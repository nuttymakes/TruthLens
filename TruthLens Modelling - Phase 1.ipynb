LOL if anyone can spot a criminal, it s Crooked Hillary The infamous Romanian hacker known as Guccifer, speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily and repeatedly breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s personal email server in early 2013. For me, it was easy easy for me, for everybody, Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker Guccifer, told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.Guccifer s potential role in the Clinton email investigation was first reported by Fox News last month. The hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with Fox News.Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar s claims.In response to Lazar s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying, There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell. In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton s server are inaccurate. It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. The former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the Top Secret level. Via: FOX News   \n",

Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, he said. And that s fine. We ve saved a lot of lives. Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico s 3.4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34. The U.S. territory s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a _CUR_72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island s debt would have to be erased. They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we re going to have to wipe that out. You re going to say goodbye to that, I don t know if it s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that, Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody s on Tuesday estimated Maria s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at _CUR_45 billion to _CUR_95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a real catastrophe like Katrina, the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800. What s happened in terms of recovery, in terms of saving lives   \n",
      "2  Romania s lower house of parliament approved on Wednesday legislation to overhaul its justice system, legislation that the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and the country s president have criticized as threatening judicial independence. Two bills, and a third which was approved on Monday, are part of a wider overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks and which thousands of magistrates oppose The European Union state, ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, joins its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the protesters. Changes approved on Wednesday include setting up a special unit to investigate criminal offences committed by judges and prosecutors. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a system dedicated to investigating them. The bills also enforce more restrictive criteria for prosecutors seeking to join anti-corruption and anti-organizedcrime prosecuting units. On Monday, lawmakers approved a bill that changes the way magistrates are supervised and amends the definition of prosecutor activity to exclude the word independent . The three bills must now be approved by the senate, with a vote expected next week. Opposition parties and President Klaus Iohannis could also challenge the bills at the Constitutional Court, but the outcome of that was unclear. The ruling Social Democrats also plan changes to the country s criminal code. In November, the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern. At the start of this year, attempts by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the country s largest street protests in decades. Romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on top-level graft. The lower house and senate speakers are both currently on trial in separate cases.   \n",
