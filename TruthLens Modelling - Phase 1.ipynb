LOL if anyone can spot a criminal, it s Crooked Hillary The infamous Romanian hacker known as Guccifer, speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily and repeatedly breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s personal email server in early 2013. For me, it was easy easy for me, for everybody, Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker Guccifer, told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.Guccifer s potential role in the Clinton email investigation was first reported by Fox News last month. The hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with Fox News.Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar s claims.In response to Lazar s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying, There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell. In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton s server are inaccurate. It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. The former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the Top Secret level. Via: FOX News   \n",

Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, he said. And that s fine. We ve saved a lot of lives. Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico s 3.4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34. The U.S. territory s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a _CUR_72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island s debt would have to be erased. They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we re going to have to wipe that out. You re going to say goodbye to that, I don t know if it s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that, Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody s on Tuesday estimated Maria s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at _CUR_45 billion to _CUR_95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a real catastrophe like Katrina, the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800. What s happened in terms of recovery, in terms of saving lives   \n",
      "2  Romania s lower house of parliament approved on Wednesday legislation to overhaul its justice system, legislation that the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and the country s president have criticized as threatening judicial independence. Two bills, and a third which was approved on Monday, are part of a wider overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks and which thousands of magistrates oppose The European Union state, ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, joins its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the protesters. Changes approved on Wednesday include setting up a special unit to investigate criminal offences committed by judges and prosecutors. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a system dedicated to investigating them. The bills also enforce more restrictive criteria for prosecutors seeking to join anti-corruption and anti-organizedcrime prosecuting units. On Monday, lawmakers approved a bill that changes the way magistrates are supervised and amends the definition of prosecutor activity to exclude the word independent . The three bills must now be approved by the senate, with a vote expected next week. Opposition parties and President Klaus Iohannis could also challenge the bills at the Constitutional Court, but the outcome of that was unclear. The ruling Social Democrats also plan changes to the country s criminal code. In November, the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern. At the start of this year, attempts by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the country s largest street protests in decades. Romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on top-level graft. The lower house and senate speakers are both currently on trial in separate cases.   \n",

Crew on board Etihad flight EY450 landed the plane at 5 a.m.  at Adelaide Airport, in the state of South Australia. The Boeing 777 passenger jet had 349 passengers on board who disembarked via emergency exits, according to online news service Adelaide Advertiser. A technical fault with a cargo hold air recirculation fan had been found, Etihad Airways told Reuters in an email. Etihad Airways apologizes for the inconvenience. The safety of our guests and crew is of paramount importance, it said. Australia s ABC News had reported that a smoke alarm had activated. Passengers would make their onward journeys via other airlines due to crew rest requirements, the airline said. Saturday s Etihad flight EY451, from Sydney to Abu Dhabi, had been canceled and passengers would be rescheduled on later Etihad services out of Sydney, the airline said. It was the second incident this year for the Etihad flight that connects Australia s biggest city with the hub of Abu Dhabi, where passengers transit for worldwide destinations. In July, four men were arrested in Sydney over an Islamist plot to attack the flight. One of the men sent his unsuspecting brother to catch the July 15 Sydney to Abu Dhabi flight carrying a bomb hidden in a meat-mincer.   \n",
      "70670  Good morning. I'll be spending a lot of today with Kim Severson, our national food correspondent, up from Atlanta to help us welcome guests to our Food for Tomorrow conference, which starts tomorrow in Pocantico Hills, N. Y. at the Stone Barns Center for Food Agriculture. It would be great if we were cooking, but we'll be in a car, talk, talk, talking, and when we need gas, we'll stop, and Kim will scout for pork rinds, because you never know: There may be a better kind than Golden Flake. I hope you'll be cooking.  If I were cooking, I'd be pleased this evening to serve Pierre Franey's great old recipe for chicken breasts with lemon alongside some plain rice and a platter of green beans with shallots. It makes for a relatively fast meal, and it should leave you time to clean up ahead of the first debate of this election season.  I'd be making plans for the rest of the week, too. I'm excited to try my hand at David Tanis's recipe for lamb steaks with Lebanese spices. I'd like to serve Florence Fabricant's recipe for broccoli rabe made . I want to make Nigella Lawson's recipe for salmon in a ginger and lemongrass broth. It's getting to the time of year when I want to eat David's recipe for pork chops with apples and cider. And who doesn't want, as fall begins to cool off our evenings a little, to settle into a dinner of Jamie Oliver's recipe for eggplant Parmesan? The Food for Tomorrow conference runs through Wednesday, so perhaps I'll get to one of those toward the end of the week. If you beat me to the punch, take a photograph of what you cook and post it to social media, where we monitor the hashtag #NYTCooking on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest. We've got a growing community of home cooks going. Let's share our work! You can find many more recipes on Cooking. Search through our collections and see if you can't find something delicious to cook. Then cook it! You can rate your results on a scale of one to five stars, and, if you have a good substitution or hack to suggest, you can post a note on the recipe. And, as always, I'll ask you to reach out to us for help if you need it. There are kind and careful people standing by at cookingcare@nytimes. com. Now, have you read this piece in our Sunday Review arguing that industrial farms are good for the environment? Discuss.   \n",

The footage was released by Facebook user Yossi Cohen on Monday. \"Today at the synagogue in Ben Gurion airport,\" he wrote under the video. They were all members of one Turkish family, according to Breaking Israeli news. They were apparently looking for a place to pray and found a synagogue which was empty. It was just before the holiday of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that marks the end of the annual cycle of public Torah readings and the beginning of a new cycle. Religious Jews do not usually travel on such days. The family used the available Jewish prayer shawls, also known as tallits, as prayer mats. Tallits are shawls traditionally worn over the clothes by religious Jews during prayers. But when the Muslim family realized that they were praying in the synagogue, they \"folded the shawls and explained that they'd just looked for a place to pray,\" a witness told NRG website. According to the Times of Israel , Ben Gurion Airport doesn't provide any facilities for believers of religions other than Judaism. Some Israelis welcomed the act of praying in the synagogue. According to Yehuda Glick, a member of the Knesset, he himself \"prayed in a mosque\" and he said he is \"happy that Muslims prayed in a synagogue.\" \"Where is the embarrassment? I couldn't find any,\" he wrote on Facebook, as cited by Arutz Sheva network. His position was supported by Rabbi David Menachem, rabbi of the Mishkan Yosef synagogue in Jerusalem. \"A group of Muslims from Turkey innocently prayed in the airport synagogue in Ben-Gurion. Innocently and in honor of God,\" he wrote on Facebook. Comment: What a refreshing reaction. Facebook commenter David Auman added : Why is there really no place for Muslims to pray ben gurion airport? At the airport in turkey. They set a place for Jews to pray.    \n",

      "61047  Canadian designer Line the Label shot to prominence on Monday after U.S. actress Meghan Markle wore a coat from the brand in her first public appearance after her engagement to Britain s Prince Harry. Markle appeared in the sunken garden at Kensington Palace on Monday in the late November chill, donning the C_CUR_799  white wrap coat with oversized collars and cinched at the waist with a knotted belt. The surge in interest in the coat caused the style to quickly sell out and crashed the Toronto-based knitwear label s website in some parts of the world, including in London. The company is taking reorders on the coat, an external spokeswoman said by email. Line has since named the coat Meghan, company President and co-founder John Muscat said in a statement, adding it was one of her favorite pieces from the fashion label. We are incredibly honored that Meghan chose to wear a Line coat to mark this very special occasion, Muscat said. We are elated for Meghan and wish her a lifetime of happiness with Prince Harry. Markle, who has a starring role in the Toronto-filmed U.S. TV show Suits, has lived in the Canadian city for several years. Markle also wore a Line coat to the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in Toronto in September, days after the pair made their first public appearance together. Celebrities including Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Garner and Kate Hudson have also been photographed wearing the brand. Line was founded in 2000 by Muscat and designer Jennifer Wells. It was acquired a few years later by Canadian fashion house and importer PYA, which is based in a north Toronto suburb.   \n",

The footage was released by Facebook user Yossi Cohen on Monday. \"Today at the synagogue in Ben Gurion airport,\" he wrote under the video. They were all members of one Turkish family, according to Breaking Israeli news. They were apparently looking for a place to pray and found a synagogue which was empty. It was just before the holiday of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that marks the end of the annual cycle of public Torah readings and the beginning of a new cycle. Religious Jews do not usually travel on such days. The family used the available Jewish prayer shawls, also known as tallits, as prayer mats. Tallits are shawls traditionally worn over the clothes by religious Jews during prayers. But when the Muslim family realized that they were praying in the synagogue, they \"folded the shawls and explained that they'd just looked for a place to pray,\" a witness told NRG website. According to the Times of Israel , Ben Gurion Airport doesn't provide any facilities for believers of religions other than Judaism. Some Israelis welcomed the act of praying in the synagogue. According to Yehuda Glick, a member of the Knesset, he himself \"prayed in a mosque\" and he said he is \"happy that Muslims prayed in a synagogue.\" \"Where is the embarrassment? I couldn't find any,\" he wrote on Facebook, as cited by Arutz Sheva network. His position was supported by Rabbi David Menachem, rabbi of the Mishkan Yosef synagogue in Jerusalem. \"A group of Muslims from Turkey innocently prayed in the airport synagogue in Ben-Gurion. Innocently and in honor of God,\" he wrote on Facebook. Comment: What a refreshing reaction. Facebook commenter David Auman added : Why is there really no place for Muslims to pray ben gurion airport? At the airport in turkey. They set a place for Jews to pray.    \n",

Mayor Rawlings-Blake says that the Baltimore rioters needed room to destroy The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied a state request for disaster aid to cover the costs associated with the rioting and unrest that broke out in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray.W. Craig Fugate, FEMA s administrator, wrote in a June 12 letter to Gov. Larry Hogan that federal disaster aid was not appropriate for such an event. Therefore, I must inform you that your request for a major disaster declaration is denied, Fugate wrote.Spokeswoman Erin Montgomery said Friday that the Hogan administration is reviewing FEMA s response and will make a determination about the appropriate next steps, including a possible appeal. A disaster declaration would allow public agencies and residents affected by the unrest to seek reimbursement for related costs.City officials have reserved _CUR_20 million to cover direct costs, including overtime for police and firefighters, damage to city-owned property and repaying other jurisdictions for police and other assistance.Howard Libit, a spokesman for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, said Friday that the city is working on an appeal. We re told we have 30 days to appeal, he said. We re working with the federal delegation and Obama administration officials to assess what we might do to become eligible for reimbursement. Henry J. Raymond, Baltimore s finance director, said in May that the city was covering the costs from its rainy-day fund but hoped for federal reimbursement of up to 75 percent of the costs.In his request for aid, Hogan had cited Baltimore s preliminary estimate that the rioting and looting in April and the five-night citywide curfew had an economic impact of _CUR_30.5 million. That included the loss of conventions, hospitality and leisure spending, and tourism from Orioles games that were closed to the public or moved to Florida. Read more: The Baltimore Sun   \n",
      "77672  Leave a reply \\nBill Still – Good morning, I'm still reporting on the Daybreak Poll. \\nDonald Trump has rocketed ahead to what the USC Daybreak poll's creators define as an unstoppable lead of 5.4% this morning. Trump now leads Clinton 47.8% to 42.4% in this national tracking poll. And remember the methodology of this poll – it is a 7-day rolling average with over 3,004 participants. \\nTrump – in a single day – jumped up 9/10s of a percent, while Clinton fell 9/10ths of a percent – a huge one-day swing of 1.8% – and that's on top of yesterday's 1.7% swing. In fact, in the last 9 days, Trump has risen 4 full points, while Clinton has lost 2.7% – a 6.7% swing. \\nBoth candidates – Trump on the topside, and Clinton on the bottom side of this chart – are now well outside of the \"95% confidence interval\". \\nAccording to the University of Southern California researchers running the ongoing Understanding America Study: \"Figures lying outside the gray band mean that we are at least 95% confident that the candidate with the highest percentage will win the popular vote.\" \\nBut in addition, the closer such a surge to election day, the more sure of that result we can be. There is now little doubt that Donald Trump will win the popular vote nationwide. \\nDigging down into the numbers shows where the biggest surge lies. Trump now leads in all 3 age categories. With millennials, Trump now leads by 2.6%. Among the middle aged, Trump now leads by a whopping 5.2%. But in the 65 and over group, Trump's lead has now widened to 9.6%. \\nWhen sorted by education, Trump enjoys a huge 18.1% lead among those with a high school education or less. A landslide is defined as a 10-point lead. \\nAmong those with some college, Trump leads by 12.3%. \\nEven among those with advanced degrees, Trump is closing the once-huge gap. Clinton still leads here in this demographically small group by 13.1%. \\nWhen sorted by income, Clinton still leads among those making _CUR_35k or less by 17.8%. \\nHowever, among the middle class – those with household incomes of between _CUR_35k and 75k, Trump leads by 15.9%. \\nAmong those making _CUR_75k or more, Trump leads by 11.4%. When sorted by ethnicity, Trump's lead among whites continues to increase, now at 25.9%. \\nThis poll's one blind spot continues to be among blacks. Although Trump made a .9% gain yesterday, Clinton still dominates with an 82.1% lead. \\nIn the \"other ethnicity\" group, Trump now leads by 9.2%. \\nAmong Latinos, Clinton still leads by 18.2%, however, Trump did increase by .6% points yesterday, while Clinton fell by .9 percent; a one-and-a-half percent swing. Among the ever-critical female vote, Trump closed the gap yesterday by 1.5%. Clinton's lead has been cut to 8.5%. \\nAmong men, Trump increased his lead yesterday by a full 2 percentage points. He now leads Crooked Hillary by 19.8% among men – more than double Clinton's lead with women. \\nI'm still reporting from Washington. Good Day. SF Source Bill Still Nov. 2016 Share this:   \n",
