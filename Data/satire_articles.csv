Dickhead Boss Wants To Hit The Ground Running In 2025,"A COMPLETE visual replica of a gaping arsehole, local boss Jamie McCartlin, has informed staff on their first day back in 2025 that he wants to hit the ground running this year. In a circular email sent to staff that immediately led to rolling of eyes seen by WWN, McCartlin spoke of wanting ‘100%’ from staff, pointing to a less than stellar last quarter and how ‘some people around here won’t get away with coasting for another year’. “Not only is it the bastarding 2nd of January, it’s a Thursday. Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,” groused employee Cormac D’Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. “My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road. So even if I wanted to hit, slam, bate the ground in 2025 it’ll have to wait,” offered Carmel Tullan, who didn’t make it past the first sentence in her boss’ email which began ‘New Year, New Focused Workforce’. For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. “This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I’m saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,” McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through. “I won’t sugarcoat it, I need soldiers, people who eat, sleep and breathe this job. ,” concluded McCartlin, who neglected to mentioned he was offing on a two week skiing trip to Austria at the end of the month.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",business,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/dickhead-boss-wants-to-hit-the-ground-running-in-2025/
Organised Local Woman Straight Onto Revenue Portal To Get That €4.25 Tax Back She’s Owed,"HAVING CALCULATED the projected tax relief she is entitled to under the Remote Working Relief on electricity and broadband bills at the start of December, local woman Orna Stewart is primed and ready to file her 2024 tax return. With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers. “People have no idea how much they’re entitled to, just leaving money there on the table but not me, no way Jose, that €4.25 is mine!” Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. “But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,” Stewart’s husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn’t entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour’s long lecture on honesty and ethics. “Here she is, right on queue,” said the automated system in receipt of Stewarts tax declaration, making her the first person in the country to submit her declaration for the 5th year running.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 3, 2025",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/03/organised-local-woman-straight-onto-revenue-portal-to-get-that-e4-25-tax-back-shes-owed/
“Eight Additional Data Centres Needed To Store Pictures Of Irish Snow” Energy Watchdog Warns,"THE COMMISSION FOR Regulation of Utilities in Ireland has called on the public to refrain from taking yet more photos of the snow as server capacities reach breaking point. “Data centres already consume a huge amount of our electricity, but Meta will need to break ground on another eight data centres if you keep uploading those photos of your snowman with a carrot for a dick,” cautioned the energy watchdog. Usually limiting itself to providing a free complaint resolution service, the CRU has felt the need to speak out before the energy grid buckles under the weight of picturesque landscape photos accompanied by the word ‘sneactha’. “We all know what snow fucking looks like lads, you’ve already taken 150 pictures of it, that’s enough. And anyway, they’re likely out of focus and partially covered by your fat fingers. The world will survive without your visual documentation of it all,” a CRU spokesperson added, as the light caught their face just right amid a background of beautiful cascading snow which acted as cotton wool blanket pulled over the nearby hills. “You better not be taking a fucking picture of me,” insisted the spokesperson, as this reporter’s iPhone camera’s flash went off brighter than a Chinese New Year fireworks display. UPDATE: The CRU also urged the public to be mindful of the carbon footprint created by taking 400 photos of your pets every hour, and the impact of giving a thumb’s up emoji to every single WhatsApp message you receive.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/eight-additional-data-centres-needed-to-store-pictures-of-irish-snow-energy-watchdog-warns/
Colin Farrell Asks If Three Golden Globes Are Redeemable For One Oscar,"EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. “Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?” Farrell asked over the phone, the audience’s applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. “There’s no way Meryl hasn’t exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don’t be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn’t exactly a stretch for me, just saying,” one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. “Enough time has passed, it’s okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in ‘Milk’? Over me in ‘In Bruges’, give over,” continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell’s angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. “Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I’m guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?” one industry insider offered.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",entertainment,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/colin-farrell-asks-if-three-golden-globes-are-redeemable-for-one-oscar/
Remote Workers Wouldn’t Have Agreed To Work From Home If They Knew It Meant Zero Snow Days Off,"“I FEEL TRICKED” confirmed Carmel Foley, one of hundreds of thousands of workers granted the ability to work from home several days a week in recent years, as she stared mournfully out at heavy snow she couldn’t use as an excuse for a handy day off. “You can’t begin to understand how sneaky and satisfying it felt back with the big snow in 2018 when I told the office the roads to the were impassable due to snow. Back then I didn’t have a home work set up,” added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement. Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a ‘snow day’ due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day’s work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building. “That’s a ‘The Chase’ repeat marathon in my boxers off the fucking cards,” griped one worker who has actually had several of those days recently over the Christmas but still feels like they’re missing out. “A snow day off from work is one of those sacred if rare rights of passage all office workers should be entitled to, like when you get a day off ‘cus someone in the warehouse loses an arm or the under the table hush payment when the boss can’t keep his arms to himself,” complained workers rights’ advocate Tony Dallon. Asked why remote workers didn’t just lie and say they had no electricity, workers responded in unison stating that every office has some ‘busybody prick’ who would actually check that with the ESB networks and rat on them.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",business,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/remote-workers-wouldnt-have-agreed-to-work-from-home-if-they-knew-it-meant-zero-snow-days-off/
“I’m Too Old And Rich To Be Righteous Anymore” – Bono,"IRISH singer-songwriter and former activist Bono clasped his hands and prayed to whatever God he worships these days while receiving the US Presidential Medal of Freedom from outgoing president and Zionist Joe Biden, admitting that yes, he’s too old and rich to be righteous anymore. Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their ‘meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace’. “Look, we’ll forget about that last part there and just say it’s for the first two,” Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. “We’ll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we’re finished. The seaside property there is to die for”. Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. “There comes a time in an activists’ life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,” Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. “I know people back home will not be happy, but they’re just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh”. Meanwhile, Michael J Fox, Denzel Washington, ‘Magic’ Johnson, Ralph Lauren and several others were just glad they were actual American citizens and thus avoided such criticism from people calling for an end to the Palestinian genocide.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",entertainment,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/im-too-old-and-rich-to-be-righteous-anymore-bono/
Irish Couples Under Increasing Pressure To Have ‘Mini-moon’,"A NEW SURVEY of Irish couples reveals that many feel crushing pressure to go on a ‘mini-moon’ despite ‘stupid fucking mini-moons’ only coming to prominence in recent years. “I’d never heard of it before but now all because she saw randomer who is dead good at putting make up on herself on Instagram had one, herself is off down the Credit Union,” explained oblivious groom to be Daniel Dennan. A toxic mix of notions, societal pressure and following influencers who get all this stuff for free, has, according to the recent survey led to 92% of couples planning a wedding or newly married convincing themselves they might not be allowed stay married under the eyes of the law unless they go on a romantic mini-honeymoon. “Suddenly, one day out of nowhere it becomes an accepted and demanded practice in society. Notions on crystal meth. Kind of like when everyone was perfectly happy carrying water around in a plastic bottle but now everyone has been convinced you need a hardy metal container that is so oversized it can store the contents of an Olympic sized-swimming pool in it, baffles the mind but here we are,” explained g’way-out-of-that expert Shona Ward. “A fucking mini-moon? No, you idiot, that’s what the honeymoon is for. That’s the holiday. You don’t have to have a little holiday so Paris doesn’t get jealous of your two weeks in the Caribbean. Are you mad?

5 Realistic New Year’s Resolutions,"EVERY YEAR thousands of Irish people set themselves unrealistic goals as so-called NEw Year’s resolutions and fail miserably when it comes to achieving anything. Why set the bar at an unobtainable level when there are some real everyday improvements to be made and very achievable targets. Check out these realistic New Year’s resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don’t count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of ‘getting dressed every day’. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don’t set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don’t even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 1, 2025",entertainment,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/01/5-realistic-new-years-resolutions/
Seeing ‘Elder Millennials’ In News Headlines Like A Stab In The Heart,"MILLENNIALS have urged the media to choose their words more carefully after reports dozens of people born between in the 80s and 90s have suffered cataclysmic emotional breakdowns at seeing ‘elder millennials’ in headlines. “You can’t be elder anything if you are still part the fresh young generation that’s just emerged and is defining culture. Fashion, music, art, film, we’re the zeitgeist,” falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. “If you even so much as try and say ‘oh, I wasn’t born then so it was before my time’ to me, I’ll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn’t ‘classic TV’,” sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words ‘elder millennials’ often precede headlines such as ‘still have f-all hope of affording a house’. “Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We’re the tech generation,” offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window. UPDATE: An emergency team of therapists have been deployed to millennials after a meme stating ‘we’re as close to the year 2000 as people were in 1975’ began doing the rounds.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 30, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/30/seeing-elder-millennials-in-news-headlines-like-a-stab-in-the-heart/
Nation’s Traffic At Standstill As Post-Christmas Re-turn Machine Queues Clog Roads,"TAILBACKS of 10 miles have been reported in some areas in Ireland today as people attempt to dispense with their post-Christmas cans of beer, in the first Christmas since the Re-turn recycling scheme was introduced. “Authorities should have seen this coming, we should have quadrupled the number of machines,” said one man from his car which he has been trapped in for 17 hours just outside the car park to his local Lidl such is the traffic. With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren’t out of order, the country’s main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey. “I didn’t think it through when I got in the eight slabs for the Christmas, I usually have a mental breakdown when I do the post-Christmas dump run but I guess I’ll just have it now,” added one individual towing a trailer full of his haul of Christmas cans which included some from the days they had the in-laws and neighbours over. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. “I’m missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTÉ,” said one driver, unaware the car they’ve been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago. UPDATE: Supermarkets with Re-turn machines are now providing hose down showers for drivers stuck in their cars for hours on end who now stink of stale alcohol emanating from their boots and back seats.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 26, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/26/nations-traffic-at-standstill-as-post-christmas-re-turn-machine-queues-clog-roads/
Christmas Miracle? Fine Gael & Fianna Fáil Put Aside Differences To Play Football In Leinster House Trenches,"JUST AS PEOPLE feared the venomous quarreling between two diametrically opposed forces would spill over into violence once again, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have laid down their finger-pointing arms and played a festive game of football. “Wow, ’tis the season of peace on earth and good will to all men, so it is,” said one shoe polisher outside Leinster House, who threw his flat cap skyward in exultation before jumping and clicking his heels. The tear-jerking intrusion of man’s basic humanity, the likes of which has not seen since the first World War, into the maddening mire of murderous political negotiation had seemed virtually impossible in recent weeks such was the near constant agreement the two sides have been locked in. “I’ve seen it all now, it wasn’t two days ago I heard some of them agreeing on absolutely everything, declining to even speak out loud due to their telepathic understanding of each other and now look at them, putting aside their zero differences to play a bit of ball, warms the heart. There’s a lesson in their for all of us” added another onlooker, filled with the Christmas spirit.

Local Woman Can’t Believe How Many Bullshit Made Up Christmas Traditions In-Laws Have,"THE PERSONABLE and polite exterior belonging to local woman Ciara Kinnane is at risk of shattering if she has to endure one more bullshit Christmas tradition observed by the her other half’s family, the Mortons. “Silly Sockless time, Silly Sockless time, who’s going to win the last Roses chocolate,” screeched Morton matriarch and mother-in-law to Kinanne, Carmel as the family inexplicably whipped off their socks and ran out the front door. “D’you not play this before? I definitely told you about this one Ciara,” Kinnane’s partner Jack said, outlining how one member of the family who can survive out on the concrete drive way in front of the house in their bare feet the longest wins a solitary chocolate. “But it’s mild enough like and you’re all adults. You can buy an infinite amount of chocolate for yourselves. In fact you just told me you vomited a little in your mouth there ‘cos you’re too full of chocolate,” a so-fucking-done-with-this Kinnane said. At first glance, Kinnane could be labeled a Grinch of the highest order, but experts in spending festive period with the in-laws have pleaded for understanding. “She’s had to sit through something called ‘Oopsy Daisy Gift’ where you buy someone a gift you know they’ll hate, and there’s still the Christmas Eve watching of the Michael Keaton Batman movies ‘as is tradition’ to come, and the mulled wine and pineapple soup. These family-specific traditions are a penance,” explained one Christmasologist, who wouldn’t blame Kinnane if she started walking back home to Cork from Dublin now. Expertly spotting that Kinnane was receding into herself slightly, her other half tried to cheer her up. “You a bit tired or something? Don’t worry, you’ll be having great craic once we start playing mistletoe toe, remember? Where we pass the parcel with mistletoe and if it’s in your hand when the music stops, you have kiss someone’s toe” Jack told Kinnane, who can’t believe she’s three more days of this foot obsessed family.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 22, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/22/local-woman-cant-believe-how-many-bullshit-made-up-christmas-traditions-in-laws-have/
“How Come You & Your Dad Support Different Teams?” Innocently Asks Girlfriend About To Receive Crash Course In Chelsea’s Early 2000s Transformation,"UNAWARE she has set herself on a path towards receiving a dense-packed hours long lecture about early 2000s Premier League football, Emily O’Sullivan has queried why her boyfriend Sean Hughton supports a different team to his father. “And you see Damien Duff is Irish and he played the same position as me, and they were drowning in money. And Jose was cool back then, not the cringe magnet he is now, but even before him Ranieri was like sound and Ferguson and his little parade of pricks were arrogant as anything,” launched Hughton, not drawing breath as O’Sullivan identified her nearest emergency exits. Putting himself back on the defensive slightly 32-year-old Hughton made sure to mention how before his time mid-90s Chelsea were a joyously sophisticated blend of brawn and skill, counting Zola and Wise among their ranks, thus proving the ‘we’ve got no history’ chant is deeply ironic before having to explain the chant’s origins what O’Sullivan said “what’s a chant?”. “And sure dad would try and wedge me into a United shirt but I didn’t want to be like the other lad in school who were all United fans. You following this?” continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn’t seem to have desired effect on O’Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely. “Do you want to see my Premier League sticker book?” beamed Hughton, rummaging through a shoe box in his wardrobe.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 20, 2024",sports,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/20/how-come-you-your-dad-support-different-teams-innocently-asks-girlfriend-about-to-receive-crash-course-in-chelseas-early-2000s-transformation/
Investigation Launched To Discover Why Sofas No Longer Come With Arm Rest Covers,"IRISH homeowners are subject of a wide-ranging furniture study, believed to be the biggest of its kind, which is seeking to understand when the practice of having arm rest covers on sofas came to an end. “You couldn’t move from arm rest covers, couches had them, the ‘dad chair’ had them, the good room was just one big arm rest. Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?” professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O’Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. “Some suggest it’s a ‘notions’ thing but isn’t removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says ‘my sofa is precious’, it tells visitors ‘I don’t want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,” added O’Neill, who believes there’s a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn’t count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers. “Some studies are utterly pointless but am glad someone is finally doing something of value,” said one study participant Patricia Clarke, who is just thankful matching patterned curtains and carpets never went out of fashion.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 19, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/19/investigation-launched-to-discover-why-sofas-no-longer-come-with-arm-rest-covers/
Tesco Expand Self-Service Checkout To Include Customers Stacking Shelves & Processing Deliveries,"EYING a new streamlined and improved customer service experience, Tesco has announced it is expanding its self-service offerings beyond self-scan and checkout services from next week. “Customer surveys indicate they want more freedom to go about their shopping unencumbered by inconveniences in the traditional retail processes such as staff,” explained Tesco’s head of increasing dividends Tony Smith. The new changes will see customers allowed access to loading bays where they can free produce they want to buy from crates and pallets, moving them to their shop floor location at dedicated signposted spaces on shelves in various aisles. “From here, customers can then take a number of those items, scan them, pay for the items, pack them in bags and leave,” added Smith. The initiatives are set to increase customer interaction with faceless interfaces by 350%, reducing the need for surplus staff. “And we understand not all customers live in the most conveniently located areas in relation to their local branch. In fact, some might live closer to distribution centres and in those cases we’ve heard what customers have said and we give in; you can pick up large shipments of stock from there and drive them directly to our stores,” chimed head of staff headcount recalibration Craig Stafford. “Our only thought here is the customer, it’s all customer led initiatives and ideas,” he added, handing some pricing guns to a stressed out mother-of-three who just wanted to know where the milk aisle was.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 19, 2024",business,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/19/tesco-expand-self-service-checkout-to-include-customer-stacking-shelves-processing-deliveries/
Fears RIP.ie Death Notice Charge May Turn Irish Funerals Into A Money Racket,"IN A FIRST for the funeral industry in Ireland, many stakeholders are now suggesting vulnerable families processing the loss of a loved one could be preyed upon and have their grief exploited in the name of profit by bad faith actors. This fear comes with the news that the RIP.ie website, purchased this year by The Irish Times, will begin charging a €100 fee for death notices. “RIP.ie would want to cop on, that’s fierce bad,” said one funeral director who knows just the phrase to use to steer grieving families away from all the cheapest available elements of a funeral package. “And that phrase is ‘if you really loved them you’d go for our deluxe premium gold mourning package'” they added. In retaliation to the new charge, Irish people around the country are gathering in protest and have confirmed they will boycott dying until RIP.ie reverse their decision. “That’s awful so it is,” offered a priest who can paid upwards of €150 for doing the thing he’s supposedly driven to do as a calling as he is not motivated by money.  Florists, printers, musicians, car leasers, hotels, restaurants and bars among others have all condemned RIP.ie’s decision to take a look grieving families and think ‘they could be paying more’. “As a firm that charges by the individual tissue handed out to grieving widows, we know an insensitive price gouge when we see one,” offered one dissenting funeral director who would now have to regretfully up the fee they already charged for placing an RIP notice.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/fears-rip-ie-death-notice-charge-may-turn-irish-funerals-into-a-money-racket/

Martina Burke’s suspicions have all but been confirmed after Enoch bricked up an escape tunnel his mother built into prison which was concealed behind a poster of Rita Hayworth.  “Ah look, Christmas can be a stressful time if you have batty relatives, I’ve often considered doing a short stretch too just to get a break from my lot.

Others backing calls to ‘give it a rest Christ almighty, we get it’ were almost certain one of the core tenets of Jesus’ teachings included ‘look the other way for a bit if you’ve plans and don’t want them interrupted by killjoy stuff like actual killings’. “Sure what can I do about it?

Murphy, known to some for believing 3-year-old refugees would need de-programming because they’re probably in ISIS, and having the Workplace Relations Committee finding she had penalised an office worker in her 60s who had raised allegations of bullying against her during her time as head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, is set to net the €255k position due to her sterling CV which now reads ‘make me Ceann Comhairle if you want independents’ support’. “All that may be true but let’s focus instead on the fact she will be the first ever female Ceann Comhairle,” countered Verona Murphy. For their part Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael defended their actions. “If this sort of move is anything to go by, I have a feeling the next five years could be Irish politics finest every period,” confirmed Micheál Martin, drooling as he stared at the Taoiseach’s office. “She wasn’t good enough for Fine Gael when she left and we found her conduct unbecoming but I’d rather nail my sack to a high speed Japanese train than develop some principles and a moral compass, power at any cost baby,” confirmed Taoiseach-for-now Simon Harris.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",politics,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/fresh-hope-irish-politics-changing-for-better-with-ff-fg-supporting-td-who-thinks-3-year-old-immigrants-are-in-isis-for-ceann-comhairle/
On This Day 1981: Ireland’s First Swingers Discuss Having No One To Ride,"IRELAND’S first ever controversial ‘swingers’ have asked for at least one other couple to develop a perverse and sickening interest in extra-marital mickey swapping, Waterford Whispers News reports with much regret. “I’m not sure we technically qualify as swingers as we haven’t found anyone to swing with,” a rueful Cathy Dolan told this publication, discussing the desire she and her husband Brian have to broaden their hobbies to foreign-to-their-wedding-vows fornication. “I think if someone was brave enough to consider becoming Ireland’s second swinging couple, we’d have a jolly time, it’s quite lonely at the minute, one set of keys in the bowl,” explained Brian Dolan, a sullen figure striped down to his birthday suit with no one other than his wife to blow out his candle. “Brian tries to hide his disappointment when he pulls his own keys out of the bowl at our parties, but I see it in his eyes,” a sad Cathy added. Aside from putting an advert down an alley way in the form of a ‘for a good time call’ scrawl on a wall in graffiti, the couple are at a loss as how to find a like-minded couple. “We got close once with a couple from Limerick but I think they misunderstood the keys in a bowl thing and drove off with Brian’s VW,” Cathy explained. “We’re penpals with a couple in Germany, they do more swinging than monkeys on a vine over there, you can’t fathom the embarrassment each new postcard we send brings; a swinger who hasn’t swung,” sobbed Brian.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",entertainment,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/on-this-day-1981-irelands-first-swingers-discuss-having-no-one-to-ride/
What Irish People Are Saying About Israel Closing Its Embassy In Ireland,"NEWS WHICH has been extensively reported around the world and hotly debated online, but just what do the Irish public make of the Israeli government’s decision to close their embassy here in Ireland? WWN has taken to the streets to find out: “Since the embassy will be going spare, we can probably let Palestinian refugees move in?” – Deirdre, Cork. “I might be overdue an eye test but why does Netanyahu suddenly closely resemble a jockey’s bollocks?” – Carmel, Wexford. “I get it, when I’m annoyed at people I feel aren’t treating me well I punish them by punching myself in the face too” – Cormac, Wicklow. “I’m an Irish-American on Twitter with 12 followers that absolutely isn’t a bot account and I can confidently say I speak for all Irish people when I say antisemitism is taught from birth in Ireland. It’s whispered in the ears of newborns by midwives and Irish people are given a free potato every time they say ‘Israel is bad'” – SonOfAira1816. “That’s very Main Character Energy of Israel, we’re actually too busy protesting against and intimidating refugees in Ireland to be bothered being mean to their embassy” – Fergal, Westmeath. “Things have gotten so bad Israel has got me supporting Simon Harris, thanks a lot Netanyahu!” – Mairead, Dublin. “Sorry, I can’t talk I’m off to return one of my 40 copies of Mein Kampf to the library” Ian, Waterford. “I can’t help but feel this is partly my fault, if only I’d celebrated the murder of Palestinians, sent a congratulations card every time a child was executed by sniper fire then the ambassador would have felt more welcome” – Shay, Kerry. “Rent in Dublin is a pox, I know the feeling too pal, I left a long time ago” – Ciara, Glasgow. “Antisemitism is a very real and hateful form discrimination which needs to be stamped out, but that’s probably not helped by the Israeli government calling Irish people antisemitic for objecting to mass murder” – Laura, Galway.  “Is this the first time the Israeli government has actually given up property?” – Kevin, Cavan.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 17, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/17/what-irish-people-are-saying-about-israel-closing-its-embassy-in-ireland/
4-Year-Old Pours Glass Of Ribena After Another Exhausting Day,"“I’M THAT up to my eyes with the stress, I’ll have it neat,” stone-faced 4-year-old Jack McKinty barked at his Mam, Una McKinty, after what must rank as the most stressful day in little Jack’s life thus far. A particularly taxing bout of chasing during little break, coupled with exhaustive number rhymes and an argument over what the best dinosaur is, McKinty entered the second half of his day more tired than usual, with his desire to ‘put today to bed’ manifesting itself in a 6pm request for an unprecedented second glass of Ribena. “My friends don’t understanded me, hide and seek is better than just chasing. Mrs Horan doesn’t understanded me, maths is wojus altogether, we should do painting but Ribena, Ribena gets me,” said Jack staring into the middle distance, inhaling sharply as the 2024 vintage blackcurrant juice burned a little in his throat. Jack’s stress levels weren’t helped by the fact his two older siblings were ‘acting the complete pricks’ when they returned from school, insisting on switching off Bluey in favour of playing their computer games. “Okay honey, just this once but we can’t make having two glasses of Ribena a habit okay? It’s not good for your toothy woothies and it’s full of E numbers,” Una told her child, who couldn’t hear her as his senses were momentarily dulled by the sugary blackcurrant squash coursing around his body. “This world is chewing me up and spitting me out just fine without you being on my case too Una, just one day, that’s all I’m asking, one fucking day you can just leave me to enjoy the small things in life without a lecture,” said Jack grabbing the bottle of raw unfiltered Ribena and storming off to bed.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/4-year-old-pours-glass-of-ribena-after-another-exhausting-day/
McEntee Reassures Public Dublin City Safe Between The Times Of 10.23am-10.27am Every Second Tuesday,"FOLLOWING a fresh assault in the capital city, this time on two off duty gardaí Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has confirmed the city is definitely safe during a narrow but precise window of time. “As I have previously stated on the 239 other occasions I have been forced to put out similarly phrased words of comfort in the wake of violence in the city; this is an isolated incident and Dublin is safe… during 10.23am and 10.27am every second Tuesday-ish,” explained the Minister. With no empirical research and reason to back up why this particular 4-minute window is a blissfully peaceful time on the streets has emerged, the public have been urged not to complain but rather except this as the good news it is. “I looked it up, it’s not when methadone is doled out, it’s not when Conor McGregor is training in the gym or the Monk is off on a jolly in an early house, we can’t pin down the reason but let’s not question it Dubliners just enjoy it,” confirmed one Dept of Justice spokesperson. The news has seen an increase in city dwellers maximising the time, getting all errands and highly dangerous activities such as ‘existing’ out of the way in the golden 4-minutes. “Nah, you’re alright,” responded the Minister when asked if she planned another walk through the city centre flanked by gardaí and the media.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/mcentee-reassures-public-dublin-city-safe-between-the-times-of-10-23am-10-27am-every-second-tuesday/
"Former Fine Gael Politician Charged With Human Trafficking & Possessing Sex Abuse Images, Some Media Half-Heartedly Reports","WITH FORMER Fine Gael councillor Bill Tormey accused of possessing child pornography images and helping to bring an illegal immigrant into the country, some media outlets have reacted with somewhere between 2 and 3% of the breathless coverage they normally reserve for such a bombshell news item. “There is a case before the courts, this curtails what we can report but also I’m devastated this wasn’t a Sinn Féin rep, ‘cus it’s now basically a non-story worthy of little to no further reporting” confirmed one journalist, whose desire for fishing out crass details and doorstepping politicians is unusually absent. Layout designers and editors who may have been required to work late on 32-page special pullout supplements on such an Earth-shattering story have been stood down, as have producers of emergency podcasts, as it now transpires this isn’t a big story in the public interest. “I may have demanded Sinn Féin answer all and any questions relating to the case of their once-staff member being a sex offender, but it would be downright tawdry journalism to ask Fine Gael to answer for an individual and their alleged actions. A trial much take place. And when that is over and if he’s found guilty, I will say ‘justice has spoken, there is no more to say’ and move on,” one reactionary columnist confirmed. “No, there’s a clear difference; in the case of Sinn Féin you can extrapolate out an issue and ask, speculate and confirm it’s proof of deficiencies and anti-democratic values which are unique to the party but if such alleged crimes relate to a Fine Gael member, that’s mere coincidence and it would be churlish and unethical to draw conclusions about the party itself,” confirmed another columnist readying a ‘Expect The Opposition To Play Political With An Incredibly Sensitive Issue’ article.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/former-fine-gael-politician-charged-with-human-trafficking-possessing-sex-abuse-images-some-media-half-heartedly-reports/
Thousands Of Psychologists Descend On Manchester City To Observe & Study Guardiola’s Meltdown,"MANCHESTER hotels and Air Bnbs are at full capacity as the world’s leading psychologists have descended on the city in the hope of getting to observe, in person, Pep Guardiola’s post and pre-match press conference in which he slowly unravels. “Truly fascinating, it’s like if Einstein suddenly not only forgot the basic tenets of physics but was struggling to count to ten,” remarked one psychologist on Man City’s current complete lack of form. With City’s resolve and spine currently wilting like a ice cream cone on the surface of the sun, Guardiola’s response to continued adversity is the sort material that could fill a thousands PHD studies. “I’ve seen men who walked in their wives having sex with all four of their brothers at once cope better than this guy,” said a psychologist fascinated by the former Barcelona man’s soul-baring stream of consciousness press interviews. “Look the January transfer window is coming up, City will be looking to make new additions, we’re just hoping to be one of the 40 new additions required,” confirmed a group of therapists hoping to join the coaching Pep down on the ledge of his own manic monologues team.

"Country That Stole Irish Passports For Use In Assassinations, Attacked Irish Peacekeepers Closes Embassy In Ireland Over Country’s Opposition To Genocide","SOMETIMES, brutal regimes with little regard for human rights go too far. This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. “Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,” confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland’s decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. “Take that Ireland!” announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they’ve been punished. “What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?” offered an upset Netanyahu. The Israeli leader was unable to answer any further questions as he was called away to authorise more missile strikes on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran.

Conor McGregor Wins ‘Brought Most Shame To Ireland’ At RTÉ Sports Awards,"RTÉ’S biggest night in sport saw Paul O’Donovan walk away with the coveted ‘Sportsperson of the Year award’ for his Olympic and World Rowing Championships heroics. However, it wasn’t the only award handed out on the night with Conor McGregor having the great dishonour of picking up the ‘Brought Most Shame To Ireland’ award.  An unprecedented 5th win in a row in the category, McGregor faced his toughest competition for the award this year with late surges from ‘Unnamed Armagh GAA player questioned over rape’, Denis Coulson, who is was given 14 years in a French prison for his part in a gang rape of a woman and Chris Farrell who must wear an electronic monitor for two years after being found guilty for failure to prevent a crime. “I think it’s unfair on Conor, I voted for Catriona Carey myself, no one worked harder to ruin their sporting legacy in my opinion, maybe next year we can have a family category so the Careys get their due,” confirmed one voter for the awards. All in all it was a strong showing for the rugby fraternity with ex-international Brendan Mullin serving a three year sentence for stealing €570,000 from Bank of Ireland.

‘Super Low Key’ Girls Xmas Meet Up Somehow Costs €427,"AN ANNUAL Xmas get together over a ‘super low key’ lunch among a group of friends is dangerously spiralling into a ‘massive ball ache’ thanks to the pricey organising habits and notions addiction of one Marie McGrath (32). “I’ve Christmas with two kids to be paying for, Shauna and Michelle are saving for houses, how in the name of the baby Jesus is this costing this much?” said Patricia Farley, in a separate WhatsApp group set up to bitch about McGrath. Running for over the past 7 years and always taking place over a brief lunch in Dublin during a workday given everyone’s busy schedules over the Christmas, Type A McGrath has successfully strong-armed the group into buckling to her demands and a two-night stay in Galway. “Galway doesn’t really suit me,” remarked Niamh Sullivan, the only one of the girls still living In Waterford, whose concerns were directly addressed by McGrath in the form of sending a link to €90 elf costumes everyone is now required to wear. A secret Santa with a budget of €150, a €60 bottomless brunch with a non-refundable deposit and staying in a 4-star hotel with a spa they won’t have time to use are among the many concerns the group have. “Don’t be silly, what are we? Penniless students,” McGrath responded to a suggestion to book a cheap hostel while omitting the fact the cost of the ‘lunch’ has now topped €658 excluding any money spent while in Galway. “They have a special offer on in the hotel where if you book the luxury suites they give you a festive cocktail for €20 extra but still – makes sense to make a fuss so it’s not just a boring get together, oh and then have that fake snow that gives you pink eye if it gets within 2 feet of your face,” enthused McGrath, who will have to be deposed from her organising role in a bloody coup.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 13, 2024",lifestyle,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/13/super-low-key-girls-xmas-meet-up-somehow-costs-e427/
Pep Guardiola Calls Shamrock Rovers For Tips On Winning In Europe,"“THIS GAME has given me a lot so I don’t mind giving back, and I’ll help an any aspiring coach I can,” confirmed Stephen Bradley, who showed just how gracious and humble he is by taking a phone call from a struggling coach based in Manchester late yesterday evening. With his Shamrock Rovers side enjoying a 5-game unbeaten run in Europe, Bradley is the man Pep Guardiola has turned to for advice on how to crack continental competitions as his Manchester City side remain on the verge of Champions League elimination after a 2-0 loss to Juventus. “Ah no look, he was glum enough this lad Pep, but I told him football is a simple game just get it to  Kenny up top and the rest will take care of itself,” added Bradley after Rovers beat Bosnian champions Borac 3-0 last night in Tallaght. Bradley aware of the fact words from a high-level coach such as himself could have a big effect on an impressionable young coach like Guardiola, the Dubliner declined to point out the Manchester based man wsas using outdated ‘dinosaur tactics’ from 2019. Keeping him on the phone for close to 4 hours, Guardiola sought advice in other areas including what to do if your team is found to have broken spending rules 115 times and may be relegated to 47th tier of English football. “Jesus if you had asked me about boardroom squabbles I’d have a book for you on that, but can’t help you there pal,” explained Bradley, who declined to take struggling defender Kyle Walker off the Spaniard’s hands.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 13, 2024",sports,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/13/pep-guardiola-calls-shamrock-rovers-for-tips-on-winning-in-europe/
"Everyone Advised To Ignore Report Saying House Prices Overvalued By 10%, Everything Is Fine","AN ERSI report warned householders currently paying an average 33% of their net income on their mortgages are vulnerable to a ‘painful correction’ on house prices which are overvalued by as much as 10%. “Only 10%?” said the Irish public staring at Daft.ie listings for ‘half collapsed shed in active war zone, D15’ valued at €550,000 which beg to differ. Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. “You’ll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it. NOW,” whispered the mangled demon soul of Ireland directly into the ears’ of first time buyers. “Sadly, they’re not elevated enough. I was barely able to leverage my home to buy an apartment in Dublin to rent at extortionate levels; it’s the Irish dream,” shared one man, who thinks it’s a disgrace his kids can’t afford a house. Meanwhile, the outgoing Minister for Housing has confirmed having combed through the report its content are clearly a hyperbolic fantasy and that everything is indeed fine.  “Oh I haven’t read a word. But from my understanding we can counteract further price inflation by doing things that increase prices like more subsidies for builders, tax breaks for landlords, increasing the help to buy scheme and upping the rent credit payment,” explained Darragh O’Brien, who admitted government formation talks were on the verge of collapse as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fight over who gets responsibility for increasing homeless figures.

Man Greets ‘Suitable For 8 People’ Label On Food Like A Challenge,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man has admitted for the first that for much of his life he has treated the guidelines listed by producers of food as a challenge, and has successfully beaten the ‘pathetic’ gauntlets they have clearly laid down for him. “‘Serves eight’? Never heard such nonsense in my life,” confirmed Niall Tulley, collecting the flakey crumbs on his chest, the only remnants of his 16 pack of sausage rolls. “It’s the arrogance that gets me to be honest, ‘suggested serving size – one slice’, you don’t think I can do it? Eat the whole cake? I’ll show you,” added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a ‘call out’ and a ‘questioning of my stomach storage facilities’, Tulley’s nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. “You can’t put ‘serves 8’ on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,” explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. “Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor”. Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include ‘listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you’ve nothing to prove’ and ‘but won’t you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?’",Waterford Whispers News,"December 12, 2024",lifestyle,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/12/man-greets-suitable-for-8-people-label-on-food-like-a-challenge/
Saudi Arabia Begins Plotting Workers’ Mass Grave For World Cup 2034,"DELIVERING for the good of the game once again, FIFA have announced that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, winning a bidding processing in which they were the only applicants. “Saudi Arabia had an amazing bid, but more than anything we were impressed by the $1bn they invested in DAZN which then DAZN announced a $1bn deal for the broadcast rights to the new FIFA Club World Cup,” said FIFA official Bribe McBribery. Celebrations among the Saudi delegation had to remain short and swift as attention turned to what to do with the bodies of all the dead migrant labourers who will suffer human rights abuses and die of exhaustion building the 2034 stadiums. “We don’t want the mass grave near any of the tourist stuff, obviously” offered one meek member of Mohammed Bin Salman’s delegation during a human rights abuses storming session. “Call me crazy, well don’t ‘cus I’ll have you killed, but would it be the perfect mix of dastardly and practical to just leave a big hole at pitch level and just pop all the bodies in there, then lay the over them?” queried Mohammed Bin Salman. “If I may, I don’t know why we’re fretting over this, we could dump them in a big pile in front of an official FIFA fan zone, if Qatar’s proven anything it’s that no one cares,” offered one McBribery.

Revenue Raise Concerns As Some GAA County Board Accounts Written In Marker On Hurl Grip Tape,"WITH MAYO and Galway GAA not in a position to sign off on their accounts and seeking GAA HQ intervention as Revenue belatedly discovered the organisation’s existence, it has been claimed that some county boards’ monitoring of accounts was limited to scribbling expense claims down on discarded hurl grip tape. “They may be an amateur organisation but we’re one step shy of doing calculations using an abacus made of character references,” confirmed one tax expert. “Ah, accounting is like GAA rule changes, a complete pain in the hole and if you kick up enough of a fuss they just change them back again in the end,” confirmed one county board member who is pretty sure mileage, payments and holidays worth thousands in payments aren’t the tax man’s business and the only receipt he’s kept is a nod and a wink. “GAA (Gaelic Accounting Adjustments) is a complex financial system that Revenue officials simply don’t understand but it’s straightforward, if one of the senior team lads receives a car from a sponsor gratis, you jot down ‘nutritional allowance’ and that’s the end of it,” explained one county board official. Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating ‘but we’re the GAA’ didn’t immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids’ play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received €40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles. Revenue only accepted the accounts when forced to witness the man down 18 breakfast roles in 7 minutes.

Israel Bagsies Syria,"LOUDLY PROCLAIMING ‘yoink’, the government led by fraud trial attender and internationally wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu are defending their decision to seize the Golan Heights ‘buffer zone’ in the wake of the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s reign. “Bagsie it,” confirmed Israel citing a cast iron legal precedent observed the world over. The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim.  Citing previous bagsie incidents including ‘Israel’ and the fact it has illegally occupied the other portion of Golan since 1967, Israel do not expect any meaningful challenge to their commandeering of the territory. “I dunno, sounds pretty compelling to us,” confirmed originator of the ‘bagsie it’ method, Britain. Having also destroyed the majority of the newly liberated Syria’s military capabilities, Netanyahu said he hoped any future leadership there would accept his clear offer of friendship but warned that geography is not the IDF’s strong suit and they could continue to expand the size of the Golan Heights if they need to. Elsewhere, many people have called the insistence that attention be paid to the plight of the Syrian people ‘insensitive’ citing the fact they need time to process the Megan Fox-Machine Gun Kelly split for several more weeks.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 11, 2024",world,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/11/israel-bagsies-syria/

Coined as ‘Syrians rebels’ for now until it suits, militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani was greeted with cheers from supporters after capturing the Syrian capital Damascus, solidifying the once wanted group’s control over much of the country. “Don’t worry guys, we’re the good Islamic terrorists so there’s no need to worry about us beheading any of you or anything, unless you’re Christian of course,” proclaimed the rebel leader, who has had a US-issued $10mn dollar reward on his head since 2017, which was ages ago really when you think about it and people change. “I don’t even dress like a terrorist anymore. Look at my army style shirt. I’m like a Syrian Zelensky, I’m one of the good guys now!” he stated. Forcing the Assad family to flee to Russia after a 50-year reign of terror, the once al-Qaeda member al-Jawlani promised a more pragmatic approach to jihad going forward, admitting his past endeavours were questionable, but to trust him all the same as he’s a changed man. “I was al-Qaeda, then Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, then Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but today I’m a Syrian rebel. I may have changed terrorist organisations more times than my headscarf, but you can’t buy that kind of experience so I’m the perfect guy to take over from Assad until they oust me later down the line,” al-Jawlani concluded his statement. Meanwhile, Syrian people have been told to stop celebrating the end of a brutal dictatorship by western leaders because the group that brought freedom didn’t get their permission beforehand.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",world,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/dont-worry-were-the-good-terrorists/
Hayes Sickened He Didn’t Hold Out As Stock He Dumped Soars,"NEWLY SUSPENDED newly elected Social Democrats Eoin Hayes has voiced his regret after shares in software company Palantir have almost tripled in the six months since he sold them. Offloading his stake for just €200k in July, Hayes’ shares would be now worth nearly €600k, which works out at a full terms salary in the Dáil or the cost of an ‘affordable home’ in Dublin. “He’s absolutely bulling,” a source close to Hayes described his mood as he was forced on moral grounds to dump his stake in the US company which provides artificial-intelligence products and services to Israel for use in occupied Palestinian territories. The newly elected Dublin Bay South TD has been suspended from the Social Democrats’ parliamentary party with immediate effect for giving incorrect information, originally stating he sold the shares before he was elected to politics, but was actually after the fact. “In fairness to Eoin he’s showing some real promise as an Irish politician and shouldn’t be put off that he was booted out of the Social Dems for lying, he’d get a promotion in Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael for the same thing,” pointed out another source.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 11, 2024",politics,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/11/hayes-sickened-he-didnt-hold-out-as-stocks-he-dumped-soars/
Some Irish Villages Resorting To Cannibalism As Power Yet To Be Restored After Storm Darragh,"DESPITE ESB repair crews’ best effort, a significant number of people in Ireland still remain without power in the aftermath of Storm Darragh with worrying reports many have resorted to cannibalism. “You got a phone charger? I’ll such your dick for a little phone juice. Please, I’m desperate,” said one internet-deprived Waterford resident seconds into losing power during Storm Darragh, and the social cohesion and civility has only fractured further since then plunging some villages into a more-lawless-usual nightmare. “Ah look, we actually had a load of pre-cooked meals and that so we were fine for food but I thought this storm might be my only excuse to try human flesh,” said one Galway resident feasting on his neighbour’s arm, having just endured close to 30 hours without power. This man is not alone, as it is estimated nearly 3,000 rural Irish villages now resemble some sort of zombie apocalypse movie on steroids. “I wouldn’t mind only we had got in extra stock and hired a generator,” said one rural take away that actually suffered a dip in business as panicked locals never considered checking in, instead choosing to immediately resort to cannibalism. “It’s got so bad Donal Skehan has rushed out a cannibal recipe book for the Christmas,” said one ESB worker who had his leg gnawed off as he was halfway up a pole fixing an electrical fault.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/some-irish-villages-resorting-to-cannibalism-as-power-yet-to-be-restored-after-storm-darragh/
Person At Top Of Shop Queue Taken Completely By Surprise By Request To Pay For Goods,"A MAN AT the top of a lengthy shopping queue has been taken by surprise at a request for payment, WWN can exclusively reveal. Initially local man Tom Shannon struggled to comprehend the words, straining and asking the supermarket retail assistant to repeat what they said before engaging in what looked like the long forgotten elaborate tribal dance of his people, patting down every pocket his clothing had several times. “Just a sec,” said Shannon, who despite seeing the four people in front of him go through the same routine to pay for his shopping, was as ill-prepared for a request for payment as a monkey would be if asked to perform open heart surgery. “What’s this prick at,” confirmed the eleven people behind Shannon in queue in unison. Wasting the sort of time George RR Martin could’ve finished writing his Game of Thrones series in, Shannon fumbled, rummaged and pulled at his jacket and jean pockets before producing his phone which he intended on paying with. “There we are now,” said Shannon before failing to open his phone using face-ID technology, forcing him to resort to incorrectly inputting his phone pin which led him to revert to using his debit card. Doing so with the sort of nonchalance that brings out a unique and potent level of animosity in fellow shoppers, Shannon then repeatedly tapped a coffee loyalty card on the card machine. “You should have given me a heads up you were finished scanning my shopping,” Shannon now barked at the retail assistant, cementing his reputation as a one-of-a-kind dickhead in the process.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 6, 2024",category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/06/person-at-top-of-shop-queue-taken-completely-by-surprise-by-request-to-pay-for-goods/
Assad To Be Given Tour Of Moscow’s Most Beautiful 10th Storey Windows,"A REMARKABLE few days has seen the fall of Syrian tyrant Bashar Al-Assad, with reports placing him in the safe haven for a number of irredeemable bastard dictators, Moscow. The deposed despot fled the country he and his family brutalised for over 50 years but those fearing Assad would be left to a life in penury and suffering will be left disappointed as evidenced by the warm welcome he has reportedly received from Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “I know you would rather be back home killing and torturing, who wouldn’t, but in Moscow we have nice restaurants, the theatre, oh and you will not believe the beautiful windows we have. Hey, Alexander show Bashar our best windows,” enthused Putin before abruptly leaving his dictator friend to get back to concentrating on his three day special military operation in Ukraine. Putin’s FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow’s best high rise windows. “You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me? I like two-panel slider window because once it slide over you can lock in place so no accidentally close while you trying to get view. Come look,” insisted Assad’s friendly and accommodating tour guide. Assad’s guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below. “With jalousie window, you no stand out on edge, feel breeze on face, hand at your back. It real shame,” added Alexander, before ushering Assad to the crown jewel of Russian windows which is known for its panoramic views and no overlooking apartment blocks or witnesses.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",politics,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/assad-to-be-given-tour-of-moscows-most-beautiful-10th-storey-windows/
Local Dad Enters 2nd Hour Of Christmas Tree Price Negotiation Stand Off,"A FATHER based in the Ireland area of Europe is growing ever more dug in on his insistence that the Christmas tree he is attempting to buy should cost no more than €45. “I’ll walk, I’m telling I’ll walk, and then what? That’s a sale gone for your good self,” insisted 45-year-old Cormac Keeler as his children stood by, wishing the world would swallow them up. Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating ‘trees €45, €65 & €85’ Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at €85. “Your sign says ‘€45’ and aim to hold you to that,” barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don’t treat everything like an episode of Dragon’s Den. “You don’t think I’ll go down to the GAA club where they’re selling them as well. I’ve bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for €45 is more than fare,” said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as ‘an asshole’ when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year. Keeler, now shivering from being in the cold so long in a thin jumper, began losing stamina but insisted on not losing face in front of his children. “I’ll give you €85 on the sly but you just pretend you’ve agreed to go down to €45,” pleaded Keeler, to which Horan responded ‘no’.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 6, 2024",local,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/06/local-dad-enters-2nd-hour-of-christmas-tree-price-negotiation-stand-off/
UnitedHealthcare Board Not Sure When Right Time To Break It To CEO’s Family None Of This Is Covered Under Insurance Plan,"A SHOCKING BROAD daylight assassination, a suspect still on the loose, and a motive not yet clear. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has left America reeling,   “Can’t we just crush their souls will a faceless barrage of automated emails full of mangled and meaningless bureaucratic jargon like they were a normal customer?” pondered one executive, who noted a pre-existing allergy to being shot as justification for why any healthcare administered is not covered. While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.  “No, they have our cell numbers, we can’t just rely on our customer disservice lines for this one,” one anguished board member said, bouyed slightly by the news the company’s share price is actually up. “C’mon, this isn’t a single mother-of-two in need of cancer treatment that we give the run around to, this is a real person with a real family,” reasoned one soft hearted profit-allergic board member who risked tarnishing UH’s stellar industry-leading 32% claim rejection rate. “Could we maybe put aside some of huge increases in profits we’ve experienced in the last few years and cover things ourselves? We’ve what, $90bn in profits from last year?” suggested one smiling executive to titters of laughter. Meanwhile, profits are set to soar at private security firms that specialise in providing protection to the top 1% earners across the world.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 5, 2024",business,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/05/unitedhealthcare-board-not-sure-when-right-time-to-break-it-to-ceos-family-none-of-this-is-covered-under-insurance-plan/
Parents Counteract Child Dropping Hints About Xmas Presents By Dropping Hints They’re Broke As Fuck,"“OH TWO can play that game motherfucker” confirmed stressed and broke parents Martin and Fiona Larkan, responding to their eldest child’s increasing number of outlandish hints and requests relating to this year’s Christmas presents. “Bless him, we’d love to get him nice things but he’s overdoing it with the PS5 and SIX feckin’ games,” confirmed Fiona, who has taken to leaving the couple’s shrinking bank balance statements out on the kitchen table for Fiachra (11) to read. Martin has undertaken the more demanding role when it comes to acting, taking to crying when in the car with Fiachra when the petrol gauge flitters near empty. “Yeah, acting, that’s it,” confirmed Martin who has taken to plugging the TV out during ad breaks to save on electricity bills. Not alone this Christmas, the Larkans are believed to part of a growing number of parents who resort to interrupting ‘the magic of Christmas’ with the occasional ‘do you have any idea how much the fucking magic of Christmas is costing us’ lectures when a child asks for €3,000 worth of presents. “You see, this is just a foundational tenet of negotiating. You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they’ve won.

‘You Up Hun?’ FF & FG Sends Late Night Text To Michael Lowry,"SHOUTING to a member of house staff to come in and remove his sleep mask from his face so he can see who just texted him at 2 in the morning, independent TD Michael Lowry smiled to himself at being added to the WhatsApp group ‘The Boys Are Back In Town’. “Melvin, start up the sauna and throw on the kettle, it’s going to be a long day of flirting,” Lowry ordered his butler, who was now folding back the bed clothes for his master to sit up. “It’s going to be like the good old days again – time really is a healer”. The received ‘you up hun?’ text slowly gathered thumbs-up emojis from other recipients, including the Healy Raes, Mattie McGrath, Verona Murphy and that guy who cursed in the Dáil once. “Thanks for the add, guys, all we need now is Bertie,” a message quickly liked by ‘The Bertmeister’ read, much to the amusement of everyone. “At least we’ve no IMF admins in the group chat this time,” a message from ‘2-pint man’ read, souring the chat’s flow.

“That’s Bad Form Now” Kim Jong Un Urges South Korean President To Stand Down,"“THAT’S bad form now, you wouldn’t see that kind of carry on up north,” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began in a nationwide TV address calling out his South Korean counterpart who attempted to implement martial law yesterday in a bid to avoid impeachment. Yoon Suk Yeol’s future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world’s spotlight. “Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,” Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death. “This is exactly what happens when you’ve got a poor leader who can’t control his people – sure they may all have fancy things like food, a working economy, health care and really nice fried chicken, but what would you prefer, all those materialistic things or a great strong leader with dashing good looks?” Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of ‘we love you’ could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation’s men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year. “Since it’s Christmas, I’m giving away a free holiday to Eastern Europe for every North Korean man in the country. See how nice I am to you?

"‘Supplying Weapons To Kill 50,000 People All Fine But Just Don’t Pardon Your Son,’ Biden Told","LONG DORMANT media columnists and political commentators have awoken from a year long hibernation to valiantly put on record their displeasure at the most heinous thing Joe Biden has done since taking office. “Are we not a country of rules and laws anymore? I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,” exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. “Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you” offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. “What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,” Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner’s dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister.  “Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he’s walking free – makes me sick,” said Trump who didn’t pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment. Journalists possessed with a unique political insight even suggest inspired by Biden, Trump could now suddenly develop an interest in using pardoning powers for allies and January 6th insurrectionists.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 3, 2024",world,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/03/supplying-weapons-to-kill-50000-people-all-fine-but-just-dont-pardon-your-son-biden-told/
“First 100 Violations Of Ceasefire Are Free” US Tells Israel As IDF Continues To Strike Lebanon,"DESPITE UNIFIL forces observing at least 100 instances of Israeli forces breaching the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the US administration between the IDF and Hezbollah, it has emerged that the deal had some hidden clauses applying solely to Israel. “Well, as a valued and repeat customer for US arms, Israel actually signed up to our premium package which mean the first 100 violations of ceasefires are free,” spokesperson for the US Department of State, Matthew Miller, said. Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear. “Now, look, it’s not all rosy for the IDF when the next 100 violations occur that triggers a clause in our agreement together,” outlined Miller, revealing the hard line the Biden administration continues to take could see Israel sent more weapons as punishment. Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. “It’s not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,” outlined Miller.

Fianna Fáil & Fine Gael’s ‘Red Lines’ For Going Into Government With Each Other,"EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheál Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the ‘red lines’? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheál Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fáil would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fáil will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Féin embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dáil bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a €20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Féin effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia.

“Calm Down Sugar Tits”: Gregg Wallace’s Guide To Crafting The Perfect Apology,"SO YOU’VE found yourself in a spot of bother and now some middle class women of a certain age who can’t take a joke/groping are giving out to HR.  You might be fearing the worst; job gone, career over, but relax one of the world’s leading apology experts, Gregg Wallace, is on hand to dispense his priceless advice that’ll get everyone back on your side: Step 1) Deescalate – there’s been a clear misunderstanding of harmless banter. “Calm down sugar tits”. Fire any and all publicists working for you, you’ve got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners.  If anything you’ll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn’t even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. “You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I’d love motor boat clearly aren’t getting any at home which is why you can’t even take a compliment”. Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn’t the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. “Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I’ll need to pretend I’m a devout Christian now too”. Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife’s vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn’t an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You’re going to want to mention the word ‘woke’ a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I’m A Celebrity to see if they’ll book you on the first flight to the jungle.

"Rachel Maddow Concerned Trump Will Put Her in ‘FEMA Camp’ During Second Term: ‘Yes, I’m Worried’","Clinically insane MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has expressed serious fearmongering concerns that she and millions of other clinically insane American woke socialist liberals would be interned in a “camp” when former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House this November. During an interview with Maddow in Monday’s Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. “Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the ‘treacherous and treasonous scum’,” noted Burner. “You’re one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?”  Rachel Maddow replied: “I’m worried, but I’m actually ready for being in a camp because I’m a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don’t read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. “When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump anyway. “In the camps of the future it won’t be so bad either, there will be plenty of women for me to become friends with. I hope Trump puts me in one of those all female camp buildings. I’ll be up to my eyeballs in pussy. Really, there’s nothing to fear folks, everything I say on MSNBC is absolute bullshit, and I am essentially an actor. Anyone who takes me seriously must be as mad as I am.” The ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ seems to be in full force before the coming U.S.elections.",Daily Squib,2024-06-12,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/56316-rachel-maddow-concerned-trump-will-put-her-in-fema-camp-during-second-term-yes-im-worried.html
I'm a Cruise Ship Worker...These are the SIX Things Smart Passengers Always do Onboard,"A cruise ship worker has shared the six things that ‘smart’ passengers always do when they come aboard for their holiday. Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don’t fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point “as early as possible”, suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. “One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark.” Don’t jump off the ship when it’s cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: “Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets”. She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don’t fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience.  Don’t get pushed off the ship Janice’s fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There’s only so much a crew member can take, so don’t be an arse and get on everyone’s tits. Don’t fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker’s penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: “You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning”. Don’t fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: “The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy.

The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it.

Labour Plan to Have Speakers and Listening Devices on Every Lamp Post,"The public will be lectured on “motivational” socialist principles, and Labour diktats every day of their lives, a newly published manifesto paper has revealed. Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour “Listen and Speak” scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. “If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I’ll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I’d fucking top myself.” Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour “Listen and Speak” system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast.  Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen’s speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. “If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,” a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to “safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen” and a way to uphold “the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining”.",Daily Squib,2024-05-30,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/56106-labour-plan-to-have-speakers-and-listening-devices-on-every-lamp-post.html
Personal Computers and Smartphones Were Introduced For Benefit of AI,"You may think there were some benevolent reasons for rolling out and introducing the personal computer and smartphone to the civilian population, and yes there were some, but the majority of reasons were far from that. One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who’s programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.?  You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control.  This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain.

ANALYSIS: Was Prince Harry Making a Statement in Latest Address?,"Yes, Prince Harry was a gunner on an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan for 6 weeks, and he served his country briefly, but royal fans have been questioning his ‘ludicrous’ display of medals for his brief stint in the military in his latest video address. “Arse!” Royal fans were up in arms when they saw a blurred, wonky amateur video of the prince on his porch in Montecito wearing medals all over a cheap looking civilian suit. One Twitter X user commented: “What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned” Another X user revealed: “He looks like a prize ninny! Who’s he trying to fool?” However, others defended the duke, with one user Laquisha46 commenting: “Harry is wearing his medals proudly, which our African princess Meghan probably purchased for him in a flea market in Santa Monica. Leave them alone, you bunch of bullies. Love you Meghan.” The consensus was of ridicule for the wayward prince who has admitted to heavy use of class-A drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, meth and marijuana, allegedly including when he served. Expert analysis Royal expert and body language expert Arbuthnot Bollsaque commented on the BBC that “Harry is showing defiance for being stripped of his right to wear a military uniform by displaying the plethora of medals all over his cheap looking suit”. Harry was stripped of his honorary military titles by late Queen Elizabeth II after he stepped down from royal life in 2020 and moved to California with Meghan Markle.",Daily Squib,2024-04-27,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55590-analysis-was-prince-harry-making-a-statement-in-latest-address.html
Interconnected: The Internet Only Creates War For Humanity,"When humans become too interconnected, they reject this state through war because too much connection creates a reaction of disconnection and a run to privacy. Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.",Daily Squib,2023-12-07,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/54018-interconnected-the-internet-only-creates-war-for-humanity.html
"World Economic Forum: ""Brutal Totalitarian Communist China is Model For Western Nations""","According to the World Economic Forum, which dictates to Western nations on policy, and future direction, the brutal bullying thugs of the Chinese Communist Party and its evil policies of totalitarian savagery are a model for Western nations to follow. This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China’s CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a “role model” for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN’s Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week’s APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China’s “tremendous” achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. “I think it’s a role model for many countries,” Schwab said. “I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,” Schwab said. It’s not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it’s forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions.  A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved “peacefully.” Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome’s 1972 pro-depopulation book “The Limits to Growth.” Meadows argues that most of the world’s population must be wiped out so that the survivors can “have freedom” and a “high standard of living.” During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world’s population is “inevitable.” However, he insists that a “benevolent” dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population “peacefully.” “We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,” he says of the world’s growing population. “If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart … and [people have] a low standard of living,” Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.",Daily Squib,2022-11-28,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/48511-world-economic-forum-brutal-totalitarian-communist-china-is-model-for-western-nations.html

The Beginning of the Post Consumerist Era,"Food scarcity, impossible prices, insane inflation and mass job losses/bankruptcies. Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down.

Netflix Harry and Meghan Enjoy Themselves Exploiting Disabled Veterans For Cash,"The Netflix producers and cameras were all in tow as Harry hugged another disabled Afghanistan veteran for the cameras. This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in ‘real life’ by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans.  Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children’s book The Stench. Disabled Veterans  Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. “It’s a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually ‘care’ despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that’s something for another day. You just can’t fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved. Exploiting the disabled and old for your own monetary and press gain is truly despicable, but it’s all part of the game, and these two money-grabbing tricksters play that game very well.” Here’s to the VVIP (Vile Vindictive Insolent Parasite) Sussexes… (long fart sound)",Daily Squib,2022-04-18,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/45624-netflix-harry-and-meghan-enjoy-themselves-exploiting-disabled-veterans-for-cash.html
Experts: Meghan Markle Thought She Could Move Up Rank in Royal Family,"According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works.  “Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that’s it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. “This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. “Prince Harry once said ‘What Meghan wants Meghan gets’ and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry’s life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. “Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle’s psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. “Markle has modelled herself on Harry’s mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. “Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana’s inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. “Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. “As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan’s evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan’s titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.”",Daily Squib,2021-04-07,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41634-experts-meghan-markle-thought-she-could-move-up-rank-in-royal-family.html

Is Harry Now a National Security Threat?,"To become a bona fide enemy of the state is no mean feat, but Harry and Meghan seem to have managed it with ease. Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain’s enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain’s Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry’s Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain’s enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!",Daily Squib,2021-03-08,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/41322-is-harry-now-a-national-security-threat.html

Meghan Markle Endures Bird Shit Trauma During Oprah Interview,"During the sell-out Oprah interview, Meghan Markle was talking about her favourite subject – herself – when a cute little tweety boird landed on a branch next to the narcissist. The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle’s black couture dress. They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry’s ratings in the UK. One of Oprah’s producers was professional about the bird shit incident. “The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!” As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple’s garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient.   UPDATE: March 11, 2021 – Some geezer has taken our idea and put it to video.

Meghan Markle Demands English County of Sussex is Moved to California,"The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle has made a remarkable request to the Queen that has caused shockwaves through royal circles. Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle’s demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen’s cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.",Daily Squib,2021-02-19,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/41113-meghan-markle-demands-english-county-of-sussex-is-moved-to-california.html
Queen Meghan and King Harry of America Knight Their Gardener,"American royal author appointed by Queen Meghan and King Harry, Ringo Scoobie, has outlined in a new book that the American royal couple have knighted their first Sir on American soil.  According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. “The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace’s footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like ‘puta’ and ‘madre’. “Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. “The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers ‘Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.’ The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. “The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day’s business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.” It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future. In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder. Queen Meghan has staunchly denied the American royals are competing with anyone else, ahem, mention no names.",Daily Squib,2020-12-09,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/39995-queen-meghan-and-king-harry-of-america-knight-their-gardener.html
"Hunter Biden: ""I Can't Wait to Move Into White House to Smoke Crack Rocks""","“Pops said I get my own wing, so I can sneak my crack dealer in and underage girls to give me foot jobs daily. Can’t live without that shit. We’re also gonna set up a direct link with the Chinese Communist Party so they can download what they want and dictate to Pop what they need done,” an excited Hunter Biden said rubbing his hands with glee. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE According to Democrat officials who say the election is in the bag, Marxist political operative Zheng Zhifa and Democrat-Chinese Influence peddler John Wei, who are closely tied to the CCP will have their own office directly in line with Biden’s Oval Office so they can bark orders at him without even picking up a phone. “Pops told me that the Secret Service assholes, and any moron who cares for national security will be told to stand down. If anyone even raises a fucking eyebrow to our corrupt deals, as we rake in more millions, they will be retired to goddamn Alaska. As for my crack dealer, Jigaboom ‘Boom’ Williams, he will be given free access to my quarters, as he is the best crack rock dealer this side of Chicago,” Hunter Biden added. Thanks to the silence of the corrupt dealings and crimes of the Biden Crime Family by the mainstream Democrat Party Propaganda media, the Bidens are well protected and can do as they please without any fear of prosecution. They are effectively above the law, and their evil crimes are completely dusted under the carpet. “When it comes to Democrats, the media keeps quiet of our crimes, and we can do anything without fear of ever being prosecuted. Republicans, libertarians, and anyone else — they get prosecuted immediately for the smallest misdemeanour, their names and reputation put through the mud, and turfed out of town by the mob.

Obama and Hunter Biden: Sold Out America to the Highest Bidder - CHINA,"Under the Obama administration China increased its economic stance tenfold off the back of America. Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China.  WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden’s recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA’s national security.",Daily Squib,2020-10-27,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/39255-obama-and-hunter-biden-sold-out-america-to-the-highest-bidder-china.html
The Biden Incest Plot Thickens,"There’s only so much we can reveal here, but we have seen a small tip of the iceberg that truly incriminates the Biden crime family. Due to mass biased censorship, the DS can only briefly describe what is out there now all over the internet. Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child. This obviously ties in with Joe Biden’s creepy photographs sniffing women and children, and other inappropriate behaviour even during C-SPAN photo shoots. SOURCE: NationalFile.com Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who allegedly admitted to his father in a text message that he had sexual relations with his 14-year-old niece, Natalie Biden, is now undercover and nowhere to be seen. Maybe venture to 4Chan, as Chinese dissidents against the CCP regime are flooding the place with even more photos from the Hunter hard drive. In one video Hunter Biden is filmed receiving foot gratification from a female whilst smoking a crack pipe. That’s all we can reveal here, purely because of the censorship and cover up by the socialist controlled media. There may or may not be some information from here if you follow through. Free and Fair Press? There is no way any of the mainstream news outlets can call themselves news services, or journalists because they are completely ignoring the biggest scandal in political history at the moment. You are not a journalist if you ignore this Biden story, you are a paid biased slave to political masters, and are ignoring the basic tenets as well as responsibility of journalism. Your cowardice and inaction, will never be forgotten — you are a disgrace to the mantle of journalism and a free, fair press. Do not ever call yourselves journalists ever again.

Keeping Up With the Sussexes - Netflix Series Coming in December,"As the horrible Keeping Up With the Kardashians series is finally canned, a new horror awakens from the bowels of Netflix – Keeping Up With the Sussexes.  Just as the sun seemed to be shining again and the vile Kardashian slime was seeming to have subsided, there is a newer even worse offering coming to our screens, this time involving freeloaders Harry, Meghan and poor old Archie. “No doubt the Netflix executives have ordered the Sussexes to bring out the sprog for maximum effect, and are already training the kid to do circus tricks,” one ex-Netflix subscriber said disparagingly. Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. “It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians. Sussex is now viewed next to any other cheap brand on the telly and no doubt the merchandising will be profitable as well. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, the Windsors can only look on in horror as the royal name is dragged through the dustbin of inequity,” a royal commentator revealed. Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving ‘woke’ bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age. If it was up to the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry and Meghan would have been given the boot with no title, no pay offs and no goodbyes.",Daily Squib,2020-09-10,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38604-keeping-up-with-the-sussexes-netflix-series-coming-in-december.html
Trump to Open Presidential Library of Authors Books Written About How Bad He is,"You have the Clinton presidential library, with hidden compartments to stash naked young women, you have the Obama library where books about climate change and anal rimming techniques are the choice, and you have the George W. Bush library, which only has one book, My Pet Goat. The Donald Trump presidential library is set to stump all of the prior presidents, and their ego stroking book depositories. Trump is going to open up a whole library of books dedicated solely to authors who have spilled the dirt on the president, backstabbers, former employees with grudges, former White House staff who were fired, and all the rest of the Trump haters who wrote vast volumes of text detailing how bad a person he is. “I want to put all the tremendous hate into one place, so I can walk in there and revel in all of it. We’re not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me. I revel in this, because I affected those people so much, they went and wrote a book about me, good for them. You know, I should get royalties from them all, maybe I might get my new lawyer to look into that. We’re going to see rows and rows of these books in my new shining library, it’s gonna be bigger than Obama’s that’s for sure,” President Donald J. Trump quipped from the White House on Wednesday. There’s even talk about bringing out an encyclopaedia of Donald Trump Haters, who all seem to have come out of the woodwork only weeks before the election. Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president’s anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. “No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it’s because they are really scared he will win a second term. The negative news projects are released with such quantity daily, they now overlap each other publicity wise. We are talking well researched hit pieces, some with actual evidence as opposed to the old ‘anonymous source’ route. I don’t know anyone on this planet that can survive that kind of shit, but the Teflon Don. Sure some stuff sticks a little while longer, like the vet smear project, but all I see is Trump wading through this manure, he’s doing it relatively calmly too, with ease. You gotta hand it to him, and if he wins the Nobel Peace Prize, he will deserve it way more than Obama, who just got his for being black,” a prominent Capitol Hill commentator revealed about the whole fiasco.",Daily Squib,2020-09-10,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/38599-trump-to-open-presidential-library-of-authors-books-written-about-how-bad-he-is.html
Meghan is Imitating Diana After Years of Study,"Meghan Markle is acting in the biggest and most lucrative acting role ever — that of imitating Princess Diana.  Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle’s actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. “Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. “Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle’s Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. “This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person’s weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. “With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his ‘mother’ for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman’s claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. “My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.”",Daily Squib,2020-09-02,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38512-meghan-is-imitating-diana-after-years-of-study.html
Another Tedious Megain Markle Lecture to the Unwashed Masses,"Every day is a special day in Meghan Markle land, where she, appointed by absolutely no one, has taken it upon herself to lecture the masses on how to do things the ‘right’ way. Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. “Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,” the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being ‘ordered’ to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that’s all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don’t you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do.  One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the ‘voice of the people’ has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have ‘mental’ problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle’s bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that’s what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world. People are sick of being lectured by you and your little boy — Harry.",Daily Squib,2020-08-21,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38263-another-tedious-megan-markle-lecture-to-the-unwashed-masses.html
Meghan Markle Pees in Extensive Gardens Instead of Using 16 Bathrooms,"Prince Harry, according to his advisers, is at his wits end about his wife Meghan Markle, who has a penchant for urinating in the lavish gardens of their new mansion in Santa Barbara. According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. “We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That’s when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,” Harry was quoted in the book ‘Fine Whine and Freedom‘. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan’s pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. “It’s acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!” The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town’s carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that’s her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.",Daily Squib,2020-08-14,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38146-meghan-markle-pees-in-extensive-gardens-instead-of-using-16-bathrooms.html
Ironic That BLM ANTIFA Heroes Karl Marx and Engels Thought Blacks Closer to Animal Kingdom Than Whites,"The communist heroes of Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA – Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels – were avowed racists who not only resented ‘lazy’ Mexicans but thought black people were closer to animals in opposition to the highly evolved biological nature of white people. “Manifesto of the Communist Party” Isn’t it ironic to see the communist flags flying at ANTIFA and BLM protests/riots and to hear the idiotic sputum spewing coming from one of the BLM founders, Cullors, that she is a trained Marxist is additionally hilarious to behold?  Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx’s racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of ‘n*ggers’ holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx’s son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by “one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood.” In a letter to Lafargue’s wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that’s why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province.   So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It’s quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it’s embarrassing that these supposedly ‘anti-racism’ groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.",Daily Squib,2020-08-10,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/38067-ironic-that-blm-antifa-heroes-karl-marx-and-engels-thought-blacks-closer-to-animal-kingdom-than-whites.html
Why is Michelle Obama So Depressed?,"The trials and tribulations of a former first lady are probably far-reaching and complex, and it is this complexity we can see in Michelle Obama, a woman who once had it all but now is a mere footnote in history. Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking ‘whitey’ for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle’s famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine ‘woke’ propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There’s only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. “We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack’s. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let’s say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?” What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: “Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people’s money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It’s a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they’re downers.” Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.",Daily Squib,2020-08-07,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/38023-why-is-michelle-obama-so-depressed.html
BLM Campaign Failure: Are Black People More Hated Now Than Before Riots?,"Black Lives Matter and their extremist politically charged campaign may have backfired totally, as black people are now more hated and despised than before their nefarious BLM scorched earth campaign. The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. “Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,” an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of ‘White Flight’ where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China’s power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China’s land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.",Daily Squib,2020-07-03,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37706-blm-campaign-failure-are-black-people-more-hated-now-than-before-riots.html
Mount Rushmore Presidents Could Be Replaced by BLM and #MeToo Founders,"Marxist groups for the Soviet Cultural Revolution of America have called for the great American presidents on Mount Rushmore to be replaced with the faces of Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) and Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi (founders of Black Lives Matter). “We are petitioning the Lakota tribe elders, who really own the land on which Mount Rushmore resides to clear the racist presidents from the sculpture. Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,” a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today.  Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture’s design and oversaw the project’s execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation’s birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America’s magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. “We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,” a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.",Daily Squib,2020-06-25,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37612-mount-rushmore-presidents-could-be-replaced-by-blm-and-metoo-founders.html
BLM Doing to White People What the Nazis Did to Jews - Dehumanizing Them,"During the reign of the Nazi party in Germany, propaganda created by Goebbels made the Jews out to be an inferior race, the National Socialist regime effectively dehumanized Jewish people, instead of a hard-working, enterprising, resilient, and creative people, they were portrayed as inferior to the Aryan (pure) Germanic race. The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as ‘anti-racism’ by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews.  White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM’s ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population. History repeats itself sometimes in sinister ways.",Daily Squib,2020-06-07,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37341-blm-doing-to-white-people-what-the-nazis-did-to-jews-dehumanizing-them.html
George Floyd to be Sainted by Pope in America,"The violent criminal and drug addict, who robbed a terrified pregnant woman, beating her over the head with a pistol, George Floyd, will be sainted by the Pope in Minneapolis in July, the Vatican has revealed. All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. “Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,” the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: “We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money. Saint George could do no wrong, as he kicked her in the stomach before he left with the woman’s money. She was white and deserved it. Black lives matter, and Saint George Floyd, praise be to you, I drink champagne in your honour!” Pope Francis will be coming to liberal American cities blighted by racial tension to administer the sainthood on Apostle George Floyd in late July.",Daily Squib,2020-06-05,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37294-george-floyd-to-be-sainted-by-pope-in-america.html
Intelligence: China Encouraging BLM ANTIFA Rioters Across U.S. Cities,"Chinese communist propaganda and operators are working within groups like Black Lives Matter, and the overtly Marxist group ANTIFA to destabilise and encourage rioting in U.S. cities an intelligence group have revealed about the threat from China. These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America’s campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg’s Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals.  There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system.   “Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,” one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: “Their goal is to exploit America’s academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. “It’s smart. It’s a long-term, patient approach.” Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party’s “united front” efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party’s friends to strike at the party’s enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It’s not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples.   Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!",Daily Squib,2020-05-31,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37236-intelligence-china-encouraging-blm-antifa-rioters-across-u-s-cities.html
Civilian Harry Misses His Old Life and Regrets Listening to Meghan Markle,"We do have regrets in life, and it is testament to the enduring qualities of Harry, stripped of his medals in the army, and his royal status, all because he had a moment of momentary madness, and followed this woman who controlled him so well to the un-royal city of Los Angeles, where the soulless grid streets all lead to nowhere in particular. “I used to hang around thousand-year-old palaces steeped in history, have proper English butlers, shoot pheasants, and in the evenings have anything including any young filly delivered to my quarters to be pumped with vigour. Now I am a civilian underling to an ageing humourless Z list actress who is obsessed by herself, and orders me around as if I am one of nana’s Corgis, there are no palaces here in the soulless cocaine fuelled environs of Los Angeles, just bland Starbucks and fake plastic people with their faces stretched behind their ears, and their pig’s anus resembling trout lips, puckered to the point of absurdity,” the woeful former royal lamented to his friends. The former prince yearns for the fresh breeze of the rolling green hills of England, the quaint pubs, the polo, his friends and brother and the cheers of Twickenham, as well as the considered sarcastic comments of royal discourse, which is non-existent to the clueless politically correct Yanks. Meghan whose chief expertise is in fellatio, due to her apprenticeship over many years of shitty low-end showbiz jobs, has only this skill to her name, but over time, even her intricate oral technique will not be able to keep the former prince from feeling home sick. The hundreds of men she has serviced in her time can contest to her fellating skills, but her vicious narcissistic personality counteracts this very attribute. One friend revealed: “Harry is so bored of it all. He is now surrounded by American socialists, who can be even more intoxicating than the British sort, mainly because of their extreme champagne swilling PC hypocrisy and constant sappy victimhood. The Hollywood set are about as shallow and vapid as a Death Island episode.

Meghan Markle Appealing to Trump to End Coronavirus Pandemic Because Her Headlines Are Gone,"Former royal, Meghan Markle is appealing for the coronavirus pandemic to be ended, or put on hold because it is messing with her headlines and PR campaigns. Having no qualms about abandoning her own family and 72-year-old father who had two heart attacks, it is not surprising that Meghan does not care much for the people dying from coronavirus. “The headlines are not about me, Meghan Markle, instead they are about this awful pandemic, about old people dying, I mean who fucking cares about them? These old people are taking away my headlines, just let ’em go. Then it’s about coronavirus masks, and food bank queues, and corona this, corona that! There’s nothing about my new foundation Archehole, or my new initiative to slow global warming by stitching up elephant assholes so their farts do not damage the ozone layer.” Harry and Meghan, who claim they left the UK because of press intrusion, are now even more distraught that the press have got better things to report than the gimmie dat couple who just ‘take, take, take’. One of Meghan’s aides revealed in secret that the atmosphere is very tense in the Harry and Meghan household. “She orders the servants to rearrange the furniture every two hours, and is so irritated by the coronavirus headlines that whenever someone on TV starts talking about the virus, she shouts at the top of her voice about how great Meghan is, and how she is going to save the world. Meghan is now writing affirmations with her third sharpie all over the walls of the rented villa in Los Angeles where she is in lockdown with poor Harry and Archie.” In desperation, Meghan Markle is actually thinking of phoning up Donald Trump, who she. hates, and demanding he halts the pandemic immediately, so she can get some headlines once again.",Daily Squib,2020-04-16,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/36586-meghan-markle-appealing-to-trump-to-end-coronavirus-pandemic-because-her-headlines-are-gone.html
Archehole: Harry and Meghan Reveal New Money Making Venture,"Former royals, Harry and Meghan, who have recently moved to Los Angeles, are setting up a new organisation called Archehole. In a statement, they said “We are fed up of the global COVID-19 pandemic taking up our precious publicity but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how the Archehole commodity came to be”. The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their  royal titles at the end of last month, allowing Meghan to resume her z-list career in acting, and have trademarked their own son to make money off selling cheaply produced tat to their deluded, deranged anti-royal fans. In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole. The name Archehole combined an ancient word for strength and action, with another that “evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon through our assholes”. “We have launched Archehole during a global pandemic because as narcissists we cannot be out of the news for more than two weeks plus we need some fucking money sharpish,” they said. C’mon peasants, you may be dying of COVID-19 and have lost everything you have, but you must now pay up your last remaining pennies to Harry and Meghan.",Daily Squib,2020-04-10,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/36508-archehole-harry-and-meghan-reveal-new-money-making-venture.html
Coronavirus - Cui Bono - Who Benefits?,"When it comes to something like the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to understand that in these situations, we have to look at who ultimately benefits from this global virus. One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you ‘Do Not Panic!’ whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged. As Obama puts it ‘the old white men‘, who somehow thwarted his hermaphrodite homosexual orgiastic dream last time around. This time however, the virus will no doubt kill these over sixties off, and bring in a new age for the young Marxist indoctrinated youth to savour. Cui bono? It is the globalist communist China loving controllers every time..Greta Thunberg is literally having a deep orgasm at the mere thought of it all…Soros is loving every moment…the Bilderbergers are joyous…the tech power nerds click clacking their keyboards..and the hidden ones…ebullient…",Daily Squib,2020-03-13,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35810-coronavirus-cui-bono-who-benefits.html
Meghan Reveals Harry Suffers From 'Post Traumatic Royal Disorder',"Back in Canada after the disastrous last visit to England and an unsavoury farewell, Meghan Markle, the former Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that Harry gets the shakes and is suffering from PTRD (Post Traumatic Royal Disorder). “It usually happens at night. Harry will wake up shouting and sweating like a Catholic priest at a choir boys convention. The sweat is horrible, and he’s shaking like a leaf. “I then ask him if it was THAT dream again. He always answers ‘yes’. “It’s always the same dream, he’s at Sandringham, and the whole Windsor family are sitting around the dinner table. Harry is presented with an exquisite feast, and he tentatively asks for the salt. One of the many butlers brings him some salt and even sprinkles his food with it, except he keeps going, then Harry tells the butler ‘that’s enough!’ but he keeps on pouring the salt until his food is completely submerged. “As the salt keeps coming, more and more, Harry looks down and his nose is just above the salt, he can’t breathe, the salt rises further, all he can hear is everyone laughing, guffawing, blackness, suffocation — and this is when Harry always wakes up!” What does this recurring nightmarish dream mean? Countless psychiatrists are trying to cure the poor former prince, but he goes through psychiatrists like a chain smoker goes through lighters. It has got to such a bad state that Harry now sleeps in a separate room and Meghan sleeps with Archie, which she prefers.",Daily Squib,2020-03-13,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35975-meghan-reveals-harry-suffers-from-post-traumatic-royal-disorder.html
Will Harry Ever Forgive Meghan For Her Crime?,"The tragedy of the final appearance of the former prince, Harry and the woman he naively followed out of the royal family, resembles a tragic play worthy of Shakespeare or an operatic masterpiece from another era. Will Harry ever forgive this odious power mad manipulative commoner who ruined his royalty, who put a stain on his image that will probably never be removed? Meghan, with her constant gleeful fake smile parades her power over the lowly, weak, Harry with a commanding authority much like a pig farmer parades their prize breed boar through the stalls of an auction house. Harry’s life will from now on be a sad shadow of his previous one, and it’s all down to the emasculating, vindictive monster he has been fooled into mating with. Nothing to lose Meghan gained everything while Harry, who had so much, gave up everything, for little or no return. One royal fan from the crowd observing, quipped, “Be careful with whom you stick your winky into ‘arry, for it can affect your whole life, drastically for the worse, as you’re seeing now. The initial buzz of the first time lust always dies down.”  “Meghan and her Croydon facelift does not care about Archie, otherwise she would have brought him along on the trip to England for the final appearance, and she vindictively used the child’s absence as a way of punishing Her Majesty, the Queen. Withholding grandchildren to punish, is an oft used technique by parents with a stick to whack,” one angry woman said from the sidelines of the abbey. The service at Westminster Abbey in honour of the Commonwealth was most certainly marred by the antics and idiosyncrasies of the Firm, something well documented over the decades. In years to come, or maybe sooner, Harry will resent this woman who took him away from his beloved army mates, his brother, from his country, and from his family, and from the sprawling palaces, the shooting grounds, the rolling hills of England, the Pomp and Circumstance, gone now, a distant memory with only vast straight grid roads and fast food restaurants to look at in his new environs.

Disney Could Replace Meghan Markle With Plank of Wood,"Disney executives who are being begged by Harry and Meghan’s agent to give her a role in a superhero film, or anything that comes up, are so fed up that they might just have a plank of wood on screen to represent the former Duchess of Sussex. “She can’t act, has zero charisma, and is a foul using bitch who has zero endearing qualities, plus has a very negative image in the public’s eyes. We just went to Home Depot and bought a plank of plywood, that will be her,” Gus Van Horten, senior studio producer told CNN. It would be a win win situation for the film studio because the plank of wood costs about $19.99 as opposed to some horrific sum pushed by Meghan’s deluded agent. “The plank of wood will have more presence and acting skills than Meghan Markle, who was a Z list anyway,” another Disney producer revealed. The former royal couple are currently holed up in Vancouver, Canada staying as a guest of a Kremlin connected Russian businessman. Meghan Markle is signed up to visit Britain for the last time before embarking on her Hollywood ‘career’.

Defiant Meghan Markle Vs Windsor Royal Family,"Meghan Markle detests the Windsor Royal family and Britain with a vehemence, and is now embroiled in a dirty war to prove she is bigger than all who stand in her way. Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the ‘Sussex Royal’ name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan’s modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. “Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. “Meghan’s sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of ‘charity funding’. The key factor is to ‘virtue signal’ for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. “The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that’s when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. “We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of ‘loving’ Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.”",Daily Squib,2020-02-22,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/35629-defiant-meghan-markle-vs-windsor-royal-family.html
Thomas Markle Bans Meghan and Harry From Using Markle Brand,"After Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II, banned ex-royals Harry and Meghan from profiting off the ‘Sussex Royal‘ brand, estranged father of Meghan Markle made an announcement today to the same effect. “After deep cogitation at the ramifications of our Markle family name being dragged through the gutter, I hereby decree that the use of the ‘Markle’ family name be not used to market cheap plastic trinkets, socks, pyjamas and toilet brushes as proposed by Meghan and Harry after being banned by the Queen of Great Britain of using the ‘Sussex Royal’ name for profit.” The Exile on Meghan Street couple who are now holed up in Canada, have already spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating a Sussex Royal website as well as patenting thousands of products they wished to sell using the trademark to make millions of dollars. This has all been shot to the ground much to the delight of the general population who vehemently detest Meghan Markle and her calculating ideas of global domination. The only thing left for the marauding ex-royal freeloaders is to now call themselves simply as ‘Meghan and Harry’.",Daily Squib,2020-02-19,entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/35605-thomas-markle-bans-meghan-and-harry-from-using-markle-brand.html
Chinese Water Supply Contains Faecal Matter Aiding Spread of Coronavirus,"Contamination of drinking water from faeces is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as diarrhoea and viral hepatitis. A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to “at least basic sanitation”, a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment.   High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi’an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!",Daily Squib,2020-02-06,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35419-chinese-water-supply-contains-faecal-matter-aiding-spread-of-coronavirus.html
Chinese Authorities Misreporting Coronavirus Deaths,"With over 100,000 Chinese people infected, the deaths from coronavirus are being vastly misreported by the Chinese Communist State. Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs.  Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again.  The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run.  If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.",Daily Squib,2020-02-03,world,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35341-chinese-authorities-misreporting-coronavirus-deaths.html

Trump: 'I Have Done More For Christianity Than Jesus',"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In response to the Christianity Today editorial calling for his removal, Trump called the magazine a ""left-wing rag"" and said, ""I have done more for Christianity than Jesus."" ""I mean, the name of the magazine is Christianity Today, and who is doing more for Christians today? Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals."" While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. ""I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,"" Trump stated. ""How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it."" Furthermore, Trump asserted that he ""saved Christmas."" ""Look what I've done,"" he said. ""You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

Senate To Be Replaced With Room Full Of Monkeys Throwing Feces,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In an emergency, overnight referendum, the American people voted on Thursday to replace the United States Senate with a room full of monkeys throwing feces. The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats.

The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  ""It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,"" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. ""No more 10-12 hour hearings. With these monkeys, all the fecal projectiles will have been flung in under 30 minutes. One and done.""

Motorcyclist Who Identifies As Bicyclist Sets Cycling World Record,"NEW YORK, NY - In an inspiring story from the world of professional cycling, a motorcyclist who identifies as a bicyclist has crushed all the regular bicyclists, setting an unbelievable world record. In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. ""Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,"" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. ""Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here."" Banner also said he painted the word ""HUFFY"" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.",The Babylon Bee,2019-10-25,sports,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/motorcycle-that-identifies-as-bicycle-sets-world-cycling-record
Trump Announces He Has Hidden 5 Golden Tickets Among Stimulus Checks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Trump has built up a lot of buzz over the coming stimulus payments, saying he has hidden five golden tickets among the checks heading to Americans this week. Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago. Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager.

RBG!""  ""Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,"" said LeBron James after the game. ""I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge.

""If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,"" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear.

Biden Cuts Hole In Mask So He Can Still Sniff People's Hair,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Joe Biden has committed to wearing a mask in public to be a good example and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. ""That's better,"" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. ""Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.""

Man Identifying As 6-Year-Old Crushes Game-Winning Homer In Tee-Ball Championship,"AUBURN, CA - Local 36-year-old man Nate Ripley, who identifies as a six-year-old, ""absolutely crushed"" a game-winning homer at a local tee-ball game and won the championship for his team Monday evening, reports confirmed. Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, ""Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!"" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. ""I'm just proud to be here with my team. It's all for the love of the game,"" an emotional Ripley told reporters while enjoying an orange slice and juice box after the championship.

Fisher-Price Releases 'My First Peaceful Protest' Playset With House You Can Actually Burn Down,"EAST AURORA, NY - The toy geniuses at Fisher-Price have announced a brand new toy made just for leftist parents and their kids: the My First Peaceful Protest playset. The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  ""Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,"" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. ""We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met."" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. ""We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,"" said Flufferton, ""but selling them isn't the point.

Cracker Jack Changes Name To More Politically Correct Caucasian Jack,"PLANO, TX — When ballparks finally open again, those standing for the traditional seventh-inning stretch will be singing some different lyrics to ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame.""

Walmart Discontinues Auto Part Sales To Prevent Car Accidents,"BENTONVILLE, AR - In a bold move intended to curb the thousands of deaths from vehicles each and every day, Walmart has decided to stop selling auto parts, sources confirmed Tuesday. According to shocking reports, people have purchased car parts at Walmart and then those cars have been involved in accidents, proving a direct correlation between selling auto parts and causing deaths. ""We can no longer be complicit in an industry that kills over 3,000 people a day,"" said a spokesperson for Walmart.

Government Accidentally Shuts Itself Down With Ban On Non-Essential Businesses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congress has asked all non-essential businesses to limit their hours or close entirely for an undetermined amount of time. But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. ""Oops,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""We meant non-essential private businesses. Of course, the government is always essential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse."" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she would have caught the mistake but had passed the ban in a hurry, saying, ""We had to pass the ban to see what it did.""",The Babylon Bee,2020-03-26,politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/government-accidentally-shuts-itself-down-with-ban-on-non-essential-businesses

From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. ""The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,"" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. ""At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!"" ""Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,"" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. ""If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!"" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like ""love has no age"" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. ""I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,"" Allan says. ""We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?"" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.",The Babylon Bee,2020-08-21,world,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/hollywood-rushes-to-make-pedophilia-acceptable-before-theyre-outed-by-ghislaine-maxwell

But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I’m not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences.

Biden Carried Away By Ants,"WASHINGTON—In a shocking breach of White House security, President Joe Biden was reportedly carried away by ants Friday. According to witnesses, the 81-year-old commander-in-chief remained quite calm during his apparent abduction by the insects, showing no signs of resistance as the swarm of approximately 2,500 black carpenter ants hoisted him over their bodies using their powerful mandibles and began marching slowly but steadily toward the White House Rose Garden. Secret Service officials confirmed that snipers stationed on the  roof of the executive mansion fired upon the swarm to no avail, reportedly because the ants’ 6-millimeter-long bodies were simply too small to target.

Perdue Announces Initiative To Even The Playing Field By Giving Chickens Guns,"SALISBURY, MD—Emphasizing that it was an integral part of the company’s mission to raise humanely sourced meat, poultry processing giant Perdue Farms announced a new initiative Tuesday to even the playing field by giving guns to chickens. “At Perdue, we always strive  to ensure animals are treated with dignity and respect, and today we expand upon that commitment by handing each bird a loaded pistol and allowing them a fair chance to escape,” said Perdue spokesperson Jamie Walton, describing a new policy under which each chicken would be issued a weapon with a single round in the chamber and given an opportunity to kill their captor with a well-placed bullet before they could be taken to slaughter. “They should get one clean shot. That’s just good sportsmanship. So from now on, every chicken in our Perdue facilities will have free and easy access to firearms. We may lose some staff to gunshot wounds, but everyone involved—human or fowl—will have an opportunity to defend themselves. It’s only right.” At press time, sources confirmed a shift in the balance of power at several Perdue processing plants had resulted in thousands of employees being slaughter with assembly-line efficiency.",The Onion,2024-05-14T15:40:00+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/perdue-announces-initiative-to-even-the-playing-field-b-1851423157/

Despite what the virtue-signaling, left-wing fanatics are espousing on CNN, this requirement is actually quite fair and attainable.

We’ll do our best to reattach the fingers that weren’t swallowed, but that isn’t going to prevent these patients from chewing them off again the next time they eat a gyro or cheesesteak.” At press time, saying they really needed something to wash down their sandwich with, several of the patients reportedly failed to  realize they were drinking the blood from their wounded hand.",The Onion,2024-05-24T10:00:00+00:00,local,Satire,https://theonion.com/everyone-in-er-bit-off-finger-while-holding-sandwich-1851488798/

It can’t be her doctrine they’re drawn to, because that is not particularly inspiring either.

No one could  have told me? No one? Fuck all of you. Seriously.

USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction “DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian” underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it.

NASA Warns Space Hawk Has Swooped In And Picked Up Earth For Nest,"WASHINGTON—Sounding the alarm that a cosmic bird of prey had clamped its talons onto the planet, NASA warned Thursday that a space hawk had swooped in and picked up the Earth for its nest of hungry space chicks. “We are on high alert after our satellite imaging confirmed that a quite sizable space hawk has in fact descended on Earth and carried it off with the intention of feeding our planet to its interstellar hatchlings,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson, who explained that the space hawk had used its keen extrasolar vision to pinpoint Earth’s blue seas from hundreds of light-years away, allowing the cosmic raptor to pluck our rocky planet right from its orbit. “Given the evidence we’ve obtained from observing distant exoplanets, the space hawk will first tear apart  the Earth and give bite-sized pieces of our home world to its young.

But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed  he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I’ve always wanted to do that.” At press time, Thomas called for a short recess to give the matter more thought, as whichever choice he made could have dire consequences for decades of his luxury vacations.",The Onion,2024-07-01T11:00:00+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/clarence-thomas-torn-over-case-where-both-sides-offer-c-1851566812/

She was only 59 yesterday,” the visibly distraught DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after the party’s new presumptive nominee began to ask him who he was and then trailed off, her cloudy eyes glossing over beneath a wisp of stark-white hair and her skin now wrinkled and liver-spotted. “She’s been rambling about all kinds of nonsense, and she keeps calling everyone “buster.” No, Madam Vice President, I’m not your stepson, and I’m not here to take you back to California. Goddammit, she’s too far gone to even formulate a coherent argument for abortion rights. Someone better call [California Gov.

Congress Bans Roofs,"WASHINGTON—In response to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Congress moved quickly to pass legislation Monday that bans the civilian use of roofs. “As our country continues to reel from this horrific event, we in Congress have taken action by enacting a nationwide ban on all roofs, roof terraces, and balconies,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining that the would-be assassin, who shot at and nearly killed Trump from atop a building 430 feet away, highlighted just how lax U.S. laws had been in addressing the threat of widespread roof access. “As we saw on Saturday, the risks of Americans having roofs is far too great to continue allowing our homes, schools, and other buildings to be covered in any way. In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.” Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building’s windows.",The Onion,2024-07-15T22:00:00+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/congress-bans-roofs-1851592883/

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.” At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.",The Onion,2024-08-05T10:15:00+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/environmentalists-warn-u-s-running-out-of-small-wooded-1851609190/

It’s stressful, though, because a single mistake in the blocking of a scene can put you in the hospital.

Scarecrow Has Double Ds,"AFTON, WI—Remarking on the hay-stuffed decoy’s surprisingly shapely form, passersby reported Friday that a scarecrow in a local cornfield boasted double-D breasts. “Damn, she’s got hay in all the right places, don’t she?” area man Jim Bickford said to a group of visibly dumbstruck bystanders who either leered and catcalled or stood with jaws agape as they contemplated the ample, overstuffed bust straining against the straw mannequin’s faded, stretched-out blouse. “Them buttons is fixin’ to pop right off! Man, I wouldn’t mind getting my hands around those knotted nests of brittle sticks and hay. Her burlap face ain’t too bad, either.” At press time there were multiple injuries reported among local men who scratched their faces on stray twigs and straw while attempting to motorboat the scarecrow.",The Onion,2024-09-20T12:00:00+00:00,local,Satire,https://theonion.com/scarecrow-has-double-ds/
‘The Onion’ Officially Endorses Joe Biden For President,"Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup.

Texas Sex Ed Class Teaches Boys How To Cheat On Pregnant Wife,"RICHARDSON, TX—In an effort to help his students one day navigate the harsh realities of an adult relationship, local sex ed teacher Robert Emerson reportedly spent class Wednesday teaching male students how to cheat on their pregnant wives. “Over the 9 months a woman carries a child, her body will change a lot, making it all the more necessary for you to have a hot young slam piece to bang on the side,” Emerson said before telling the room full of seventh-grade boys that it was perfectly natural for a man whose wife is pregnant to want to send flirty messages to beautiful women on social media, give his number to a hot young waitress, or hit on his wife’s attractive younger sister. “At 3 months, you’ll want to keep things casual and mostly send sexually explicit photos to your ‘lady friend.’ Then, by 6 months, you’ll likely have escalated to meeting up on weeknights at a local motel. By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.",The Onion,2024-10-02T15:06:11+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/texas-sex-ed-class-teaches-boys-how-to-cheat-on-pregnant-wife/

North Carolina Family Informed Their Insurance Policy Voided Once House Gets Wet,"ASHEVILLE, NC—Saying he wished there was more he could do to help as he pointed out a clause that showed he didn’t have to, a representative from an insurance company explained to local residents Stan and Loretta Coleman on Thursday that their policy was voided the moment their house got wet. “Unfortunately, the coverage you paid for doesn’t extend to any situation where there is water in, on, or around your home,” said Pat Treacy, a claims adjuster at Countrywide Mutual Insurance who informed the Colemans that their policy had actually been voided the moment they first filled their bathtub or ran water from their sinks. “It’s industry standard, I’m afraid. Houses just aren’t meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability. If it’s possible to prove the house remained dry during the storm, and it just sort of fell down on its own, then maybe a case could be made for approving your claim.” Treacy went on to wish the Coleman family well and said he would keep an eye out for them on GoFundMe.",The Onion,2024-10-03T20:39:53+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/north-carolina-family-informed-their-insurance-policy-voided-once-house-gets-wet/
Grandma Who Survived Great Depression Casually Drops That She Once Killed Man For Mayonnaise,"LOUISVILLE, KY—In a wide-ranging conversation about the hardships and difficult choices her family had faced during the Great Depression, local grandmother Mary Sipple casually mentioned Tuesday that in August 1937 she took the life of a man who refused to give up a jar of mayonnaise. “She just crushed his skull with a rock and said a prayer while he bled out,” said Sipple’s granddaughter Sarah Green, explaining that her grandmother had managed to make the mayonnaise last until spring, right around the time the dead man’s body—which she had carefully weighed down and dumped into the Ohio River—washed up in the next county. “Grandma told me she was tired of having nothing to put between two slices of bread. So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann’s, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.” At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history.",The Onion,2024-10-08T19:41:24+00:00,local,Satire,https://theonion.com/grandma-who-survived-great-depression-casually-drops-that-she-once-killed-man-for-mayonnaise/
Piss-Soaked Tucker Carlson Claims Demon Urinated On Him While He Slept,"BRYANT POND, ME—Describing the moment as a “transformative experience” that inspired him to embrace God and read the Bible, a piss-soaked Tucker Carlson claimed Friday that a demon had urinated on him while he was sleeping. “One moment I was asleep in bed, and the next, my boxers were absolutely soaked with what could only be the urine of an evil spirit,” said the former Fox News host, who added that while he did not previously consider himself a religious person, everything changed when he woke up to a rush of hot liquid covering his groin. “Lying there, I felt this terrible pressure in my bladder, almost as if a demon was sitting on it. Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.” At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.",The Onion,2024-11-01T17:41:12+00:00,news,Satire,https://theonion.com/piss-soaked-tucker-carlson-claims-demon-urinated-on-him-while-he-slept/
Trump Calls Harris To Congratulate Himself On Winning,"PALM BEACH, FL—In a five-minute phone call that both campaigns described as largely cordial, President-elect Donald Trump reportedly called Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday morning to congratulate himself on winning. “Madame Vice President, I want to be the first to congratulate myself on running one heck of a campaign, and to let you know I’m doing everything in my power to ensure the Trump administration has a smooth transition to the White House,” said Trump, telling an entirely silent Harris that it had been the honor of his life to have been in this race with himself, and extending his genuine gratitude for everything he had done to keep the race civil, even at its most heated. “I’ll tell you what, despite everything—I know it’s been a hard-fought race—but I’ve really always secretly admired myself.

"Man Forgetting Difference Between Meteoroid, Meteorite Struggles To Describe What Just Killed His Dog","TORONTO—Though he tried hard to recall what he had learned about space rocks back in middle school, local man Jason Nieto reportedly forgot the difference between meteoroids and meteorites Thursday, struggling to describe what had just killed his dog. “God, I always forgot which one is the kind that actually hits the ground, if that’s even the difference, so I’m not sure what just crushed Churro,” said Nieto, explaining that the meteorite or meteoroid—or maybe asteroid, if that was a category including all of them—came streaking out of the clouds while he was walking his Pomeranian in the park. “If it hadn’t left a crater where Churro was and had just burned up in the atmosphere, then that’s a meteoroid, right? One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can’t remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there’s also just a ‘meteor’ too, isn’t there?

Every Movement In Man’s Burrito-Eating Technique Informed By Past Burrito Tragedies,"GLENDALE, CA—Rotating the tortilla-wrapped meal to consume the Mexican food in even levels, eyewitnesses reported Thursday that every movement in local man Eddy Azarian’s burrito-eating technique has been informed by past burrito tragedies. “You can see how he massages the outside to get an a well-balanced distribution of ingredients as he goes, so you know that’s a man who has lost some carne asada to a floor before,” said friend Mike Fuentes, who noted the concentration on Azarian’s face as he rolled down the foil to form an even and tactile seam out of biting range. “Just look at that grip, perfectly spaced and easy to shift on the fly. And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He’s seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn’t want to experience one again.” At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.",The Onion,2024-11-21T13:00:00+00:00,local,Satire,https://theonion.com/every-movement-in-mans-burrito-eating-technique-informed-by-past-burrito-tragedies/
