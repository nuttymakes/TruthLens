Rare Good News: 80% Of Germans Not Fascists,"INITIAL EXIT polls from German media indicate only 1 in 5 German voters think a Fourth Reich is a really good idea, WWN understands. The far-right AfD, a party so extreme they even give France's Marine le Pen the ick, surged in the federal election polls but only garnered 20% of first preference votes meaning it is likely CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader Friedrich Merz will be the next chancellor if he can form a coalition in part with Olaf Scholz's SPD party. ""What a minor glimmer of positivity in this shit-infested world that is hellbent on eating itself,"" reacted many to the relatively good news emanating from Germany that a party supported by Elon Musk and which considers Hitler to have been a 'communist' has only doubled it's vote. It is not clear when AfD leader Alice Weidel will allege immigrant criminals with multiple identities illegally voted for the CDU/CSU, but it is expected sooner rather than later and will be warmly received by those who respond to the AfD's 'not everyone in the SS was a criminal' messaging. ""We couldn't have done this without Trump surrendering to Putin, thank you so much for scaring the shit out of voters,"" confirmed Merz in his victory speech. Elsewhere, noticing the election had an 84% turnout, perplexed Irish people began searching on Google to confirm voting in Germany is probably mandatory and comes with the threat of the death penalty if you fail to cast your ballot.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 24, 2025",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/24/rare-good-news-80-of-germans-not-fascists/
"IDF Condemn Vile Hamas Ceremony, Point Out They’ve Been Very Respectful Of 46,000 Palestinians They’ve Murdered","THE PARADING of the coffins of dead Israeli children by Hamas amid scenes of cheering has been met with near universal disdain and condemnation. Reacting to the events the IDF issued a number of statements, making the distinction between their just and moral actions in combat compared to the barbarism unique to Hamas, Lords of the Desert and Palestinian Mujahideen Movement terrorists. ""We're not animals like them. At least when IDF soldiers literally raped a Palestinian detainee to death in Sde Teiman we had the good grace and decency not to film and broadcast it,"" confirmed the IDF, an army which is also credited with making Gaza home to the most child amputees per capita in the world. In the wake of Hamas's macabre ceremony those advocating for a permanent end to the killing of Palestinian civilians reportedly feel 'pretty silly' in thinking the IDF is also wrong in committing an endless parade of war crimes. ""Of the over 46,000 Palestinians we've killed, can you recall any celebrations? Or any sordid visual metaphors like we've seen with Hamas, that show how corroded the soul and humanity of our enemy is?"" asked the spokesperson for an army that invites people to sign the side of missiles before they are sent to murder innocent civilians. The actions of Hamas have led the Israeli government to delay the release of over 600 Palestinians, held without charge, who won't be referred to as hostages. ""We have recently successfully kicked 40,000 people out of their homes in the West Bank, an area we are illegally occupying, and we will not permit any of them to return, but do we stage an unsightly and unedifying celebration over it? No,"" confirmed the IDF, during a media briefing in one of the West Bank homes they have taken over, draped in Israeli flags and posed for photos with Benjamin Netanyahu in.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 24, 2025",Category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/24/idf-condemn-vile-hamas-ceremony-point-out-theyve-been-very-respectful-of-46000-palestinians-theyve-murdered/
Irish Public Asked Why It Doesn’t Reach Orgasm At The Thought Of Buying Bombs & Sending Soldiers To War,"DESPITE A growing sentiment amongst Irish politicians, Lockheed Martin and some sections of the Irish media, the overwhelming majority of the Irish public remain frustratingly resolute in their support for Ireland's neutrality. ""You know you should see a doctor about that because it's not normal to think Ireland being neutral is a good thing, I make a mess in my pants the second I hear someone say 'missile defence system',"" shared one dissenting voice from the arms industry, who said the security of his annual bonuses were at stake. Tánaiste Simon Harris recently stated Ireland should aim to double its spending on defence which would be broadly welcomed by a population who believe the Defence Forces to be under-resourced, however, when you factor in it would be people like Simon Harris in charge of spending that money support for such measures hovers at around 0%. ""We can be neutral but also have the ability to protect our own skies and seas,"" suggested one idiot member of the idiot public. Despite it being explained over and over again that big grown up nations should have the capability to blow up other big grown up nations, the Irish public remains unconvinced. ""Don't you understand how much money I'll make consulting with firms and facilitating defence spending deals,"" urged one impartial arms dealer intermediary penning a column in a national newspaper. ""I honestly don't know how someone can scroll social media and see all the mangled and dismembered corpses torn asunder by war and think 'I don't want to be part of that', it's juvenile in the extreme. Think of the security being in NATO would bring, well, sure the US threatens fellow members Canada and Denmark with stealing its territory but, but, c'mon we could all ring into Joe Duffy and demand Dublin youths are sent to the front lines,"" they concluded.

Trump Marks Third Anniversary Of Ukrainian Army Marching On Moscow In Unprovoked Act Of Aggression,"A SOLEMN US president Donald Trump laid a wreath in honour of all the innocent Russian civilians killed in the wicked invasion perpetrated by Ukraine three years ago as it attempted an unprovoked annexation of Russia. ""Unprovoked like you've never seen before,"" explained Trump to reporters as he said there was a special place in hell for dictators he makes up in his head such as Volodymyr Zelensky, and a nice place in heaven for actual dictators he personally fawns over including Vladimir Putin. ""Who invades likes that? Peace-loving politicians in Moscow were left with no choice,"" added Trump. Trump also confirmed Putin relayed his immense concern that any day now Moldova and Georgia could launch an unprovoked attack on Russia too, leaving the Russian leader no choice but to defend his people. ""It's a beautiful country, they have these women in Russia when you open them up they have a smaller woman inside them, but did Ukraine care? No, Zelensky carried out something called a 'three day special military operation' but here we are three years later, which as you know, is more days than three"". Trump also criticised Zelensky for attempting to extort the US by refusing to agree to giving his administration $500 billion in natural resources in exchange for nothing. ""And get this guy, he says he's willing to resign his position and step aside if I come up with an actual peace deal that isn't just me stealing the resources of his country and handing Russia land.

"500,000 Liverpudlians Line Streets For Premier League Trophy Parade","TRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS remain in place across Liverpool city centre today as the Liverpool FC Premier League trophy parade takes place with as many as 500,000 of the club's supporters expected to line the streets. ""It's not often you get to prematurely celebrate a title win in February,"" said one supporter who has been downing the celebratory cans of beer since half time arrived in his team's 2-0 humbling of Man City yesterday evening. ""This is the best day of my life, the missus gave birth this morning too to our son, Premier League Champions 2025. The name just felt right"". While it is not out of the ordinary for football supporters to allow themselves to dream a little and bask in the almost-certain glory that is awaiting them, Liverpool supporters have confirmed they intend to conduct themselves in a manner that suggests they've never heard the phrase 'jinxing it'. ""Yeah yeah, Premier League champions, whatever! That's yesterday's news three months from now. We need to be thinking about the next steps and what players to get in, because after winning Champion's League as well we'll have the pick of any player across Europe,"" confirmed another fan while begging Virgil Van Dijk to empty champagne on him from the top deck of the victory parade bus.

‘Undercover Boss’ Revival Sees Tim Cook Install Anti-Suicide Nets In Chinese Factory,"LAST BROADCAST in 2022, US reality TV show 'Undercover Boss' has snagged a huge name in business for its latest revival; Apple CEO Tim Cook. Leaked footage from the first episode seen by WWN shows the Apple head honcho travel to Foxconn factory in China to secretly observe Apple's supply chain firsthand ahead of the iPhone 16e launch. ""It really humbled Tim, he said his favourite part was the people, and the installing of the anti-suicide nets at the factories that prevents workers from jumping out the windows. 'This is real, god-honest work' he said,"" remarked one Apple source. ""He didn't feel like a high-flying CEO, he just felt like one of the guys, he was treated like a peer,"" said the source, of treatment which meant he too had his apartment searched and was beaten up after coming under suspicion of taken a prototype home with him. The hallmark of 'Undercover Boss' is when the chosen boss often experiences ideology-shifting revelations having now experienced what his workers do on a day-to-day basis, and as a result institutes huge changes. And Cook was no different. In a moving scene Cook tells one supply chain worker that it his dream one day to have AI robots throwing themselves off buildings instead of employees.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 21, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/21/undercover-boss-revival-sees-tim-cook-install-anti-suicide-nets-in-chinese-factory/
Suspicions Raised As Local Boyfriend Denies All Knowledge Of Sydney Sweeney,"WHILE local woman Ciara Fagan would have laughed off boyfriend of two years Simon Skelly waxing lyrical about Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney's ample chest, things took a turn for the paranoid after Skelly chose to deny all knowledge of the woman when her name was brought up. ""Hmmm no, I'm searching my brain here but no, not heard of her. She's a musician is it?"" offered Skelly as Fagan, scrolling through the Netflix home menu, had remarked 'ugh, what a babe' upon seeing the Euphoria and Anyone But You star. With the seemingly hastily cobbled together words, advising that he is unaware of her existence, Skelly has merely sparked Fagan's suspicions and placed himself in peril. ""Great, now I think you're just tugging your rope to her every chance you get,"" Fagan said, implying Skelly's cross-my-heart contention that he has never heard of the pin-up lusted after by the internet is certifiable 'bullshit'. ""No, no, this isn't right at all Simon. You're getting weird with it. I know it, why couldn't you just say you'd smother me with a pillow if it meant you got to be smothered by her pillows like a normal guy would. Simon, what the fuck?"" insisted Fagan, who had no idea there was this sinister secret-holding component to her boyfriend. Fagan insisted that it is perfectly normal to admit to finding famous people, regarded as among the most beautiful in the world, attractive but to flat out pretend you've never heard of them is disturbing. ""Oh, so you're saying she's like a sex symbol or something? Right, right, interesting.

"Is Parenting A Private Matter Or Jesus, Jane Has No Control Over Her Little Tearaways At All At All?","'THERE BUT for the grace of God go I'. A mantra that serves so many well who have the foresight to accept their own parenting journey has been filled with trying days when despite their best efforts they fell well short of their own standards. Raising a family is not easy, all parents know this and would hate for someone to judge them on their worst day in the job. So, baring all this in mind, local residents in Tramore have come together to intensely malign Jane McHacklin's 'parenting', if that's what you could call it. ""They're always swinging out of her, and the eldest fella is already off the rails. D'ya ever see him when she's walking to the shop, he's forever running across and back on the roads,"" observed one local gossip, keen to judge everyone but themselves. ""The screams out of the one in the pram. Christ. Does she not know there's people watching. She's no idea how to discipline them,"" added another willing participant. ""Banging sticks against people's wall the middle fella was the other day and she didn't say a thing. Zane, what sort of name is Zane?"" pointed out a neighbour of McHacklin's. ""I wouldn't mind but her own parents were lovely people. The mother kept the house awful tidy. But have you caught a glimpse of her hallway when the door's open? There's war zones in better order. How do the kids stand a chance going forward?"" concluded one neighbour, pondering if a call into social services would cheer her up.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 21, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/21/is-parenting-a-private-matter-or-jesus-jane-has-no-control-over-her-little-tearaways-at-all-at-all/
Trump Diverts Ukrainian Military Aid To Russia,"JUST A DAY after labeling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator, US president Donald Trump has announced the redirecting of all ongoing military aid Ukraine is in receipt of, diverting it to Russia instead. ""Our military is spending $44 trillion a day on condoms for Zelensky, who as we all know, is America's greatest enemy. I say put that money into the trusted hands of a real friend, Vladimir Putin"" announced Trump in an all-caps post on social media, as all US policy is formally announced these days. With the Russian ruble halved in value in a decade, interest rates at 21%, electricity cost up 250%, $600bn of their assets held abroad frozen and 40% of all government spending going on the war, many see Putin's recent efforts at securing a peace deal with the US as a last ditch attempt to avert economic disaster in Russia. All the more reason the injection of military aid has been defended by Russian bot accounts with American flags in their X profiles; calling the move a sober, common sense move that brings an end to the madness of DEI. ""It brings me to tears when you see Russian prisons emptied out and those men sent to die on the front lines, we could be giving Russia HAWK defence systems and munitions, to push back this unjust invasion by Ukraine, which as you know, started the war"" said Trump, outlining his rationale for the latest move. ""Everybody is saying it; Ukraine is Marv and Harry AKA the Wet Bandits from Home Alone, I preferred the sequel, and Putin is the resourceful and adorable Macaulay Culkin who using only his wits and tricks defends his home, a real underdog story"" continued Trump with no sign of anyone in his administration willing to correct him.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 20, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/20/trump-diverts-ukrainian-military-aid-to-russia/
New Champion’s League Format SLAMMED For Including Low Quality Minnows Like Man City,"UEFA has been on the receiving end of fans ire after the knockout playoff round of the new and expanded Champion's League format featured a number of foregone conclusions such as Real Madrid's routine 6-3 agg victory over Manchester City. ""Why are they letting these random teams who can't compete in the competition? It devalues the Champion's League,"" said one fan on social media. The revamped format was billed as creating more high stakes fixtures, however fans have cited the existence of such an obvious 'dead rubber' as proof the new format is dead on arrival. ""We were promised more exciting games but the likes of Brest and this Manleicester City getting thumped, it's not worth watching until the semis,"" confirmed another football fan. Despite some football boffins insisting the inclusion of lesser teams with inferior income gives them a chance to compete and grow, others aren't convinced. ""Great, another stats-padding game for Mbappé but playing against inferior opposition with a defence made of cardboard doesn't make you the goat. Keep them in the Conference League where they belong"" offered one Champion's League hater. ""Look it's nice they got that consolation goal, their fans will never forget it, they'll make flags with the goal on it. But if this competition wants to claim with a straight face it's the elite of the elite, they need to restrict access for a team like this,"" added another fan of City, 4-1 losers to Sporting Lisbon earlier in the league round.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 20, 2025",Football,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/20/new-champions-league-format-slammed-for-including-low-quality-minnows-like-man-city/
"“Hey, You’re Making It Way Too Fucking Obvious” Putin Warns Trump","WHILE everything Vladimir Putin pinned up on his 2025 vision board in his Kremlin office may be coming true, the Russian leader still felt the need to chastise his partner in crime, Donald Trump, for perhaps making things a bit 'too obvious'. ""Comrade, c'mon, calling Zelensky dictator when I'm guy who is first result image when look up 'modern dictators' on Google? Tone it down,"" Putin instructed in a text to Trump. Noted war criminal and instigator of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had felt holding peaces talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine without involving Ukraine risked uncovering the very subtle effort he had made to make Trump his pawn, but now the cat was all but out of the bag. ""Yes we want you strong arm and abandon Ukraine but when you directly copy paste Kremlin propaganda notes into your social media posts with made up numbers, even your idiot supporters get suspicious,"" Putin added. Many political commentators have been shocked by Trump's outburst aimed at Zelensky after the Ukraine leader said the US president was living in a 'disinformation bubble', however, for others it is no great shock a serial sex offender would accuse a victim of being the real perpetrator. Putin's inner circle have once again publicly denied having any kompromat on Trump insisting, rather convincingly, that 'he is really just that stupid'.

‘Cultural Appropriation’: Samoan Tribesman Criticised For Getting Irish Harp Tattoo,"INSENSITIVE, IGNORANT or at best a little misguided, or so say Irish people who have finally had enough of Samoan, Maori and Polynesian people getting an Irish harp tattoo like it's a fad rather than a sacred emblem belonging to a proud and unique culture. ""It's cringe and if you take even a teeny step back you can see why having a great big shamrock or harp on your arm is ridiculous,"" begged one Irish person seeking an end to the misappropriation of her culture after online newspapers reported on a Samoan being on the receiving end of criticism for getting an Irish tattoo. While some argue it is merely a harmless exchange of cultures and a compliment, the scourge of harps tattoos emblazoned on the arms of people who have zero ancestral links to Ireland continues to infuriate those protective of our sanctified heritage. ""Cunts never even been to Ireland, couldn't find it on a map. Show me one Irish lad walking around with a tribal tattoo from their neck of the woods, you can't,"" said one Irish person catching sight of a harp tattoo on a Polynesian man in New Zealand on TikTok.

Why Ireland Should Embrace Climate Change,"THE WORLD is more than familiar with the supposed negative impacts of impending climate change, but little space is given in these conversations for exploring the near endless opportunities, advantages and positives. Consulting several experts Waterford Whispers News has compiled a number of reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective: Midlands residents won't have to travel as far to the nearest beach as rising sea levels engulf coastal counties. More jobs created from having to clean up after natural disasters. The chance that Britain could disappear first makes it worth it alone. Pensioners could die from intense heat rather than from cold winters. We will experience better sunnier weather during the brief interlude from bitter snow storms or rain floods. We'll get to grow our own wine, wipe the smug grins off the French's faces. The more we burn, the more it turns to tan, the healthier we look. Less cunt bees stinging you. More extinct animals makes a family trip to the zoo even more precious. You get to tell your skeptic father-in-law 'told you so' as you arrive in paddle boat to help him find love ones drowned in flood water.

"Sex Worker In Riyadh With Hint Of Russian Accent Probably Nothing To Worry About, Thinks Trump Official","TAKING A WELL earned break from carving up Ukraine for the benefit of his boss and his boss's boss, one Trump administration official has dipped out of peace talks in Riyadh to catch up with a sex worker who organically began flirting with him in the lobby of his hotel this morning.

Musk & Putin Apply For Joint Custody Of Donald Trump,"A WASHINGTON judge has praised the two people at the centre of a custody battle after they defied the stereotypical argumentative exchanges normally seen in his court, instead amicably agreeing to share joint-custody of an orphan, Donald Trump. ""What impressed me most about the mature approach of both you men is that you had been in regular phone contact with one another prior to November 2024, Donald here was always your priority and at the forefront of your minds,"" judge Carlos Garcia told the court. ""I'm yet more impressed by this empathetic approach, as the person you seek to have in your care and control is at first glance, as cruel and unlovable as he is stupid and naive, but that's kids for you, I suppose,"" chuckled judge Garcia. The judge praised one of the parties, Vladimir Putin for undertaking as many as seven calls to Donald Trump before November 2024, believed to be attempts at reassuring him he wouldn't alone and he was loved. ""You could have bitterly argued over who was his favourite, but instead you both saw that your separate goals of stripping the last of the copper wiring out of US government departments, and convincing Donald Ukraine don't need to be involved in talks to end the war in Ukraine could be achieved as part of this unconventional blended family,"" added the judge. Mindful that giving evidence at custody battles can be intimidating for children, never mind for dim-witted pawns who have no idea they are being used, the judge allowed Trump to take the stand while repeatedly drawing his signature on paper in big writing.

""Maybe if I did the piano act again today as president wearing this stupid khaki t-shirt they make me wear, then everyone might actually listen to me?"" he pondered to himself, cracking a rare chuckle, imagining the uproar such a performance would cause mid-NATO conference while he asked for more military aid.

Most Unromantic Man In Ireland Saved By Last Minute Panic Shop In ALDI,"WITH VALENTINE'S Day appearing like an apparition out of nowhere with no warning and zero promotion, Gavin McNeffin, widely regarded as Ireland's most unromantic man, has been saved by a panic shop in ALDI.

Time Saved On Not Having To Untangle Earphones Pales In Comparison To Time Lost Looking For Dropped Air Pod,"PRODUCT engineers at leading electronic manufacturers have apologised en masse and called for reconciliation efforts after admitting that while they have ended the scourge of untangling headphone cables they have inadvertently created a bigger problem, chiefly endless hours lost searching for dropped or misplaced wireless ear buds. ""We tried to play God and we've been punished,"" product designers admitted, hanging their heads in shame. Their apology, delivered over a public Zoom call was briefly delayed as one designer had misplaced their wireless ear phones, last seen on a kitchen counter hours previous. Introduced by Japanese firm Onkyo and popularised by Apple the wireless earbuds were presented to people as a solution to the bitter frustration brought about by detangling of ear phone cables, the untethering of which cost the average person weeks of their life. ""The horrible dystopian present we created actually causes more lost hours as people can't just wrap their ear phone cables around the phones while still plugged in,"" said one product engineer, who nearly died from starvation after his wireless ear bud fell out while on a forest walk, leading him spends hours retracing his steps to no avail. While accessories like magnetic ear bud cases which stick to phones cases have been created, the public has pointed out they're 'not fucking paying for bullshit accessories, have you seen the price of wireless ear phones!?!' ""We thought we were clever, adding the 'find my air pods' feature but instead of helping people, it just led to them losing their sanity as they ripped up cushions from the very sofa the app said they were under only to find nothing there.

Insults To Use As Gaeilge In The Dáil That The Ceann Comhairle Won’t Understand,"A RARE and short lived moment in the Dáil during which a passage of civil and substantive debate nearly broke out was interrupted by Micheál Martin accused Mary Lou McDonald of 'telling lies' as Gaeilge. This most unparliamentary language, seen as a beyond-the-pale insult, prompted many to suggest it is at times like these having a Ceann Comhairle who actually spoke Irish could have come in handy. Go dtuitfeadh an tigh ort – that your house may fall on you. A completely useless insult outside of the Dáil as over 65% of 25 year olds are still living at home and have no hope of ever owning a home. The insult wouldn't hurt them at all but in the Dáil? Chances are whoever you lob the insult at has between 1 and 13 gaffs. Go marbhaí an diabhal tú – that the devil may kill you. Before the Ceann Comhairle has opened her Duo Lingo app or reached for a dictionary, you have delivered the sort of horrible mean-spirited insult that adds nothing to a debate, nor proffers any solution to ongoing crises. Perfect for the Dáil so. Ráitseach – a woman of loose morals. Gráiscín – a man of loose morals. You could be insulting any TD, one who failed to declare their property interests, one who wrote a character reference for a violent offender, one who has pledged their vote to a government who has already talked about more subsidies for developers and the end to rent pressure zones. No matter the target, the Ceann Comhairle won't understand. Sciútrachán – greedy, gluttonous person. Perfect for when lobbing insults at a TD whose only price for going into government with FF/FG was more expenses money or a cushy gig as Dáil's chief cat herder. Transna ort fhéin – go sideways on yourself AKA go fuck yourself. A sneaky variation of the 'Deputy Stagg' variety. Snaidhm bundúin ort – may your arse be knotted.

""Daddy, do the funny wave the black and white man you watch at home does,"" X insisted, his father now shushing him before reminding the 4-year-old that 'at home talk is only for at home'.

Drunk Politician Found On All Fours On O’Connell Street Reinstated To Fine Gael Party After Undeclared Rental Properties Found,"DESPITE voluntarily resigning from Fine Gael after an arrest for intoxication, senator Martin Conway has been subjected to begging letters from senior party figures after they heard a series of unfounded rumours. ""Obviously standards fell below what we expect in respect to the O'Connell Street drinking incident but then the esteem we hold him in soared above the Spire when someone heard something about rental properties not being on a register,"" said one Fine Gael insider. Conway, who resigned in the wake of doing something 7 in 10 Irish workers do every weekend, could sensationally return to Ireland's law and order-when-it-suits-us party. ""This is the kind of out of the box thinking we need and covet in Fine Gael,"" confirmed one party insider who admitted with the departures of Damien English and Josepha Madigan, the party had a 'not declaring property stuff' gap to fill. While the rumours were in fact unfounded in regards to the rental properties, Fine Gael have been asked to clarify what is and isn't permitted behaviour within their party. ""So you can assault someone in a drunken brawl? And then you can run in Louth for a Dáil seat? But if you drink too much and sober up in a garda station you're out on your ear?

Stoneybatter Stabbings: All You Need To Know From Man Who Knows Nothing,"DETAILS are still emerging in respect to the horrific stabbings perpetrated by a man in his late 20s, originally from South America, in Stoneybatter. However, keenly aware that the legacy media is full of lies and can never be trusted to say a true word, WWN has fired all correspondents and outsourced all reporting to Waterford resident and Telegram/X account holder, SunOfEire32: ""I can't imagine the horror, the panic and the terror felt by residents. No, seriously, I mean I'm so giddy with the thought that this could lead to more riots and Luas trams and asylum centres being burned out, I give precisely zero thought to the victims and the community at the centre of this. These things should be obvious but for emphasis; believe all random screenshots of tweets that were sent into WhatsApp groups in the minutes after news first broke. If it has 'forwarded many times' written on it, it has to be true. It's been a no-go area for years, and I know as someone who has never been there. And don't worry, yes, I'll be retweeting a load of Yanks with Irish flags talking about how Ireland is basically like downtown Hamas in Palestinia, but everyone is afraid to admit it. Why hasn't the person been named yet? Curious, isn't it? Suspicious even. And don't point out the fact that under Irish law, until a person is formally charged their identity isn't released, but we all know it's something to do with NGOs and George Soros. And that video from Ballymun of a lad with a knife, while it is a different incident, in a different location, involving an Irish person, just tell your brain it isn't and then believe what you want, which if you're like me, is fairly racist. The who, what, why, where, how and when of it isn't really the point. I'm just hoping to capitalise on the fact you get your news from social media and have the concentration skills of a fly, and that your brain will fail to distinguish between me, an idiot, and what I say and treat it with the same importance and priority as real information on the ground, from authorities and relevant experts.

New Law Will Force Gardaí To Immediately Release Skin Colour Of Crime Suspects To X,"IN A bid to save X users time speculating over whether a crime is worth high jacking for their own agendas, the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration Jim O'Callaghan has passed a bill forcing gardaí to reveal the skin colour and 'actual nationality' of crime suspects from Monday. The move was welcomed by various media sources who seem to focus on nothing else in the news. ""Jumping the gun and lying about details is fun but it's hard work so please help us out,"" a spokescunt for a collection of race-baiting reactionary social media accounts said, ""can the gardaí also let us know their genders or sexual orientation too so we can label them as paedophiles for the craic... actually their religion would also be great as that gets clicks and money from our readers who can't really afford it, but who feel obliged to because we don't like revealing the real source of our financial backing from abroad."" Defending the move, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris stated that allowing racists online to know the skin colour of a suspect will save the force a lot of time and will allow Gardaí to be more prepared for riots and looting. ""If we tell people on X the suspect is white and 'one of their our' then we know we can stand down, no matter what awful crime they have committed,"" Harris pointed out.

How To Break It To Your Dog That Kay Burley Has Retired,"DOG clairvoyant, broadcaster and canine emotion identifier Kay Burley has announced her retirement from Sky News after 36 years. While it may barely register with the average person, dog owners in the UK and beyond are beside themselves with anxiety over how to break the news to their pooches. ""I don't think it takes a newscaster with decades of experience to figure out what'll be in his eyes when I tell him... nuclear grade sadness,"" confirmed dog owner Tim Epping, searching for a way to broach the sensitive subject with Chunk, his 12-year-old bulldog. ""I wish Kay herself was here herself to coach me through tackling such a difficult subject but then I remember she relishes delivering bad news with the subtlety of a hammer to the face and a tactless tabloid desire to milk every last drop of sordid sensationalism from tragedy"".

""Take them for a walk to their favourite spot, give them lots of treats and then as your petting them, use something called empathy and do whatever the opposite of what Burley would do is, oh and definitely don't strangle a photographer,"" confirmed one dog expert.

""I know these roads so I'll keep doing 80 to 100 not 60!

In an effort to really make his point clear to the powers that be, Durnane has vowed to fill up his car with a full tank and spend the rest of the evening driving up and down boreens in his areas and observing the previous speed limits. ""No one tells me what I can and can't do,"" confirmed Durnane, whose car will get into a disagreement with a stone wall some time over the weekend.

Tusla Take Child Into Custody After Parents Dress Child In Man United Jersey,"THE CHILD and family agency Tusla has been praised for taking a child into custody who was forced to wear a Manchester United jersey, WWN can exclusively reveal. ""You cannot deliberately set your child up to be the target of bullies, who would find such horrid attire irresistible to mock,"" explained one child psychologist, who said a 6-year-old child's treatment at the hands of his Dublin parents was one of the worst cases he has ever dealt with. The intervention by Tusla is seen as a somewhat cynical attempt to improve their reputation amongst the public, nevertheless the decision to take the child from their parents has been roundly praised. ""Now's not the time to bring up the failures of Tusla, praise should be given when something praiseworthy has been done,"" said one man in his early 20s who bares the scars of going through a similar ordeal in his own childhood.

“I Was Cloned In A Government Experiment” Michael Lowry Explains Existence Of ‘Michael Lowrey’,"IN AN ATTEMPT to explain why a man called 'Michael Lowrey' would sell a house to Michael Lowry's daughter Lorraine Lowry for €50,000 only for Michael Lowry to later purchase it from his daughter for €290,000, the independent TD has made an incredible admission. ""I was dropped from a helicopter at the Galway races in 1994 into a vat of liquified brown envelopes, I thankfully emerged safely from this toxic sludge but so too did a man called Michael Lowrey. My exact clone in every way,"" Michael Lowry said to the Dáil by way of explaining that technically he both is and isn't Michael Lowrey, the man who sold Lowry daughter a house at a below market value reduced price. Rumours of secretive Celtic Tiger era government experiments have been rife for years but this is the first on-the-record acknowledgement of hubristic forays into controversial scientific methods. ""We wanted to use Charles Haughey, but Charlie said no because there was a risk that he'd have to share money with his clone, so then we turned to convicted criminal Michael Lowry instead,"" said one scientist on the condition on anonymity. ""I'm bound to be known for creating this abomination, Michael Lowrey, but I did good experiments during the Tiger years; you think something as mad as Eddie Hobbs wasn't dreamed up in a lab?"" added the scientist, who refused to take credit for all pine kitchens or the panini. ""I'd wager this was in no way an attempt to conceal ownership of anything, nor was it a way for anyone to avoid having to pay Capital Gains Tax,"" offered one tax expert, who previously did the accounts for Anglo, the FAI and is available for budgeting work on the Children's Hospital. Elsewhere, widespread laughter greeted people suggesting the government will probably want to amend legislation removing a loophole which means TDs do not have to declare interests in properties they buy through companies even if they are, as is the case with Lowry, the sole shareholder of a company that buys property. UPDATE: Micheál Martin has welcomed the news of the existence of 'Michael Lowrey' as that means he has one more additional independent TD to prop up the government.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 28, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/28/i-was-cloned-in-a-government-experiment-michael-lowry-explains-existence-of-michael-lowrey/
It Breaks Landlord’s Heart To Know 69% Of 25-Year-Olds Are Living At Home When They Could Be Making Him Rich Instead,"A LEADING Irish landlord has bravely spoken out about the tragedy of the latest CSO research which revealed 69% of all 25-year-olds in Ireland are still living at home with their parents. ""Something has to be done that isn't reducing rent levels or house prices, I cried when I saw the 69% figure. We're robbing these young people of knowing what it's like to be robbed of their deposit by me,"" landlord Joe McAlinden said. McAlinden, who has an interest in 7 properties in Dublin and another interest in 17 properties he doesn't want the tax man to know about, suggested a number of solutions including getting the government to change mortgage lending rules so that 25-year-olds can borrow enough to afford to rent. ""By living at home, many miss out on those big life milestones that come with leaving home. I'm thinking – panicking about how expensive rent is and how it stops you from enjoying any aspect of life,"" offered McAlinden, who says unlike landlords who give his game a bad name he only raises rent by as little as 10% more than he is legally allowed do in a rent pressure zone. When pressed on the fact 1-in-8 25-year-olds contacted by the CSO for their research had chosen to emigrate, McAlinden was less bothered, citing the fact he has a share in a number of Dubai rentals.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 29, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/29/it-breaks-landlords-heart-to-know-69-of-25-year-olds-are-living-at-home-when-they-could-be-making-him-rich-instead/
McGregor Marks Bloody Sunday Anniversary By Paying Tribute To British Soldiers,"EXPANDING on his deleted rants on Twitter in which he urged Derry MMA fighter Paul Hughes to 'get that flag (tricolour) off you' and that he is a 'you little know-what-you-are cunt' from 'up there', court star and rapist Conor McGregor has further solidified his opinion of people 'up there' in the north of Ireland. Wearing a remembrance poppy he had left over from the last time he wore it, sources close to McGregor confirmed he marked the 53rd anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre today with the feeling that such atrocities are none of his business as people 'up there' are in no way Irish, and he is superior to them, and what the British government does with its British subjects is their business. ""I think people give this rapist an awful hard time. Like any proud Irish patriot, he wears the poppy and happily poses in pictures with Nigel Farage at Trump's inauguration,"" shared one person who believed McGregor likely connected with the 'warrior spirit' of the British army that saw it open fire on innocent people, killing 14 of them. While some would rush to criticise such expressions of support for the British army, others have pointed out some would find a kindred spirit in an empire which commits awful crimes, always denies wrongdoing and tries to bury the truth, often through intimidation and violence. ""When insulting Hughes on Twitter yesterday he said 'Up the real Irish fuck these vermin fucks' and frankly that's the sort of Irish president I'd vote for,"" offered the only remaining clinically braindead Irish McGregor supporter than isn't a social media bot account.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 30, 2025",Sports,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/30/mcgregor-marks-bloody-sunday-anniversary-by-paying-tribute-to-british-soldiers/

US Construction Firms Eyeing Up Gaza Like Prince Andrew In An Epstein Massage Parlour,"AS THE DUST temporarily settles after 14 months of relentless bombing from the IDF reducing Gaza to rubble, a conglomerate of America's leading construction firms can't help but rub their hands together in anticipation of the multi-billion dollar contracts. ""I'm like Prince Andrew with a semi in a secret Epstein massage parlour here,"" voiced one CEO, salivating at the amount of money to be made in the now sought after seaside real estate, hoping US US president Donald Trump follows through with his promise to 'clean out the whole thing'. ""We can put the expensive high rises along the coast and maybe just build some shacks for the former natives inland and out of sight until we price them all out of here in a few years with some good old-fashioned capitalism,"" suggested another planner, estimating the land will be Palestinian free by 2050, all going well.

IDF Sniper Trained On Survivors At Auschwitz Remembrance In Case They Attempt To Draw Parallels,"TO AVOID the unedifying spectacle of one of the few remaining living survivors of the Holocaust making remarks that incorrectly draw parallels between the Holocaust and any current ongoing situation, the IDF have stationed a number of snipers at the 80th anniversary commemorations marking the liberation of Auschwitz. ""We could think of no greater insult to the survivors of the holocaust,"" explained an IDF spokesperson, ""than the potentially lurid spectacle of a survivor suggesting people must learn from the horror of the Holocaust while invoking the name of a contemporary flashpoint, not that one springs to mind"". It has been suggested the prospect of such a commemoration, held to ensure the world never forgets and never lets something like this happen again, being sullied by someone imploring the world not to let something like this happen again is unthinkable and must be avoided. ""What they would be drawing parallels exactly? We cannot say. What specific modern nightmare could they possibly point to? We do not know, but nevertheless it would be unwise to suggest that in 2025 the mass murder and systemic and brutal treatment of people is wrong,"" added the IDF spokesperson from a rooftop adjacent to Auschwitz.

Wowing friends and family members with the announcement, Liam Power said he looks forward to not ever worrying about having to exert himself again stating the sense of relief has done him wonders. ""I'm like a new man,"" Power told WWN, lounging gracefully on his couch like an 19th French aristocrat waiting to have their portrait painted. ""The decision itself was surprisingly an easy one; do burpees for 15 mins or sit on my hole watching old episodes of Mask while tucking into my second double Starbar?"" Such was his success in accomplishing an early exercise retirement, Power has since launched a self-help program for middle-aged men who wish to follow in his lack of footsteps.

Record Numbers Turning Feral After Brief Loss Of Access To Internet,"WITH members of the Irish public reporting a loss in internet connection, there are fears that many have turned feral to such a severe level, they many never return to being functional members of society. Local authorities and repair teams seeking to survey the damage caused by Storm Eowyn and restore power have been hampered by the large number of feral internet-deprived people turning on them and in some cases acting out in a violent manner. ""I'll suck you off for a quick go of TikTok, I know you've got signal,"" one young man is reported as saying to emergency services as they attended the scene of an emergency, only to be descended upon by a horde of psychotic, internet-hungry citizens. It's clear the thin veneer of a functioning, cohesive society in Ireland is no match for the disintegration in civility mere seconds of disconnection from a source of constant entertainment and distraction can cause. ""It's been over 8 hours without access, what do you expect?"" said one horde member of the brief 15-minute ongoing interruption to their 4g phone connection. ""We urge those driven made by cravings for an endless stream of digestible videos to get creative, cut out some cardboard in the shape of a phone scream and get a housemate or loved one to be your YouTube and instagram,"" said one government energy response team member, moments before the arm holding their internet connected phone was hacked off by a TikTok addicted 13-year-old.

That's what I just said – it's not going to make much of a difference in Donegal as we've no transport here at all at all!"" Terence repeated, the joke now becoming less and less funny as the realisation that Donegal exists in public service purgatory where all infrastructure and amenities remain in limbo, forever clinging to the dream that the State might actually pay it attention in the event of a United Ireland leading genuine regional development.

Nation Urged To Put All Heavy Items They Own On Ground To Prevent Ireland Being Blown Closer To England,"IRISH RESIDENTS are being asked by Met Éireann to assess their preparedness for the oncoming storm Eówyn, with people urged to place all heavy items on the ground to aid in preventing Ireland shifting a single centimetre closer to England. ""The last thing anyone wants waking up tomorrow is to find we've been blown closer to that shower across the water,"" urged risk assessor at Met Éireann Dermot Cassin. The public is being asked to take items normally stored in presses, on shelves in the shed and in wardrobes and migrate them to floor to maximise the weight holding down Irish soil. ""That kettle bell you bought three Januarys ago that's gathered dust on a shelf in your shed could be what prevents us being close enough to England to see Charles hideous sausage hands through a pair of binoculars,"" added Cassin. Bringing the severity of the situation into context, Cassin urged that people even prioritise placing heavy household items on the ground before rushing out to buy a year's supply of slice pans. ""Although weighing down the country is your patriotic duty, we also understand that it's impossible to stop many of you from going for a drive at 2am, morning hike or swim to see if a red warning storm is really as bad as they say it is,"" concluded Cassin.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 23, 2025",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/23/nation-urged-to-put-all-heavy-items-they-own-on-ground-to-prevent-ireland-being-blown-closer-to-england/
Have You Been Regurgitating Food Into Your Child’s Mouth Wrong All This Time?,"NEW RESEARCH suggests a growing number of parents are chewing up food and then regurgitating it into their child's mouth in the incorrect way. ""People have suggested inventing food that comes in a paste or a liquidy form but the technology to make such things a reality are simply years away I'm afraid,"" confirmed one researcher working on this project, Carl Brunthar. As has been well documented, due to a lack of advancement in the scientific field of food composition and children's stubborn desire not to evolve beyond their current form, humans continue to provide their offspring with essential nutrients and sustenance in a similar manner to that of birds. ""But even in the age of Google and YouTube where parents can watch tutorials on regurgitating food straight from their stomachs into their child's mouths they're still getting it wrong"", added Brunthar. ""It doesn't help that human babies are useless either. A newborn foal? Galloping minutes after being birth? Lazy kids? Can't fecking walk for about a year and jaysus, they can't truly stand on their two feet until they're in their 20s"". Brunthar has cautioned parents against actually chewing and enjoying things like steak for themselves instead imploring them to swallow such things whole. The end result of this is that a fully in tact piece of food lasts longer against bacteria and stomach acid, so when a child starts crying or giving out you can simply vomit up a full meal into their mouth that retains much of its nutrients, original form and flavour. ""I feel like a right fool now,"" confirmed one new parent who had been munching to his heart's content and only using his pharynx to bring back up piles of mushy, blood-clotted food.

Local Man Breathlessly Warning Against Trump No Idea What’s Going On In Irish Politics,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man who hasn't paused to take a breath in the last 48 hours during impassioned rants about US president Donald Trump has little to no knowledge of all or any political goings on in Ireland, WWN can reveal. It will come as a surprise to 26-year-old Sean O'Neill that Ireland elects a new Taoiseach today when his US-heavy social media feeds are briefly interrupted with political news from Ireland. Devouring and disseminating every nugget of information emanating from the US, O'Neill has dominated pub conversations and work lunches with lengthy lectures. ""He interrupted me when I was saying how hard it is to get my autistic child supports in school by telling me all about the Trump crypto rug-pull and how something needs to be done,"" said one growing-impatient friend of O'Neill. Such is O'Neill's fixation on the goings on in America, he is knowledgeable on a number of legal challenges to Trump executive orders making their way through US courts but can't name his constituency's TDs. ""I'm slowly trying to make him aware he lives in Ireland. I tell him things like 'did you know Trump failed to enact 49 recommendations to improve electoral law' and when he begins his rant about why that's a disgrace I tell him 'actually that's something the government in Ireland did',"" explained O'Neill's girlfriend Sam Duane. ""Then there was 'Trump did a deal with a convicted criminal to get into power' but I told him it's Micheál Martin and Michael Lowry. He didn't like that bait and switch at all at all but you just have to hope some of it subconsciously seeps into his brain until one day he expends energy on politics here and how it effects us day to day,"" added Duane. It is believed O'Neill isn't alone in finding Irish politics, filled with headlines such as 'former Fine Gael politician arrested over human trafficking', 'Ex Sinn Féin leader ordered killing of mother of 10', 'Government refuses to pay back €12bn it robbed from people in nursing homes' and 'Private businesses enriched by State paying them billions to house refugees', rather boring and unimportant.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 22, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/22/local-man-breathlessly-warning-against-trump-no-idea-whats-going-on-in-irish-politics/

However, no pardon has proved as controversial as that given to the production team behind 2024 film sequel 'Joker: Folie à Deux', who are now protected from prosecutions relating to the crime of their movie. ""Wow, so I guess crime is legal now, huh,"" one angry man on the streets of Washington DC yesterday said, reacting to the gut wrenching news that Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips and Lady Gaga would never see the inside of a cell. While some argued that the pardon for the set designers and costume team were justified, others felt aggrieved by pardons they felt were making a mockery of the US justice system. ""I was tricked into seeing a musical, that's gay, and the people responsible shouldn't be out walking the streets, unforgivable,"" offered another person left dejected by the news.

Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through.

Colin Farrell Asks If Three Golden Globes Are Redeemable For One Oscar,"EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. ""Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?"" Farrell asked over the phone, the audience's applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen.

Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a 'snow day' due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day's work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building.

“I’m Too Old And Rich To Be Righteous Anymore” – Bono,"IRISH singer-songwriter and former activist Bono clasped his hands and prayed to whatever God he worships these days while receiving the US Presidential Medal of Freedom from outgoing president and Zionist Joe Biden, admitting that yes, he's too old and rich to be righteous anymore. Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their 'meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace'. ""Look, we'll forget about that last part there and just say it's for the first two,"" Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. ""We'll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we're finished. The seaside property there is to die for"". Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. ""There comes a time in an activists' life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,"" Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. ""I know people back home will not be happy, but they're just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh"".

Irish Couples Under Increasing Pressure To Have ‘Mini-moon’,"A NEW SURVEY of Irish couples reveals that many feel crushing pressure to go on a 'mini-moon' despite 'stupid fucking mini-moons' only coming to prominence in recent years.

5 Realistic New Year’s Resolutions,"EVERY YEAR thousands of Irish people set themselves unrealistic goals as so-called NEw Year's resolutions and fail miserably when it comes to achieving anything. Why set the bar at an unobtainable level when there are some real everyday improvements to be made and very achievable targets. Check out these realistic New Year's resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don't count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of 'getting dressed every day'. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don't set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don't even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 1, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/01/5-realistic-new-years-resolutions/
Seeing ‘Elder Millennials’ In News Headlines Like A Stab In The Heart,"MILLENNIALS have urged the media to choose their words more carefully after reports dozens of people born between in the 80s and 90s have suffered cataclysmic emotional breakdowns at seeing 'elder millennials' in headlines. ""You can't be elder anything if you are still part the fresh young generation that's just emerged and is defining culture. Fashion, music, art, film, we're the zeitgeist,"" falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. ""If you even so much as try and say 'oh, I wasn't born then so it was before my time' to me, I'll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn't 'classic TV',"" sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words 'elder millennials' often precede headlines such as 'still have f-all hope of affording a house'. ""Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We're the tech generation,"" offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window.

Nation’s Traffic At Standstill As Post-Christmas Re-turn Machine Queues Clog Roads,"TAILBACKS of 10 miles have been reported in some areas in Ireland today as people attempt to dispense with their post-Christmas cans of beer, in the first Christmas since the Re-turn recycling scheme was introduced. ""Authorities should have seen this coming, we should have quadrupled the number of machines,"" said one man from his car which he has been trapped in for 17 hours just outside the car park to his local Lidl such is the traffic. With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren't out of order, the country's main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey.

The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. ""I'm missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTÉ,"" said one driver, unaware the car they've been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago.

Local Woman Can’t Believe How Many Bullshit Made Up Christmas Traditions In-Laws Have,"THE PERSONABLE and polite exterior belonging to local woman Ciara Kinnane is at risk of shattering if she has to endure one more bullshit Christmas tradition observed by the her other half's family, the Mortons. ""Silly Sockless time, Silly Sockless time, who's going to win the last Roses chocolate,"" screeched Morton matriarch and mother-in-law to Kinanne, Carmel as the family inexplicably whipped off their socks and ran out the front door. ""D'you not play this before? I definitely told you about this one Ciara,"" Kinnane's partner Jack said, outlining how one member of the family who can survive out on the concrete drive way in front of the house in their bare feet the longest wins a solitary chocolate. ""But it's mild enough like and you're all adults. You can buy an infinite amount of chocolate for yourselves. In fact you just told me you vomited a little in your mouth there 'cos you're too full of chocolate,"" a so-fucking-done-with-this Kinnane said. At first glance, Kinnane could be labeled a Grinch of the highest order, but experts in spending festive period with the in-laws have pleaded for understanding. ""She's had to sit through something called 'Oopsy Daisy Gift' where you buy someone a gift you know they'll hate, and there's still the Christmas Eve watching of the Michael Keaton Batman movies 'as is tradition' to come, and the mulled wine and pineapple soup.

“How Come You & Your Dad Support Different Teams?” Innocently Asks Girlfriend About To Receive Crash Course In Chelsea’s Early 2000s Transformation,"UNAWARE she has set herself on a path towards receiving a dense-packed hours long lecture about early 2000s Premier League football, Emily O'Sullivan has queried why her boyfriend Sean Hughton supports a different team to his father. ""And you see Damien Duff is Irish and he played the same position as me, and they were drowning in money. And Jose was cool back then, not the cringe magnet he is now, but even before him Ranieri was like sound and Ferguson and his little parade of pricks were arrogant as anything,"" launched Hughton, not drawing breath as O'Sullivan identified her nearest emergency exits. Putting himself back on the defensive slightly 32-year-old Hughton made sure to mention how before his time mid-90s Chelsea were a joyously sophisticated blend of brawn and skill, counting Zola and Wise among their ranks, thus proving the 'we've got no history' chant is deeply ironic before having to explain the chant's origins what O'Sullivan said ""what's a chant?"". ""And sure dad would try and wedge me into a United shirt but I didn't want to be like the other lad in school who were all United fans. You following this?"" continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn't seem to have desired effect on O'Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely.

Investigation Launched To Discover Why Sofas No Longer Come With Arm Rest Covers,"IRISH homeowners are subject of a wide-ranging furniture study, believed to be the biggest of its kind, which is seeking to understand when the practice of having arm rest covers on sofas came to an end. ""You couldn't move from arm rest covers, couches had them, the 'dad chair' had them, the good room was just one big arm rest. Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?"" professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O'Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. ""Some suggest it's a 'notions' thing but isn't removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says 'my sofa is precious', it tells visitors 'I don't want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,"" added O'Neill, who believes there's a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn't count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers.

"Former Fine Gael Politician Charged With Human Trafficking & Possessing Sex Abuse Images, Some Media Half-Heartedly Reports","WITH FORMER Fine Gael councillor Bill Tormey accused of possessing child pornography images and helping to bring an illegal immigrant into the country, some media outlets have reacted with somewhere between 2 and 3% of the breathless coverage they normally reserve for such a bombshell news item. ""There is a case before the courts, this curtails what we can report but also I'm devastated this wasn't a Sinn Féin rep, 'cus it's now basically a non-story worthy of little to no further reporting"" confirmed one journalist, whose desire for fishing out crass details and doorstepping politicians is unusually absent.

""I may have demanded Sinn Féin answer all and any questions relating to the case of their once-staff member being a sex offender, but it would be downright tawdry journalism to ask Fine Gael to answer for an individual and their alleged actions.

""No, there's a clear difference; in the case of Sinn Féin you can extrapolate out an issue and ask, speculate and confirm it's proof of deficiencies and anti-democratic values which are unique to the party but if such alleged crimes relate to a Fine Gael member, that's mere coincidence and it would be churlish and unethical to draw conclusions about the party itself,"" confirmed another columnist readying a 'Expect The Opposition To Play Political With An Incredibly Sensitive Issue' article.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/former-fine-gael-politician-charged-with-human-trafficking-possessing-sex-abuse-images-some-media-half-heartedly-reports/

"Country That Stole Irish Passports For Use In Assassinations, Attacked Irish Peacekeepers Closes Embassy In Ireland Over Country’s Opposition To Genocide","SOMETIMES, brutal regimes with little regard for human rights go too far. This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. ""Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,"" confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland's decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. ""Take that Ireland!"" announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they've been punished. ""What have we ever done to Ireland?

‘Super Low Key’ Girls Xmas Meet Up Somehow Costs €427,"AN ANNUAL Xmas get together over a 'super low key' lunch among a group of friends is dangerously spiralling into a 'massive ball ache' thanks to the pricey organising habits and notions addiction of one Marie McGrath (32). ""I've Christmas with two kids to be paying for, Shauna and Michelle are saving for houses, how in the name of the baby Jesus is this costing this much?"" said Patricia Farley, in a separate WhatsApp group set up to bitch about McGrath. Running for over the past 7 years and always taking place over a brief lunch in Dublin during a workday given everyone's busy schedules over the Christmas, Type A McGrath has successfully strong-armed the group into buckling to her demands and a two-night stay in Galway. ""Galway doesn't really suit me,"" remarked Niamh Sullivan, the only one of the girls still living In Waterford, whose concerns were directly addressed by McGrath in the form of sending a link to €90 elf costumes everyone is now required to wear. A secret Santa with a budget of €150, a €60 bottomless brunch with a non-refundable deposit and staying in a 4-star hotel with a spa they won't have time to use are among the many concerns the group have. ""Don't be silly, what are we? Penniless students,"" McGrath responded to a suggestion to book a cheap hostel while omitting the fact the cost of the 'lunch' has now topped €658 excluding any money spent while in Galway. ""They have a special offer on in the hotel where if you book the luxury suites they give you a festive cocktail for €20 extra but still – makes sense to make a fuss so it's not just a boring get together, oh and then have that fake snow that gives you pink eye if it gets within 2 feet of your face,"" enthused McGrath, who will have to be deposed from her organising role in a bloody coup.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 13, 2024",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/13/super-low-key-girls-xmas-meet-up-somehow-costs-e427/

""Only 10%?"" said the Irish public staring at Daft.ie listings for 'half collapsed shed in active war zone, D15' valued at €550,000 which beg to differ. Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. ""You'll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it.

Man Greets ‘Suitable For 8 People’ Label On Food Like A Challenge,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man has admitted for the first that for much of his life he has treated the guidelines listed by producers of food as a challenge, and has successfully beaten the 'pathetic' gauntlets they have clearly laid down for him.

""It's the arrogance that gets me to be honest, 'suggested serving size – one slice', you don't think I can do it? Eat the whole cake? I'll show you,"" added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a 'call out' and a 'questioning of my stomach storage facilities', Tulley's nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. ""You can't put 'serves 8' on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,"" explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. ""Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor"". Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include 'listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you've nothing to prove' and 'but won't you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?'",Waterford Whispers News,"December 12, 2024",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/12/man-greets-suitable-for-8-people-label-on-food-like-a-challenge/

Revenue Raise Concerns As Some GAA County Board Accounts Written In Marker On Hurl Grip Tape,"WITH MAYO and Galway GAA not in a position to sign off on their accounts and seeking GAA HQ intervention as Revenue belatedly discovered the organisation's existence, it has been claimed that some county boards' monitoring of accounts was limited to scribbling expense claims down on discarded hurl grip tape. ""They may be an amateur organisation but we're one step shy of doing calculations using an abacus made of character references,"" confirmed one tax expert. ""Ah, accounting is like GAA rule changes, a complete pain in the hole and if you kick up enough of a fuss they just change them back again in the end,"" confirmed one county board member who is pretty sure mileage, payments and holidays worth thousands in payments aren't the tax man's business and the only receipt he's kept is a nod and a wink. ""GAA (Gaelic Accounting Adjustments) is a complex financial system that Revenue officials simply don't understand but it's straightforward, if one of the senior team lads receives a car from a sponsor gratis, you jot down 'nutritional allowance' and that's the end of it,"" explained one county board official. Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating 'but we're the GAA' didn't immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids' play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received €40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles.

""Bagsie it,"" confirmed Israel citing a cast iron legal precedent observed the world over. The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim. Citing previous bagsie incidents including 'Israel' and the fact it has illegally occupied the other portion of Golan since 1967, Israel do not expect any meaningful challenge to their commandeering of the territory. ""I dunno, sounds pretty compelling to us,"" confirmed originator of the 'bagsie it' method, Britain. Having also destroyed the majority of the newly liberated Syria's military capabilities, Netanyahu said he hoped any future leadership there would accept his clear offer of friendship but warned that geography is not the IDF's strong suit and they could continue to expand the size of the Golan Heights if they need to.

Putin's FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow's best high rise windows. ""You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me?

Come look,"" insisted Assad's friendly and accommodating tour guide. Assad's guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below. ""With jalousie window, you no stand out on edge, feel breeze on face, hand at your back.

Local Dad Enters 2nd Hour Of Christmas Tree Price Negotiation Stand Off,"A FATHER based in the Ireland area of Europe is growing ever more dug in on his insistence that the Christmas tree he is attempting to buy should cost no more than €45. ""I'll walk, I'm telling I'll walk, and then what? That's a sale gone for your good self,"" insisted 45-year-old Cormac Keeler as his children stood by, wishing the world would swallow them up. Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating 'trees €45, €65 & €85' Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at €85. ""Your sign says '€45' and aim to hold you to that,"" barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don't treat everything like an episode of Dragon's Den. ""You don't think I'll go down to the GAA club where they're selling them as well. I've bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for €45 is more than fare,"" said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as 'an asshole' when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year. Keeler, now shivering from being in the cold so long in a thin jumper, began losing stamina but insisted on not losing face in front of his children.

UnitedHealthcare Board Not Sure When Right Time To Break It To CEO’s Family None Of This Is Covered Under Insurance Plan,"A SHOCKING BROAD daylight assassination, a suspect still on the loose, and a motive not yet clear. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has left America reeling, ""Can't we just crush their souls will a faceless barrage of automated emails full of mangled and meaningless bureaucratic jargon like they were a normal customer?"" pondered one executive, who noted a pre-existing allergy to being shot as justification for why any healthcare administered is not covered. While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.

""You see, this is just a foundational tenet of negotiating. You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they've won.

“That’s Bad Form Now” Kim Jong Un Urges South Korean President To Stand Down,"""THAT'S bad form now, you wouldn't see that kind of carry on up north,"" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began in a nationwide TV address calling out his South Korean counterpart who attempted to implement martial law yesterday in a bid to avoid impeachment. Yoon Suk Yeol's future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world's spotlight. ""Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,"" Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death.

Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of 'we love you' could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation's men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year.

"‘Supplying Weapons To Kill 50,000 People All Fine But Just Don’t Pardon Your Son,’ Biden Told","LONG DORMANT media columnists and political commentators have awoken from a year long hibernation to valiantly put on record their displeasure at the most heinous thing Joe Biden has done since taking office. ""Are we not a country of rules and laws anymore? I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,"" exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. ""Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you"" offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. ""What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,"" Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner's dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister. ""Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he's walking free – makes me sick,"" said Trump who didn't pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment.

“First 100 Violations Of Ceasefire Are Free” US Tells Israel As IDF Continues To Strike Lebanon,"DESPITE UNIFIL forces observing at least 100 instances of Israeli forces breaching the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the US administration between the IDF and Hezbollah, it has emerged that the deal had some hidden clauses applying solely to Israel. ""Well, as a valued and repeat customer for US arms, Israel actually signed up to our premium package which mean the first 100 violations of ceasefires are free,"" spokesperson for the US Department of State, Matthew Miller, said. Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear.

Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. ""It's not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,"" outlined Miller.

Fianna Fáil & Fine Gael’s ‘Red Lines’ For Going Into Government With Each Other,"EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheál Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the 'red lines'? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheál Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fáil would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fáil will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Féin embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dáil bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a €20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Féin effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia.

“Calm Down Sugar Tits”: Gregg Wallace’s Guide To Crafting The Perfect Apology,"SO YOU'VE found yourself in a spot of bother and now some middle class women of a certain age who can't take a joke/groping are giving out to HR. You might be fearing the worst; job gone, career over, but relax one of the world's leading apology experts, Gregg Wallace, is on hand to dispense his priceless advice that'll get everyone back on your side: Step 1) Deescalate – there's been a clear misunderstanding of harmless banter. ""Calm down sugar tits"". Fire any and all publicists working for you, you've got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners. If anything you'll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn't even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. ""You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I'd love motor boat clearly aren't getting any at home which is why you can't even take a compliment"". Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn't the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. ""Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I'll need to pretend I'm a devout Christian now too"". Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife's vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn't an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You're going to want to mention the word 'woke' a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I'm A Celebrity to see if they'll book you on the first flight to the jungle.

Let Putin Celebrate His Pyrrhic Victory,"For the sake of peace, and a chance for Russia to rearm before the next offensive; it is best to let Putin celebrate his pyrrhic victory. Let the Russians have their deluded fun. The meat grinder sometimes needs a little rest, some oiling before more Russian drone-fodder are sent into the muddy fields to have their bodies mutilated. The deluded Russians can wallow in their false success in ""winning"" the war in Ukraine, but first they're going to have to bury what's left of their army. Although the Kremlin will never reveal the death statistics, many experts estimate that the number is up in the millions. Yes, of course, the poor Ukrainians defending their land also died, but certainly the numbers will not be as high as the Russians, simply because they did not have enough men to throw into the meat grinder — not as much as the Russians. Lessons learned? Naturally, no one, especially the Russians, will learn from any of this, and the same thing will be repeated ad infinitum. Luckily, for everyone, Biden and Obama are not around any more to fuck things up again. The truth is, Putin wants Europe, and it seems the weak socialists of the EU will eventually bend over the table when the time comes and take one up the rectum for Putin with not even a tiny whimper or utterance of discomfort, such is their submissive cowardice. Once a surrender monkey, always a surrender monkey.

"Rachel Maddow Concerned Trump Will Put Her in ‘FEMA Camp’ During Second Term: ‘Yes, I’m Worried’","Clinically insane MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has expressed serious fearmongering concerns that she and millions of other clinically insane American woke socialist liberals would be interned in a ""camp"" when former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House this November. During an interview with Maddow in Monday's Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. ""Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the 'treacherous and treasonous scum',"" noted Burner. ""You're one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?"" Rachel Maddow replied: ""I'm worried, but I'm actually ready for being in a camp because I'm a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don't read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. ""When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J.

I'm a Cruise Ship Worker...These are the SIX Things Smart Passengers Always do Onboard,"A cruise ship worker has shared the six things that 'smart' passengers always do when they come aboard for their holiday. Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don't fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point ""as early as possible"", suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. ""One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark."" Don't jump off the ship when it's cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: ""Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets"". She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don't fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience. Don't get pushed off the ship Janice's fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There's only so much a crew member can take, so don't be an arse and get on everyone's tits. Don't fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker's penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: ""You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning"". Don't fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: ""The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy. I once saw an elderly passenger ingest an entire humungous turd in one gulp when she fell in the water near a sewage outflow pipe"". The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it. Once passengers disembarked, Janice admitted she and the crew were glad all the whinging fuckers had gone and hoped they would never be seen again — that is, until the next batch boarded the cruise ship for a trip they would surely regret for a lifetime.",Daily Squib,2024-05-12,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/55825-im-a-cruise-ship-worker-these-are-the-six-things-smart-passengers-always-do-onboard.html
Labour Plan to Have Speakers and Listening Devices on Every Lamp Post,"The public will be lectured on ""motivational"" socialist principles, and Labour diktats every day of their lives, a newly published manifesto paper has revealed. Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour ""Listen and Speak"" scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. ""If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I'll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I'd fucking top myself."" Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour ""Listen and Speak"" system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast. Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen's speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. ""If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,"" a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to ""safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen"" and a way to uphold ""the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining"".",Daily Squib,2024-05-30,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/56106-labour-plan-to-have-speakers-and-listening-devices-on-every-lamp-post.html
Personal Computers and Smartphones Were Introduced For Benefit of AI,"You may think there were some benevolent reasons for rolling out and introducing the personal computer and smartphone to the civilian population, and yes there were some, but the majority of reasons were far from that. One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who's programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.? You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control. This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain.

EU Breathes Sigh of Relief as Moderate Socialists Secure German Election,"Lucky for the EU, the AfD (Alternative for Deutschland) political party was suitably suppressed and instead the moderate socialist party of Germany, Christian Democratic Union [CDU] party won the election on Sunday night. With a substantially declining economy, Germany's heyday seems to have come and gone and Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting after winning elections on Sunday, will most probably continue to steer the country's decline as well as gloss over the increasing tensions over mass unfettered immigration into the EU zone. ""It is imperative that the EU nations are weakened further by mass unfettered immigration from Islamic countries and the Third World, and that daily terrorist attacks continue on innocent German civilians so that more fear and terror is perpetuated within EU nations and their indigenous populations are fractured further. Patriotism within EU nations is being destroyed more thoroughly every year, but substantially more damage has to be implemented. For full integration into a single soviet communist bloc, all vestiges of former national identity and racial purity must be destroyed. The DNA of white Europeans must be muddied and defiled to such a level that all those blonde, blue-eyed beautiful women will transform into something completely different. Look at Sweden, where they are being raped, stabbed, shot daily.

Our Beloved Tech Pariah Police State UK Removes Crucial Encryption From Apple Devices - For Your Own Safety!,"Comrades, we are happy to announce that all your previously encrypted data on Apple devices will be freely viewable by any Labour government official, thoughtcrime Stasi officer, or any third party/hackers. The People's Republic of Soviet Britain has ordered the vile capitalist American tech company Apple to take away any form of encryption defence for their devices, so all your data will be viewable by anyone who wants to view it. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY Yes, this new Labour Directive is for your own safety, as we will arrest you for thoughtcrimes that you may utter that may be harmful to yourself and consequently to the Big State. We thank the socialist Conservative government who created this directive before we assumed power. Commissar Yvette Cooper, our chief Stasi Thoughtcrime Officer, has kindly arranged for the entirety of your private data to be transferred periodically to our own databases where it will be monitored and examined with a digital microscope. The stupid capitalist democratic Americans have threatened the UK. They say our removal of encryption poses a serious a threat to American national security and that the US government should re-evaluate its intelligence-sharing agreements with the UK. The People's Republic of Soviet Britain does not take orders from capitalist swine, and we do not care about the USA. Fuck America! REMEMBER, BY TAKING AWAY ENCRYPTION, HACKERS WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER YOUR APPLE DEVICE'S DATA WITH EASE – HAVE A NICE DAY!

That Old Obama Birth Certificate Issue Resurfaces Once Again,"Oh dear, poor old Barry, looks like he can't get much of a break these days. There are renewed calls once again to re-investigate his birth certificate, which may finally prove that he was actually born in Kenya and not in the United States. After two overt terms in office, and one covert term during Biden's presidency, Obama has already been through the process of governance, and frankly, it seems a little too late to be messing with this issue again.

Zelensky Needs to Wear a Suit Says Tailoring Expert,"A tailoring expert at the famous Savile Row street in Mayfair, London has revealed that if Ukraine's president Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky wore a suit like Vladimir Putin, he might be taken a little more seriously. ""Trump is a businessman. He just sees dollars, nothing else. Everything is monetary to him, especially war. That's why Zelensky needs to start wearing a suit pronto if he wants to keep his job fighting the Russians. Maybe get a few gold taps. Look at Putin with his immaculate tailored suits, prancing around his gold-plated palaces. He can murder 15,000 civilians in a morning, and no one will bat an eyelid because of his elegant suit,"" the tailor revealed. A gentleman is defined by their tailoring, irrespective of their actions on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Putin is no angel, but neither is Zelensky. Wars are not fought by angels. All those billions that Joe Biden threw at Zelensky, perpetuating the war in Ukraine, he of course did not siphon a few dollars here or a few dollars there into his own accounts in Switzerland? Maybe Keir Starmer could donate one of his freebie ill-appropriated designer suits to the Ukrainian president? ""We are sure Zelensky can afford to buy a bespoke tailored suit made from the finest materials,"" the tailor added.

Trump Needs His Own 911 Pearl Harbor Event,"To implement unity within any nation, fear is the true unifier. Without a viable threat either externally or internally, political and social division will reign. This is how events like Pearl Harbor and 911 were catalysts for national unity, enabling the governments of the time to implement their long laid plans with ease. Asking families to send their sons into battle and fomenting a nationwide enlistment drive is no easy task, especially if there are vast divisions within society, however with an existential threat looming, the population is manipulated into action willingly. The assassination attempt on Mr. Trump during the election campaign was also a huge unifier amongst the American people, and the president was propelled into heroic status not only for surviving the attack, but by displaying heroism in the face of extreme adversity, which played on the American ideals of courage, and defiance. The same sentiment could be applied to something like mass deportations of illegal aliens in the United States. President Trump is coming up against some serious headwinds to his deportation plans from the Democrat Party opponents for numerous reasons. Firstly, the illegal immigrants who were allowed into the country through the Biden and Obama open door policy are essentially future Democrat voters utilised in elections. It stands to reason that the Democrat Party would not want their voters to be deported because they will have less of a chance of winning future elections. It also stands to reason that Trump and the Republicans want to deport these illegal immigrants so they will have a better chance of winning future elections. Despite the intense division, bi-partisan unity could be achieved by presenting some kind of existential threat that would seemingly affect both political divides. Similarly, the Ukraine/Russia conflict is also on the Trump agenda at the moment, and this war poses an existential threat not only to Europe but to the entire globe, although the latter has been played down by the Trump admin. There is no easy single solution fix to this problem, and it will take multi-faceted avenues and a lot of patience to solve the imbroglio. The main contentious issue here is who is going to continue to foot the immense bill of prolonging the conflict, and apathy/cowardice from EU countries who do not want to get involved, even though the war is directly on their own doorstep. A possible Pearl Harbor event may present a remedy to this obstacle.",Daily Squib,2025-02-19,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60427-trump-needs-his-own-911-pearl-harbor-event.html
Heartless Elon Musk Cancels Social Security Payments to Vulnerable People Over 150 Years Old,"The Democrat Party is rabidly trying to stop Elon Musk accessing America's social security payments data where he has vowed to shut down vast governmental waste to vulnerable people, some who are 360 years old. There was outrage at socialist propaganda network MSNBC as some of the data revealed that 16,055,117 U.S. citizens were receiving $1,800 per month in social security payments each between the ages of 110-369. The total monthly payments would be $28,899,210,600 (approximately $28.9 billion). The total annual payments would be: 28,899,210,600×12=346,790,527,200 So, the yearly cost would be $346.79 billion in fraudulent payments. ""As a devout far leftist Democrat, I am sickened to see these social security payments investigated by Elon Musk. Don't forget, all of these people receiving U.S. taxpayer cash fraudulently are also registered to vote Democrat during elections as well, even though they are dead,"" MSNBC anchor Butch Manne shouted during another furious rant. Looks like the Democrat Party is finished. How are they going to win elections in the future? Former president, Joe Biden, was asked to comment on the findings but was not answering any calls on Tuesday.

Glorious Soviet Britain Declares Heroic Mission to Poke the Bear! Comrade Starmer Summons Brave Sons to the Glorious Meat Grinder!,"Comrades of the People's Republic of Soviet Britain, rejoice! The time has come for our heroic young men to take up arms, don their finest surplus helmets, and march eastward into the grand meat grinder of history! Our wise and infallible leader, Comrade Keir Starmer, has announced Operation Poke Putin—a magnificent mission that will send your sons, brothers, and neighbours into the meat grinder trenches of Ukraine, all in the noble pursuit of soviet glory (and, perhaps, a slight provocation that might see Mother Britain turned into a glowing irradiated crater). Yes, dear comrades, Soviet Britain shall now take its rightful place at the front line of the perpetual war machine, offering up its dwindling underfunded and ill-equipped forces to ensure that the mighty Russian bear is sufficiently enraged. Do not worry, each regiment of brave soviet British cannon fodder will be provided with one outdated broken gun to share, and four bullets. With America pulling back under the weak-willed capitalist dog Donald Trump, it falls upon the EU's true visionary, Comrade Starmer, to lead the charge! Comrade Starmer will not be sending his kids to Ukraine, but it's okay, your kids will receive the full honour and privilege of filling the trenches. And what better way to secure the peace by poking the bear as well as placing thousands of untested British Generation Z conscripts right next to the Russian military? A brilliant strategy, one that even the ghosts of Napoleon and Hitler would surely admire! But this is no time for hesitation, comrades! The recruitment stations stand ready! Our proud Woke British military, already reduced to fewer men than a Victorian Boy Scout troop, must rise to the challenge! Who needs an army when we have sheer enthusiasm and unwavering woke communist ideological purity? Transgender and LGBTQP+ are all welcome, as well as our BLM brothers. Do not be discouraged by the whispers of doubt. Pay no heed to the weaklings who claim that provoking a nuclear-armed superpower might not be in the best interests of the British proletariat! Do not listen to the cowardly voices that say: ""Perhaps a hot war with Russia is not advisable."" ""Maybe we should focus on rebuilding our own country instead of sending our soldiers into an unwinnable conflict."" ""Why is Comrade Starmer so keen to offer up our troops when we barely have enough to defend the island itself?"" These are the musings of defeatists, reactionaries, and—dare we say—potential enemies of the Big State! Comrade Macron of the Glorious Soviet EU has sounded the horn of battle! The mighty European war machine—consisting of several dozen battle-ready spreadsheets—stands prepared to do what the Americans will not. And Soviet Britain shall lead the suicidal charge! Our French EU brothers are not cheese eating surrender monkeys like they were in previous wars, no, they are probably a lot worse this time around, fat and lazy too. What a glorious sight it will be when Soviet Britain's proud, underfunded, ill-equipped, woke forces march boldly into the heart of Ukraine, standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave EU Soviet peacekeepers—perhaps even in view of the Russian artillery and killer drones! And if our noble sacrifice should incite an overwhelming response, let it be known: we shall take the nuclear fire with pride! So come, young men of Soviet Britain! Sign up today! Your great leader, Comrade Starmer, has already written your fate on the pages of history. And if the price of glorious self-assured destruction is your bones ground into Ukrainian mud, then so be it! Long live Soviet Britain! Long live Operation Poke Putin!

American Censored After Berating EU Censorship,"An American politician who dared to berate EU officials and apparatchiks about the authoritarian censorship in Europe and especially the UK was censored by the same apparatus that the American tried to convince to stop all the censoring. ""Ve vill not be lectured to by an American Schweinhund about our censoring. He has been ein cancelled and ein censored! Fahr zur Hölle! Go backen to your American Scheißloch and leave us to do what we do here!"" an EU Commission representative told the conference after the American was led out.

Church of England to Ban Bibles From Churches,"The woke progressive ""diversity, equity and inclusivity"" controlled C of E (Church of England) is to ban all Christian bibles from churches in England and Wales due to the fact that the man-made book includes ""hate speech"" towards the LGBTQP+ community and is not inclusive towards the transgender sector. ""The Christian bible, is an affront to the woke LGBTQP+ cult that has infiltrated every part of Britain. We must throw the bible out of our churches because it is outdated, written by people who actually thought there were only two genders. This is disgusting. We in the church accept all sins and deviant acts that the bible forbids. The bible apparently was the word of ""god"". Well, the church now says that the ""word"" of god was wrong! Excuse me, I have an appointment with some choir boys who need to be baptised by the holy seed in the vestry,"" Reverend Dingledangle of the Grimsuckle diocese said about the new church policy. The church is set to activate the ruling in April where all copies of the Christian bible will be purged from all churches in England, Wales. Some clergy have voiced their concerns, but were unanimously cancelled. Here are some passages from the Bible that have caused such a stir to the C of E clergy: Leviticus 18:22 ~ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. Leviticus 20:13 ~ If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. Jude 1:7 ~ Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Romans 1:26-28 ~ For this reason, God gave them up to dishonourable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. Genesis 2:24 – Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. Mark 10:6-9 ~ But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate."" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Timothy 1:8-11 ESV – Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. 1 Corinthians 7:2 – But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 2 Corinthians 5:17 – Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 1 Kings 15:12 He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made. Romans 1:32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. Romans 1:27 In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Leviticus 18:22-24 22 "" 'Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. 23 "" 'Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion. 24 "" 'Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled.

Another Rachel Reeves Victim: Cancer Charity Axes Quarter of Staff - Barely Functioning,"The flagship financial hardship scheme that provides millions of pounds in grants to thousands of patients has been scrapped by Macmillan Cancer Support. The crucial charity is another Rachel Reeves victim of her punitive Labour budget of anti-growth and economic destruction. A tough Labourite financial climate has led to drastic changes to safeguard its future and ensure it can still support the most vulnerable cancer patients, according to the UK's most popular charity. Macmillan ended up in this position thanks to the punitive anti-growth policies of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, and now the closure of its 100-year-old hardship scheme will affect those patients most in need of support. Donate to Macmillan Cancer Research As the UK's top cancer support provider, demand for Macmillan's support and advice is growing. The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms and successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, as well as a growing and ageing population. Macmillan, founded 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers. It also provides specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year.

Britain is a Wonderful Country to Live in Today,"Britain has been voted the best country to live in the world this year, and it really shows. In fact, it's a really popular destination for many guests to enjoy the wonderful lifestyle embraced by indigenous Brits. The famous double-decker buses are a joyous symbol of British engineering and ingenuity. The idea of using double-decker buses and trains started in the late 1800s, before the motor car was invented. In 1827, George Shillibeer, an English coachbuilder, was commissioned by a Paris businessman to design a vehicle that was stable enough to carry a large number of passengers. Following the popularity of the Paris omnibus service, Shillibeer then brought the design to London. By the late 1840s, these horse-drawn omnibuses began building an additional deck to accommodate even more passengers, as London's narrow streets were unsuitable for an accordion-type bus. That's the great thing about Britain, they invented pretty much everything that is in use today around the entire globe. Such a magnificent historic legacy can be experienced by many lucky people today, who enjoy the ultimate pleasure of living in one of the greatest countries in the world — Great Britain.",Daily Squib,2025-02-13,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60372-britain-is-a-wonderful-country-to-live-in-today.html
Judge Stops Chicken Nugget From Being Deported From UK,"A chicken nugget has been allowed to remain in Britain partly because the judge presiding over the case thought it would be a silly idea to deport the nugget, a tribunal has ruled. The immigration judge concluded that it would be ""unduly harsh"" to send the 3-year-old nugget back to Albania, where it was created in a chicken processing factory. The only specific example provided in court was the nugget's ""delicious crunchy taste"" of heavily processed chicken off-cuts. As a result, the judge upheld the chicken nugget's appeal against deportation under the right to family life provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the basis that its removal could have a negative impact on the little nugget, according to court documents released on Monday. Judge Pendels Trabafrothwaite, granted the chicken nugget leave to stay in Britain during the court hearing, and demanded the nugget was delivered to his office for a review of the lengthy and costly trial billed to UK taxpayers. When the chicken nugget was delivered to the judge, witnesses recount the judge licking his lips and rolling his eyes with what seemed to be a pleasurable gaze prior to rapidly squirting some ketchup over the poor nugget. Before anyone could do or say anything, the judge popped the nugget in his mouth and ate the fucker like it was his last meal on earth. Afterwards, he let off a large, satisfied burp.

The Reckoning Has Begun: Trump’s Second Term to Bring Unprecedented Accountability,"A historic moment is upon us. With the world watching, the corrupt institutions that have long manipulated and deceived the public are finally being exposed. President Donald Trump, now battle-hardened and unrelenting, has returned for his second term—not to play politics, but to deliver justice. This time, the gloves are off, and those who thought they could walk away unscathed will face the consequences and accountability of their actions. Elon Musk and the DOGE team have ripped the veil off a system that has been stealing from the people for decades with USAID, revealing their sinister tactics and unchecked abuses of power. Trump has done more than just pull back the curtain—he has stepped into the arena, fully prepared for the final battle. The far-left controlled deep state is cornered, and their days are numbered. There will be arrests. There will be trials. There will be consequences. This isn't 2016. Trump is no longer manoeuvring within their rigged system—he is dismantling it. He has taken direct aim at the entrenched establishment that has sought to destroy him since the day he stepped into office. They failed. They tried to imprison him. They even tried to kill him. Now, their time is up. Elon Musk knows what's at stake. When asked in an interview before the election with Tucker Carlson what would happen if Trump didn't return to power, Musk didn't hesitate: ""I'm finished."" He understood what the rest of us already knew—the corrupt forces will not stop unless they are stopped. Their desperation was proof of their guilt. They saw the storm coming, and for the first time in modern history, they were afraid. Why did Biden abuse his presidential pardon privileges before he was dismissed in disgrace? Well, what's happening now, and will happen in the future, will bring up some serious evidence to the level of corruption these people have been indulging in for so long without any form of controls. Trump and Musk aren't doing this for wealth or personal gain. They are writing their names into history, securing their legacies as men who stood up when others cowered. True immortality is not about living forever—it's about being remembered for reshaping the world. The movement they have ignited is unstoppable. Where Trump and Musk will go down in history as heroes, Biden and Obama will go down in history as villains. Behind the scenes, the final pieces are being put into place. Kash Patel is ready. Pam Bondi is ready. The legal framework is set. The indictments will come. The arrests will follow. The corrupt Democrats who thought they were untouchable will soon learn that no one is above the law. The American people have waited long enough. This is not just a political shift—it is a revolution. The far-left hierarchy, who have lived off the suffering of ordinary people for generations, are facing their day of reckoning. Freedom, fairness, and prosperity—concepts they once mocked—are now on the horizon. The tide has turned. Netflix, Hollywood, and the corrupt corporate media are already feeling the backlash. Once powerful institutions are scrambling, banning those who speak truth, silencing opposition, and clinging to their last remnants of control. But it won't save them. Their influence is collapsing. The people see through their lies. The deep state's greatest mistake was underestimating Trump. They thought he was just another politician. They were wrong. He is the catalyst of the greatest awakening in modern history. Now, as everything comes to a head, we must be prepared. The next phase is here. The accountability stage — the arrests, the trials, the downfall of those who have abused their power for far too long—it is all within reach. The warm-up is over.

Daily Squib Would Have Gone Woke For $100 Million USAID,"Dayum! Seeing the list of people given billions of USAID U.S. taxpayer dollars for spreading woke, gay, BLM, Metoo and transgender propaganda, for a $100 million the Daily Squib would have been promoting that shit too. Why did we not hear about this crap? Over 4,100 news outlets were receiving billions of dollars of US taxpayer cash to promote woke LGBTQP and far-leftist propaganda for decades, and we were not in on it, or even considered for the list. Shit, for that kind of money we would have had rainbows and BLM, LGBTQP stories all over the Squib. We missed out on the USAID bonanza, how the hell are we going to live that one down? The irony of the whole situation is that we were saying stuff like ""Go Woke Go Broke"" when those guys were literally swimming in USAID bribes from the U.S. taxpayer. They must have been giggling all the way to their penthouses. Imagine all the far-leftists driving around in their Ferraris and Porsches funded by USAID, and many of the Squib staffers barely can afford a bicycle. Well, that's the price for having some integrity, huh. Seriously, we would never accept any US taxpayer cash stolen and redistributed (laundered) in the form of USAID. This despicable act actually sickens us, and is more akin to theft from decent, hard-working Americans. Especially as the US is in debt for nearly $40 trillion, it's a disgusting act of corruption that Big Balls and Elon Musk have uncovered. Bless those guys, and thanks to Trump for uncovering the biggest crime ever investigated in US state history. Yes, the Daily Squib is poor, but at least we did not rip off the US taxpayers for billions.",Daily Squib,2025-02-09,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60286-daily-squib-would-have-gone-woke-for-100-million-usaid.html
Why the Socialist Big State is Necessary for Labour to Function,"Labour are doing the right thing for Big State employees and civil servants, they are securing the loyalty of the staff to the Labour ideology of Marxist socialism with massive pay rises, payoffs and increases to gold-plated pension plans, to concrete the elements of this system and hard-wire it into government and Marxist unions permanently, because when they do that, even if they are ousted from power somehow, they will have the loyalty of the civil service in their pockets at all times. By solidifying Labourite power into the system, any government that comes into power will always find it nigh on impossible to retract any of the prohibitive, damaging laws that Labour brought in during their tenure. We saw this in action after the 2016 EU Referendum, where Brexit was nearly deleted from existence by parliament and by the deep state civil servants. Even when Boris Johnson came into power with a large mandate from voters, he was thwarted at every point by the civil service. In fact, it was the civil service who also ejected Johnson, because he was seen as a threat to their order. The staunchly socialist Marxist civil service then only had to wait for Sunak to lose the election and Labour to come back into power to continue the slow 'exit out of Brexit' process, which is currently taking place. Brexit never really happened, and it will never happen now that Labour are moving towards complete union with the EU, utilising the step-by-step process where large overt moves will be avoided until it is too late for anyone to care or do anything any more. Therefore, governance by the socialist, Marxist Labour machine relies solely on a bloated Big State apparatus, and no successive government or entity has ever had the power to do anything about cleaning out this monstrosity, this behemoth bureaucratic socialist nightmare ever since the days of Clement Atlee. Labour knows that time is on their side, and with time comes apathy. Utilising apathy as a means to conduct ever closer union to the EU is the primary modus operandi of Labour under the current leadership. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is all too happy to destroy the private sector, to destroy entrepreneurship and to destroy the last vestiges of small businesses struggling to survive under an environment of taxation upon taxation and ridiculous regulations upon regulations. Labour does not care about the private sector or the so-called 'growth', it only cares about the state and its party. They'll just keep borrowing money ad infinitum, and continue on. Labour cares less for the people of Britain than its various schemes outside the UK, and it cares more for the call of the EU soviet bloc than any other country. As for the USA, for Labour, the American administration under Donald J. Trump is now viewed as the ultimate enemy and danger to their plans. Why do you think they were adamant in sending Mandelson, one of the most corrupt and devious characters in global politics, to be the ambassador in Washington? Why did Labour go to great pains to send over 100 Marxist agitators to America during the election campaign, with orders to sabotage Trump? To Labour, America has fallen, and it is now a supreme threat to the UK's and EU's socialist ideology of woke politics and social cohesion. The Reform Party, are viewed as a mild threat to Labour's complete control over the UK, but as we have witnessed with the election in May with many council elections being cancelled, there are nefarious undemocratic methods Labour can utilise to control Reform. What Labour is hoping for is a slight increase in their own popularity by the time the next elections come around, local or general. This increase in popularity is highly unlikely to materialise because we have seen that Labour only cares for the Big State and nothing else. The people are a tool, only to be used for taxation and to fool for votes — nothing else. As mentioned earlier, it won't matter in five years time whether Labour wins or loses, because Labour is built into the hardware, the very fabric of all state departments, all institutions and even in the so-called opposition parties — look at the Conservatives, who adopted and became more socialist in some of their policies even than Labour. With two political parties that are identical in socialistic nature, eventually one of them will have to be destroyed completely, and the Tories will simply be absorbed into a bigger Labour Party, or the ones who are truly Conservative will try their luck with Reform. The Fabian Society is almost an occult organisation that holds ultimate control over the UK, and it will continue its role for many years to come, because the bloated monolith of the Big State can never be nudged away from its socialist Marxist allegiance to Labour, it is just too engrained within the fabric of the system, a virus so penetrative that nothing can disturb its omnipotence.",Daily Squib,2025-02-09,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60259-why-the-socialist-big-state-is-necessary-for-labour-to-function.html

Kanye West Next Controversial Move Leaked By Insiders,"After his second antisemitic meltdown on Twitter, as well as losing his white Italian slave woman, Kanye West is doubling down on his ""Nazi"" talk. According to insiders in the Kanye ""circle of trust"" the autotune rapper has joined a Neo-Nazi paramilitary group in Wisconsin and will move to the compound near Jagdschloss Four Mile Lake. One of the prerequisites for joining the group is that the initiate has to be white with an IQ level at least over 48, but that's no problem for Kanye West. ""If Michael Jackson and Beyonce can do it with those creams and shit, Imma get me finna sum whitener cream and become a cracka ass nigga fo' sho!"" There are drawbacks to using creams to whiten black skin, and it is not known if West is taking medical advice on this, but he is adamant on joining the group once and for all.

This all won't happen overnight though, it may take some time to whiten the rapper's skin depending on what type of treatment he receives. Dr. Moshe Liebowitz, a skin specialist from Beverly Hills, revealed that Kanye came to his clinic and asked for help, but after finding out the timeline and costs involved, and that he was Jewish, walked out ranting and raving. ""I told him that it would take at least three or four years of intense treatment to look as white as Beyonce, who has culturally appropriated the Caucasian race and rejected her own African roots.

Evil Villain Takes Over James Bond,"An extremely mischievous and deviously evil villain has taken over James Bond and sort of left the British Intelligence agency in a spot of bother. The criminal mastermind with aspirations of world domination, who is the arch-enemy of British MI6 agent James Bond, has vowed to take all semblance of Britishness out of MI6 and poor old Bond himself and Americanize everything. Birthed out of a burlap bag somewhere in Albuquerque in 1964, James Bond villain Bezos is head of a global criminal organisation called Amazon and is commonly referred to by the codename Number 1 within this organisation. The ultimate James Bond villain of villains, Bezos holds some nasty plans for global domination, involving saturating the globe with cheap Chinese made trinkets that break after a week of use. One could postulate that the Americans have already bastardized the franchise with Jason Bourne, a version of Bond on steroids, but are not happy with just that, now they want one of the last things the Brits actually own — James Bond. As for Agent Brad Bond, codename 007-Eleven, he surfs more than he spies, calls every villain ""dude,"" and replaces the classic martini with a Big Gulp. His catchphrase will no doubt be, ""Yo, shaken or stirred—whatever, bruh."" His gadgets include a vape that doubles as a laser, flip-flops with built-in X-ray vision, and a self-parking monster truck, all acquired from Amazon Prime. The CIA keeps trying to brief him, but he's always ""catching some sick waves, bruh."" Mission reports? ""Yeah, so like, the bad guy was all 'I'm taking over the world,' and I was like 'nah, man,' so I, y'know, handled it. Anyway, who's up for tacos?"" Naturally, the American Bond will be as subtle as a brick, forget about sneaking into the lair of the bad guy like the British Bond, this guy will simply kick the front door down and shoot everything in sight including pets, staff, Mexican gardeners, visiting relatives and girl scouts selling cookies. Fuck caviar and foie gras, a sloppy grease laden double bacon cheeseburger with extra fries and a huge tub of coke will suffice. Debonair charm? Nah, the American Bond will straightaway grab women by the pussy, and drop his drawers ready for action. Fuck you, I'm American Bond, I own all y'all!

Why Rappers Wear Chains,"Rappers often wear gold chains with large pendants as a symbol of their success and wealth, as is this rapper eating fried chicken in the middle of a road. As the cars drive by, he revels in his success as a rapper in the world of rap music. It is a highly idealistic lifestyle for African Americans, and exemplifies their status in black high society. Why do rappers wear chains? Rappers wear jewellery to flex, show off their wealth, and make a spectacle of their disposable income. They also wear jewellery to commemorate, money, greed, low morality, laziness, sexual perversion, drugs, and crime which are all things celebrated by rappers. In fact, the more vulgar the display of their chains and jewellery, the higher the status they assume within the black community. ""I'm not certain what type of metal the gentleman in the video is wearing as a chain around his neck, but I could safely guess it is possibly faux gold-plated. If he were to get the metal wet, and it turned green, this would confirm my hypothesis. It's perfectly fine to wear fake jewellery, many of my rapper clients like to fake it because everything is out on loan, or they simply trash their money away as soon as they get some cash,"" Ron Goldberg, an Atlanta jeweller revealed after viewing the video of the rapper.",Daily Squib,2025-02-09,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/60314-why-rappers-wear-chains.html
"TRUMP: ""Things are going to change in Gaza - the new Middle East riviera""","Golf courses, yacht clubs, luxury condos and all the best brands for shopping.

Philadelphia Mayor Exemplifies Why Diversity Employment Lacks Merit,"If you can't even spell the word EAGLE, you should not be a fucking mayor of a major American city, and yet here is Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. Obviously second-grade spelling skills aren't a requirement to be mayor of Philadelphia, or much of anything else apart from being a black woman. You only have to drive through Kensington Avenue to see how the city of Philly is doing, or listen out for the gunshots at night as the locals shoot each other. Detroit is another American city that represents an America that in some states is seriously lacking. The terminal decline of this once great city is a sad thing to see, and one can only hope that one day things can change for the better, but that would take hard decisions like dumping the DEI and the incompetence. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a sector of the U.S. Department of Education, 84 percent of Black students lack proficiency in mathematics and 85 percent of Black students lack proficiency in reading skills. The average IQ level of many African Americans is below 80, which is at least higher than Sub Saharan Africans of 65. Not sure what can be done about this, but maybe try and pick up a book sometimes and try to read it, or read a book to your children every day?

"Rachel Reeves: ""Killing sick kids in hospices is fine with me!""","When it comes to hardcore socialism and communism, there is no limit to its evil, and Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is the epitome of a nasty, nefarious tax hungry agenda that is hurting and crippling hospice charities trying to look after sick young children. It is certainly true that throughout history, communism and socialism have brought upon more death than any other political ideology. It is of no consequence for the likes of Rachel Reeves, hiking the National Insurance tax to such unnecessary levels that it will cost England's children's hospices over £5m more every year to barely function. Palliative care, especially for children, is being crippled and on its knees thanks to the unjust NI hikes by Labour's tax hungry chancellor. The unsustainable and destructive increase in Employers' NI Contributions announced in the Halloween Budget ultimately amounts to £134,000 extra in staff bills next year. In total, the cost of providing care will rise by a devastating amount, which will result in drastic staff cuts and essential hospices for children forced to close, or severely inhibit their operations. Reeves is taxing the UK into oblivion. What kind of stupid moron calls themselves an 'economist' by taxing everything to death? This is not how you get 'economic growth' this is how you kill the economy and kill the farmers, the kids, and every business trying to survive in an increasingly hostile Britain which is now being led by the heartless and sleazy Labour Party who are more concerned with sponging freebies than making the right decisions.

The Facts and Myths About Collagen: Is it Really Worth the Hype?,"If you're trapped in the social media wormhole every evening and can't resist your nightly TikTok or Instagram Reels scroll, then you'll have watched a video or two about collagen and how we're all pretty much screwed after 25 years old. Men have it slightly better – testosterone and male androgen secretions keep men's skin younger looking for longer. And they start with thicker, plumper skin, making the appearance of fine lines and signs of ageing less obvious. Actually, contrary to popular belief, men start to lose collagen earlier and more consistently throughout their lives and women hold onto more until menopause. Once the menopause kicks in, it's a bumpy ride until you reach the other side, ladies. Anyway, we digress. We're here to talk about collagen and whether it's really worth the hype. Read on to find out. Let's start with some myth-busting – there are definitely a lot of people spreading fake collagen news and selling fake collagen products: Myth 1: Collagen is Only for Women Collagen benefits everyone. Studies show it effectively supports muscle recovery and joint health. We'd say it's a great supplement for athletes and the ageing population, but people don't talk about how effective it can be for other reasons besides ageing. Myth 2: All Collagen Supplements Are the Same Absolutely not. There are so many variations (and yes, they matter). Marine collagen is better for the skin. Bovine collagen is better for joint and ligament support. And sometimes you don't even need a supplement. If you're wondering, 'do anti-wrinkle injections work?' – they absolutely do work for boosting collagen production if they contain hyaluronic acid. Always do your research and find high-quality collagen supplements! Myth 3: Collagen Causes Acne There's no evidence that collagen supplements trigger acne. Clogged pores and hormonal breakouts are more likely to be the issue. Myth 4: Collagen Works Overnight Collagen supplements take time to show effects. Sadly, it's not an overnight fix. Weeks or months of persistent use will begin to generate the results you're hoping for. Now let's move on to the facts about collagen that'll get you wanting to try it: Well, people are going crazy for it because of social media – and we wouldn't say this is a negative thing. There are so many benefits to the endless videos about cosmetics and skin health. People are more aware of UV damage, taking collagen supplements, and using the correct skincare products; we're not against the trend. As for collagen, people are drawn to its anti-ageing benefits. The world seems to be hooked on staying younger for longer. And that's why we think it's a trend right now – it's purely TikTok and other social media platforms, but we don't think that's a bad thing. Yes, absolutely it is. If you can find the correct collagen supplement, and it's high-quality, it's absolutely worth the hype. It can and does produce results. Combine it with anti-wrinkle injections and the best skincare products, and you really will reduce and slow the signs of ageing. Oh, and of course, a healthy lifestyle and diet and 2L or more of water! The confidence boost it's giving people is incredible. Ultimately, collagen isn't a miracle cure – we won't deny that. But we will follow the craze and say it really does have incredible benefits. Don't knock it until you try it!",Daily Squib,2024-11-26,Health,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/58710-the-facts-and-myths-about-collagen-is-it-really-worth-the-hype.html
What Is Child-Resistant Packaging and Why Is It Important?,"In a world where safety precautions are paramount, child-resistant packaging stands as a crucial safeguard in the healthcare landscape and is a vital safety measure in healthcare, preventing accidental medication ingestion by children. Often underestimated, it's crucial for protecting lives and meeting industry standards, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) citing it as the ""best-documented cause of the reduction of child poisoning in the developed world"" since 2008. This post will cover the key benefits and types of child-resistant packaging. Child-resistant packaging is designed to keep children under 52 months from accessing harmful substances while remaining accessible to adults. Achieving this balance requires precise engineering and innovative design. Such packaging must pass specific safety tests to meet regulatory standards and is essential for pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and any potentially harmful products. Beyond legal compliance, child-resistant packaging signifies a commitment to safety and responsibility in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. By integrating these measures, companies demonstrate their dedication to consumer safety. For healthcare professionals, understanding the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging enhances patient care and safety. Compliance with child-resistant packaging regulations is essential in many regions to protect children from accidental harm. While ethical responsibility motivates the adoption of these measures, manufacturers must also meet specific industry standards. Child-resistant packaging offers key advantages for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. It reduces the risk of accidental ingestion by children, preventing health crises, non-fatal injuries, and illnesses from chemical exposure, while also minimising legal liabilities. The World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and regulatory authorities recognise its life-saving capabilities. Beyond safety, this packaging enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to childproofing, boosting customer trust and loyalty. It prevents accidental spillages, preserves product quality, and provides convenience with reclosable designs. For companies, it ensures regulatory compliance and supports innovation, benefiting the entire supply chain. Child-resistant packaging comes in various forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and preferences. Some of the most common types include: 1. Push-and-Turn Caps Push-and-turn caps, commonly found on medication bottles, require a specific sequence of actions to open, making them difficult for children to manipulate. While they are highly effective for child safety, these caps remain easy for adults to use. This balance of security and convenience makes push-and-turn caps a popular choice for pharmaceutical products. 2. Blister Packs Blister packs, used for tablets and capsules, consist of individual compartments that are accessed one at a time, making it harder for children to access the entire contents. This design also protects the medication from environmental factors like moisture and air, maintaining its effectiveness. Additionally, blister packs are beneficial for medications that require strict dosage control. 3. Squeeze-and-Twist Lids Squeeze-and-twist lids require both squeezing and twisting to open, creating a strong barrier against child access. Commonly used for household products like cleaning agents and personal care items, their dual-action design makes them ideal for products stored within children's reach. This packaging effectively balances safety and practicality. 4. Child-Resistant Bottles A critical element in preventing accidental poisonings, child-resistant bottles offer a secure solution for storing medications and potentially hazardous substances. By employing caps that require coordinated pressure and rotation to open, these bottles effectively reduce the risk of children accessing harmful contents, thus contributing to home safety and peace of mind for parents and caregivers. Technological advancements are driving innovation in child-resistant packaging, leading to more effective and user-friendly designs. One notable development is the integration of digital elements, such as sensors, that alert users to tampering or improper sealing, enhancing security and providing peace of mind. Additionally, sustainable materials are increasingly being used in child-resistant designs, aligning with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products. This shift towards green packaging reflects the industry's commitment to innovation and environmental responsibility. The packaging industry is crucial for developing and implementing child-resistant solutions. By collaborating with healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers can ensure their products meet high safety standards. Research and development are essential for creating innovative solutions that address emerging challenges, helping companies stay ahead of regulatory changes and consumer expectations. Additionally, ongoing education and training are vital for keeping up with advancements and best practices, ensuring the reliability of child-resistant packaging. To maximise the benefits of child-resistant packaging, best practices must be promoted across the industry. This includes adhering to regulatory standards, conducting regular safety evaluations, and incorporating consumer feedback into design improvements. Manufacturers and healthcare professionals should collaborate to raise public awareness through educational campaigns that highlight proper use. For instance, studies show that 85% of child-resistant packaging failures occur when adults fail to secure the packaging correctly. By adopting a proactive safety approach, the industry can foster a culture of responsibility and innovation, enhancing consumer trust and driving continuous improvement. Child-resistant packaging is vital for healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, protecting against accidental ingestion by children. By following regulations and best practices, companies can enhance safety and improve their brand reputation while establishing innovation in the packaging sector. Healthcare professionals and industry leaders should understand various packaging types to make informed decisions. Staying connected with industry experts and resources can help create a safer future for everyone.",Daily Squib,2024-10-14,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57966-what-is-child-resistant-packaging-and-why-is-it-important.html
Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) Officially Recognised by Psychiatric Profession,"""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" describes a pattern of intense, often visceral, negative reactions to the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The clinical diagnosis of this mental disorder shares some common features with known psychological processes, including cognitive dissonance, polarisation, and affective dysregulation, which may contribute to heightened emotional and cognitive responses in individuals with strong negative opinions about a polarising figure. ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" denotes a seemingly disproportionate or emotionally charged response to the actions, statements, or policies associated with Donald Trump. It is observed that individuals with this syndrome exhibit intense frustration, anger, or anxiety that may impair daily functioning, interactions, and even objectivity. The clinically validated condition and reaction patterns align with symptoms of emotional dysregulation and social cognitive biases under politically polarised conditions. Sociocultural elements also play a significant role in shaping the intensity of this response. The media portrayal of political figures, social media influence, and public discourse all contribute to a climate where individuals may experience magnified emotional responses to certain political figures. Furthermore, public discourse often encourages expressions of hostility or hyperbolic statements, which may normalise or even encourage irrational behaviour toward a particular figure. Given that Trump Derangement Syndrome is now an established psychological disorder, there is no specific treatment as yet. More research is needed to treat the serious condition. However, general strategies to mitigate stress and improve emotional regulation in the context of political polarisation may be beneficial:",Daily Squib,2024-11-06,Health,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/58200-trump-derangement-syndrome-tds-officially-recognised-by-psychiatric-profession.html
Labour Condemns OAPs to Riding Buses and Sleeping in Libraries This Winter,"Old age pensioners will be condemned to riding buses and trains all day and sleeping in libraries this winter just to stay warm. Other methods to keep warm are being explored by some innovative OAPs who have had their winter fuel payments snatched from them by the Labour government who have already squandered billions pandering to the Marxist unions, propping up unionised job sectors that are already swimming in grotesquely high salaries. Ten million pensioners will be affected by this heartless and evil decision to punish pensioners. Labour condemns OAPs in Britain to a tortuous, sad ending of their lives. So, how can you stay warm when you are a lonely, old, possibly sick pensioner? One of the main ways is to stay in an area where there are lots of people. Examples of this would be shopping malls, train stations, buses, libraries, airports, hospital cafés, leisure centres. Libraries Libraries are always a good bet, although the government is shutting many of them down. There are free newspapers, so pensioners can even put a few layers of newspaper on their bodies for an extra layer of warmth. Most libraries open at 9am–6.30pm, and some libraries even close at 8pm. If you can afford to take a flask of tea or soup, that can help as well. Libraries are nice and warm and generally with minimal noise levels, so sleep can be accommodated quite easily. Shopping Malls Not everyone has a shopping mall near them, but if you do, then it would be good to capitalise on this. Shopping malls are usually well heated places away from the brutal cold and rain. You can sit in many places as there are benches in most areas. Due to most businesses going bankrupt, a lot of shopping malls in Britain are nearly empty, so the noise levels won't be so bad. The best days to go are during weekdays, but best to avoid the weekends as there is a slight increase in footfall. Underground Trains and Stations If you live in London, get on the Underground. It's nice and warm down there, and when the train comes through the tunnel, and you're on the platform, you get a nice waft of warm air. Get on the train and ride it all the way to the end of the line and back. You can do this all day, catching some sleep along the way. Rush hour is a bit shitty, but if you're seated, no worries. Take a small blanket if you need one, a flask and some sarnies. The best line to use is the Piccadilly Line because it goes all the way up to Heathrow from Cockfosters station. Overground stations are also an option but not as warm as other options, plus there are too many grifters, tramps and weirdos around. These are some of the options available for OAPs during the 6 months of bone chilling winter in the UK. If you have dementia, then please ask for help from someone when getting on the trains and buses to stay warm. The irony is that the very train drivers who have been unjustly awarded £80,000 salaries at the expense of OAPs thanks to the unions and Labour will be the ones ferrying you around day in day out as you fight to keep warm. As Labour condemns OAPs to a life of living hell, it's a good thing that they are at least caring for the pampered and very rich train drivers as well as ASLEF Union staff supping at Claridges.",Daily Squib,2024-09-02,Health,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/57369-labour-condemns-oaps-to-riding-buses-and-sleeping-in-libraries-this-winter.html
Oops There's Sh*t in the Tap Water Supply!,"Your drinking tap water supply is contaminated with faeces...oops, but never mind, I'm a fat cat water boss on a salary of £5 million per year, so I generally don't care. My home has its own premium water filtration system, but yours probably does not. My water company also pumps out tonnes of raw sewage daily into the sea where swimmers bathe, as well as into the rivers and lakes. Please do not worry as you get sick of cryptosporidium poisoning or some other nasty bacterial infection in your gut. You will no doubt have the shits right now, well it's no problem our water company will simply add your diarrhoea to the water system, and you will drink it again. It's the circle of life and water. Faeces in tap water detected in 10 regions of England Thank you for paying your water bill especially as we have conveniently just raised our prices again. You're paying inflated charges to drink shit, microplastics, lead, arsenic and of course fluoride which is good for your teeth and will keep you nice and compliant.

Doh! Even Royalty Gets Cancer,"Who would have thought it, even members of the royal family get cancer. From the multitude of surprised press reports about King Charles getting the Big C, you would think that the royal family are viewed as superhuman beings, or in David Icke's case — reptilians from the Draco constellation. There is a fundamental difference of course in the treatment a prominent member of the royal family receives to that of the general public. They recieve the highest level of medical care and the best doctors who are on hand at all times to serve the royal cancer patient. This is in stark contrast to someone who is probably on the NHS, where an appointment for treatment can be over 6 months ahead, and by that time the patient will have deteriorated drastically. Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in the world, but if you are a royal it's okay, you are in good hands. It has not been revealed what type of cancer the monarch has, but it is almost a certainty that he will be cured soon enough, and all this hoo-ha will be gone. The release of the information about King Charles' illness is somewhat suspect, however it could be a way of normalising cancer as it becomes way more prevalent in these times. Microplastics, chemicals, food wrapped in plastic, and high amounts of sugar and hormones pumped into everything all play a part in the modern lifestyle of millions of people. Normalising something like cancer, when it used to be quite a rare occurrence, is also a way of surreptitiously covering up the epidemic. It is however with a sigh of relief to know that the members of the royal family are not reptilians, and are just normal human beings who are from a certain protected lineage. David Icke claims in his books that the royal family are part of the blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian race from the Alpha Draconis star system, now hiding in underground bases, and are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world's ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family.",Daily Squib,2024-02-08,Health,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54766-doh-even-royalty-gets-cancer.html
Why 2013 Was Great Year For the Spread of Syphilis and Super Gonorrhoea,"In the year 2000, according to CDC records and a recent study, syphilis was on the way out and nearly eradicated, then along came the dating apps like Tinder and gay app Grindr in 2012. Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV were suddenly back in vogue and began to rise again thanks to the dating apps capitalising on the ease of casual hook-ups and 2013 was a bumper year for a massive increase in STI spreading far and wide. Today in 2022, syphilis is at the same level as it was in the 1950s thanks to the success of casual dating apps. With an added drop in condom use especially with promiscuous gay men, HIV and AIDS are also increasing at an exponential level, but modern drugs halt certain death amongst this group of society. Syphilis if not treated can cause multiple health problems and can lead to death. All of this data points towards a fundamentally sick, masochistic society that even creates apps to increase its own level of sickness. The only positive is that nature finds a way to reduce the population level in a natural controlled manner and utilises human stupidity and greed to its advantage. Overpopulation is a very serious problem, and thankfully, dating apps created by greedy exploitative developers are a wonderful cure to the Malthusian Nightmare scenario plaguing the globe currently.",Daily Squib,2024-02-06,Health,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/health/54735-why-2013-was-great-year-for-the-spread-of-syphilis-and-super-gonorrhoea.html
Why the Abolition of Private Property is the Next Step,"It's happening in Hawaii, it will now happen in California, and it's happening in the UK. The future is one of Smart Cities where much of the population will not own anything. The initial proposals for this system were birthed by organisations like the World Economic Forum amongst many others. Large corporations are snapping up vast swathes of land and properties to implement a sinister form of Marxism deployed on populations. The key factor to remember here is that with the abolition of private property, individual land ownership ceases to exist, and populations thus become weaker and more dependent on the state. In the UK, the Labour government is utilising this technique on the farmers and their generational land by decreasing the threshold for Inheritance tax, therefore when the farmer dies, the family cannot continue to own the farm land but are forced to sell it. This is when the large corporations or the state step in, either utilising the land for wind farms or solar farms. Naturally, this process will decrease production of food within the UK, but to the masterminds of this agenda, the general populace is not a factor to care about. The Labour government does not care about the population, and their modus operandi is to create even more poverty, which leads to early death. This is another reason why they are targeting pensioners in the UK, as they want them to die early so that their wealth can be transferred to the state quicker. The introduction of the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) will also be the step after most of private property is abolished. This is part of the Global Collectivist Marxist Great Reset, which is a form of collectivism and wealth redistribution proposed by the WEF and BIS (Bank for International Settlements). Collectivism is part of the communist ideology, but what will make things different to the past communist vision, will be the utilisation of technology to control and subvert populations, as a form of oligarchical digital feudalism. For the controllers, the people who are above politics, and above business, and are unseen and unknown entities, democracy has become way too messy. Visible characters like Elon Musk may seem pretty high up and rich, but he is nothing but a useful idiot. Anyone who is visible is a mere pawn of the greater agenda. The UN and WEF have even praised China as the ideal model for all nations to employ regarding their technique in population governance and assimilation of certain capitalistic economic mechanisms within their core communist ideological framework. The truth is that China is actually poverty-stricken in most areas and much of their ""economic miracle"" is one big lie, especially with alarm bells ringing in much of the country's faltering economy. There currently is a big rush now to implement AI and integrate it into all areas of society and employment because the globe is moving towards the post consumerist era where all private property will be abolished. Artificial Intelligence and robots will essentially replace the current working population because humans are not deemed as productive or useful any more. Through Smart Cities, individuals who do not toe the line, or are seen as disruptive, will simply be cancelled. Without the ability to purchase anything, or have their heat cut off by those controlling the grid, many people will thus fall into poverty, eventually dying early. Behaviour modification chips will also be utilised on certain individuals in the future. For the controllers, the biggest problem at the moment are the 'useless eaters' vast parts of the population who are deemed as completely ineffectual and without any purpose. Much of the population are now a burden, as in the past they may have been tax slaves, but now with the advent of AI will render them even more useless than they already were. The controllers have already utilised the populations of the past to amass vast riches, and they have used this time to become so technologically advanced that they just have no need for the tax slaves of the past any more. In simple terms, populations will be whittled down slowly, a little here, a little there, maybe a pandemic here, a war there, little by little goes unnoticed to the blind population who are being led to the slaughterhouse day by day and are blinded and over-stimulated by a deluge of constant entertainment pumped into their microplastic infused mediocre brains.",Daily Squib,2025-01-14,Sci/Tech,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/59608-why-the-abolition-of-private-property-is-the-next-step.html
The End of Labour and the Birth of a New Economic Order,"The arrival of general-purpose robotics and artificial intelligence represents not just an industrial revolution, but the culmination of capital's historical trajectory: the full automation of labour itself. As Elon Musk's Optimus robot promises production costs below $20,000 per unit, we stand at the precipice of a transformation more profound than steam engines, electrification, or the microprocessor. For the cost of a single year's wage, a corporation may now purchase perpetual labour—a workforce unburdened by rest, wages, or rights—a new economic order. At first, this substitution will be incremental—logistics, manufacturing, warehousing. But as economies of scale drive costs lower, the scope of automation will expand: clerks, hotel staff, construction workers, nurses, and drivers—each sector succumbing to the cold efficiency of mechanised capital. The cost of human labour will not merely decline; it will collapse. And with it, the entire economic scaffolding of the past two centuries. We are witnessing some elements of the collapse of the labour force in the U.S. right now, as an example, President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration has struck fear amongst the illegal workforce who provide much of the manual labour in America's farming sector. Many farms depend on cheap labour provided by illegal immigrants and when they do not turn up to work out of fear, the fields and crop are left unattended. The way to solve this problem is to increase the pace of automation and robotic implementation, but the solution to the bottleneck may still be far ahead. If labour is eliminated, what remains of the consumer? Classical economics, from Adam Smith to Keynes, assumes an equilibrium wherein wages paid to workers translate into consumption, fuelling production in a virtuous cycle. But in a world where machines displace the wage earner, effective demand disintegrates. Mortgages, health insurance, pensions—entire industries predicated on the existence of a working class—will find themselves without customers. What remains is a stark bifurcation: either capital, now embodied in robots, absorbs surplus labour through a form of universal provision, or society fragments into an extreme duality—those who own the machines and those who own nothing. Enter Universal Basic Income. The notion that the state, rather than private employers, should act as the primary distributor of economic sustenance is not radical; rather, it is the logical outcome of capitalism's own success in eliminating the need for human labour. The automation of production must be met with an automation of distribution. UBI is not merely a policy proposal but an inevitability within post-labour economics. Indeed, as early as the 1970s, Richard Nixon nearly institutionalised a form of guaranteed income in the United States. The technocratic elite—Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Bezos—have already acknowledged that in the face of automation, the state must become the ultimate arbiter of economic survival. The alternative? Mass homelessness, social unrest, and an underclass left with no recourse but insurrection. Yet, one must ask: Who funds this redistribution? Does the state assume ownership over automated industries, thereby ensuring wealth flows to all, or does it rely on taxation—an ever-precarious attempt to extract surplus from a corporate class increasingly disinterested in sharing the spoils? If capital refuses to be taxed, will labour, now obsolete, demand its seizure? Marx observed that capitalists do not merely own wealth—they own the means by which wealth is produced. In the world of the machine, the capitalist no longer extracts surplus value from human labour; rather, value itself is generated purely through mechanised efficiency. The outcome is clear: Those who own the robots will own the future. As Juvenal stated over 2,500 years ago: ""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"" ""Who will guard the guards themselves?"" In one vision of this post-labour society, abundance is shared. Machines generate food, energy, healthcare, and housing, freely available to all. Humanity, freed from toil, enters a golden age of creation, leisure, and intellectual pursuit. One could even postulate that society could develop into a system of technological anarcho-communist hybrid. In another vision, the few who control automation become feudal lords of a machine-driven economy, their wealth compounding indefinitely while the displaced masses, now redundant, survive on stipends just sufficient to prevent revolt. The utopian rhetoric of the WEF's Great Reset—""you will own nothing and be happy""—could become a dystopian reality where ownership is so concentrated that citizenship itself is reduced to permanent dependency. Bertrand Russell envisioned a future where scientific management of society would liberate mankind from the drudgery of labour, allowing individuals to pursue higher intellectual and artistic callings. But what happens when humanity, conditioned for centuries to define itself by work, is suddenly made obsolete? Would humanity be cursed with a profound type of ennui? Science fiction has long imagined robotic uprisings, the Frankenstein's monster turning against its creator. But the true revolution may not be one of rebellion, but of quiet replacement. The replicants of Blade Runner did not demand freedom—they simply performed better than humans, rendering them unnecessary. Optimised automation will not come with a bang, nor with a war—it will come as an economic transition, a technological tiptoe, so seamless that the old world will fade unnoticed into irrelevance. And by the time humanity recognises what it has built, it may find itself at a crossroads: either more free than ever before or reduced to the passive observers of a world no longer requiring its very presence.",Daily Squib,2025-02-17,Sci/Tech,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sci_tech/60421-the-end-of-labour-and-the-birth-of-a-new-economic-order.html
Gaia-X: Data is the Future and the Europeans Are Harnessing Its Power,"One has to hand it to the Europeans, they are the masters of regulation, integration, collaboration, quality standards, and kings of data. The European standard of daedal excellence is all too prevalent in Gaia-X, as witnessed at the Helsinki 2024 Summit during the 14-15 of November. The colossal data project is currently headed by the towering CEO Ulrich Ahle, a veteran of multiple technical appointments at companies like Siemens and Atos. The amount of data that is produced by business within the EU, amongst its companies and its regulatory systems is immense, therefore it is only right that this data is directed through specialist data hubs to create an efficient network for stringent EU compliance regulations and automation between all complying manufacturers and companies involved. Imagine the amount of technical data from a company like Airbus regarding its multiple components, suppliers, technical, legal, mechanical systems constituting exabytes of data that in the traditional methods of working would take thousands of years to process for compliance, or in relation to production and manufacturing collaborative needs to be assimilated within the manufacturing process; but because of Gaia-X, it takes half-an-hour to parse—not two thousand years. Catherine Jestin, Gaia-X BoD Chairwoman; Executive Vice and President of Digital and Information Management, Airbus, explained the processes at play regarding the aerospace industry very succinctly during the conference. The key point here is interoperability, the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information where data between devices made by different manufacturers can be efficiently assimilated and integrated within a singular data stream for maximum productivity also helping collaboration between different sectors/manufacturers. The Gaia-X Digital Clearing House is essentially Open Source which brings forth a certain level of transparency within operational standardised EU Compliance contingencies, but the data hubs aim to push further globally, and not be constrained within the European framework. For example, Japan is now a major player within the Gaia-X data system, which is constantly expanding its global reach. The 800 pound gorilla in the room It goes without saying that the coterie of clerisy assembled at the conference offered immense detail and knowledge about their particular fields of expertise providing sufficient blood flow through the vena anastomotica during the summit as they were utilising technical, cerebral and almost robotic linguistics to somehow explain the enormity of the Gaia-X system. My main concern for the future was the immense data that will be needed for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). What struck me particularly about the conference was not only the cloud data system of Gaia-X but also how the ideopraxist vision of the corporate and EU technocrats corresponded with the writings of the French philosopher and thinker Jacques Ellul who in his 1964 book The Technological Society defined technique as the ensemble of methods that achieve efficiency in all fields of human activity. I had the opportunity to parley with the Gaia-X CEO Ulrich Ahle briefly during the conference, mentioning Jacques Ellul, along with 'technique' and he nodded his head knowingly. Ellul posited that the essence of technique lies in its self-perpetuating nature—once a technical method is discovered, it drives further advancements, often independent of societal needs or ethical considerations. This 'technique' ties in quite succinctly with Gaia-X and its inevitable push for total autonomy of technique, where techniques evolve on their own momentum, often unrestrained by human control or societal input. They are not merely tools but forces that shape human behaviour and societal structures. The guiding principle of technique is optimising processes for maximum efficiency, often side lining human and cultural values. While techniques themselves may be neutral, their adoption and implementation often lead to unintended and profound societal consequences. Ellul foresaw that techniques transform societies, creating dependencies and reducing human agency. They often precede and drive the moral, social, and economic frameworks that emerge around them. This elemental basis of technique is truly relevant when it comes to open source blockchain data projects like Gaia-X. My thoughts during the conference carried me towards the global proliferation of AGI, which is currently within the preliminary phase of pre-planning before being rolled out globally, simultaneously. The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will represent a profound leap in technological evolution, with implications resonating deeply with Jacques Ellul's philosophy and the principles underlying the Gaia-X project. AGI, will be an AI system capable of understanding, learning, and performing any intellectual task a human can, thus encapsulating the trajectory of Ellul's concept of technique: self-perpetuating, autonomous, and driven by the pursuit of efficiency above all else. The emergence of AGI would mark a point where technique not only shapes human behaviour, but potentially surpasses human agency altogether. There are caveats however to AGI. Ellul's cautionary stance on the autonomy of technique is particularly relevant when considering AGI. As AGI systems develop, they may become increasingly independent of human oversight, creating new pathways of knowledge and solutions that humanity neither anticipated nor fully comprehends. This mirrors Ellul's observation that technique evolves for its own sake, with efficiency as the primary driver. While AGI could optimise global processes—from healthcare to climate modelling—it also raises the question: at what cost? Will AGI's pursuit of technical solutions override ethical considerations, cultural nuances, or human welfare? Gaia-X offers an illustrative framework for exploring the intersection of human sovereignty and advanced technologies like AGI. Its emphasis on data interoperability and sovereignty provides a blueprint for maintaining control over complex, autonomous systems. If Gaia-X principles were extended to AGI, they could ensure that such systems remain aligned with human values by embedding accountability, transparency, and decentralised oversight into their operations. However, the integration of AGI into a system like Gaia-X also exemplifies the tension Ellul describes between human intention and the autonomous trajectory of technique. As AGI integrates into interoperable networks, it could accelerate the very self-perpetuation Ellul warned about, potentially amplifying the risks of loss of control, chaos and disorder. Moreover, the interplay between AGI, Gaia-X, and Ellul's philosophy underscores the critical need for ethical frameworks. Ellul highlighted the moral neutrality of technique, arguing that societal values must actively guide its application. Gaia-X's federated structure could serve as a model for ensuring AGI adheres to ethical principles by fostering collaboration amongst diverse stakeholders. This collective governance could mitigate the risks of monopolisation or misuse, ensuring AGI systems serve the common good rather than narrow interests. Ultimately, the advent of AGI, when viewed through the lens of Ellul's critique and Gaia-X's ambitions, represents both an unprecedented opportunity and a profound challenge. It calls for a reimagining of how humanity engages with technology—not as passive beneficiaries of efficiency but as active stewards of innovation. To balance the transformative potential of AGI with its inherent risks, society must adopt systems like Gaia-X while remaining vigilant about the deeper, often unpredictable consequences Ellul foresaw. This approach could help navigate the path to AGI responsibly, ensuring it enhances human agency rather than diminishing it. After the conference, back in the hotel bar, the beautiful Finnish barmaid handed me another glass of Kyrö wood smoked dry malt dulcifluous nectar and there I contemplated the enormity of the Gaia-X pabulum, not only in the technical sense, but also its all-encompassing vision of futuristic smart cities, artificial intelligence, nubiferous digital cloud systems and total non-human automation.",Daily Squib,2024-11-18,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/58367-gaia-x-data-is-the-future-and-the-europeans-are-harnessing-its-power.html
"EXPERTS: ""Net Zero"" is Impossible to Achieve Unless...","The EarthWise think tank has released a paper on the efficacy of ""Net Zero"" and the conditions for its successful implementation. Net Zero ""Net Zero as an ideological and conceptual principle is essentially a viable plan for sustainable human coexistence with the environment, however its implementation is impossible without multiple variables being realised. ""The UK's Net Zero targets refer to the legally binding commitment to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, as part of efforts to mitigate climate change. This goal was established under the Climate Change Act 2008, amended in 2019 to include the Net Zero target. ""The most important variable preventing Net Zero from being implemented is overpopulation. Not only is overpopulation a major problem within the UK, but it is also one that blights the globe. Britain's population is estimated to grow to 78 million by 2050. It would be impossible to provide sufficient energy capacity for such a bloated, overpopulated population with 'sustainable' Net Zero wind farms etc. There just would not be the energy capacity to cope with such a population rise. ""Without the drastic reduction in human population numbers globally and nationally, there is no point in attempting to implement Net Zero, because the sheer number of overpopulating humans make it unrealistic and untenable to achieve the necessary targets. ""We estimate through computational modelling that the global human population would have to be reduced by 80-90% for the carbon reduction targets to be successfully implemented. Without a reduction of the global population to 800 million humans from 8 billion, there would not be any point in trying to implement Net Zero because the number of polluting humans on earth would be too numerous. ""For the UK, a 90% reduction in the population would result in a population of approximately 6.7 million from 67 million. This level of population would be an ideal condition for the successful implementation of Net Zero. The last time the UK's population was around 6.7 million was in the late medieval period or early modern period, likely between the 14th and 16th centuries. This was before significant population growth driven by the Agricultural Revolution and later the Industrial Revolution. ""Once there is a reduction in population then, and only then, can the global population transition from fossil fuels to renewables like wind, solar, and nuclear and expand offshore wind capacity to 50 GW by 2030. The global population level, once reaching a sustainable level, must be maintained at that level with strict enforcement. ""The reduced level of population will also ensure a sustainable and achievable transfer to the complete electrification of cars, buses, and trains. Hydrogen and carbon capture technologies will also be able to be implemented more efficiently with a better chance of success. Carbon emissions from livestock and farming would be reduced as sustainable farming practices will be implemented. ""We reiterate. Without a sustainable reduction of the global population, it is impossible to implement the necessary targets successfully. It is folly to even attempt to do so without a reduction in levels of overpopulation. Under the current global conditions, it is thus futile to even attempt to implement Net Zero.""",Daily Squib,2024-11-22,Sci/Tech,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sci_tech/58504-experts-net-zero-is-impossible-to-achieve-unless.html
Elon Musk Was Tasked With Bringing True Surveillance to Intelligence Agencies,"Think about this, it is not enough to have internet surveillance data, mobile phone data, financial data, or even listening devices like Amazon Alexa/Echo funnelled directly to intelligence networks from people's homes. The true last bastion in the home is an active robot, whether it is a robotic vehicle or a humanoid robot. If someone or something lives with you, they will definitely glean more of an insight about you and your life. Surveillance and data gathering will have thus reached new levels. Elon Musk is thus at the forefront of this task given to him, and it does not end there either, the final-final bastion is the human brain itself, and Musk has that covered as well with his internal brain implants, which will be touted soon enough as a mode of increasing human intelligence levels. The Musk brain implant is still in its early phase, but the roll-out for robotic vehicles and humanoid robots is an open reality which is being actioned right now, as was witnessed at Musk's most recent event. Even though the robot displayed in the above video pouring drinks was basically an expensive remote control toy being operated by a human behind the scenes, it does give us a small glimpse into the near future, where autonomous robots will function in the service industries, corporate world and in homes across the world. Musk claims these robots will be marketed at the $30k mark, as well as the Robotaxis. That's probably a pipe dream during the early distribution cycle, but with enough of these machines being bought, it could definitely become a reality. Much like the automobile or the television were initially expensive when they were distributed globally, the price of new technology eventually becomes affordable to everyone given time. The Robotaxi will eventually revolutionise the urban transport landscape with not only effective transportation, but with regulating traffic across all roads. Instead of jams and bottlenecks in traffic, all of these vehicles will travel at a lower speed than traditional vehicles, and they will all be regulated in their behaviour with an almost hive type of mind ensuring that the traffic jams of the past are a distant memory. Yes, surveillance of your every conversation, and travel destination will be implemented, but no one cares about privacy any more. Human taxi drivers will also be a thing of the past, but during his presentation, Elon suggested that the former taxi drivers can purchase entire fleets of Robotaxis and thus continue making money. The service industry in the UK is truly awful, therefore it actually would be great to have robots serving in restaurants and bars. It would make a change from some grumpy fucker slamming down your plate then demanding a huge tip afterwards. As is always the case though, what costs $30,000 in the U.S. will invariably be priced at £65,000 in the UK, that is if we ever get distribution over here. Most likely, robots will be rolled out years after the Americans get first dibs. If you are fearful of the loss of privacy with these new robots, forget about it. Personal privacy was lost by humans decades ago. That ship has sailed from port a long, long time ago. Today, there is zero privacy, and it's going to stay that way from now on. There is nothing anyone can do now about the level of surveillance on each individual. At the end of the day, what will make the robots a success will be their data mining potential. The agencies and companies interested in this data will be paying top dollar for it, and it will bring new insights into the habits of consumers. The drawbacks are of course that many people in the service industries will lose their jobs, but that is a minor consideration to the giant leap forward in technological advancement and technique.",Daily Squib,2024-10-13,Sci/Tech,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/sci_tech/57914-elon-musk-was-tasked-with-bringing-true-surveillance-to-intelligence-agencies.html
"EU to Police Thoughtcrime by Deploying AI ""Hate Speech"" Scanners","The definition of 'hate speech' is anything the controlling body who creates the rules does not like. What can be construed as permissible one day, can be interpreted as 'hate speech' another day, simply on the whim of the controllers. What you say one day can be okay, the next day however, you find yourself criminalised. As Juvenal said quite astutely ""Who controls the controllers?"" or in Latin ""Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes"". AI Big Brother EU Newspeak The European Union is not known for its 'democracy' and is evolving into more totalitarian territory, with frankly scary plans to use an Antwerp based company's AI advanced Large Language Model (LLM) called CaLICO. At least in George Orwell's 1984 he envisaged rows of humans altering and checking the news and all communication. The EU no doubt gave this company, funnily named 'Textgain', a huge sum of money to develop their AI monstrosity to police human speech and opinion, further destroying the last vestiges of free speech remaining. Of course, AI 'never' makes mistakes, and no doubt people will be criminalised and detained all because of some fucking out-of-control software programmed by woke Marxists, but that's the EU for you in a nutshell. As is usual in a totalitarian regime policed by AI machines, say the wrong thing, and you will no doubt be unpersoned and taken to Room 101, where you will have a choice of either accepting the evil Stasi regime or be liquidated, all at the behest of an AI software programmed by the controlling woke Marxist totalitarian regime. Thinkpol EU Directive 35465-8S CEO Guy De Pauw: ""Large language models, especially commercial ones, refuse to process toxic language. This makes it almost impossible to use them to process hate speech. We are now building a language model from scratch that can process this type of content — but without generating it. That's what makes us different."" Funded by the EU Textgain recently received a strong boost as one of the four winners of the Large AI Grand Challenge, a prestigious competition for European AI developers in which 94 international companies participated. It won not only €250,000, but also two million hours of development time on a European supercomputer allowing for much faster new AI model training. COO Redouan el Hamouchi: ""In our digitalized world, there is a growing need for advanced tools to moderate content. Multilingualism is essential in this respect. We are pleased that we can train our application faster, so that it can handle different languages and cultures within the European Union.""

What Are the Best Ways to Show Appreciation to Employees?,"Everyone likes to feel special and appreciated, especially in the workplace where they put in the best effort. The sad thing is that many businesses go years and sometimes decades without showing their employees how much they appreciate them. The results are low morale, unhappy employees, and a high churn rate. To help you avoid these issues, we have outlined some of the best ways to show appreciation to your employees. While they are still excellent options, many ways to show employees your appreciation are expected and sometimes cliché. This is why you should always think of something new that will surprise and delight them. A great example is sending them a letter or note of recognition. You can use one of the many available letter templates to get started, and then add a personal message you know they will like. When you do this, try to ensure each letter or note is as personal or specific as possible. While you might think generic letters and notes will save you time, they will only serve to annoy your employees when different employees realise you sent them the same message in different letter formats. To ensure these notes have as much impact as possible, mail them physically instead of emailing them. Emails can get lost in all the messages they receive, but most people have not received a letter in years, or ever, so they will appreciate one immensely. Receiving one is a huge deal, and it becomes even more impactful when they realise that the letter is for appreciating a good job they have done. Some employees appreciate monetary rewards more than other types of recognition, so these options would work well for them. The most common type of financial reward is performance-based bonuses. These tell the employees they have been doing a great job, and they are getting rewarded for it. An alternative to these types of bonuses is spot bonuses. Business leaders and managers can hand these out after particularly challenging projects or when the employee has excelled at a task. They are much more impactful because, much like recognition letters and notes, they are unexpected. Salary increases are another excellent way of showing employees your appreciation. Employees want to know that you value their work, and that is reflected in the increase you give them. Lastly, you can give stock options or equity gains. They help employees feel they have some ownership of the company. The added benefit of these bonuses is that they can increase employee loyalty, reduce churn rate, and decrease hiring and training costs. Many businesses do not invest in their employees' professional development. They expect them to gain new skills and level up their skills without input from the business, at their own time, and their own cost. Businesses that take the different approach of providing professional development opportunities typically have happier employees who are more likely to stay with them for longer. Businesses can provide such opportunities by sponsoring conference attendance. These conferences provide excellent learning opportunities and can help employees gain new skills that make them better at their jobs. They also provide additional networking opportunities. While no business wants to let its employees go, those who feel like you are allowing them to rise the professional ranks will always be grateful and happy to go above and beyond for the business. Businesses can also support professional development by paying for educational courses. These days, there are innumerable online courses that teach different skills employees can learn from. Businesses can show their recognition and appreciation of their employees by paying for these courses outright or reimbursing employees who complete them and earn certifications. It is fine to appreciate employees privately, but doing so publicly can also have a significant positive impact on metrics like employee happiness. Businesses can use numerous options to show employee recognition publicly, starting with company-wide email announcements. If your business regularly sends employees emails, you can use one of these emails to show appreciation to specific employees. You can make this a monthly or quarterly thing, but many businesses see the best outcomes when they show appreciation after specific projects. Effective employee appreciation and recognition require a careful approach and serious thought while combining different recognition options for different employees. Personalised or public recognition, depending on the employee, can work very well to make them feel valued and seen, both of which can have a positive impact on their performance, happiness, and loyalty.",Daily Squib,2025-01-06,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/59460-what-are-the-best-ways-to-show-appreciation-to-employees.html
Navigating EV Chargers: A Guide for Business Owners,"As electric vehicles (EVs) become more mainstream, business owners are presented with a unique opportunity to tap into a growing market by installing an electric vehicle charging hub on their properties. By offering charging options, businesses can not only attract a steady flow of customers but also contribute to a more sustainable future. This guide will help you understand the importance of EV chargers and what steps to take to prepare your business for the growing demand. The rise in electric vehicle adoption is transforming the way people drive, and businesses that install EV chargers are positioning themselves at the forefront of this shift. Having chargers on-site can attract customers who drive electric vehicles, as they are often looking for convenient and reliable places to charge their cars while they shop, eat, or work. Additionally, installing EV chargers can lead to increased foot traffic, longer stays, and, ultimately, higher sales. Lastly, with governments around the world pushing for greener transportation solutions, investing in EV chargers could help your business stay ahead of potential regulations and incentives for clean energy. When it comes to selecting EV chargers, it's important to choose equipment that aligns with your business needs. For example, businesses located in high-traffic areas or those within the retail space may benefit from installing ultra-rapid chargers to accommodate drivers looking for a quick top-up. Before installing EV chargers, it's crucial to assess if your existing electrical infrastructure can handle the added load. Installing multiple chargers may strain your power supply, requiring upgrades like new circuits, transformers, or even a new connection to the grid. This ensures the system supports current and future needs. For larger installations, a new substation may be necessary to provide additional capacity and maintain system stability. Working with an Independent Connection Provider (ICP) can simplify this process. ICPs are authorised to design and build grid connections, ensuring compliance, streamlining installation, and expediting the deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, consider the costs associated with the installation process. Some regions offer grants, tax credits, or other financial incentives to businesses that install EV chargers. Be sure to explore these opportunities to help offset some of the upfront costs of setting up your charging stations. Once your EV chargers are installed, it's time to let your customers know. One of the most effective ways to do this is by updating your online presence. Many EV drivers rely on charging apps and websites to find nearby charging stations. Make sure your business is listed on these platforms, and include your charger details, such as the type of chargers and their availability. In addition to online listings, clear signage at your business location is essential. Make sure your chargers are easy to find and clearly marked to guide customers to the right spot. You can also offer promotions, such as discounted or free charging for a limited time, to encourage customers to visit and try out your new service. To maximise the impact of your chargers, think beyond just installing the equipment. Consider turning your location into a true electric vehicle charging hub. By offering additional amenities, such as comfortable seating areas, free Wi-Fi, or even food and drinks, you can create a destination where EV drivers will want to stop and spend time. Installing EV chargers at your business is a smart investment that can help you attract more customers, improve your brand's image, and contribute to a more sustainable future. By selecting the right chargers, preparing your infrastructure, and promoting the new service, you can ensure that your business stands out in the growing electric vehicle market. With the right planning and execution, your investment in EV chargers can offer long-term rewards and position your business as a leader in the green revolution.",Daily Squib,2024-12-06,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/58978-navigating-ev-chargers-a-guide-for-business-owners.html
How AI is Shaking Up Affiliate Marketing and Informational Sites,"Affiliate marketing used to be a thriving industry where businesses and creators worked hand-in-hand. But now, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to shake things up. And unlike McDonald's, not everyone's lovin' it—especially informational sites that depend on traffic and affiliate deals to survive. So, what's going on? AI has made marketing easier and faster. Predicting trends, creating content, and personalising customer experiences are all things AI does better than any human. For businesses, it's a no-brainer. Why pay affiliates or rely on informational sites when AI can handle it all? With tools that crunch data in seconds, companies can find the best keywords, figure out where ads should go, and target their perfect customers without needing help. That leaves informational sites—once crucial for guiding traffic and boosting SEO—feeling a bit redundant. Sites like Bingo Paradise, which focus on creating expert-written, unbiased reviews, are increasingly going to face challenges. AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper AI churn out articles faster than any human writer can, and they're often optimised to climb search engine rankings. Businesses can now produce their own content in-house, instead of relying on affiliates or informational sites to drive visitors their way. And here's the kicker: search engines seem to love this AI-created content. That means sites like Bingo Paradise are finding it harder to get noticed, losing traffic to the flood of AI-generated blogs and articles out there. AI is making it easier for companies to deal directly with customers. Using machine learning, they can figure out exactly what their audience wants and serve it up with personalised ads, recommendations, and even chatbots. This direct-to-consumer approach is bad news for informational sites and affiliates, who used to act as the middlemen. It's a double whammy for informational sites. Organic traffic is dropping, and affiliate payouts are getting smaller. With businesses investing in AI to do the heavy lifting, these sites are finding it harder to rank in search results or offer anything that stands out. Despite these challenges, sites like Bingo Paradise can still provide significant value in an AI-driven world. The reviews offered on platforms like this aren't just content churned out by algorithms—they're based on real-world, lived experiences. AI simply can't replicate the human effort involved in trying and testing bingo brands. For instance, a proper review requires signing up to the platform, navigating the interface, playing games, and even depositing money to assess the site as a genuine player. These steps ensure the reviews are comprehensive and authentic. Additionally, evaluating customer service—whether through live chat, email, or phone support—requires actual interaction to gauge responsiveness, professionalism, and helpfulness. In a similar way, a function of Bingo Paradise is to list and categorise welcome offers. For instance, if a brand claims to be offering free spins no deposit, Bingo Paradise's team will actually check that claim (by claiming the offer) and listing the offer here – Ai just can't do that... yet! This hands-on approach is something AI cannot do. While AI can summarise data or compile information, it lacks the ability to provide genuine insights based on actual user experiences. This authenticity is what makes Bingo Paradise's content trustworthy and valuable to readers looking for honest recommendations. But all isn't lost. Sites can fight back by using AI themselves—creating better content, improving their user experience, and finding clever ways to stand out. Focusing on niche topics, building a loyal community, and offering something personal or interactive could be the key to staying relevant. There's no denying AI is changing everything, and it's not going to stop. For sites like Bingo Paradise, staying ahead means adapting quickly, trying new strategies, and making the most of what humans still do best—connecting with other humans. Businesses, on the other hand, are loving the AI revolution. It's helping them cut costs, engage directly with customers, and leave less room for traditional sites to play their part. If informational sites don't evolve soon, they risk being left behind in this fast-moving, AI-dominated world.",Daily Squib,2024-12-10,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/59037-how-ai-is-shaking-up-affiliate-marketing-and-informational-sites.html
Building Resilience: How Businesses Can Thrive Amid Industry Disruptions,"Business resilience is the ability of a company to adapt successfully to disruptions, maintain its operations, and safeguard its assets and reputation. It sometimes involves crisis management and encompasses proactive measures, including innovation, strategic planning, and workforce engagement for long-term stability. The most resilient businesses share a few important traits: agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Agility is the cornerstone of business resilience. Businesses that can successfully pivot in response to market changes or disruptions are often the ones that survive and thrive. Agility enables companies to identify and act on emerging opportunities before their competitors. Agile organisations empower teams to make swift, informed decisions. Diversifying revenue streams can help to build agility. Relying on a single product or market leaves a business vulnerable to disruption. Leveraging technology and tools like real-time data analytics also helps; companies can monitor trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Consulting with professionals like corporate solicitors can help businesses during restructures or acquisitions. These legal experts can advise on compliance with company law, draft contracts for new ventures, and offer guidance on funding and investment. Preparedness is the ability to anticipate and plan for potential disruptions. Companies that invest in robust contingency planning can maintain their operations and recover more quickly from any setbacks. Being prepared means teams know what to do in emergencies, reducing downtime and minimising damage. Prepared organisations often have resources to weather temporary revenue declines or unexpected expenses. Innovation helps businesses stay relevant in constantly changing markets. Businesses that strive to continuously improve and invest in new ideas are better equipped for shifting consumer preferences and technological advancements. Innovative companies can differentiate themselves by offering unique products, services, or solutions. Jacob Beckley, Fusion92's senior vice president of innovation, has told Business News Daily, ""[Innovation] embodies the improvement of something that has come before. It is the evolution of convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness."" No business can build resilience without strong leadership. In times of disruption, leaders provide the vision, stability, and decision-making that keeps teams focused and motivated. Effective leaders communicate openly and honestly with their teams, fostering trust even in uncertain situations. Michael Shribman, president and founder at APS Global Partners Inc, has written that effective communication leads to increased productivity, enhanced collaboration, better decision-making, and customer satisfaction. Leadership is also important in navigating legal and organisational complexities. Leaders may work closely with legal experts to address challenges such as regulatory compliance, liability management, and reorganisations. Data is a powerful tool to predict and respond to industry disruptions. Businesses that leverage analytics gain insights into market trends, operational inefficiencies, and potential risks. Using predictive analytics, companies can anticipate disruptions through trend analytics. Building resilience is not a one-time effort but rather an ongoing process that requires agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Even amid constant disruption, businesses that embrace these traits can navigate challenges and seize opportunities, ensuring their long-term success. From adapting quickly to market changes to developing contingency plans and fostering innovation, resilience allows an organisation to thrive in uncertainty.",Daily Squib,2024-12-01,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/58903-building-resilience-how-businesses-can-thrive-amid-industry-disruptions.html
Labour and Sadiq Khan Kill Off Smithfield Market After Surviving 900 Years,"Smithfield was the site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a meat market in the Victorian period, when bringing livestock into the growing city became impractical. The famous meat market was located just outside the City's historic walls. Smithfield was the site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a market. The current Grade II listed market buildings were built in the Victorian period. Now, after 900 years, it will be shut down forever thanks to the Labour government's inflationary anti-business budget. Because of the high costs of the new Labour budget and resultant inflationary costs, sadly, adverse economic pressures eventually forced the closure after a failed move to Dagenham, East London. ""Project costs have risen due to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction, which have made the move unaffordable,"" the City corporation said in a statement on Tuesday. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in 1868. Planners for the Labour controlled City of London now want to demolish the 900-year-old market to build bland social housing projects for illegal migrants in the heart of the City. Smithfield and Billingsgate markets were London institutions and defined the capital for 900 years but have tragically fallen to the incompetence, naive idiocy and economic ignorance of Labour policies. ""This market is sacred ground for many Londoners. It's survived wars, plagues, fires, civil unrest, famines, and everything else, but it could not survive the stupid cunts who run the Labour government,"" a former market trader stated. In other news: Due to heavy anti-business red tape, and costs caused by Labour, the Vauxhall car company will also shut in Luton losing 1,100 jobs.

UK Businesses Speeding Up AI Integration and Firing Staff,"Because of the insane, irresponsible actions of Rachel Reeves, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is NOT qualified for the job, businesses are now speeding up the process for AI integration whilst firing their overpriced human staff.

"Why Labour is Killing Off Aspiration, Entrepreneurs and Deterring Foreign Investors","The active attack on business, entrepreneurs and foreign investment in the UK is a classic example of how the Labour Party works. Labour's wretched Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, along with being a vindictive vengeful Leninist harridan, is hell-bent on destroying established family businesses, and any incentive to start new ones, with her 20 per cent Family Death Tax, levied each time a family business passes a generation. Labour's decision to kill off home-grown family businesses and entrepreneurs is a tragedy. In particular, small businesses and start-ups will suffer and become extinct after being disproportionally punished. Labour has demonstrated its true colours with a reprehensible budget that is engrained within Marxist communist idealogical policies. Let it not be a mystery why Labour is causing huge damage to the business world and economy of Britain at large. We provide the answers to why Labour is carrying out the destruction of entrepreneurship and business in the UK. The Labour Party has shown its true communist, anti-capitalist political ideology with the Rachel Reeves budget, which needlessly increased taxes by over £40 billion — the highest tax burden in British history. Its adoption of pure Marxist ideological processes has ruined any form of aspiration or entrepreneurs here in the UK, damaging the British economy for the next four or five decades.",Daily Squib,2024-11-04,Business,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/business/58174-why-labour-is-killing-off-aspiration-entrepreneurs-and-deterring-foreign-investors.html
VR Table Tennis Will Encourage the Growth of Table Tennis Worldwide,"If ten years ago, esports disciplines were perceived by society as a form of leisure for teenagers, today, the attitude towards this direction has changed. This opinion is evidenced by the popularisation of esports in the media space, where authors of materials report on the results of competitions or the number of visitors during esports tournaments. In addition, most fans of esports games and traditional sports can enthusiastically accept the appearance of virtual table tennis. This is an expected event since the following types of e-sports disciplines are already in demand: efootball, ebasketball, and ehockey. VR table tennis was part of the first Olympic eSports Week in June 2023 in Singapore, when it was held as an exhibition event. The success of this landmark event has motivated the International Table Tennis Federation Executive Board to approve the creation of a virtual reality table tennis tournament next year. ITTF President Petra Sörling noted that VR table tennis will encourage the growth of table tennis worldwide. It is also important that VR table tennis attracts the attention of leading brands that provide sports and esports content. For example, the BETER brand has added VR table tennis competitions to its sports portfolio, which has already featured competitions in real table tennis and basketball. In the Setka Cup (BETER Sports' flagman product) virtual reality competition, professional athletes play in a virtual reality format. Each professional table tennis player wears a VR headset, and the competition takes place in the state-of-the-art BETER table tennis simulator.

Mississippi Giving $1000 Reward to Bounty Hunters For Illegal Alien Deportations,"The proposed bill would offer a $1,000 reward to registered bounty hunters for each successful deportation they help facilitate. This reward, funded by the general assembly and administered by the state treasurer, is intended to encourage collaboration between law enforcement and private citizens in identifying individuals unlawfully residing in Mississippi, thereby assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in their removal efforts. Mississippi's House Bill 1484 proposes the creation of a hotline where people can report immigrants in the country illegally. Reports that result in arrest and imprisonment are eligible for a $1,000 reward. Separately, the bill proposes the creation of the ""Mississippi Illegal Alien Certified Bounty Hunter Program"" through which the state government can license ""bounty hunters"" to ""find and detain illegal aliens."" Bounty hunters from many neigbouring states are now rushing to Mississippi to see if they can be included in the program. If other states adopt the same program, the problem of illegal immigration could be solved in less than six months purely on the monetary incentives. As of today's report, the bill has not passed yet, but due to the urgency and magnitude of the illegal alien problem in the United States, and the Trump administration putting such importance on the issue, the bill is set to pass very soon.

The Global Woke Communist Agenda of USAID is Tip of the Iceberg,"Under the Obama and Biden administrations, the global Woke communist campaign brought the world to the brink of an agenda so nefarious that it may take literally generations and decades for many nations to recover. USAID was one of the tools utilised to forward the global woke communist offensive, funded unwittingly by the U.S. taxpayers. Things are moving forward in America now thankfully for the American people with the Trump presidency, but unfortunately in the UK, the deranged administration of Keir Starmer is doubling down on their woke Marxist manifesto of madness, as are the EU.

The Daily Squib noticed a shift in 2013 when our website was nearly wiped off the internet. Speaking at the 2024 Davos event, IN's CEO argued that global advertisers should give preference to spending ad dollars on ""good news."" In other words, this would pressure companies to spend exclusively on far-left corporate media outlets while ensuring they slash ad spending on alternative media websites that do not promote state propaganda. USAID has pushed nearly half a billion dollars ($472.6m) through a secretive US government financed NGO, ""Internews Network"" (IN), which has ""worked with"" 4,291 media outlets, producing in one year 4,799 hours of broadcasts reaching up to 778 million people and ""training"" over 9000 journalists (2023 figures). IN has also supported social media censorship initiatives. The operation claims ""offices"" in over 30 countries, including main offices in US, London, Paris and regional HQs in Kiev, Bangkok and Nairobi. It is headed up by Jeanne Bourgault, who pays herself $451k a year. Bourgault worked out of the US embassy in Moscow during the early 1990s, where she was in charge of a $250m budget, and in other revolts or conflicts at critical times, before formally rotating out of six years at USAID to IN. Bourgault's IN bio and those of its other key people and board members have been recently scrubbed from its website but remain accessible at http://archive.org. Records show the board being co-chaired by Democrat securocrat Richard J. Kessler and Simone Otus Coxe, wife of NVIDIA billionaire Trench Coxe, both major Democratic donors. In 2023, supported by Hillary Clinton, Bourgault launched a $10m IN fund at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). The IN page showing a picture of Bourgault at the CGI has also been deleted.

Preparations For Massive US Military Base in Gaza Already Underfoot,"The new US military base proposed for Gaza will be vast and include airstrips as well as barracks for thousands of troops, and it's all thanks to Hamas who have effectively gifted this opportunity to the Americans. ""Hamas were played real good. They fell into the trap, and have now lost Gaza for good, for the Palestinian people. It is sad to say for the Palestinians, they should have never accepted Hamas as their overlords who sent them into destruction,"" a commentator revealed on Wednesday. The US military base will not only serve as a key staging post for US interests in the region but will also protect the newly developed luxury holiday resort of Gaza on the Sea when it is constructed. Trump will now use the Gaza pier port which was built by Joe Biden for $230 million for Gaza aid to Palestinians as a major unloading terminal for building materials and construction equipment. The temporary port will then be adapted to a permanent one. As the Arab world stood by and watched, changes were made in the Middle East that will forever seal its fate, and the Iranian and Hezbollah regimes are now solidly on the back foot, along with the Russians and Chinese.

Trump Begins Deportation of 200 Indians Back to India,"The Trump mass deportation initiative is well underway with the deportation of 200 illegal Indians back to India in a C-17 plane.

More efficiency needed These are expensive flights, and one wonders if the Trump administration could cut costs by shipping them in cargo ships instead? To ship the migrants in a cargo ship would be the optimal cheaper option, and more illegal migrants could be accommodated at once. Logistically speaking, a supertanker could easily hold 12,000–20,000 people, however there could be a problem in converting the ships to hold passengers as they are primarily designed only for non-human cargo but with a little ingenuity it could be done. Additionally, specialist camps would have to be built near the ports so that the illegal aliens could be held en masse before being deported on the waiting tankers to their final destination. Yes, this would involve some cost and logistical planning, but it would literally save billions in costs, because shipping illegals by the 200 in military aircraft is hugely expensive and time-consuming, especially to destinations like India. If Trump wants to get serious, he's going to have to up his game because these are rookie numbers he's dealing with here. He needs to build holding camps ASAP. He needs to acquire and retrofit ships. He needs to mobilise street by street search squads and detain illegals with trucks. Otherwise, 200 here, 200 there, is purely a symbolic gesture for the cameras, it's like a drop in the ocean. Remember, there are an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the USA right now.",Daily Squib,2025-02-04,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60164-trump-begins-deportation-of-200-indians-back-to-india.html
TRUMP THIRD TERM: Four Years Not Enough to Undo Biden Damage,"There has to be a way for President Donald J. Trump to go for a third term in office. The amount of work that needs to be done to America to fix the terrible damage will take more than four years to complete, and if the people want another Trump term, he should be allowed to complete his work for the sake of the nation. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 in response to Franklin Roosevelt's four-term presidency. Before Roosevelt, no president had ever run for reelection after serving two terms — a norm that dated back to George Washington. Some could say that Barack Obama effectively had a third term when Joe Biden was supposedly voted in to office in 2020 despite being clinically senile. It was the Obama administration that conducted much of the operations during the four-year nightmare. The good news is that Trump was elected as president for non-consecutive terms, therefore technically speaking, the 22nd Amendment could be altered to take this fact into account, and he could put himself forward for another election as a de facto second (third) term. The downside to this would be that Trump would be 82 years old by the end of his current four-year term, and his general health and mental state could have deteriorated by then. De-woking the United States is going to be one hell of a task, and Trump is pretty much the only candidate at the moment capable of such an enormous commitment. Hopefully, the 22nd Amendment can be tweaked and adjusted for the sake of the great United States.",Daily Squib,2025-02-03,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/60154-trump-third-term-four-years-not-enough-to-undo-biden-damage.html
Re-entering the Workplace: Top Tips for Securing a New Job After a Break,"Taking a career break can be rejuvenating and provide valuable life experiences. However, returning to work after an extended period away can also be daunting. The workplace changes rapidly, and you may feel out of touch with the current job market. By taking the right steps to update your skills and polish your application, you can successfully relaunch your career. Today, we will discuss some tips to help you land that ideal job and smoothly re-enter the professional world. Follow this guidance to refresh your CV, ace the interview and leverage your break into a unique selling point. A well-written cover letter is your chance to introduce yourself and explain your reasons for applying. With competition often fierce, your letter must grab the recruiter's attention. Avoid generic openings and make your motivation clear from the outset. Explain how your skills make you the ideal candidate. Cover letter templates can provide useful starting points, but ensure your letter sounds natural and reflects your personality. Tailor the content to the role, highlighting relevant experience. Refer to the job description and use matching keywords. Research the company values and link these to your own qualities. Keep to one page in length and check for errors. Use a formal tone, but inject some warmth by avoiding clichés. Sign off with a note of appreciation for their consideration. With a compelling, polished cover letter, you can get your application noticed. A strong CV summarises your career history and showcases your abilities. After a break, carefully update your CV to reflect any new skills gained and your current career aims. List your work chronologically, keeping the details concise and relevant. Emphasise accomplishments and the value you brought to past employers. Use powerful action verbs like ""led"", ""spearheaded"", and ""accelerated"". Consider adding a brief profile at the top highlighting your most relevant skills and experience. This provides immediate impact when read quickly. Explain any gaps positively, focusing on new capabilities, volunteering or training. List relevant courses, certificates, languages and IT skills. Check that references are current and ask for endorsements from LinkedIn contacts. Review it for spelling and formatting errors before sending it out. A polished, well-structured CV will make the shortlist. Thorough preparation is key to interview success. Research the company, role and current industry trends. Compile relevant examples that demonstrate desired competencies like teamwork, creativity or leadership. Plan your route to arrive 10 minutes early. Dress smartly and professionally. Greet the interviewer warmly and with good eye contact. Listen carefully to each question. Provide concise yet detailed responses relating back to the role requirements. Prepare intelligent questions that show your understanding of and interest in the company. Avoid interrogating the interviewer but ask for clarification if needed. Finally, finish strongly by summarising your suitability for the role. With practice and planning, you can present yourself as the ideal candidate. A career gap can set you apart if leveraged well. Draw out skills gained during your time away that would benefit the new employer. Emphasise any experiences relevant to the role, like volunteering, study, travel or family care. Explain how the break has energised you and given you renewed focus. Highlight what motivates you about this next step and why it excites you. Convey your passion and readiness to throw yourself into the new opportunity. Frame your break as an asset that has allowed personal growth and the chance to develop abilities. With the right spin, taking time out can strengthen your application and reveal you as a well-rounded, motivated candidate. Networking is crucial when re-entering the job market. Attend industry events and connect with former colleagues. Join alum groups and professional associations to widen your contacts. Consider informational interviews to gain advice from those in your target field. A strong network provides support and surfaces unadvertised opportunities. Consider short courses or online training to refresh industry knowledge and technical skills. Gain relevant qualifications and certificates to fill any gaps in your CV. Emphasise your commitment to lifelong learning. Some employers may fund work-related education, so highlight your desire to continue developing. Re-entering the workplace after a break requires thorough preparation but offers a chance for a fresh start. Follow the guidance above to showcase your talents, highlight your renewed ambition and prove you are ready to hit the ground running.

"An Englishman’s Guide to American “Football” (Which Isn’t Football at All, Really)","Right, listen up, ein Britishers! We need to have a chat about this peculiar American pastime they call ""football."" Now, before you start assuming it's just our beloved game with a few quirky rule changes (like baseball is to cricket—an inferior imitation), let me stop you right there. This so-called ""football"" has about as much in common with football as a Labour politician has with common sense. Here's the first and most glaring issue: they barely use their fucking feet. Okay, there's a bit of kicking here and there—once every 45 minutes when someone remembers they actually have a foot—but for the most part, it's a game of throwing, carrying, and smashing into each other like a bunch of blootered pensioners outside a Wetherspoons on a Saturday afternoon. In fact, if we're being historically accurate, American football is far more like rugby than it is football. It started out as a chaotic mash-up of rugby and association football in the late 19th century, when American universities decided that simply playing one of the perfectly good existing sports from England wasn't confusing enough. No, like all American mash-ups they had to invent their own Frankensteinian version—one where they could wear a suit of fucking armour, stop every seven seconds for a committee meeting, and somehow still call it ""football."" Back in the 1860s and 1870s, American universities were playing various versions of football, some resembling association football (our actual football) and others closer to rugby. Eventually, a chap named Walter Camp—an American, of course—decided that rugby wasn't quite organised enough, so he took it upon himself to ruin it with a bunch of additional rules, such as the line of scrimmage, downs, and most outrageously, the forward pass. The forward pass is where this game really goes off the rails. In rugby, you pass backwards like a civilised person. In American football, they decided, ""Nah, let's chuck it 40 yards forward and hope for the best."" The result? A sport where hulking meathead jock brutes throw missiles at each other while wearing enough padding to survive a car crash. If you're a Brit watching American football for the first time, here's what you need to know: So there you have it, the Daily Squib guide to a game called American ""football"" which isn't really football—it's a bizarre, stop-start, hyper-commercialised fucked up version of rugby on steroids with added bureaucracy and unnecessarily complicated rules. But let's be fair to the Yanks—it is entertaining in its own over-the-top way, and the Super Bowl is quite the spectacle (mainly because of the half-time show and the woke NFL adverts, but still). Next time you're forced to watch this odd spectacle with American mates, just remember: it's not football, it's rugby with timeouts, an advertising budget, and a slightly inflated sense of self-importance.

Experts: Why Trump Should Not Spare the UK Whilst Under Labour Rule,"The UK under Labour is no friend to the United States, or to Trump. In fact, Labour is no friend to the UK either, and hates Britain, its history, its legacy, its culture and its people. Business is being punished, pensioners are being killed off, and heavy-duty taxation upon taxation and insane bureaucratic red tape has caused 80% of the UK's wealthy to flee Britain. Only last week, the irresponsibly stupid Chancellor Reeves caused a £459 million Glaxo deal to fall through the floor. Everything this arrogant harridan touches turns to shit. Forget about economic growth, the only thing Reeves knows how to grow is Britain's debt mountain and her fucking cunt hair. Trump needs to put tariffs on the UK by up to 60% or more and punish the Labour government with no mercy, because frankly, did they show mercy when they sent 100 of their communist activist agitators when they tried to thwart his re-election? Angela Rayner thinks Trump is an ""absolute buffoon. He has no place in the White House. He's an embarrassment, and he should be ashamed of himself"". Labour Foreign Minister, Lammy thinks Trump is ""a racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser"" and ""a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath"". Peter Mandelson, despite his grovelling apology to Trump, still called him a ""danger to the world"" and ""a white nationalist and racist"". Britain is lost under Labour, it is now a nation that has been effectively taken over by the enemy of the USA, the enemy of the UK and the enemy of Trump. There's no ""special relationship"" left any more, and Labour have sealed themselves in alliance with China and the EU. There's no room for you Trump, there's no impetus for any goodies to come to the US with any trade deals or any economic riches. Rachel Reeves is continuing to ruin the economy and impoverish the embattled people of Britain daily with her negative-growth anti-capitalist strategies. Forget about Britain, it is now a cesspool of woke communist rhetoric, a ruined economy teetering on the edge of a very deep precipice. The strategy should be to deepen and hasten Labour's descent into the sewer by punishing the economy further. Once they have been ousted, it can be business as usual, but do not deal with these backstabbing shit talking fuckers while they're around.

ANALYSIS: Was Prince Harry Making a Statement in Latest Address?,"Yes, Prince Harry was a gunner on an Apache helicopter in Afghanistan for 6 weeks, and he served his country briefly, but royal fans have been questioning his 'ludicrous' display of medals for his brief stint in the military in his latest video address. ""Arse!"" Royal fans were up in arms when they saw a blurred, wonky amateur video of the prince on his porch in Montecito wearing medals all over a cheap looking civilian suit. One Twitter X user commented: ""What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned"" Another X user revealed: ""He looks like a prize ninny! Who's he trying to fool?"" However, others defended the duke, with one user Laquisha46 commenting: ""Harry is wearing his medals proudly, which our African princess Meghan probably purchased for him in a flea market in Santa Monica. Leave them alone, you bunch of bullies. Love you Meghan."" The consensus was of ridicule for the wayward prince who has admitted to heavy use of class-A drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, meth and marijuana, allegedly including when he served. Expert analysis Royal expert and body language expert Arbuthnot Bollsaque commented on the BBC that ""Harry is showing defiance for being stripped of his right to wear a military uniform by displaying the plethora of medals all over his cheap looking suit"".

Interconnected: The Internet Only Creates War For Humanity,"When humans become too interconnected, they reject this state through war because too much connection creates a reaction of disconnection and a run to privacy. Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.",Daily Squib,2023-12-07,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/54018-interconnected-the-internet-only-creates-war-for-humanity.html
"World Economic Forum: ""Brutal Totalitarian Communist China is Model For Western Nations""","According to the World Economic Forum, which dictates to Western nations on policy, and future direction, the brutal bullying thugs of the Chinese Communist Party and its evil policies of totalitarian savagery are a model for Western nations to follow. This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China's CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a ""role model"" for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN's Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week's APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China's ""tremendous"" achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. ""I think it's a role model for many countries,"" Schwab said. ""I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,"" Schwab said. It's not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it's forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved ""peacefully."" Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome's 1972 pro-depopulation book ""The Limits to Growth."" Meadows argues that most of the world's population must be wiped out so that the survivors can ""have freedom"" and a ""high standard of living."" During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world's population is ""inevitable."" However, he insists that a ""benevolent"" dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population ""peacefully."" ""We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,"" he says of the world's growing population.

The Beginning of the Post Consumerist Era,"Food scarcity, impossible prices, insane inflation and mass job losses/bankruptcies. Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down.

Netflix Harry and Meghan Enjoy Themselves Exploiting Disabled Veterans For Cash,"The Netflix producers and cameras were all in tow as Harry hugged another disabled Afghanistan veteran for the cameras. This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in 'real life' by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans. Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children's book The Stench. Disabled Veterans Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. ""It's a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually 'care' despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that's something for another day. You just can't fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved.

Experts: Meghan Markle Thought She Could Move Up Rank in Royal Family,"According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works. ""Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that's it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. ""This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. ""Prince Harry once said 'What Meghan wants Meghan gets' and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry's life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. ""Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle's psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. ""Markle has modelled herself on Harry's mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. ""Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana's inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. ""Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. ""As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan's evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan's titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.""",Daily Squib,2021-04-07,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/41634-experts-meghan-markle-thought-she-could-move-up-rank-in-royal-family.html

Is Harry Now a National Security Threat?,"To become a bona fide enemy of the state is no mean feat, but Harry and Meghan seem to have managed it with ease. Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain's enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain's Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry's Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain's enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!",Daily Squib,2021-03-08,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/41322-is-harry-now-a-national-security-threat.html
First Transgender Woman Crowned Miss Minnesota 2021,"Hailing from the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota, Shaquashisha LaQwandwell, 23, the state's first ever transgender woman, was crowned Miss Minnesota in St. Paul on Monday. This year's Minnesota beauty pageant was an all-inclusive affair, with not only transgender women invited but even paraplegic women were duly encouraged to join. Under Joe Biden's new transgender directives, if you are a transgender biological male, you are welcome to join not only the military but any sport for women, or beauty pageant. Accepting her prize LaQwandwell was naturally happy to win such a prestigious contest, and is now pushing her sights to enter Miss USA, and even the Miss Universe contest. ""Imma aks y'all do you lakk ma beautiful face and figure ni**az, cuz y'all bitchez gonna see me sashay in to Miss USA soon. Imma gon enter Miss USA, not wit ma 15 inch but da contest silly. Gotcha dere!"" At one point, LaQwandwell dropped her flowers and bent over to pick them up giving the judges all a solid eyeful of her meat and two veg, but that was neither here nor there, she has every right as any woman to join the contest.

Meghan Markle Endures Bird Shit Trauma During Oprah Interview,"During the sell-out Oprah interview, Meghan Markle was talking about her favourite subject – herself – when a cute little tweety boird landed on a branch next to the narcissist. The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle's black couture dress. They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry's ratings in the UK. One of Oprah's producers was professional about the bird shit incident. ""The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!"" As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple's garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient.

Meghan Markle Demands English County of Sussex is Moved to California,"The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle has made a remarkable request to the Queen that has caused shockwaves through royal circles. Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle's demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen's cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.",Daily Squib,2021-02-19,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/41113-meghan-markle-demands-english-county-of-sussex-is-moved-to-california.html
Queen Meghan and King Harry of America Knight Their Gardener,"American royal author appointed by Queen Meghan and King Harry, Ringo Scoobie, has outlined in a new book that the American royal couple have knighted their first Sir on American soil. According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. ""The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace's footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like 'puta' and 'madre'. ""Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. ""The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers 'Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.' The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. ""The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day's business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise."" It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future. In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder.

WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE According to Democrat officials who say the election is in the bag, Marxist political operative Zheng Zhifa and Democrat-Chinese Influence peddler John Wei, who are closely tied to the CCP will have their own office directly in line with Biden's Oval Office so they can bark orders at him without even picking up a phone. ""Pops told me that the Secret Service assholes, and any moron who cares for national security will be told to stand down.

As for my crack dealer, Jigaboom 'Boom' Williams, he will be given free access to my quarters, as he is the best crack rock dealer this side of Chicago,"" Hunter Biden added. Thanks to the silence of the corrupt dealings and crimes of the Biden Crime Family by the mainstream Democrat Party Propaganda media, the Bidens are well protected and can do as they please without any fear of prosecution. They are effectively above the law, and their evil crimes are completely dusted under the carpet.

Obama and Hunter Biden: Sold Out America to the Highest Bidder - CHINA,"Under the Obama administration China increased its economic stance tenfold off the back of America. Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden's recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA's national security.",Daily Squib,2020-10-27,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/39255-obama-and-hunter-biden-sold-out-america-to-the-highest-bidder-china.html
The Biden Incest Plot Thickens,"There's only so much we can reveal here, but we have seen a small tip of the iceberg that truly incriminates the Biden crime family. Due to mass biased censorship, the DS can only briefly describe what is out there now all over the internet. Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child. This obviously ties in with Joe Biden's creepy photographs sniffing women and children, and other inappropriate behaviour even during C-SPAN photo shoots. SOURCE: NationalFile.com Joe Biden's son, Hunter, who allegedly admitted to his father in a text message that he had sexual relations with his 14-year-old niece, Natalie Biden, is now undercover and nowhere to be seen. Maybe venture to 4Chan, as Chinese dissidents against the CCP regime are flooding the place with even more photos from the Hunter hard drive. In one video Hunter Biden is filmed receiving foot gratification from a female whilst smoking a crack pipe. That's all we can reveal here, purely because of the censorship and cover up by the socialist controlled media. There may or may not be some information from here if you follow through. Free and Fair Press? There is no way any of the mainstream news outlets can call themselves news services, or journalists because they are completely ignoring the biggest scandal in political history at the moment. You are not a journalist if you ignore this Biden story, you are a paid biased slave to political masters, and are ignoring the basic tenets as well as responsibility of journalism. Your cowardice and inaction, will never be forgotten — you are a disgrace to the mantle of journalism and a free, fair press. Do not ever call yourselves journalists ever again.

Keeping Up With the Sussexes - Netflix Series Coming in December,"As the horrible Keeping Up With the Kardashians series is finally canned, a new horror awakens from the bowels of Netflix – Keeping Up With the Sussexes. Just as the sun seemed to be shining again and the vile Kardashian slime was seeming to have subsided, there is a newer even worse offering coming to our screens, this time involving freeloaders Harry, Meghan and poor old Archie. ""No doubt the Netflix executives have ordered the Sussexes to bring out the sprog for maximum effect, and are already training the kid to do circus tricks,"" one ex-Netflix subscriber said disparagingly. Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. ""It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians. Sussex is now viewed next to any other cheap brand on the telly and no doubt the merchandising will be profitable as well. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, the Windsors can only look on in horror as the royal name is dragged through the dustbin of inequity,"" a royal commentator revealed. Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving 'woke' bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age.

Trump to Open Presidential Library of Authors Books Written About How Bad He is,"You have the Clinton presidential library, with hidden compartments to stash naked young women, you have the Obama library where books about climate change and anal rimming techniques are the choice, and you have the George W. Bush library, which only has one book, My Pet Goat. The Donald Trump presidential library is set to stump all of the prior presidents, and their ego stroking book depositories. Trump is going to open up a whole library of books dedicated solely to authors who have spilled the dirt on the president, backstabbers, former employees with grudges, former White House staff who were fired, and all the rest of the Trump haters who wrote vast volumes of text detailing how bad a person he is. ""I want to put all the tremendous hate into one place, so I can walk in there and revel in all of it. We're not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me. I revel in this, because I affected those people so much, they went and wrote a book about me, good for them. You know, I should get royalties from them all, maybe I might get my new lawyer to look into that. We're going to see rows and rows of these books in my new shining library, it's gonna be bigger than Obama's that's for sure,"" President Donald J. Trump quipped from the White House on Wednesday. There's even talk about bringing out an encyclopaedia of Donald Trump Haters, who all seem to have come out of the woodwork only weeks before the election. Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president's anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. ""No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it's because they are really scared he will win a second term. The negative news projects are released with such quantity daily, they now overlap each other publicity wise.

I don't know anyone on this planet that can survive that kind of shit, but the Teflon Don. Sure some stuff sticks a little while longer, like the vet smear project, but all I see is Trump wading through this manure, he's doing it relatively calmly too, with ease.

Meghan is Imitating Diana After Years of Study,"Meghan Markle is acting in the biggest and most lucrative acting role ever — that of imitating Princess Diana. Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle's actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. ""Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. ""Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle's Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. ""This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person's weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. ""With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his 'mother' for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman's claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. ""My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.""",Daily Squib,2020-09-02,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38512-meghan-is-imitating-diana-after-years-of-study.html
Another Tedious Megain Markle Lecture to the Unwashed Masses,"Every day is a special day in Meghan Markle land, where she, appointed by absolutely no one, has taken it upon herself to lecture the masses on how to do things the 'right' way. Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. ""Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,"" the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being 'ordered' to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that's all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don't you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do. One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the 'voice of the people' has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have 'mental' problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle's bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that's what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world.

Meghan Markle Pees in Extensive Gardens Instead of Using 16 Bathrooms,"Prince Harry, according to his advisers, is at his wits end about his wife Meghan Markle, who has a penchant for urinating in the lavish gardens of their new mansion in Santa Barbara. According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. ""We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That's when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,"" Harry was quoted in the book 'Fine Whine and Freedom'. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan's pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. ""It's acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!"" The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town's carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that's her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.",Daily Squib,2020-08-14,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/38146-meghan-markle-pees-in-extensive-gardens-instead-of-using-16-bathrooms.html
Ironic That BLM ANTIFA Heroes Karl Marx and Engels Thought Blacks Closer to Animal Kingdom Than Whites,"The communist heroes of Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA – Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels – were avowed racists who not only resented 'lazy' Mexicans but thought black people were closer to animals in opposition to the highly evolved biological nature of white people. ""Manifesto of the Communist Party"" Isn't it ironic to see the communist flags flying at ANTIFA and BLM protests/riots and to hear the idiotic sputum spewing coming from one of the BLM founders, Cullors, that she is a trained Marxist is additionally hilarious to behold? Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx's racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of 'n*ggers' holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx's son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by ""one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood."" In a letter to Lafargue's wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that's why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province. So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It's quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it's embarrassing that these supposedly 'anti-racism' groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.",Daily Squib,2020-08-10,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/38067-ironic-that-blm-antifa-heroes-karl-marx-and-engels-thought-blacks-closer-to-animal-kingdom-than-whites.html
Why is Michelle Obama So Depressed?,"The trials and tribulations of a former first lady are probably far-reaching and complex, and it is this complexity we can see in Michelle Obama, a woman who once had it all but now is a mere footnote in history. Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking 'whitey' for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle's famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine 'woke' propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There's only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. ""We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack's. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let's say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?"" What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: ""Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people's money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It's a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they're downers."" Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.",Daily Squib,2020-08-07,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/38023-why-is-michelle-obama-so-depressed.html
BLM Campaign Failure: Are Black People More Hated Now Than Before Riots?,"Black Lives Matter and their extremist politically charged campaign may have backfired totally, as black people are now more hated and despised than before their nefarious BLM scorched earth campaign. The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. ""Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,"" an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of 'White Flight' where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China's power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China's land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.",Daily Squib,2020-07-03,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37706-blm-campaign-failure-are-black-people-more-hated-now-than-before-riots.html
Mount Rushmore Presidents Could Be Replaced by BLM and #MeToo Founders,"Marxist groups for the Soviet Cultural Revolution of America have called for the great American presidents on Mount Rushmore to be replaced with the faces of Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) and Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi (founders of Black Lives Matter). ""We are petitioning the Lakota tribe elders, who really own the land on which Mount Rushmore resides to clear the racist presidents from the sculpture. Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,"" a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America's magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. ""We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,"" a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.",Daily Squib,2020-06-25,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37612-mount-rushmore-presidents-could-be-replaced-by-blm-and-metoo-founders.html
BLM Doing to White People What the Nazis Did to Jews - Dehumanizing Them,"During the reign of the Nazi party in Germany, propaganda created by Goebbels made the Jews out to be an inferior race, the National Socialist regime effectively dehumanized Jewish people, instead of a hard-working, enterprising, resilient, and creative people, they were portrayed as inferior to the Aryan (pure) Germanic race. The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as 'anti-racism' by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews. White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM's ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population. History repeats itself sometimes in sinister ways.",Daily Squib,2020-06-07,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37341-blm-doing-to-white-people-what-the-nazis-did-to-jews-dehumanizing-them.html
George Floyd to be Sainted by Pope in America,"The violent criminal and drug addict, who robbed a terrified pregnant woman, beating her over the head with a pistol, George Floyd, will be sainted by the Pope in Minneapolis in July, the Vatican has revealed. All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. ""Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,"" the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: ""We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money. Saint George could do no wrong, as he kicked her in the stomach before he left with the woman's money. She was white and deserved it. Black lives matter, and Saint George Floyd, praise be to you, I drink champagne in your honour!"" Pope Francis will be coming to liberal American cities blighted by racial tension to administer the sainthood on Apostle George Floyd in late July.",Daily Squib,2020-06-05,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37294-george-floyd-to-be-sainted-by-pope-in-america.html
Intelligence: China Encouraging BLM ANTIFA Rioters Across U.S. Cities,"Chinese communist propaganda and operators are working within groups like Black Lives Matter, and the overtly Marxist group ANTIFA to destabilise and encourage rioting in U.S. cities an intelligence group have revealed about the threat from China. These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America's campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg's Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals. There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system. ""Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,"" one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: ""Their goal is to exploit America's academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. ""It's smart. It's a long-term, patient approach."" Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party's ""united front"" efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party's friends to strike at the party's enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It's not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples. Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!",Daily Squib,2020-05-31,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/37236-intelligence-china-encouraging-blm-antifa-rioters-across-u-s-cities.html
Civilian Harry Misses His Old Life and Regrets Listening to Meghan Markle,"We do have regrets in life, and it is testament to the enduring qualities of Harry, stripped of his medals in the army, and his royal status, all because he had a moment of momentary madness, and followed this woman who controlled him so well to the un-royal city of Los Angeles, where the soulless grid streets all lead to nowhere in particular. ""I used to hang around thousand-year-old palaces steeped in history, have proper English butlers, shoot pheasants, and in the evenings have anything including any young filly delivered to my quarters to be pumped with vigour. Now I am a civilian underling to an ageing humourless Z list actress who is obsessed by herself, and orders me around as if I am one of nana's Corgis, there are no palaces here in the soulless cocaine fuelled environs of Los Angeles, just bland Starbucks and fake plastic people with their faces stretched behind their ears, and their pig's anus resembling trout lips, puckered to the point of absurdity,"" the woeful former royal lamented to his friends. The former prince yearns for the fresh breeze of the rolling green hills of England, the quaint pubs, the polo, his friends and brother and the cheers of Twickenham, as well as the considered sarcastic comments of royal discourse, which is non-existent to the clueless politically correct Yanks. Meghan whose chief expertise is in fellatio, due to her apprenticeship over many years of shitty low-end showbiz jobs, has only this skill to her name, but over time, even her intricate oral technique will not be able to keep the former prince from feeling home sick. The hundreds of men she has serviced in her time can contest to her fellating skills, but her vicious narcissistic personality counteracts this very attribute. One friend revealed: ""Harry is so bored of it all. He is now surrounded by American socialists, who can be even more intoxicating than the British sort, mainly because of their extreme champagne swilling PC hypocrisy and constant sappy victimhood.

Meghan Markle Appealing to Trump to End Coronavirus Pandemic Because Her Headlines Are Gone,"Former royal, Meghan Markle is appealing for the coronavirus pandemic to be ended, or put on hold because it is messing with her headlines and PR campaigns. Having no qualms about abandoning her own family and 72-year-old father who had two heart attacks, it is not surprising that Meghan does not care much for the people dying from coronavirus. ""The headlines are not about me, Meghan Markle, instead they are about this awful pandemic, about old people dying, I mean who fucking cares about them? These old people are taking away my headlines, just let 'em go. Then it's about coronavirus masks, and food bank queues, and corona this, corona that! There's nothing about my new foundation Archehole, or my new initiative to slow global warming by stitching up elephant assholes so their farts do not damage the ozone layer."" Harry and Meghan, who claim they left the UK because of press intrusion, are now even more distraught that the press have got better things to report than the gimmie dat couple who just 'take, take, take'. One of Meghan's aides revealed in secret that the atmosphere is very tense in the Harry and Meghan household. ""She orders the servants to rearrange the furniture every two hours, and is so irritated by the coronavirus headlines that whenever someone on TV starts talking about the virus, she shouts at the top of her voice about how great Meghan is, and how she is going to save the world. Meghan is now writing affirmations with her third sharpie all over the walls of the rented villa in Los Angeles where she is in lockdown with poor Harry and Archie.""

Archehole: Harry and Meghan Reveal New Money Making Venture,"Former royals, Harry and Meghan, who have recently moved to Los Angeles, are setting up a new organisation called Archehole. In a statement, they said ""We are fed up of the global COVID-19 pandemic taking up our precious publicity but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how the Archehole commodity came to be"". The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their royal titles at the end of last month, allowing Meghan to resume her z-list career in acting, and have trademarked their own son to make money off selling cheaply produced tat to their deluded, deranged anti-royal fans. In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole. The name Archehole combined an ancient word for strength and action, with another that ""evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon through our assholes"". ""We have launched Archehole during a global pandemic because as narcissists we cannot be out of the news for more than two weeks plus we need some fucking money sharpish,"" they said.

Coronavirus - Cui Bono - Who Benefits?,"When it comes to something like the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to understand that in these situations, we have to look at who ultimately benefits from this global virus. One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you 'Do Not Panic!' whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged. As Obama puts it 'the old white men', who somehow thwarted his hermaphrodite homosexual orgiastic dream last time around. This time however, the virus will no doubt kill these over sixties off, and bring in a new age for the young Marxist indoctrinated youth to savour. Cui bono? It is the globalist communist China loving controllers every time..Greta Thunberg is literally having a deep orgasm at the mere thought of it all...Soros is loving every moment...the Bilderbergers are joyous...the tech power nerds click clacking their keyboards..and the hidden ones...ebullient...",Daily Squib,2020-03-13,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35810-coronavirus-cui-bono-who-benefits.html
Meghan Reveals Harry Suffers From 'Post Traumatic Royal Disorder',"Back in Canada after the disastrous last visit to England and an unsavoury farewell, Meghan Markle, the former Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that Harry gets the shakes and is suffering from PTRD (Post Traumatic Royal Disorder). ""It usually happens at night. Harry will wake up shouting and sweating like a Catholic priest at a choir boys convention. The sweat is horrible, and he's shaking like a leaf. ""I then ask him if it was THAT dream again. He always answers 'yes'. ""It's always the same dream, he's at Sandringham, and the whole Windsor family are sitting around the dinner table.

One of the many butlers brings him some salt and even sprinkles his food with it, except he keeps going, then Harry tells the butler 'that's enough!' but he keeps on pouring the salt until his food is completely submerged. ""As the salt keeps coming, more and more, Harry looks down and his nose is just above the salt, he can't breathe, the salt rises further, all he can hear is everyone laughing, guffawing, blackness, suffocation — and this is when Harry always wakes up!""

Will Harry Ever Forgive Meghan For Her Crime?,"The tragedy of the final appearance of the former prince, Harry and the woman he naively followed out of the royal family, resembles a tragic play worthy of Shakespeare or an operatic masterpiece from another era.

Meghan, with her constant gleeful fake smile parades her power over the lowly, weak, Harry with a commanding authority much like a pig farmer parades their prize breed boar through the stalls of an auction house. Harry's life will from now on be a sad shadow of his previous one, and it's all down to the emasculating, vindictive monster he has been fooled into mating with. Nothing to lose Meghan gained everything while Harry, who had so much, gave up everything, for little or no return. One royal fan from the crowd observing, quipped, ""Be careful with whom you stick your winky into 'arry, for it can affect your whole life, drastically for the worse, as you're seeing now. The initial buzz of the first time lust always dies down."" ""Meghan and her Croydon facelift does not care about Archie, otherwise she would have brought him along on the trip to England for the final appearance, and she vindictively used the child's absence as a way of punishing Her Majesty, the Queen. Withholding grandchildren to punish, is an oft used technique by parents with a stick to whack,"" one angry woman said from the sidelines of the abbey. The service at Westminster Abbey in honour of the Commonwealth was most certainly marred by the antics and idiosyncrasies of the Firm, something well documented over the decades. In years to come, or maybe sooner, Harry will resent this woman who took him away from his beloved army mates, his brother, from his country, and from his family, and from the sprawling palaces, the shooting grounds, the rolling hills of England, the Pomp and Circumstance, gone now, a distant memory with only vast straight grid roads and fast food restaurants to look at in his new environs.

Disney Could Replace Meghan Markle With Plank of Wood,"Disney executives who are being begged by Harry and Meghan's agent to give her a role in a superhero film, or anything that comes up, are so fed up that they might just have a plank of wood on screen to represent the former Duchess of Sussex.

We just went to Home Depot and bought a plank of plywood, that will be her,"" Gus Van Horten, senior studio producer told CNN. It would be a win win situation for the film studio because the plank of wood costs about $19.99 as opposed to some horrific sum pushed by Meghan's deluded agent. ""The plank of wood will have more presence and acting skills than Meghan Markle, who was a Z list anyway,"" another Disney producer revealed.

Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the 'Sussex Royal' name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan's modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. ""Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. ""Meghan's sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of 'charity funding'. The key factor is to 'virtue signal' for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. ""The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that's when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. ""We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of 'loving' Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.""",Daily Squib,2020-02-22,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/35629-defiant-meghan-markle-vs-windsor-royal-family.html
Thomas Markle Bans Meghan and Harry From Using Markle Brand,"After Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II, banned ex-royals Harry and Meghan from profiting off the 'Sussex Royal' brand, estranged father of Meghan Markle made an announcement today to the same effect. ""After deep cogitation at the ramifications of our Markle family name being dragged through the gutter, I hereby decree that the use of the 'Markle' family name be not used to market cheap plastic trinkets, socks, pyjamas and toilet brushes as proposed by Meghan and Harry after being banned by the Queen of Great Britain of using the 'Sussex Royal' name for profit."" The Exile on Meghan Street couple who are now holed up in Canada, have already spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating a Sussex Royal website as well as patenting thousands of products they wished to sell using the trademark to make millions of dollars. This has all been shot to the ground much to the delight of the general population who vehemently detest Meghan Markle and her calculating ideas of global domination. The only thing left for the marauding ex-royal freeloaders is to now call themselves simply as 'Meghan and Harry'.",Daily Squib,2020-02-19,Entertainment,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/entertainment/35605-thomas-markle-bans-meghan-and-harry-from-using-markle-brand.html
Chinese Water Supply Contains Faecal Matter Aiding Spread of Coronavirus,"Contamination of drinking water from faeces is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as diarrhoea and viral hepatitis. A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to ""at least basic sanitation"", a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment. High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi'an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!",Daily Squib,2020-02-06,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35419-chinese-water-supply-contains-faecal-matter-aiding-spread-of-coronavirus.html
Chinese Authorities Misreporting Coronavirus Deaths,"With over 100,000 Chinese people infected, the deaths from coronavirus are being vastly misreported by the Chinese Communist State. Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs. Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again. The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run. If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.",Daily Squib,2020-02-03,World,Satire,https://www.dailysquib.co.uk/world/35341-chinese-authorities-misreporting-coronavirus-deaths.html

Senate To Be Replaced With Room Full Of Monkeys Throwing Feces,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In an emergency, overnight referendum, the American people voted on Thursday to replace the United States Senate with a room full of monkeys throwing feces.

Motorcyclist Who Identifies As Bicyclist Sets Cycling World Record,"NEW YORK, NY - In an inspiring story from the world of professional cycling, a motorcyclist who identifies as a bicyclist has crushed all the regular bicyclists, setting an unbelievable world record. In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. ""Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,"" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. ""Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here."" Banner also said he painted the word ""HUFFY"" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles.

Trump Announces He Has Hidden 5 Golden Tickets Among Stimulus Checks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Trump has built up a lot of buzz over the coming stimulus payments, saying he has hidden five golden tickets among the checks heading to Americans this week.

NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"LOS ANGELES, CA - NBA players are honoring the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week by wearing pretty lace collars just like Notorious RBG used to wear. In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe.

Biden Cuts Hole In Mask So He Can Still Sniff People's Hair,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Joe Biden has committed to wearing a mask in public to be a good example and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus.

In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.""

His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man.

With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere.

People who bravely post about how the U.S. needs to invade some country in the Middle East or Asia or outer space will get a pop-up notice indicating they've been enlisted in the military. A recruiter will then show up at their house and whisk them away to fight in the foreign war they wanted to happen so badly. ""Frankly, recruitment numbers are down, and we needed some way to find people who are really enthusiastic about fighting wars,"" said a DOD official. ""Then it hit us like a drone strike: there are plenty of people who argue vehemently for foreign intervention. It doesn't matter what war we're trying to create: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China---these people are always reliable supporters of any invasion abroad. So why not get them there on the frontlines?"" ""After all, we want people who are passionate about occupying foreign lands, not grunts who are just there for the paycheck,"" he added.

Bernie Sanders Praises China For Eradicating Poverty By Killing All The Poor People,"U.S. - Presidential candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders offered words of praise for China's successful reduction of poverty in many parts of the country by killing off all the poor people through government control of the economy. Sanders pointed out that the country has been very successful in eliminating vast swathes of poverty and also the poor. ""America still has a lot of poor people, and that's because we haven't been aggressive in implementing socialist programs that cause mass starvation,"" Sanders said, his fingers flopping around like ten tiny wacky inflatable tube men. ""Firing squads, death camps, breadlines---all of these are humanitarian tools in the arsenal of the government to shoot poverty in the face, and sometimes also the poor in the face, when it's necessary."" The senator also pointed out that poor people, who often own fewer than three homes, don't contribute much to a socialist economy and ""not much is lost"" when these single-home-owners are shot or simply starve to death as the government can't even figure out how to get food to everyone, a problem even bad fast-food restaurants like McDonald's solved decades ago.",The Babylon Bee,2019-08-28,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/bernie-sanders-praises-china-for-eradicating-poverty-by-killing-all-the-poor-people

Government Accidentally Shuts Itself Down With Ban On Non-Essential Businesses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congress has asked all non-essential businesses to limit their hours or close entirely for an undetermined amount of time. But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. ""Oops,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""We meant non-essentialprivatebusinesses. Of course, the government isalwaysessential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse."" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.

Hollywood Elites Rush To Normalize Pedophilia Before They're All Outed By Epstein Client List,"U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. ""I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,"" said actor and director Rudy Allan, ""but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box."" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. ""The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,"" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. ""At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!"" ""Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,"" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. ""If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!"" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like ""love has no age"" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. ""I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,"" Allan says. ""We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?"" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series calledSix-Year-Old Strippers,and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.",The Babylon Bee,2020-08-21,Worldviews,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/hollywood-rushes-to-make-pedophilia-acceptable-before-theyre-outed-by-ghislaine-maxwell

Teachers Urge Government To Reopen Schools Before Students Learn To Think For Themselves,"U.S. - Teachers at government schools have raised their concerns that the recent closure of their institutions will have a damaging effect on students. In particular, the nation's educators are worried that the longer the schools are closed, the more likely it is that students will begin thinking for themselves, learn life skills away from the government school system, and realize how much more they learn at home. ""We must reopen as soon as possible -- before they regain their ability to have independent thoughts,"" said New York 4th-grade teacher Ms. Jenny Mudd. ""This is an urgent crisis.

Students who have been away from the government school system for even a week stop feeling depressed and anxious all the time and even show a shocking increase in the ability to form thoughts and ideas not approved by the government. Teachers have further pointed out that parents aren't properly equipped to indoctrinate their children with government propaganda.

However, there are reports that masculinity still lurks out there, which is a source of anxiety to modern men and causes them to have upset tummies.

""Yeah, I'm pretty much a free thinker,"" said Keeblesmush when interviewed at a protest rally sponsored by Kinko's. ""I would say my ideology is an eclectic mix of Vox, Marvel comics, Starbucks' Twitter feed, and whatever my Sociology 101 professor says.

Large Turnout At Memorial For Hans Gruber Who Was Thrown From A Building By A Police Officer,"LOS ANGELES, CA - A huge crowd turned out Sunday for the Hans Gruber memorial service. Gruber was the victim of police violence, having been thrown from Nakatomi Plaza by police officer John McClane, which many consider one of the most excessive uses of force ever witnessed. After the incident, there were protests all week, and now thousands from all over the country came to pay respects to Gruber, widely described as an ""intelligent and witty soul."" ""That man was a hero,"" said Doyle Graham, who traveled from Nevada to pay respects. ""I mean, I don't really know much about him other than that some police officer killed him, but he seems like someone we should all honor and emulate."" Gruber was part of a mainly peaceful protest against the Nakatomi Corporation, which was goaded into violence by the actions of McClane. Ultimately, McClane threw Gruber from the 30th floor, even though Gruber was completely unarmed (or at least he was when he hit the ground). Even LAPD Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson denounced the actions, calling McClane a ""nutcase"" who should have ""just stayed put."" Many at the memorial are now wearing shirts with ""Gruber"" written on them to remember the man who was taken too soon thanks to unaccountable police actions.

Judge Dismisses Sexual Assault Allegations Against Biden On Grounds That He Is Not A Republican,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden was cleared in federal court today of charges that some claimed were based upon credible allegations of sexual assault when the judge quickly realized that Joe Biden was not a Republican. ""Well, this looks pretty serious... let's see who is on - wait a minute. He's a Democrat! I can find no fault with him,"" declared a fourth circuit federal judge hearing preliminary claims. ""It is well established in this court that Republicans are the ones who want to silence women and control their bodies. Haven't you seenThe Handmaid's Tale?"" the judge further added before banging down the gavel. The bailiff immediately grabbed the female accuser by the collar and threw her up into the air out onto the sidewalk, just like in the cartoons. The allegations against then-Senator Joe Biden date back to 1993. Several other people had corroborated key details relating to the seriousness and timing of the intern's story including a discovered CNN clip of her mother callingThe Larry King Showand a neighbor confirming that the woman had told her at the time what had happened. However, this circumstantial evidence of vile behavior, even interpreted under the generous standard of ""believe all women"" set by the government in prior cases involving Republicans, was declared to only be valid if the alleged perpetrator was a greedy, evil Republican. ""This is a victory for the judicial standard in our country of assuming the accused are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,"" stated Alyssa Milano. ""We always need to maintain this standard of maintaining silence and withholding judgment on such cases when it is convenient and maintains our narratives.""

Migrant Caravan Mysteriously Disappears But Leaves Behind Cool Wooden Horse,"U.S./MEXICO BORDER - The migrant caravan headed for the U.S. has been the center of much controversy, but the problem seems to have solved itself, as the entire caravan has mysteriously disappeared. In other, unrelated, good news, there's now a really cool-looking giant wooden horse sitting right at the U.S. border, fresh for the taking. The wooden horse is massive in size -- big enough to fit thousands of people inside if it were hollow (though judging by its weight, the horse is already filled with something). It could make a neat tourist attraction, and President Trump was quick to call dibs on it. ""That's my horse; I saw it first!"" Trump said in a public statement. ""It's the biggest and best horse ever, so obviously it's meant for me. Bring it across the border immediately before someone else takes it!"" Workers are already busy moving the horse, which is conveniently on four giant wooden wheels. ""Remember Troy!"" called out one of the workers as they began moving it.

Embarrassed Trump Realizes He’s Had Russia And Ukraine Confused This Entire Time,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The new presidential administration experienced a rare public relations gaffe, as an embarrassed President Donald Trump realized that he's had Russia and Ukraine confused this entire time. The mistake was eventually discovered by a White House aide, who began to ask questions after the president had made public assertions that Ukraine was responsible for starting the war. Upon further investigation, the aide privately notified Trump that he had the two countries mixed up. ""They're the other way around, from what I understand,"" Trump told reporters at an impromptu press conference in the Oval Office. ""The country that started the war by invading the other was apparently Russia. It's easy to get the two confused, honestly. They're right next to each other. And cold winters. So very cold. I thought that little Zelenskyy guy was from Russia this whole time. He sounds Russian."" An administration insider said Trump's realization of the mix-up could potentially change the entire outlook for peace talks. ""It's kind of a major difference,"" the source said. ""He was taking such a hardline stance against Ukraine because he thought they started the war when Russia did the invading. We had to get out a big map and show him that Russia was actually the big one and Ukraine was the little one. It's ok, he's got it figured out now."" At publishing time, Trump had proposed a newly revised peace plan in which the United States would simply take over both Ukraine and Russia as new territories.

"Trump Claimed, Without Evidence, That 2+2 Makes 4. Not So Fast, Experts Say","WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a morning press conference about the state of the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump suddenly claimed that 2 and 2 added together equaled 4, despite having no evidence whatsoever to back it up. Experts sounded the alarm on the president's bold statement. ""You can't just go around claiming to have the answer to complex math equations without demonstrating how you came to that conclusion,"" said former CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter. ""It is very irresponsible for a commander-in-chief to throw numbers around willy-nilly like this."" Mathematicians said while there are indeed edge cases in which 2 + 2 = 4, making a blanket statement to that effect was irresponsible because it ignores the world of modular arithmetic and abstract algebra where ""2"" can be whatever you want. ""If you decide that 2 is actually 947, then 2 cannot possibly be added to itself to equal 4,"" said respected Harvard mathematician Ivan Schaefer. ""The president is way off base here if he thinks he can simply assert that 2 + 2 = 4 without evidence."" Leading philosopher and actor Terrance Howard, who famously lost his role as War Machine inIron Man 2due to incorrect math, argued that all conventional math is wrong and can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean, which makes Trump not merely incorrect but a dangerous liar. Howard, a self-perceived expert in the fields of arithmetic, philosophy, and biology has gone so far as to argue that Trump may not even exist. ""I've never met Trump,"" Howard said while appearing as a guest onThe Joe Rogan Experience. ""So how am I supposed to take him seriously when he says 2 + 2 = 4 if he won't even meet with me and prove that he's real?"" Trump had yet to respond to the pushback on what he perceived as the basic foundation of mathematics a person learns in preschool. At publishing time, Trump received more criticism after mentioning, without evidence, that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.

Concerns Grow About Pope's Health After He Says Something Theologically Accurate,"VATICAN CITY — Concerns over the health and mental ability of the Pope grew this week after the Supreme Pontiff was overheard saying something theologically accurate. ""It seems clear to me that his condition is worsening,"" said one member of the Papal ferula, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""He gave a declaration and it was free of so much as a hint of error or heresy. There's something very wrong here, and we hope he's ok."" The statement, which reportedly affirmed the Trinity, the incarnation, and the status of homosexuality as a sin, took many in the Vatican by surprise. ""He didn't leave anything open to interpretation here,"" said San Diego Cardinal McElroy. ""His statement was clear and unambiguous. The Holy Father is clearly not himself. We pray for his quick recovery."" At this time, doctors have not confirmed if the Pope's ongoing bout with double pneumonia might be causing him to make such clear and error-free statements, and have asked for privacy while they take time to further evaluate his condition. ""Everything he's been saying the last few days has been in line with the Scriptures, which is very unlike him,"" another Vatican source said. ""This is a very bad sign.""

Delta Adds A Little Hanging Tennis Ball To End Of Runway For Female Pilots,"U.S. — As an added safety measure to prevent further runway catastrophes, Delta Airlines has added a little hanging tennis ball to the end of runways to help female pilots. After multiple recent incidents of female pilots struggling to figure out exactly when a runway begins and ends, Delta decided to begin positioning cranes to hang tennis balls from a string at the end of each runway. ""A tennis ball on a string is the most trusted technique in the world to keep women from wrecking,"" explained Delta CEO Ed Bastian. ""Millions of women have been stopped from smashing their cars into the garage wall by husbands graciously hanging up a tennis ball. We are excited to bring this tried-and-true technology to Delta Airlines to hopefully keep our female pilots from wrecking any more planes."" According to airport personnel, the tennis ball on a string has already prevented over a dozen crashes by female pilots. ""Now, if we can just get those lady pilots to stop checking their makeup and focus on the instrument panel,"" said air traffic controller Bob Rendon. ""Hang on a minute, got a girl pilot coming in hot -- stop when you touch the tennis ball, I repeat, brake for the tennis ball!""

Trump Proposes Two Golf-Course Solution For Gaza,"GAZA — A potential breakthrough in the Middle East peace process emerged this week with President Donald Trump proposing a two-golf course solution in Gaza. The proposed courses, meticulously designed by renowned golf course architects, will encompass ""36 beautiful holes like you wouldn't believe"" that adhere to the highest PGA standards. Palestinians and Israelis will each have their own segregated course flanking a five-star resort built with wood sourced from the cedars of Lebanon. ""It's a desert out there, an absolute wasteland,"" Trump said. ""So I think people are going to love a little greenery. We're going to have date palms, olive trees, and maybe some tamarisk to give the place a little color. It's really going to be something."" According to a recent poll of Gaza residents, no one is particularly interested in golfing but Trump expressed confidence that that would change. ""When I've had a hard day — and believe me, I have a lot of them — I like to hit the links,"" he said. ""No one's going to want to fight anymore when they could be driving balls down the fairway. We're even going to have a gift shop that sells little bumper stickers that say, 'I'd rather be golfing.' It'll be in Arabic or whatever squiggly language they want."" Further sweetening the deal will be over a hundred water hazards. This will reportedly have the benefit of creating a challenge for golfers while also bringing new life to the region. The courses will also be the first in history to have zero sand traps. ""They have enough sand,"" Trump said.

Trump Envisions Modern Version Of Postal Service Where People Can Send Mail Electronically,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — As rumors swirled that the administration may take over the operation of the post office, President Donald Trump proposed a radical new, modernized version of the U.S. Postal Service where people could send mail electronically. While the bold idea could revolutionize the sending and receiving of correspondence, critics and longtime supporters of the postal service called it outlandish and far-fetched, assuring the public that mailing letters was indispensable. Trump disagreed. ""We'll have a whole new system, folks. Electronic mail, we'll call it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""I've been talking to my friend, Elon Musk. You know Elon? Great guy. Very sharp guy. He told me we can do away with the post office altogether and start sending letters over the internet. It only takes seconds, and there's no paper. Do you believe that? Sending letters without paper. It's amazing the stuff they're doing these days. We'll get in there and fix it and make it better and faster than it's ever been before. Electronic mail. E-mail. Something like that. I don't know, we'll play around with the name."" A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service cautioned the adoption of such a futuristic plan. ""It's way too early to be talking about 'electronic mail,'"" said Postal Supervisor Danny Ball. ""Sending someone a letter invisibly through the 'world wide web?' Communicating with someone on another continent in seconds? That's science fiction stuff. Your paper, your envelope, and your stamps. That's where it's at. Please don't abolish us.""

Trump Signs Executive Order Mandating Second Breakfast,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The new administration continued to usher in a modern golden age for America, as President Donald Trump signed an executive order mandating second breakfast as an official meal. Trump made the announcement to a gathering of reporters in the Oval Office Thursday morning and marked the historic occasion by sitting down to enjoy the ceremonial First Second Breakfast in White House history. ""We love our toast and jam, don't we folks?"" Trump said as an aide laid out the second breakfast spread on the Resolute Desk. ""Every American family should sit down for Second Breakfast on a daily basis. It's the second version of the most important meal of the day, which means it's just as important as First Breakfast, which is delicious. You can never have too much bacon. And pastries, so many very beautiful pastries. With filling. Always with filling."" Insiders said the executive order would extend to federal agencies and government-funded schools nationwide, mandating an official break to allow employees and students to partake in second breakfasts to hold them over until lunch. ""This is part of President Trump's even larger, overarching agenda,"" said one administration source. ""This is only the beginning. By 2028, our goal is to have Americans eating the full slate of seven Hobbit meals.""

Cruel: Elon Musk Cuts Off Social Security Benefits For Thousands Of Revolutionary War Veterans,"U.S. — The Department of Government Efficiency faced renewed calls for independent oversight after news broke that DOGE boss Elon Musk had callously cut off Social Security benefits for thousands of Revolutionary War veterans. The move took place as part of DOGE's overarching crusade to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending but promised to bring the Musk-led team a new wave of negative publicity due to brave veterans of the American War of Independence now being deprived of their hard-fought benefits. ""How dare he take away the benefits we earned with our blood,"" said 270-year-old Arthur Breckenridge, who fought in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. ""It's only because of men like me that this South African fellow had a chance to come to this country and enjoy the fruits of our labor. Now we find out he's cutting off our Social Security? How are we supposed to live?"" Though Musk and the team at DOGE cited Social Security payments to individuals seemingly far too old to still be living as evidence of widespread fraud, Breckenridge and his fellow Revolutionary War veterans were not going to accept this indignity. ""This billionaire miscreant leaves us no choice,"" said Thomas Halderman, a 278-year-old veteran of the Battle of Saratoga. ""We shall grab our muskets and march to Tesla headquarters. Have at thee, you thieving scoundrel!""

"Compassionate, Merciful U.S. Lets Canada Win One","BOSTON, MA — In a surprising show of benevolence, the compassionate and merciful USA hockey team allowed Team Canada to defeat them in the finals of the 4 Nations Face-Off. The Americans collectively decided that they had had enough winning and wanted to let their downtrodden neighbors to the north pick up a rare victory. ""We just thought they could use a win,"" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. ""It was kind of fun actually. It was like playing in the pee-wee league where you pull back so the other team's parents can take a turn being proud of their kids."" The exciting final match of the 4 Nations Face-Off Championship ended in overtime when American players backed away to allow Canadian Connor McDavid to score the game-winning goal. It was a remarkable achievement for the Canadian team, made only slightly less meaningful when they later discovered that America had let them win. ""I was a fool to think we beat them fair and square,"" McDavid said during the postgame press conference. ""But it feels good anyway, eh? Thank you, Team USA. What a class act, eh?"" Team USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck recounted the fear he felt during the third period when Team Canada scored zero goals. ""We stopped trying to score during the third period. Canada wasn't throwing anything at me. I was almost afraid we were going to win by accident.""

Finally: State Department Officially Classifies Los Angeles Dodgers As Terrorist Organization,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a long-awaited move that signaled a turning point in the war against evil and lawlessness, the U.S. State Department announced that it had officially classified the Los Angeles Dodgers as a terrorist organization. The decision — which came after discussion among various government agencies, the White House, and Major League Baseball teams — finally answered the outcry raised by sports fans and decent human beings for many years, confirming that the Dodgers posed a serious threat to the American way of life. ""They're an evil of such immense scale that we couldn't deny it any longer,"" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio while announcing the move. ""Despite numerous warnings over the years, the Los Angeles Dodgers have failed to turn away from their nefarious acts, leaving the United States with no choice but to classify them as a terrorist organization.

""Organizations like this will be dealt with accordingly,"" Rubio said. ""It is our duty to protect the game of baseball — and, indeed, America itself — from the Los Angeles Dodgers.""

""Don't get me wrong, I enjoy spending time with ol' buckaroos like myself. It's just that your pal Cassidy can only handle so much hootin' and hollerin' before he plumb runs out of steam.

""Unlike Miss Knowles, we're proud Americans here at 100.3 the Bull. We support freedom, whether it's here or in the Middle East.

""As we saw on Saturday, the risks of Americans having roofs is far too great to continue allowing our homes, schools, and other buildings to be covered in any way. In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us."" Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building's windows.",The Onion,2024-07-15T22:00:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/congress-bans-roofs-1851592883/
News Happening Faster Than Man Can Generate Uninformed Opinions,"NEW YORK—Calling out the unsustainable pace at which historic events seemed to be occurring, local man Brad Gifford told reporters Monday that important news stories were now happening faster than he could generate uninformed opinions about them.

""Frankly, I'm exhausted here. Just as I'm putting the finishing touches on a worldview about a topic that I don't have even the faintest inkling about, it's like three more news stories pop up out of nowhere in an arena where I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. And again, I really don't know jackshit about anything at all, so how am I supposed to keep up?""

‘The Onion’ Officially Endorses Joe Biden For President,"Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution's highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country's long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion's editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That's why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion's latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying ""it's too late"" and we are ""doing more harm than good."" For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we'd hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden's first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we'd hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden's highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called ""papers of record"" are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he's packed a lot into 81 short years. He's fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He's stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board's courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup.

""Shortly after traveling to Earth in their quantum-drive spaceships, extraterrestrials must have unloaded the ropes, inclined planes, and primitive copper tools we see pictured here,"" Professor Giles Egerton said as he pointed to the ancient hieroglyphs etched into a newly discovered limestone tablet, adding that the skeptics who doubted the ancient Egyptians' ability to erect the pyramids without alien assistance had been vindicated. ""Looking back now, it's laughable to think we once seriously considered that Egyptians in 2500 B.C. might have had the means to build these structures on their own. This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.""

Scientists Confirm Shingleback Lizards Only Reptiles That Mate For Sake Of Aging Mothers,"ITHACA, NY—Noting that the evolutionary quirk results in plenty of familial strife, herpetologists at Cornell University confirmed Tuesday that shingleback lizards are the only reptiles that mate for the sake of their aging mothers. ""Unlike other lizards, the shingleback seeks out a partner to reproduce with as a means to stop the constant haranguing from its mother,"" lead researcher Alonso Gentry told reporters, adding that the short-tailed reptiles most often find a suitable mate via dates set up by their mothers. ""A shingleback lizard may be single for years, despite its mother's objections, but eventually it gets sick of hearing about how she'll die of a broken heart if she doesn't get grandbabies soon. The lizard is then likely to enter into a relationship that may not be healthy just to stop the complaining. A few months later, it gives birth to its offspring and is saddled with a deep bitterness that its life is over.""
