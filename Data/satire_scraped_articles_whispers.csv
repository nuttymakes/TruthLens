Dickhead Boss Wants To Hit The Ground Running In 2025,"A COMPLETE visual replica of a gaping arsehole, local boss Jamie McCartlin, has informed staff on their first day back in 2025 that he wants to hit the ground running this year. In a circular email sent to staff that immediately led to rolling of eyes seen by WWN, McCartlin spoke of wanting ‘100%’ from staff, pointing to a less than stellar last quarter and how ‘some people around here won’t get away with coasting for another year’. “Not only is it the bastarding 2nd of January, it’s a Thursday. Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,” groused employee Cormac D’Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. “My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road. So even if I wanted to hit, slam, bate the ground in 2025 it’ll have to wait,” offered Carmel Tullan, who didn’t make it past the first sentence in her boss’ email which began ‘New Year, New Focused Workforce’. For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. “This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I’m saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,” McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through. “I won’t sugarcoat it, I need soldiers, people who eat, sleep and breathe this job. ,” concluded McCartlin, who neglected to mentioned he was offing on a two week skiing trip to Austria at the end of the month.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/dickhead-boss-wants-to-hit-the-ground-running-in-2025/
Organised Local Woman Straight Onto Revenue Portal To Get That €4.25 Tax Back She’s Owed,"HAVING CALCULATED the projected tax relief she is entitled to under the Remote Working Relief on electricity and broadband bills at the start of December, local woman Orna Stewart is primed and ready to file her 2024 tax return. With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers. “People have no idea how much they’re entitled to, just leaving money there on the table but not me, no way Jose, that €4.25 is mine!” Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. “But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,” Stewart’s husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn’t entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour’s long lecture on honesty and ethics. “Here she is, right on queue,” said the automated system in receipt of Stewarts tax declaration, making her the first person in the country to submit her declaration for the 5th year running.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 3, 2025",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/03/organised-local-woman-straight-onto-revenue-portal-to-get-that-e4-25-tax-back-shes-owed/
“Eight Additional Data Centres Needed To Store Pictures Of Irish Snow” Energy Watchdog Warns,"THE COMMISSION FOR Regulation of Utilities in Ireland has called on the public to refrain from taking yet more photos of the snow as server capacities reach breaking point. “Data centres already consume a huge amount of our electricity, but Meta will need to break ground on another eight data centres if you keep uploading those photos of your snowman with a carrot for a dick,” cautioned the energy watchdog. Usually limiting itself to providing a free complaint resolution service, the CRU has felt the need to speak out before the energy grid buckles under the weight of picturesque landscape photos accompanied by the word ‘sneactha’. “We all know what snow fucking looks like lads, you’ve already taken 150 pictures of it, that’s enough. And anyway, they’re likely out of focus and partially covered by your fat fingers. The world will survive without your visual documentation of it all,” a CRU spokesperson added, as the light caught their face just right amid a background of beautiful cascading snow which acted as cotton wool blanket pulled over the nearby hills. “You better not be taking a fucking picture of me,” insisted the spokesperson, as this reporter’s iPhone camera’s flash went off brighter than a Chinese New Year fireworks display. UPDATE: The CRU also urged the public to be mindful of the carbon footprint created by taking 400 photos of your pets every hour, and the impact of giving a thumb’s up emoji to every single WhatsApp message you receive.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/eight-additional-data-centres-needed-to-store-pictures-of-irish-snow-energy-watchdog-warns/
Colin Farrell Asks If Three Golden Globes Are Redeemable For One Oscar,"EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. “Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?” Farrell asked over the phone, the audience’s applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. “There’s no way Meryl hasn’t exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don’t be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn’t exactly a stretch for me, just saying,” one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. “Enough time has passed, it’s okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in ‘Milk’? Over me in ‘In Bruges’, give over,” continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell’s angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. “Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I’m guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?” one industry insider offered.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",ENTERTAINMENT,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/colin-farrell-asks-if-three-golden-globes-are-redeemable-for-one-oscar/
Remote Workers Wouldn’t Have Agreed To Work From Home If They Knew It Meant Zero Snow Days Off,"“I FEEL TRICKED” confirmed Carmel Foley, one of hundreds of thousands of workers granted the ability to work from home several days a week in recent years, as she stared mournfully out at heavy snow she couldn’t use as an excuse for a handy day off. “You can’t begin to understand how sneaky and satisfying it felt back with the big snow in 2018 when I told the office the roads to the were impassable due to snow. Back then I didn’t have a home work set up,” added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement. Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a ‘snow day’ due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day’s work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building. “That’s a ‘The Chase’ repeat marathon in my boxers off the fucking cards,” griped one worker who has actually had several of those days recently over the Christmas but still feels like they’re missing out. “A snow day off from work is one of those sacred if rare rights of passage all office workers should be entitled to, like when you get a day off ‘cus someone in the warehouse loses an arm or the under the table hush payment when the boss can’t keep his arms to himself,” complained workers rights’ advocate Tony Dallon. Asked why remote workers didn’t just lie and say they had no electricity, workers responded in unison stating that every office has some ‘busybody prick’ who would actually check that with the ESB networks and rat on them.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/remote-workers-wouldnt-have-agreed-to-work-from-home-if-they-knew-it-meant-zero-snow-days-off/
“I’m Too Old And Rich To Be Righteous Anymore” – Bono,"IRISH singer-songwriter and former activist Bono clasped his hands and prayed to whatever God he worships these days while receiving the US Presidential Medal of Freedom from outgoing president and Zionist Joe Biden, admitting that yes, he’s too old and rich to be righteous anymore. Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their ‘meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace’. “Look, we’ll forget about that last part there and just say it’s for the first two,” Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. “We’ll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we’re finished. The seaside property there is to die for”. Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. “There comes a time in an activists’ life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,” Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. “I know people back home will not be happy, but they’re just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh”. Meanwhile, Michael J Fox, Denzel Washington, ‘Magic’ Johnson, Ralph Lauren and several others were just glad they were actual American citizens and thus avoided such criticism from people calling for an end to the Palestinian genocide.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",ENTERTAINMENT,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/im-too-old-and-rich-to-be-righteous-anymore-bono/
Irish Couples Under Increasing Pressure To Have ‘Mini-moon’,"A NEW SURVEY of Irish couples reveals that many feel crushing pressure to go on a ‘mini-moon’ despite ‘stupid fucking mini-moons’ only coming to prominence in recent years. “I’d never heard of it before but now all because she saw randomer who is dead good at putting make up on herself on Instagram had one, herself is off down the Credit Union,” explained oblivious groom to be Daniel Dennan. A toxic mix of notions, societal pressure and following influencers who get all this stuff for free, has, according to the recent survey led to 92% of couples planning a wedding or newly married convincing themselves they might not be allowed stay married under the eyes of the law unless they go on a romantic mini-honeymoon. “Suddenly, one day out of nowhere it becomes an accepted and demanded practice in society. Notions on crystal meth. Kind of like when everyone was perfectly happy carrying water around in a plastic bottle but now everyone has been convinced you need a hardy metal container that is so oversized it can store the contents of an Olympic sized-swimming pool in it, baffles the mind but here we are,” explained g’way-out-of-that expert Shona Ward. “A fucking mini-moon? No, you idiot, that’s what the honeymoon is for. That’s the holiday. You don’t have to have a little holiday so Paris doesn’t get jealous of your two weeks in the Caribbean. Are you mad?

5 Realistic New Year’s Resolutions,"EVERY YEAR thousands of Irish people set themselves unrealistic goals as so-called NEw Year’s resolutions and fail miserably when it comes to achieving anything. Why set the bar at an unobtainable level when there are some real everyday improvements to be made and very achievable targets. Check out these realistic New Year’s resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don’t count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of ‘getting dressed every day’. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don’t set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don’t even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 1, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/01/5-realistic-new-years-resolutions/
Seeing ‘Elder Millennials’ In News Headlines Like A Stab In The Heart,"MILLENNIALS have urged the media to choose their words more carefully after reports dozens of people born between in the 80s and 90s have suffered cataclysmic emotional breakdowns at seeing ‘elder millennials’ in headlines. “You can’t be elder anything if you are still part the fresh young generation that’s just emerged and is defining culture. Fashion, music, art, film, we’re the zeitgeist,” falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. “If you even so much as try and say ‘oh, I wasn’t born then so it was before my time’ to me, I’ll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn’t ‘classic TV’,” sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words ‘elder millennials’ often precede headlines such as ‘still have f-all hope of affording a house’. “Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We’re the tech generation,” offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window.

Nation’s Traffic At Standstill As Post-Christmas Re-turn Machine Queues Clog Roads,"TAILBACKS of 10 miles have been reported in some areas in Ireland today as people attempt to dispense with their post-Christmas cans of beer, in the first Christmas since the Re-turn recycling scheme was introduced. “Authorities should have seen this coming, we should have quadrupled the number of machines,” said one man from his car which he has been trapped in for 17 hours just outside the car park to his local Lidl such is the traffic. With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren’t out of order, the country’s main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey. “I didn’t think it through when I got in the eight slabs for the Christmas, I usually have a mental breakdown when I do the post-Christmas dump run but I guess I’ll just have it now,” added one individual towing a trailer full of his haul of Christmas cans which included some from the days they had the in-laws and neighbours over. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. “I’m missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTÉ,” said one driver, unaware the car they’ve been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago. UPDATE: Supermarkets with Re-turn machines are now providing hose down showers for drivers stuck in their cars for hours on end who now stink of stale alcohol emanating from their boots and back seats.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 26, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/26/nations-traffic-at-standstill-as-post-christmas-re-turn-machine-queues-clog-roads/
Christmas Miracle? Fine Gael & Fianna Fáil Put Aside Differences To Play Football In Leinster House Trenches,"JUST AS PEOPLE feared the venomous quarreling between two diametrically opposed forces would spill over into violence once again, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have laid down their finger-pointing arms and played a festive game of football. “Wow, ’tis the season of peace on earth and good will to all men, so it is,” said one shoe polisher outside Leinster House, who threw his flat cap skyward in exultation before jumping and clicking his heels. The tear-jerking intrusion of man’s basic humanity, the likes of which has not seen since the first World War, into the maddening mire of murderous political negotiation had seemed virtually impossible in recent weeks such was the near constant agreement the two sides have been locked in. “I’ve seen it all now, it wasn’t two days ago I heard some of them agreeing on absolutely everything, declining to even speak out loud due to their telepathic understanding of each other and now look at them, putting aside their zero differences to play a bit of ball, warms the heart. There’s a lesson in their for all of us” added another onlooker, filled with the Christmas spirit.

Local Woman Can’t Believe How Many Bullshit Made Up Christmas Traditions In-Laws Have,"THE PERSONABLE and polite exterior belonging to local woman Ciara Kinnane is at risk of shattering if she has to endure one more bullshit Christmas tradition observed by the her other half’s family, the Mortons. “Silly Sockless time, Silly Sockless time, who’s going to win the last Roses chocolate,” screeched Morton matriarch and mother-in-law to Kinanne, Carmel as the family inexplicably whipped off their socks and ran out the front door. “D’you not play this before? I definitely told you about this one Ciara,” Kinnane’s partner Jack said, outlining how one member of the family who can survive out on the concrete drive way in front of the house in their bare feet the longest wins a solitary chocolate. “But it’s mild enough like and you’re all adults. You can buy an infinite amount of chocolate for yourselves. In fact you just told me you vomited a little in your mouth there ‘cos you’re too full of chocolate,” a so-fucking-done-with-this Kinnane said. At first glance, Kinnane could be labeled a Grinch of the highest order, but experts in spending festive period with the in-laws have pleaded for understanding. “She’s had to sit through something called ‘Oopsy Daisy Gift’ where you buy someone a gift you know they’ll hate, and there’s still the Christmas Eve watching of the Michael Keaton Batman movies ‘as is tradition’ to come, and the mulled wine and pineapple soup. These family-specific traditions are a penance,” explained one Christmasologist, who wouldn’t blame Kinnane if she started walking back home to Cork from Dublin now. Expertly spotting that Kinnane was receding into herself slightly, her other half tried to cheer her up. “You a bit tired or something? Don’t worry, you’ll be having great craic once we start playing mistletoe toe, remember?

“How Come You & Your Dad Support Different Teams?” Innocently Asks Girlfriend About To Receive Crash Course In Chelsea’s Early 2000s Transformation,"UNAWARE she has set herself on a path towards receiving a dense-packed hours long lecture about early 2000s Premier League football, Emily O’Sullivan has queried why her boyfriend Sean Hughton supports a different team to his father. “And you see Damien Duff is Irish and he played the same position as me, and they were drowning in money. And Jose was cool back then, not the cringe magnet he is now, but even before him Ranieri was like sound and Ferguson and his little parade of pricks were arrogant as anything,” launched Hughton, not drawing breath as O’Sullivan identified her nearest emergency exits. Putting himself back on the defensive slightly 32-year-old Hughton made sure to mention how before his time mid-90s Chelsea were a joyously sophisticated blend of brawn and skill, counting Zola and Wise among their ranks, thus proving the ‘we’ve got no history’ chant is deeply ironic before having to explain the chant’s origins what O’Sullivan said “what’s a chant?”. “And sure dad would try and wedge me into a United shirt but I didn’t want to be like the other lad in school who were all United fans. You following this?” continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn’t seem to have desired effect on O’Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely. “Do you want to see my Premier League sticker book?” beamed Hughton, rummaging through a shoe box in his wardrobe.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 20, 2024",Football,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/20/how-come-you-your-dad-support-different-teams-innocently-asks-girlfriend-about-to-receive-crash-course-in-chelseas-early-2000s-transformation/
Investigation Launched To Discover Why Sofas No Longer Come With Arm Rest Covers,"IRISH homeowners are subject of a wide-ranging furniture study, believed to be the biggest of its kind, which is seeking to understand when the practice of having arm rest covers on sofas came to an end. “You couldn’t move from arm rest covers, couches had them, the ‘dad chair’ had them, the good room was just one big arm rest. Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?” professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O’Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. “Some suggest it’s a ‘notions’ thing but isn’t removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says ‘my sofa is precious’, it tells visitors ‘I don’t want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,” added O’Neill, who believes there’s a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn’t count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers. “Some studies are utterly pointless but am glad someone is finally doing something of value,” said one study participant Patricia Clarke, who is just thankful matching patterned curtains and carpets never went out of fashion.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 19, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/19/investigation-launched-to-discover-why-sofas-no-longer-come-with-arm-rest-covers/
Tesco Expand Self-Service Checkout To Include Customers Stacking Shelves & Processing Deliveries,"EYING a new streamlined and improved customer service experience, Tesco has announced it is expanding its self-service offerings beyond self-scan and checkout services from next week. “Customer surveys indicate they want more freedom to go about their shopping unencumbered by inconveniences in the traditional retail processes such as staff,” explained Tesco’s head of increasing dividends Tony Smith. The new changes will see customers allowed access to loading bays where they can free produce they want to buy from crates and pallets, moving them to their shop floor location at dedicated signposted spaces on shelves in various aisles. “From here, customers can then take a number of those items, scan them, pay for the items, pack them in bags and leave,” added Smith. The initiatives are set to increase customer interaction with faceless interfaces by 350%, reducing the need for surplus staff. “And we understand not all customers live in the most conveniently located areas in relation to their local branch. In fact, some might live closer to distribution centres and in those cases we’ve heard what customers have said and we give in; you can pick up large shipments of stock from there and drive them directly to our stores,” chimed head of staff headcount recalibration Craig Stafford. “Our only thought here is the customer, it’s all customer led initiatives and ideas,” he added, handing some pricing guns to a stressed out mother-of-three who just wanted to know where the milk aisle was.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 19, 2024",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/19/tesco-expand-self-service-checkout-to-include-customer-stacking-shelves-processing-deliveries/
Fears RIP.ie Death Notice Charge May Turn Irish Funerals Into A Money Racket,"IN A FIRST for the funeral industry in Ireland, many stakeholders are now suggesting vulnerable families processing the loss of a loved one could be preyed upon and have their grief exploited in the name of profit by bad faith actors. This fear comes with the news that the RIP.ie website, purchased this year by The Irish Times, will begin charging a €100 fee for death notices. “RIP.ie would want to cop on, that’s fierce bad,” said one funeral director who knows just the phrase to use to steer grieving families away from all the cheapest available elements of a funeral package. “And that phrase is ‘if you really loved them you’d go for our deluxe premium gold mourning package'” they added. In retaliation to the new charge, Irish people around the country are gathering in protest and have confirmed they will boycott dying until RIP.ie reverse their decision. “That’s awful so it is,” offered a priest who can paid upwards of €150 for doing the thing he’s supposedly driven to do as a calling as he is not motivated by money.  Florists, printers, musicians, car leasers, hotels, restaurants and bars among others have all condemned RIP.ie’s decision to take a look grieving families and think ‘they could be paying more’. “As a firm that charges by the individual tissue handed out to grieving widows, we know an insensitive price gouge when we see one,” offered one dissenting funeral director who would now have to regretfully up the fee they already charged for placing an RIP notice.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/fears-rip-ie-death-notice-charge-may-turn-irish-funerals-into-a-money-racket/

Murphy, known to some for believing 3-year-old refugees would need de-programming because they’re probably in ISIS, and having the Workplace Relations Committee finding she had penalised an office worker in her 60s who had raised allegations of bullying against her during her time as head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, is set to net the €255k position due to her sterling CV which now reads ‘make me Ceann Comhairle if you want independents’ support’. “All that may be true but let’s focus instead on the fact she will be the first ever female Ceann Comhairle,” countered Verona Murphy. For their part Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael defended their actions. “If this sort of move is anything to go by, I have a feeling the next five years could be Irish politics finest every period,” confirmed Micheál Martin, drooling as he stared at the Taoiseach’s office. “She wasn’t good enough for Fine Gael when she left and we found her conduct unbecoming but I’d rather nail my sack to a high speed Japanese train than develop some principles and a moral compass, power at any cost baby,” confirmed Taoiseach-for-now Simon Harris.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/fresh-hope-irish-politics-changing-for-better-with-ff-fg-supporting-td-who-thinks-3-year-old-immigrants-are-in-isis-for-ceann-comhairle/
On This Day 1981: Ireland’s First Swingers Discuss Having No One To Ride,"IRELAND’S first ever controversial ‘swingers’ have asked for at least one other couple to develop a perverse and sickening interest in extra-marital mickey swapping, Waterford Whispers News reports with much regret. “I’m not sure we technically qualify as swingers as we haven’t found anyone to swing with,” a rueful Cathy Dolan told this publication, discussing the desire she and her husband Brian have to broaden their hobbies to foreign-to-their-wedding-vows fornication. “I think if someone was brave enough to consider becoming Ireland’s second swinging couple, we’d have a jolly time, it’s quite lonely at the minute, one set of keys in the bowl,” explained Brian Dolan, a sullen figure striped down to his birthday suit with no one other than his wife to blow out his candle. “Brian tries to hide his disappointment when he pulls his own keys out of the bowl at our parties, but I see it in his eyes,” a sad Cathy added. Aside from putting an advert down an alley way in the form of a ‘for a good time call’ scrawl on a wall in graffiti, the couple are at a loss as how to find a like-minded couple. “We got close once with a couple from Limerick but I think they misunderstood the keys in a bowl thing and drove off with Brian’s VW,” Cathy explained. “We’re penpals with a couple in Germany, they do more swinging than monkeys on a vine over there, you can’t fathom the embarrassment each new postcard we send brings; a swinger who hasn’t swung,” sobbed Brian.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/on-this-day-1981-irelands-first-swingers-discuss-having-no-one-to-ride/
What Irish People Are Saying About Israel Closing Its Embassy In Ireland,"NEWS WHICH has been extensively reported around the world and hotly debated online, but just what do the Irish public make of the Israeli government’s decision to close their embassy here in Ireland? WWN has taken to the streets to find out: “Since the embassy will be going spare, we can probably let Palestinian refugees move in?” – Deirdre, Cork. “I might be overdue an eye test but why does Netanyahu suddenly closely resemble a jockey’s bollocks?” – Carmel, Wexford. “I get it, when I’m annoyed at people I feel aren’t treating me well I punish them by punching myself in the face too” – Cormac, Wicklow. “I’m an Irish-American on Twitter with 12 followers that absolutely isn’t a bot account and I can confidently say I speak for all Irish people when I say antisemitism is taught from birth in Ireland. It’s whispered in the ears of newborns by midwives and Irish people are given a free potato every time they say ‘Israel is bad'” – SonOfAira1816. “That’s very Main Character Energy of Israel, we’re actually too busy protesting against and intimidating refugees in Ireland to be bothered being mean to their embassy” – Fergal, Westmeath. “Things have gotten so bad Israel has got me supporting Simon Harris, thanks a lot Netanyahu!” – Mairead, Dublin. “Sorry, I can’t talk I’m off to return one of my 40 copies of Mein Kampf to the library” Ian, Waterford. “I can’t help but feel this is partly my fault, if only I’d celebrated the murder of Palestinians, sent a congratulations card every time a child was executed by sniper fire then the ambassador would have felt more welcome” – Shay, Kerry. “Rent in Dublin is a pox, I know the feeling too pal, I left a long time ago” – Ciara, Glasgow. “Antisemitism is a very real and hateful form discrimination which needs to be stamped out, but that’s probably not helped by the Israeli government calling Irish people antisemitic for objecting to mass murder” – Laura, Galway.  “Is this the first time the Israeli government has actually given up property?” – Kevin, Cavan.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 17, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/17/what-irish-people-are-saying-about-israel-closing-its-embassy-in-ireland/
4-Year-Old Pours Glass Of Ribena After Another Exhausting Day,"“I’M THAT up to my eyes with the stress, I’ll have it neat,” stone-faced 4-year-old Jack McKinty barked at his Mam, Una McKinty, after what must rank as the most stressful day in little Jack’s life thus far. A particularly taxing bout of chasing during little break, coupled with exhaustive number rhymes and an argument over what the best dinosaur is, McKinty entered the second half of his day more tired than usual, with his desire to ‘put today to bed’ manifesting itself in a 6pm request for an unprecedented second glass of Ribena. “My friends don’t understanded me, hide and seek is better than just chasing. Mrs Horan doesn’t understanded me, maths is wojus altogether, we should do painting but Ribena, Ribena gets me,” said Jack staring into the middle distance, inhaling sharply as the 2024 vintage blackcurrant juice burned a little in his throat. Jack’s stress levels weren’t helped by the fact his two older siblings were ‘acting the complete pricks’ when they returned from school, insisting on switching off Bluey in favour of playing their computer games. “Okay honey, just this once but we can’t make having two glasses of Ribena a habit okay? It’s not good for your toothy woothies and it’s full of E numbers,” Una told her child, who couldn’t hear her as his senses were momentarily dulled by the sugary blackcurrant squash coursing around his body. “This world is chewing me up and spitting me out just fine without you being on my case too Una, just one day, that’s all I’m asking, one fucking day you can just leave me to enjoy the small things in life without a lecture,” said Jack grabbing the bottle of raw unfiltered Ribena and storming off to bed.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/4-year-old-pours-glass-of-ribena-after-another-exhausting-day/
McEntee Reassures Public Dublin City Safe Between The Times Of 10.23am-10.27am Every Second Tuesday,"FOLLOWING a fresh assault in the capital city, this time on two off duty gardaí Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has confirmed the city is definitely safe during a narrow but precise window of time. “As I have previously stated on the 239 other occasions I have been forced to put out similarly phrased words of comfort in the wake of violence in the city; this is an isolated incident and Dublin is safe… during 10.23am and 10.27am every second Tuesday-ish,” explained the Minister. With no empirical research and reason to back up why this particular 4-minute window is a blissfully peaceful time on the streets has emerged, the public have been urged not to complain but rather except this as the good news it is. “I looked it up, it’s not when methadone is doled out, it’s not when Conor McGregor is training in the gym or the Monk is off on a jolly in an early house, we can’t pin down the reason but let’s not question it Dubliners just enjoy it,” confirmed one Dept of Justice spokesperson. The news has seen an increase in city dwellers maximising the time, getting all errands and highly dangerous activities such as ‘existing’ out of the way in the golden 4-minutes. “Nah, you’re alright,” responded the Minister when asked if she planned another walk through the city centre flanked by gardaí and the media.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/mcentee-reassures-public-dublin-city-safe-between-the-times-of-10-23am-10-27am-every-second-tuesday/
"Former Fine Gael Politician Charged With Human Trafficking & Possessing Sex Abuse Images, Some Media Half-Heartedly Reports","WITH FORMER Fine Gael councillor Bill Tormey accused of possessing child pornography images and helping to bring an illegal immigrant into the country, some media outlets have reacted with somewhere between 2 and 3% of the breathless coverage they normally reserve for such a bombshell news item. “There is a case before the courts, this curtails what we can report but also I’m devastated this wasn’t a Sinn Féin rep, ‘cus it’s now basically a non-story worthy of little to no further reporting” confirmed one journalist, whose desire for fishing out crass details and doorstepping politicians is unusually absent. Layout designers and editors who may have been required to work late on 32-page special pullout supplements on such an Earth-shattering story have been stood down, as have producers of emergency podcasts, as it now transpires this isn’t a big story in the public interest. “I may have demanded Sinn Féin answer all and any questions relating to the case of their once-staff member being a sex offender, but it would be downright tawdry journalism to ask Fine Gael to answer for an individual and their alleged actions. A trial much take place. And when that is over and if he’s found guilty, I will say ‘justice has spoken, there is no more to say’ and move on,” one reactionary columnist confirmed. “No, there’s a clear difference; in the case of Sinn Féin you can extrapolate out an issue and ask, speculate and confirm it’s proof of deficiencies and anti-democratic values which are unique to the party but if such alleged crimes relate to a Fine Gael member, that’s mere coincidence and it would be churlish and unethical to draw conclusions about the party itself,” confirmed another columnist readying a ‘Expect The Opposition To Play Political With An Incredibly Sensitive Issue’ article.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/former-fine-gael-politician-charged-with-human-trafficking-possessing-sex-abuse-images-some-media-half-heartedly-reports/
Thousands Of Psychologists Descend On Manchester City To Observe & Study Guardiola’s Meltdown,"MANCHESTER hotels and Air Bnbs are at full capacity as the world’s leading psychologists have descended on the city in the hope of getting to observe, in person, Pep Guardiola’s post and pre-match press conference in which he slowly unravels. “Truly fascinating, it’s like if Einstein suddenly not only forgot the basic tenets of physics but was struggling to count to ten,” remarked one psychologist on Man City’s current complete lack of form. With City’s resolve and spine currently wilting like a ice cream cone on the surface of the sun, Guardiola’s response to continued adversity is the sort material that could fill a thousands PHD studies. “I’ve seen men who walked in their wives having sex with all four of their brothers at once cope better than this guy,” said a psychologist fascinated by the former Barcelona man’s soul-baring stream of consciousness press interviews. “Look the January transfer window is coming up, City will be looking to make new additions, we’re just hoping to be one of the 40 new additions required,” confirmed a group of therapists hoping to join the coaching Pep down on the ledge of his own manic monologues team.

"Country That Stole Irish Passports For Use In Assassinations, Attacked Irish Peacekeepers Closes Embassy In Ireland Over Country’s Opposition To Genocide","SOMETIMES, brutal regimes with little regard for human rights go too far. This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. “Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,” confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland’s decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. “Take that Ireland!” announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they’ve been punished. “What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?” offered an upset Netanyahu. The Israeli leader was unable to answer any further questions as he was called away to authorise more missile strikes on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran.

Conor McGregor Wins ‘Brought Most Shame To Ireland’ At RTÉ Sports Awards,"RTÉ’S biggest night in sport saw Paul O’Donovan walk away with the coveted ‘Sportsperson of the Year award’ for his Olympic and World Rowing Championships heroics. However, it wasn’t the only award handed out on the night with Conor McGregor having the great dishonour of picking up the ‘Brought Most Shame To Ireland’ award.  An unprecedented 5th win in a row in the category, McGregor faced his toughest competition for the award this year with late surges from ‘Unnamed Armagh GAA player questioned over rape’, Denis Coulson, who is was given 14 years in a French prison for his part in a gang rape of a woman and Chris Farrell who must wear an electronic monitor for two years after being found guilty for failure to prevent a crime. “I think it’s unfair on Conor, I voted for Catriona Carey myself, no one worked harder to ruin their sporting legacy in my opinion, maybe next year we can have a family category so the Careys get their due,” confirmed one voter for the awards. All in all it was a strong showing for the rugby fraternity with ex-international Brendan Mullin serving a three year sentence for stealing €570,000 from Bank of Ireland.

‘Super Low Key’ Girls Xmas Meet Up Somehow Costs €427,"AN ANNUAL Xmas get together over a ‘super low key’ lunch among a group of friends is dangerously spiralling into a ‘massive ball ache’ thanks to the pricey organising habits and notions addiction of one Marie McGrath (32). “I’ve Christmas with two kids to be paying for, Shauna and Michelle are saving for houses, how in the name of the baby Jesus is this costing this much?” said Patricia Farley, in a separate WhatsApp group set up to bitch about McGrath. Running for over the past 7 years and always taking place over a brief lunch in Dublin during a workday given everyone’s busy schedules over the Christmas, Type A McGrath has successfully strong-armed the group into buckling to her demands and a two-night stay in Galway. “Galway doesn’t really suit me,” remarked Niamh Sullivan, the only one of the girls still living In Waterford, whose concerns were directly addressed by McGrath in the form of sending a link to €90 elf costumes everyone is now required to wear. A secret Santa with a budget of €150, a €60 bottomless brunch with a non-refundable deposit and staying in a 4-star hotel with a spa they won’t have time to use are among the many concerns the group have. “Don’t be silly, what are we? Penniless students,” McGrath responded to a suggestion to book a cheap hostel while omitting the fact the cost of the ‘lunch’ has now topped €658 excluding any money spent while in Galway. “They have a special offer on in the hotel where if you book the luxury suites they give you a festive cocktail for €20 extra but still – makes sense to make a fuss so it’s not just a boring get together, oh and then have that fake snow that gives you pink eye if it gets within 2 feet of your face,” enthused McGrath, who will have to be deposed from her organising role in a bloody coup.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 13, 2024",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/13/super-low-key-girls-xmas-meet-up-somehow-costs-e427/
Pep Guardiola Calls Shamrock Rovers For Tips On Winning In Europe,"“THIS GAME has given me a lot so I don’t mind giving back, and I’ll help an any aspiring coach I can,” confirmed Stephen Bradley, who showed just how gracious and humble he is by taking a phone call from a struggling coach based in Manchester late yesterday evening.

Keeping him on the phone for close to 4 hours, Guardiola sought advice in other areas including what to do if your team is found to have broken spending rules 115 times and may be relegated to 47th tier of English football. “Jesus if you had asked me about boardroom squabbles I’d have a book for you on that, but can’t help you there pal,” explained Bradley, who declined to take struggling defender Kyle Walker off the Spaniard’s hands.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 13, 2024",Football,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/13/pep-guardiola-calls-shamrock-rovers-for-tips-on-winning-in-europe/
"Everyone Advised To Ignore Report Saying House Prices Overvalued By 10%, Everything Is Fine","AN ERSI report warned householders currently paying an average 33% of their net income on their mortgages are vulnerable to a ‘painful correction’ on house prices which are overvalued by as much as 10%. “Only 10%?” said the Irish public staring at Daft.ie listings for ‘half collapsed shed in active war zone, D15’ valued at €550,000 which beg to differ. Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. “You’ll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it. NOW,” whispered the mangled demon soul of Ireland directly into the ears’ of first time buyers. “Sadly, they’re not elevated enough. I was barely able to leverage my home to buy an apartment in Dublin to rent at extortionate levels; it’s the Irish dream,” shared one man, who thinks it’s a disgrace his kids can’t afford a house. Meanwhile, the outgoing Minister for Housing has confirmed having combed through the report its content are clearly a hyperbolic fantasy and that everything is indeed fine.  “Oh I haven’t read a word. But from my understanding we can counteract further price inflation by doing things that increase prices like more subsidies for builders, tax breaks for landlords, increasing the help to buy scheme and upping the rent credit payment,” explained Darragh O’Brien, who admitted government formation talks were on the verge of collapse as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fight over who gets responsibility for increasing homeless figures.

Man Greets ‘Suitable For 8 People’ Label On Food Like A Challenge,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man has admitted for the first that for much of his life he has treated the guidelines listed by producers of food as a challenge, and has successfully beaten the ‘pathetic’ gauntlets they have clearly laid down for him. “‘Serves eight’? Never heard such nonsense in my life,” confirmed Niall Tulley, collecting the flakey crumbs on his chest, the only remnants of his 16 pack of sausage rolls. “It’s the arrogance that gets me to be honest, ‘suggested serving size – one slice’, you don’t think I can do it? Eat the whole cake? I’ll show you,” added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a ‘call out’ and a ‘questioning of my stomach storage facilities’, Tulley’s nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. “You can’t put ‘serves 8’ on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,” explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. “Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor”. Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include ‘listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you’ve nothing to prove’ and ‘but won’t you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?’",Waterford Whispers News,"December 12, 2024",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/12/man-greets-suitable-for-8-people-label-on-food-like-a-challenge/
Saudi Arabia Begins Plotting Workers’ Mass Grave For World Cup 2034,"DELIVERING for the good of the game once again, FIFA have announced that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, winning a bidding processing in which they were the only applicants. “Saudi Arabia had an amazing bid, but more than anything we were impressed by the $1bn they invested in DAZN which then DAZN announced a $1bn deal for the broadcast rights to the new FIFA Club World Cup,” said FIFA official Bribe McBribery. Celebrations among the Saudi delegation had to remain short and swift as attention turned to what to do with the bodies of all the dead migrant labourers who will suffer human rights abuses and die of exhaustion building the 2034 stadiums. “We don’t want the mass grave near any of the tourist stuff, obviously” offered one meek member of Mohammed Bin Salman’s delegation during a human rights abuses storming session. “Call me crazy, well don’t ‘cus I’ll have you killed, but would it be the perfect mix of dastardly and practical to just leave a big hole at pitch level and just pop all the bodies in there, then lay the over them?” queried Mohammed Bin Salman. “If I may, I don’t know why we’re fretting over this, we could dump them in a big pile in front of an official FIFA fan zone, if Qatar’s proven anything it’s that no one cares,” offered one McBribery.

Revenue Raise Concerns As Some GAA County Board Accounts Written In Marker On Hurl Grip Tape,"WITH MAYO and Galway GAA not in a position to sign off on their accounts and seeking GAA HQ intervention as Revenue belatedly discovered the organisation’s existence, it has been claimed that some county boards’ monitoring of accounts was limited to scribbling expense claims down on discarded hurl grip tape. “They may be an amateur organisation but we’re one step shy of doing calculations using an abacus made of character references,” confirmed one tax expert. “Ah, accounting is like GAA rule changes, a complete pain in the hole and if you kick up enough of a fuss they just change them back again in the end,” confirmed one county board member who is pretty sure mileage, payments and holidays worth thousands in payments aren’t the tax man’s business and the only receipt he’s kept is a nod and a wink. “GAA (Gaelic Accounting Adjustments) is a complex financial system that Revenue officials simply don’t understand but it’s straightforward, if one of the senior team lads receives a car from a sponsor gratis, you jot down ‘nutritional allowance’ and that’s the end of it,” explained one county board official. Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating ‘but we’re the GAA’ didn’t immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids’ play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received €40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles.

Israel Bagsies Syria,"LOUDLY PROCLAIMING ‘yoink’, the government led by fraud trial attender and internationally wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu are defending their decision to seize the Golan Heights ‘buffer zone’ in the wake of the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s reign. “Bagsie it,” confirmed Israel citing a cast iron legal precedent observed the world over. The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim.  Citing previous bagsie incidents including ‘Israel’ and the fact it has illegally occupied the other portion of Golan since 1967, Israel do not expect any meaningful challenge to their commandeering of the territory. “I dunno, sounds pretty compelling to us,” confirmed originator of the ‘bagsie it’ method, Britain. Having also destroyed the majority of the newly liberated Syria’s military capabilities, Netanyahu said he hoped any future leadership there would accept his clear offer of friendship but warned that geography is not the IDF’s strong suit and they could continue to expand the size of the Golan Heights if they need to.

Coined as ‘Syrians rebels’ for now until it suits, militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani was greeted with cheers from supporters after capturing the Syrian capital Damascus, solidifying the once wanted group’s control over much of the country. “Don’t worry guys, we’re the good Islamic terrorists so there’s no need to worry about us beheading any of you or anything, unless you’re Christian of course,” proclaimed the rebel leader, who has had a US-issued $10mn dollar reward on his head since 2017, which was ages ago really when you think about it and people change. “I don’t even dress like a terrorist anymore. Look at my army style shirt. I’m like a Syrian Zelensky, I’m one of the good guys now!” he stated. Forcing the Assad family to flee to Russia after a 50-year reign of terror, the once al-Qaeda member al-Jawlani promised a more pragmatic approach to jihad going forward, admitting his past endeavours were questionable, but to trust him all the same as he’s a changed man. “I was al-Qaeda, then Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, then Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but today I’m a Syrian rebel. I may have changed terrorist organisations more times than my headscarf, but you can’t buy that kind of experience so I’m the perfect guy to take over from Assad until they oust me later down the line,” al-Jawlani concluded his statement. Meanwhile, Syrian people have been told to stop celebrating the end of a brutal dictatorship by western leaders because the group that brought freedom didn’t get their permission beforehand.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/dont-worry-were-the-good-terrorists/
Hayes Sickened He Didn’t Hold Out As Stock He Dumped Soars,"NEWLY SUSPENDED newly elected Social Democrats Eoin Hayes has voiced his regret after shares in software company Palantir have almost tripled in the six months since he sold them. Offloading his stake for just €200k in July, Hayes’ shares would be now worth nearly €600k, which works out at a full terms salary in the Dáil or the cost of an ‘affordable home’ in Dublin. “He’s absolutely bulling,” a source close to Hayes described his mood as he was forced on moral grounds to dump his stake in the US company which provides artificial-intelligence products and services to Israel for use in occupied Palestinian territories. The newly elected Dublin Bay South TD has been suspended from the Social Democrats’ parliamentary party with immediate effect for giving incorrect information, originally stating he sold the shares before he was elected to politics, but was actually after the fact. “In fairness to Eoin he’s showing some real promise as an Irish politician and shouldn’t be put off that he was booted out of the Social Dems for lying, he’d get a promotion in Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael for the same thing,” pointed out another source.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 11, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/11/hayes-sickened-he-didnt-hold-out-as-stocks-he-dumped-soars/
Some Irish Villages Resorting To Cannibalism As Power Yet To Be Restored After Storm Darragh,"DESPITE ESB repair crews’ best effort, a significant number of people in Ireland still remain without power in the aftermath of Storm Darragh with worrying reports many have resorted to cannibalism. “You got a phone charger? I’ll such your dick for a little phone juice. Please, I’m desperate,” said one internet-deprived Waterford resident seconds into losing power during Storm Darragh, and the social cohesion and civility has only fractured further since then plunging some villages into a more-lawless-usual nightmare. “Ah look, we actually had a load of pre-cooked meals and that so we were fine for food but I thought this storm might be my only excuse to try human flesh,” said one Galway resident feasting on his neighbour’s arm, having just endured close to 30 hours without power. This man is not alone, as it is estimated nearly 3,000 rural Irish villages now resemble some sort of zombie apocalypse movie on steroids. “I wouldn’t mind only we had got in extra stock and hired a generator,” said one rural take away that actually suffered a dip in business as panicked locals never considered checking in, instead choosing to immediately resort to cannibalism. “It’s got so bad Donal Skehan has rushed out a cannibal recipe book for the Christmas,” said one ESB worker who had his leg gnawed off as he was halfway up a pole fixing an electrical fault.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/some-irish-villages-resorting-to-cannibalism-as-power-yet-to-be-restored-after-storm-darragh/
Person At Top Of Shop Queue Taken Completely By Surprise By Request To Pay For Goods,"A MAN AT the top of a lengthy shopping queue has been taken by surprise at a request for payment, WWN can exclusively reveal. Initially local man Tom Shannon struggled to comprehend the words, straining and asking the supermarket retail assistant to repeat what they said before engaging in what looked like the long forgotten elaborate tribal dance of his people, patting down every pocket his clothing had several times. “Just a sec,” said Shannon, who despite seeing the four people in front of him go through the same routine to pay for his shopping, was as ill-prepared for a request for payment as a monkey would be if asked to perform open heart surgery. “What’s this prick at,” confirmed the eleven people behind Shannon in queue in unison. Wasting the sort of time George RR Martin could’ve finished writing his Game of Thrones series in, Shannon fumbled, rummaged and pulled at his jacket and jean pockets before producing his phone which he intended on paying with. “There we are now,” said Shannon before failing to open his phone using face-ID technology, forcing him to resort to incorrectly inputting his phone pin which led him to revert to using his debit card. Doing so with the sort of nonchalance that brings out a unique and potent level of animosity in fellow shoppers, Shannon then repeatedly tapped a coffee loyalty card on the card machine. “You should have given me a heads up you were finished scanning my shopping,” Shannon now barked at the retail assistant, cementing his reputation as a one-of-a-kind dickhead in the process.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 6, 2024",Category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/06/person-at-top-of-shop-queue-taken-completely-by-surprise-by-request-to-pay-for-goods/
Assad To Be Given Tour Of Moscow’s Most Beautiful 10th Storey Windows,"A REMARKABLE few days has seen the fall of Syrian tyrant Bashar Al-Assad, with reports placing him in the safe haven for a number of irredeemable bastard dictators, Moscow. The deposed despot fled the country he and his family brutalised for over 50 years but those fearing Assad would be left to a life in penury and suffering will be left disappointed as evidenced by the warm welcome he has reportedly received from Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “I know you would rather be back home killing and torturing, who wouldn’t, but in Moscow we have nice restaurants, the theatre, oh and you will not believe the beautiful windows we have. Hey, Alexander show Bashar our best windows,” enthused Putin before abruptly leaving his dictator friend to get back to concentrating on his three day special military operation in Ukraine. Putin’s FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow’s best high rise windows. “You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me? I like two-panel slider window because once it slide over you can lock in place so no accidentally close while you trying to get view. Come look,” insisted Assad’s friendly and accommodating tour guide. Assad’s guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below. “With jalousie window, you no stand out on edge, feel breeze on face, hand at your back. It real shame,” added Alexander, before ushering Assad to the crown jewel of Russian windows which is known for its panoramic views and no overlooking apartment blocks or witnesses.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/assad-to-be-given-tour-of-moscows-most-beautiful-10th-storey-windows/
Local Dad Enters 2nd Hour Of Christmas Tree Price Negotiation Stand Off,"A FATHER based in the Ireland area of Europe is growing ever more dug in on his insistence that the Christmas tree he is attempting to buy should cost no more than €45. “I’ll walk, I’m telling I’ll walk, and then what? That’s a sale gone for your good self,” insisted 45-year-old Cormac Keeler as his children stood by, wishing the world would swallow them up. Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating ‘trees €45, €65 & €85’ Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at €85. “Your sign says ‘€45’ and aim to hold you to that,” barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don’t treat everything like an episode of Dragon’s Den. “You don’t think I’ll go down to the GAA club where they’re selling them as well. I’ve bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for €45 is more than fare,” said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as ‘an asshole’ when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year. Keeler, now shivering from being in the cold so long in a thin jumper, began losing stamina but insisted on not losing face in front of his children. “I’ll give you €85 on the sly but you just pretend you’ve agreed to go down to €45,” pleaded Keeler, to which Horan responded ‘no’.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 6, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/06/local-dad-enters-2nd-hour-of-christmas-tree-price-negotiation-stand-off/
UnitedHealthcare Board Not Sure When Right Time To Break It To CEO’s Family None Of This Is Covered Under Insurance Plan,"A SHOCKING BROAD daylight assassination, a suspect still on the loose, and a motive not yet clear. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has left America reeling,   “Can’t we just crush their souls will a faceless barrage of automated emails full of mangled and meaningless bureaucratic jargon like they were a normal customer?” pondered one executive, who noted a pre-existing allergy to being shot as justification for why any healthcare administered is not covered. While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.  “No, they have our cell numbers, we can’t just rely on our customer disservice lines for this one,” one anguished board member said, bouyed slightly by the news the company’s share price is actually up. “C’mon, this isn’t a single mother-of-two in need of cancer treatment that we give the run around to, this is a real person with a real family,” reasoned one soft hearted profit-allergic board member who risked tarnishing UH’s stellar industry-leading 32% claim rejection rate. “Could we maybe put aside some of huge increases in profits we’ve experienced in the last few years and cover things ourselves? We’ve what, $90bn in profits from last year?” suggested one smiling executive to titters of laughter. Meanwhile, profits are set to soar at private security firms that specialise in providing protection to the top 1% earners across the world.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 5, 2024",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/05/unitedhealthcare-board-not-sure-when-right-time-to-break-it-to-ceos-family-none-of-this-is-covered-under-insurance-plan/
Parents Counteract Child Dropping Hints About Xmas Presents By Dropping Hints They’re Broke As Fuck,"“OH TWO can play that game motherfucker” confirmed stressed and broke parents Martin and Fiona Larkan, responding to their eldest child’s increasing number of outlandish hints and requests relating to this year’s Christmas presents. “Bless him, we’d love to get him nice things but he’s overdoing it with the PS5 and SIX feckin’ games,” confirmed Fiona, who has taken to leaving the couple’s shrinking bank balance statements out on the kitchen table for Fiachra (11) to read. Martin has undertaken the more demanding role when it comes to acting, taking to crying when in the car with Fiachra when the petrol gauge flitters near empty. “Yeah, acting, that’s it,” confirmed Martin who has taken to plugging the TV out during ad breaks to save on electricity bills. Not alone this Christmas, the Larkans are believed to part of a growing number of parents who resort to interrupting ‘the magic of Christmas’ with the occasional ‘do you have any idea how much the fucking magic of Christmas is costing us’ lectures when a child asks for €3,000 worth of presents. “You see, this is just a foundational tenet of negotiating. You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they’ve won. But this was the plan all along,” explained Fiachra, who in asking for a trip to a Premier League game knew he was really guaranteeing a football jersey and training top.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 4, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/04/parents-counteract-child-dropping-hints-about-xmas-presents-with-dropping-hints-theyre-broke-as-fuck/
‘You Up Hun?’ FF & FG Sends Late Night Text To Michael Lowry,"SHOUTING to a member of house staff to come in and remove his sleep mask from his face so he can see who just texted him at 2 in the morning, independent TD Michael Lowry smiled to himself at being added to the WhatsApp group ‘The Boys Are Back In Town’. “Melvin, start up the sauna and throw on the kettle, it’s going to be a long day of flirting,” Lowry ordered his butler, who was now folding back the bed clothes for his master to sit up. “It’s going to be like the good old days again – time really is a healer”. The received ‘you up hun?’ text slowly gathered thumbs-up emojis from other recipients, including the Healy Raes, Mattie McGrath, Verona Murphy and that guy who cursed in the Dáil once. “Thanks for the add, guys, all we need now is Bertie,” a message quickly liked by ‘The Bertmeister’ read, much to the amusement of everyone. “At least we’ve no IMF admins in the group chat this time,” a message from ‘2-pint man’ read, souring the chat’s flow. Independent TDs secured almost 17% of the votes this election holding the keys to a Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government, if they play ball. “I kno problem joining ladz as long as we bring back drink drivin,” worded Danny Healy Rae as several eye roll emojis appeared.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 4, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/04/you-up-hun-ff-fg-sends-late-night-text-to-michael-lowry/
“That’s Bad Form Now” Kim Jong Un Urges South Korean President To Stand Down,"“THAT’S bad form now, you wouldn’t see that kind of carry on up north,” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un began in a nationwide TV address calling out his South Korean counterpart who attempted to implement martial law yesterday in a bid to avoid impeachment. Yoon Suk Yeol’s future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world’s spotlight. “Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,” Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death. “This is exactly what happens when you’ve got a poor leader who can’t control his people – sure they may all have fancy things like food, a working economy, health care and really nice fried chicken, but what would you prefer, all those materialistic things or a great strong leader with dashing good looks?” Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of ‘we love you’ could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation’s men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year. “Since it’s Christmas, I’m giving away a free holiday to Eastern Europe for every North Korean man in the country. See how nice I am to you?

"‘Supplying Weapons To Kill 50,000 People All Fine But Just Don’t Pardon Your Son,’ Biden Told","LONG DORMANT media columnists and political commentators have awoken from a year long hibernation to valiantly put on record their displeasure at the most heinous thing Joe Biden has done since taking office. “Are we not a country of rules and laws anymore? I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,” exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. “Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you” offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. “What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,” Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner’s dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister.  “Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he’s walking free – makes me sick,” said Trump who didn’t pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment. Journalists possessed with a unique political insight even suggest inspired by Biden, Trump could now suddenly develop an interest in using pardoning powers for allies and January 6th insurrectionists.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 3, 2024",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/03/supplying-weapons-to-kill-50000-people-all-fine-but-just-dont-pardon-your-son-biden-told/
“First 100 Violations Of Ceasefire Are Free” US Tells Israel As IDF Continues To Strike Lebanon,"DESPITE UNIFIL forces observing at least 100 instances of Israeli forces breaching the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the US administration between the IDF and Hezbollah, it has emerged that the deal had some hidden clauses applying solely to Israel. “Well, as a valued and repeat customer for US arms, Israel actually signed up to our premium package which mean the first 100 violations of ceasefires are free,” spokesperson for the US Department of State, Matthew Miller, said. Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear. “Now, look, it’s not all rosy for the IDF when the next 100 violations occur that triggers a clause in our agreement together,” outlined Miller, revealing the hard line the Biden administration continues to take could see Israel sent more weapons as punishment. Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. “It’s not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,” outlined Miller.

Fianna Fáil & Fine Gael’s ‘Red Lines’ For Going Into Government With Each Other,"EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheál Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the ‘red lines’? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheál Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fáil would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fáil will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Féin embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dáil bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a €20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Féin effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia.

“Calm Down Sugar Tits”: Gregg Wallace’s Guide To Crafting The Perfect Apology,"SO YOU’VE found yourself in a spot of bother and now some middle class women of a certain age who can’t take a joke/groping are giving out to HR.  You might be fearing the worst; job gone, career over, but relax one of the world’s leading apology experts, Gregg Wallace, is on hand to dispense his priceless advice that’ll get everyone back on your side: Step 1) Deescalate – there’s been a clear misunderstanding of harmless banter. “Calm down sugar tits”. Fire any and all publicists working for you, you’ve got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners.  If anything you’ll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn’t even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. “You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I’d love motor boat clearly aren’t getting any at home which is why you can’t even take a compliment”. Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn’t the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. “Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I’ll need to pretend I’m a devout Christian now too”. Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife’s vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn’t an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You’re going to want to mention the word ‘woke’ a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I’m A Celebrity to see if they’ll book you on the first flight to the jungle.
