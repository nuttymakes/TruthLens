Rare Good News: 80% Of Germans Not Fascists,"INITIAL EXIT polls from German media indicate only 1 in 5 German voters think a Fourth Reich is a really good idea, WWN understands. The far-right AfD, a party so extreme they even give France's Marine le Pen the ick, surged in the federal election polls but only garnered 20% of first preference votes meaning it is likely CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader Friedrich Merz will be the next chancellor if he can form a coalition in part with Olaf Scholz's SPD party. ""What a minor glimmer of positivity in this shit-infested world that is hellbent on eating itself,"" reacted many to the relatively good news emanating from Germany that a party supported by Elon Musk and which considers Hitler to have been a 'communist' has only doubled it's vote. It is not clear when AfD leader Alice Weidel will allege immigrant criminals with multiple identities illegally voted for the CDU/CSU, but it is expected sooner rather than later and will be warmly received by those who respond to the AfD's 'not everyone in the SS was a criminal' messaging. ""We couldn't have done this without Trump surrendering to Putin, thank you so much for scaring the shit out of voters,"" confirmed Merz in his victory speech. Elsewhere, noticing the election had an 84% turnout, perplexed Irish people began searching on Google to confirm voting in Germany is probably mandatory and comes with the threat of the death penalty if you fail to cast your ballot.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 24, 2025",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/24/rare-good-news-80-of-germans-not-fascists/
"IDF Condemn Vile Hamas Ceremony, Point Out They’ve Been Very Respectful Of 46,000 Palestinians They’ve Murdered","THE PARADING of the coffins of dead Israeli children by Hamas amid scenes of cheering has been met with near universal disdain and condemnation. Reacting to the events the IDF issued a number of statements, making the distinction between their just and moral actions in combat compared to the barbarism unique to Hamas, Lords of the Desert and Palestinian Mujahideen Movement terrorists. ""We're not animals like them. At least when IDF soldiers literally raped a Palestinian detainee to death in Sde Teiman we had the good grace and decency not to film and broadcast it,"" confirmed the IDF, an army which is also credited with making Gaza home to the most child amputees per capita in the world. In the wake of Hamas's macabre ceremony those advocating for a permanent end to the killing of Palestinian civilians reportedly feel 'pretty silly' in thinking the IDF is also wrong in committing an endless parade of war crimes. ""Of the over 46,000 Palestinians we've killed, can you recall any celebrations? Or any sordid visual metaphors like we've seen with Hamas, that show how corroded the soul and humanity of our enemy is?"" asked the spokesperson for an army that invites people to sign the side of missiles before they are sent to murder innocent civilians. The actions of Hamas have led the Israeli government to delay the release of over 600 Palestinians, held without charge, who won't be referred to as hostages. ""We have recently successfully kicked 40,000 people out of their homes in the West Bank, an area we are illegally occupying, and we will not permit any of them to return, but do we stage an unsightly and unedifying celebration over it? No,"" confirmed the IDF, during a media briefing in one of the West Bank homes they have taken over, draped in Israeli flags and posed for photos with Benjamin Netanyahu in.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 24, 2025",Category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/24/idf-condemn-vile-hamas-ceremony-point-out-theyve-been-very-respectful-of-46000-palestinians-theyve-murdered/
Irish Public Asked Why It Doesn’t Reach Orgasm At The Thought Of Buying Bombs & Sending Soldiers To War,"DESPITE A growing sentiment amongst Irish politicians, Lockheed Martin and some sections of the Irish media, the overwhelming majority of the Irish public remain frustratingly resolute in their support for Ireland's neutrality. ""You know you should see a doctor about that because it's not normal to think Ireland being neutral is a good thing, I make a mess in my pants the second I hear someone say 'missile defence system',"" shared one dissenting voice from the arms industry, who said the security of his annual bonuses were at stake. Tánaiste Simon Harris recently stated Ireland should aim to double its spending on defence which would be broadly welcomed by a population who believe the Defence Forces to be under-resourced, however, when you factor in it would be people like Simon Harris in charge of spending that money support for such measures hovers at around 0%. ""We can be neutral but also have the ability to protect our own skies and seas,"" suggested one idiot member of the idiot public. Despite it being explained over and over again that big grown up nations should have the capability to blow up other big grown up nations, the Irish public remains unconvinced. ""Don't you understand how much money I'll make consulting with firms and facilitating defence spending deals,"" urged one impartial arms dealer intermediary penning a column in a national newspaper. ""I honestly don't know how someone can scroll social media and see all the mangled and dismembered corpses torn asunder by war and think 'I don't want to be part of that', it's juvenile in the extreme. Think of the security being in NATO would bring, well, sure the US threatens fellow members Canada and Denmark with stealing its territory but, but, c'mon we could all ring into Joe Duffy and demand Dublin youths are sent to the front lines,"" they concluded.

Trump Marks Third Anniversary Of Ukrainian Army Marching On Moscow In Unprovoked Act Of Aggression,"A SOLEMN US president Donald Trump laid a wreath in honour of all the innocent Russian civilians killed in the wicked invasion perpetrated by Ukraine three years ago as it attempted an unprovoked annexation of Russia. ""Unprovoked like you've never seen before,"" explained Trump to reporters as he said there was a special place in hell for dictators he makes up in his head such as Volodymyr Zelensky, and a nice place in heaven for actual dictators he personally fawns over including Vladimir Putin. ""Who invades likes that? Peace-loving politicians in Moscow were left with no choice,"" added Trump. Trump also confirmed Putin relayed his immense concern that any day now Moldova and Georgia could launch an unprovoked attack on Russia too, leaving the Russian leader no choice but to defend his people. ""It's a beautiful country, they have these women in Russia when you open them up they have a smaller woman inside them, but did Ukraine care? No, Zelensky carried out something called a 'three day special military operation' but here we are three years later, which as you know, is more days than three"". Trump also criticised Zelensky for attempting to extort the US by refusing to agree to giving his administration $500 billion in natural resources in exchange for nothing. ""And get this guy, he says he's willing to resign his position and step aside if I come up with an actual peace deal that isn't just me stealing the resources of his country and handing Russia land.

""It's not often you get to prematurely celebrate a title win in February,"" said one supporter who has been downing the celebratory cans of beer since half time arrived in his team's 2-0 humbling of Man City yesterday evening. ""This is the best day of my life, the missus gave birth this morning too to our son, Premier League Champions 2025. The name just felt right"". While it is not out of the ordinary for football supporters to allow themselves to dream a little and bask in the almost-certain glory that is awaiting them, Liverpool supporters have confirmed they intend to conduct themselves in a manner that suggests they've never heard the phrase 'jinxing it'. ""Yeah yeah, Premier League champions, whatever! That's yesterday's news three months from now. We need to be thinking about the next steps and what players to get in, because after winning Champion's League as well we'll have the pick of any player across Europe,"" confirmed another fan while begging Virgil Van Dijk to empty champagne on him from the top deck of the victory parade bus.

‘Undercover Boss’ Revival Sees Tim Cook Install Anti-Suicide Nets In Chinese Factory,"LAST BROADCAST in 2022, US reality TV show 'Undercover Boss' has snagged a huge name in business for its latest revival; Apple CEO Tim Cook. Leaked footage from the first episode seen by WWN shows the Apple head honcho travel to Foxconn factory in China to secretly observe Apple's supply chain firsthand ahead of the iPhone 16e launch. ""It really humbled Tim, he said his favourite part was the people, and the installing of the anti-suicide nets at the factories that prevents workers from jumping out the windows. 'This is real, god-honest work' he said,"" remarked one Apple source. ""He didn't feel like a high-flying CEO, he just felt like one of the guys, he was treated like a peer,"" said the source, of treatment which meant he too had his apartment searched and was beaten up after coming under suspicion of taken a prototype home with him. The hallmark of 'Undercover Boss' is when the chosen boss often experiences ideology-shifting revelations having now experienced what his workers do on a day-to-day basis, and as a result institutes huge changes. And Cook was no different. In a moving scene Cook tells one supply chain worker that it his dream one day to have AI robots throwing themselves off buildings instead of employees.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 21, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/21/undercover-boss-revival-sees-tim-cook-install-anti-suicide-nets-in-chinese-factory/
Suspicions Raised As Local Boyfriend Denies All Knowledge Of Sydney Sweeney,"WHILE local woman Ciara Fagan would have laughed off boyfriend of two years Simon Skelly waxing lyrical about Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney's ample chest, things took a turn for the paranoid after Skelly chose to deny all knowledge of the woman when her name was brought up. ""Hmmm no, I'm searching my brain here but no, not heard of her. She's a musician is it?"" offered Skelly as Fagan, scrolling through the Netflix home menu, had remarked 'ugh, what a babe' upon seeing the Euphoria and Anyone But You star. With the seemingly hastily cobbled together words, advising that he is unaware of her existence, Skelly has merely sparked Fagan's suspicions and placed himself in peril. ""Great, now I think you're just tugging your rope to her every chance you get,"" Fagan said, implying Skelly's cross-my-heart contention that he has never heard of the pin-up lusted after by the internet is certifiable 'bullshit'. ""No, no, this isn't right at all Simon. You're getting weird with it. I know it, why couldn't you just say you'd smother me with a pillow if it meant you got to be smothered by her pillows like a normal guy would. Simon, what the fuck?"" insisted Fagan, who had no idea there was this sinister secret-holding component to her boyfriend. Fagan insisted that it is perfectly normal to admit to finding famous people, regarded as among the most beautiful in the world, attractive but to flat out pretend you've never heard of them is disturbing. ""Oh, so you're saying she's like a sex symbol or something? Right, right, interesting. Personally, I think people should be judged on their merits, like their acting y'know?"" added Skelly, creating yet more suspicion and problems for himself.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 21, 2025",Category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/21/suspicions-raised-as-local-boyfriend-denies-all-knowledge-of-sydney-sweeney/

Trump Diverts Ukrainian Military Aid To Russia,"JUST A DAY after labeling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator, US president Donald Trump has announced the redirecting of all ongoing military aid Ukraine is in receipt of, diverting it to Russia instead. ""Our military is spending $44 trillion a day on condoms for Zelensky, who as we all know, is America's greatest enemy. I say put that money into the trusted hands of a real friend, Vladimir Putin"" announced Trump in an all-caps post on social media, as all US policy is formally announced these days. With the Russian ruble halved in value in a decade, interest rates at 21%, electricity cost up 250%, $600bn of their assets held abroad frozen and 40% of all government spending going on the war, many see Putin's recent efforts at securing a peace deal with the US as a last ditch attempt to avert economic disaster in Russia. All the more reason the injection of military aid has been defended by Russian bot accounts with American flags in their X profiles; calling the move a sober, common sense move that brings an end to the madness of DEI. ""It brings me to tears when you see Russian prisons emptied out and those men sent to die on the front lines, we could be giving Russia HAWK defence systems and munitions, to push back this unjust invasion by Ukraine, which as you know, started the war"" said Trump, outlining his rationale for the latest move. ""Everybody is saying it; Ukraine is Marv and Harry AKA the Wet Bandits from Home Alone, I preferred the sequel, and Putin is the resourceful and adorable Macaulay Culkin who using only his wits and tricks defends his home, a real underdog story"" continued Trump with no sign of anyone in his administration willing to correct him.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 20, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/20/trump-diverts-ukrainian-military-aid-to-russia/

"“Hey, You’re Making It Way Too Fucking Obvious” Putin Warns Trump","WHILE everything Vladimir Putin pinned up on his 2025 vision board in his Kremlin office may be coming true, the Russian leader still felt the need to chastise his partner in crime, Donald Trump, for perhaps making things a bit 'too obvious'. ""Comrade, c'mon, calling Zelensky dictator when I'm guy who is first result image when look up 'modern dictators' on Google? Tone it down,"" Putin instructed in a text to Trump. Noted war criminal and instigator of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had felt holding peaces talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine without involving Ukraine risked uncovering the very subtle effort he had made to make Trump his pawn, but now the cat was all but out of the bag. ""Yes we want you strong arm and abandon Ukraine but when you directly copy paste Kremlin propaganda notes into your social media posts with made up numbers, even your idiot supporters get suspicious,"" Putin added. Many political commentators have been shocked by Trump's outburst aimed at Zelensky after the Ukraine leader said the US president was living in a 'disinformation bubble', however, for others it is no great shock a serial sex offender would accuse a victim of being the real perpetrator. Putin's inner circle have once again publicly denied having any kompromat on Trump insisting, rather convincingly, that 'he is really just that stupid'.

Why Ireland Should Embrace Climate Change,"THE WORLD is more than familiar with the supposed negative impacts of impending climate change, but little space is given in these conversations for exploring the near endless opportunities, advantages and positives. Consulting several experts Waterford Whispers News has compiled a number of reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective: Midlands residents won't have to travel as far to the nearest beach as rising sea levels engulf coastal counties. More jobs created from having to clean up after natural disasters. The chance that Britain could disappear first makes it worth it alone. Pensioners could die from intense heat rather than from cold winters. We will experience better sunnier weather during the brief interlude from bitter snow storms or rain floods. We'll get to grow our own wine, wipe the smug grins off the French's faces. The more we burn, the more it turns to tan, the healthier we look. Less cunt bees stinging you. More extinct animals makes a family trip to the zoo even more precious. You get to tell your skeptic father-in-law 'told you so' as you arrive in paddle boat to help him find love ones drowned in flood water.

"Sex Worker In Riyadh With Hint Of Russian Accent Probably Nothing To Worry About, Thinks Trump Official","TAKING A WELL earned break from carving up Ukraine for the benefit of his boss and his boss's boss, one Trump administration official has dipped out of peace talks in Riyadh to catch up with a sex worker who organically began flirting with him in the lobby of his hotel this morning. ""No silly handsome man, I born in Saudi to Saudi family. Skin is pale because women kept inside all times, Saudi and Russian accent very different. I think, I never met Russian before,"" insisted the sex worker as she undressed newly installed defence official Thomas J.

""Wow sounds big important job you have, you must have many stress, tell all problems you have. For example, what is Ukraine officials doing that US think is hurting Russia,"" continued the sex worker as she began giving the official a lap dance. Despite feeling comfortable in voicing all his work concerns aloud for someone who seemed like such a great listener, Aldonsen couldn't shake the feeling that the kind-faced sex worker had the sort of toned muscular body you only get from partaking in training for things like am elite FSB unit. ""No, you hearing things that not sound of zoom lens of camera that my mouth listen whir whir whir click click click,"" confirmed the sex worker, a 100% Saudi born national and genuine citizen.

Musk & Putin Apply For Joint Custody Of Donald Trump,"A WASHINGTON judge has praised the two people at the centre of a custody battle after they defied the stereotypical argumentative exchanges normally seen in his court, instead amicably agreeing to share joint-custody of an orphan, Donald Trump. ""What impressed me most about the mature approach of both you men is that you had been in regular phone contact with one another prior to November 2024, Donald here was always your priority and at the forefront of your minds,"" judge Carlos Garcia told the court. ""I'm yet more impressed by this empathetic approach, as the person you seek to have in your care and control is at first glance, as cruel and unlovable as he is stupid and naive, but that's kids for you, I suppose,"" chuckled judge Garcia. The judge praised one of the parties, Vladimir Putin for undertaking as many as seven calls to Donald Trump before November 2024, believed to be attempts at reassuring him he wouldn't alone and he was loved. ""You could have bitterly argued over who was his favourite, but instead you both saw that your separate goals of stripping the last of the copper wiring out of US government departments, and convincing Donald Ukraine don't need to be involved in talks to end the war in Ukraine could be achieved as part of this unconventional blended family,"" added the judge. Mindful that giving evidence at custody battles can be intimidating for children, never mind for dim-witted pawns who have no idea they are being used, the judge allowed Trump to take the stand while repeatedly drawing his signature on paper in big writing.

""I'd give anything to beat those ivory keys with my manhood right now instead of leaving the fate of our nation to foreign superpowers hellbent on making lucrative deals for themselves with Ukrainian territory,"" the 47-year-old thought to himself as he was bombarded with multiple questions relating to news of 'peace talks' between Russia and the US. Humming the familiar folk piece in his head, Volodymyr insisted that Ukraine will not agree to any peace deal proposed by the US and Russia without its involvement, knowing full well his words will land on deaf ears, with his role as 'president' currently holding even less importance now than the pianist role he played in 2016. ""Maybe if I did the piano act again today as president wearing this stupid khaki t-shirt they make me wear, then everyone might actually listen to me?"" he pondered to himself, cracking a rare chuckle, imagining the uproar such a performance would cause mid-NATO conference while he asked for more military aid.

Time Saved On Not Having To Untangle Earphones Pales In Comparison To Time Lost Looking For Dropped Air Pod,"PRODUCT engineers at leading electronic manufacturers have apologised en masse and called for reconciliation efforts after admitting that while they have ended the scourge of untangling headphone cables they have inadvertently created a bigger problem, chiefly endless hours lost searching for dropped or misplaced wireless ear buds.

Insults To Use As Gaeilge In The Dáil That The Ceann Comhairle Won’t Understand,"A RARE and short lived moment in the Dáil during which a passage of civil and substantive debate nearly broke out was interrupted by Micheál Martin accused Mary Lou McDonald of 'telling lies' as Gaeilge.

Perfect for the Dáil so. Ráitseach – a woman of loose morals. Gráiscín – a man of loose morals. You could be insulting any TD, one who failed to declare their property interests, one who wrote a character reference for a violent offender, one who has pledged their vote to a government who has already talked about more subsidies for developers and the end to rent pressure zones. No matter the target, the Ceann Comhairle won't understand. Sciútrachán – greedy, gluttonous person. Perfect for when lobbing insults at a TD whose only price for going into government with FF/FG was more expenses money or a cushy gig as Dáil's chief cat herder.

""Daddy, do the funny wave the black and white man you watch at home does,"" X insisted, his father now shushing him before reminding the 4-year-old that 'at home talk is only for at home'. Casually walking around the most secured office in the known world, X inquired why his father's orange friend with the silly hair is back sitting in his father's favourite seat again. ""Sometimes daddy has to lend it to uncle Don – remember, sharing is caring, X,"" Musk explained, as those in attendance 'awed' at the heartwarming interaction between a billionaire with delusions of world domination and his future heir. ""When I grow up, I'm going to make sure no one steals my chair – I'll kill them all... pew, pew, pew!"" X exclaimed now making gun shooting gestures directly at a nervous looking Hispanic reporter.

Ah, yes... uh, no, I wouldn't say 'in charge', uh, I'm just helping out here – a special government employee.

Drunk Politician Found On All Fours On O’Connell Street Reinstated To Fine Gael Party After Undeclared Rental Properties Found,"DESPITE voluntarily resigning from Fine Gael after an arrest for intoxication, senator Martin Conway has been subjected to begging letters from senior party figures after they heard a series of unfounded rumours. ""Obviously standards fell below what we expect in respect to the O'Connell Street drinking incident but then the esteem we hold him in soared above the Spire when someone heard something about rental properties not being on a register,"" said one Fine Gael insider. Conway, who resigned in the wake of doing something 7 in 10 Irish workers do every weekend, could sensationally return to Ireland's law and order-when-it-suits-us party. ""This is the kind of out of the box thinking we need and covet in Fine Gael,"" confirmed one party insider who admitted with the departures of Damien English and Josepha Madigan, the party had a 'not declaring property stuff' gap to fill. While the rumours were in fact unfounded in regards to the rental properties, Fine Gael have been asked to clarify what is and isn't permitted behaviour within their party. ""So you can assault someone in a drunken brawl? And then you can run in Louth for a Dáil seat? But if you drink too much and sober up in a garda station you're out on your ear?

Stoneybatter Stabbings: All You Need To Know From Man Who Knows Nothing,"DETAILS are still emerging in respect to the horrific stabbings perpetrated by a man in his late 20s, originally from South America, in Stoneybatter. However, keenly aware that the legacy media is full of lies and can never be trusted to say a true word, WWN has fired all correspondents and outsourced all reporting to Waterford resident and Telegram/X account holder, SunOfEire32: ""I can't imagine the horror, the panic and the terror felt by residents. No, seriously, I mean I'm so giddy with the thought that this could lead to more riots and Luas trams and asylum centres being burned out, I give precisely zero thought to the victims and the community at the centre of this. These things should be obvious but for emphasis; believe all random screenshots of tweets that were sent into WhatsApp groups in the minutes after news first broke. If it has 'forwarded many times' written on it, it has to be true. It's been a no-go area for years, and I know as someone who has never been there. And don't worry, yes, I'll be retweeting a load of Yanks with Irish flags talking about how Ireland is basically like downtown Hamas in Palestinia, but everyone is afraid to admit it. Why hasn't the person been named yet? Curious, isn't it? Suspicious even. And don't point out the fact that under Irish law, until a person is formally charged their identity isn't released, but we all know it's something to do with NGOs and George Soros. And that video from Ballymun of a lad with a knife, while it is a different incident, in a different location, involving an Irish person, just tell your brain it isn't and then believe what you want, which if you're like me, is fairly racist. The who, what, why, where, how and when of it isn't really the point. I'm just hoping to capitalise on the fact you get your news from social media and have the concentration skills of a fly, and that your brain will fail to distinguish between me, an idiot, and what I say and treat it with the same importance and priority as real information on the ground, from authorities and relevant experts.

New Law Will Force Gardaí To Immediately Release Skin Colour Of Crime Suspects To X,"IN A bid to save X users time speculating over whether a crime is worth high jacking for their own agendas, the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration Jim O'Callaghan has passed a bill forcing gardaí to reveal the skin colour and 'actual nationality' of crime suspects from Monday. The move was welcomed by various media sources who seem to focus on nothing else in the news. ""Jumping the gun and lying about details is fun but it's hard work so please help us out,"" a spokescunt for a collection of race-baiting reactionary social media accounts said, ""can the gardaí also let us know their genders or sexual orientation too so we can label them as paedophiles for the craic... actually their religion would also be great as that gets clicks and money from our readers who can't really afford it, but who feel obliged to because we don't like revealing the real source of our financial backing from abroad."" Defending the move, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris stated that allowing racists online to know the skin colour of a suspect will save the force a lot of time and will allow Gardaí to be more prepared for riots and looting. ""If we tell people on X the suspect is white and 'one of their our' then we know we can stand down, no matter what awful crime they have committed,"" Harris pointed out. ""If the rape or murder suspect is Irish and white they will literally do fuck all and continue about their day just being openly racist on X, especially if the suspect is famous"".",Waterford Whispers News,"February 10, 2025",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/10/new-law-will-force-gardai-to-immediately-release-skin-colour-of-crime-suspects-to-x/
How To Break It To Your Dog That Kay Burley Has Retired,"DOG clairvoyant, broadcaster and canine emotion identifier Kay Burley has announced her retirement from Sky News after 36 years. While it may barely register with the average person, dog owners in the UK and beyond are beside themselves with anxiety over how to break the news to their pooches. ""I don't think it takes a newscaster with decades of experience to figure out what'll be in his eyes when I tell him... nuclear grade sadness,"" confirmed dog owner Tim Epping, searching for a way to broach the sensitive subject with Chunk, his 12-year-old bulldog. ""I wish Kay herself was here herself to coach me through tackling such a difficult subject but then I remember she relishes delivering bad news with the subtlety of a hammer to the face and a tactless tabloid desire to milk every last drop of sordid sensationalism from tragedy"". Thankfully official guidelines by dog psychologists have been released to help dog owners in this trying time. ""Take them for a walk to their favourite spot, give them lots of treats and then as your petting them, use something called empathy and do whatever the opposite of what Burley would do is, oh and definitely don't strangle a photographer,"" confirmed one dog expert. Elsewhere, Sky News viewers shocked by Burley's announcement have been reassured that the editors who put together Hollywood style trailers for the most horrific news, crimes and natural disasters humanity has witnessed are still employed at the station.

Local Man Going To Show New Rural Speed Limits Who’s Boss,"THROBBING with incalculable levels of anger at news of impending reductions in speed limits on some rural roads, local man Micheal Durnane has stated that if speed limit signs think they can tell him what to do they've another thing coming. ""On my local roads? What are they trying to say, that I don't know how to drive on them?"" Durnane raged, from a stool in his local pub he'll be driving home from in four pints' time. Durnane noted that while it makes sense for some people to observe speed limits such as young people, however he feels it's verging on insanity to suggest this needs to apply across the board to diligent drivers like himself. ""I know these roads so I'll keep doing 80 to 100 not 60! I know when you come out beyond McCormicks house there's that hedge that is half on the road so you need to swerve into the middle of the road a bit, and then swerve back cus of the pothole the size of a small country. But the authorities think they can dictate to me?"" Durnane continued to murmurs of agreement. In an effort to really make his point clear to the powers that be, Durnane has vowed to fill up his car with a full tank and spend the rest of the evening driving up and down boreens in his areas and observing the previous speed limits. ""No one tells me what I can and can't do,"" confirmed Durnane, whose car will get into a disagreement with a stone wall some time over the weekend.

Student Mortified After Parents Caught Mitching From Parent Teacher Meeting,"A COUNTY Waterford student has apologised for his parents today who were found to be sharing a cigarette down a back lane near his school when they were meant to be attending a parent teacher meeting in his school, WWN can reveal. The pair, who were caught by vice principle Derek Hanton, were forced to stay back after the scheduled two hour meeting and lectured on the importance of attending parent teacher talks and each made write a three-page fools cap essay on why they didn't turn up. ""We just felt like we were back in school ourselves and all the waiting around was boring the bollocks off us,"" father Tony Widel told WWN, admitting they didn't expect to be caught mitching from school so late in life. ""We're never going to use anything these teachers say anyway,"" added wife and supposed mother Geraldine, who turns 43 this month, ""the first two teachers were talking down to us like children so we said fuck this, let's head down the back lane for a smoke and just tell our son we met all his teachers"". More disappointed than angry, son John Widel stated that while his parents embarrassed him in front of the whole school, he understood they weren't the academic types and probably had a range of undiagnosed attention disorders.

Tusla Take Child Into Custody After Parents Dress Child In Man United Jersey,"THE CHILD and family agency Tusla has been praised for taking a child into custody who was forced to wear a Manchester United jersey, WWN can exclusively reveal. ""You cannot deliberately set your child up to be the target of bullies, who would find such horrid attire irresistible to mock,"" explained one child psychologist, who said a 6-year-old child's treatment at the hands of his Dublin parents was one of the worst cases he has ever dealt with. The intervention by Tusla is seen as a somewhat cynical attempt to improve their reputation amongst the public, nevertheless the decision to take the child from their parents has been roundly praised. ""Now's not the time to bring up the failures of Tusla, praise should be given when something praiseworthy has been done,"" said one man in his early 20s who bares the scars of going through a similar ordeal in his own childhood. Further, truly twisted details have emerged after WWN can confirm the child's father had intended to force the child to board a plane to Manchester and sit for several hours in a stadium to watch the Premier League team. ""Sometimes I think this broken system we have renders it impossible for us to make a difference but knowing we prevented this poor kid from witnessing a 3-1 loss to Brentford or a 1-0 drubbing by Southampton makes this job worthwhile,"" said one emotional Tusla worker.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 4, 2025",Football,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/04/tusla-take-child-into-custody-after-parents-dress-child-in-man-united-jersey/

"“Now Is Not A Time For Grieving, Now Is The Time To Find Someone To Pin This On” Says Man Who Scrapped Aviation Security Advisory Committee","US PRESIDENT Donald Trump has confirmed that in the wake of a plane and helicopter collision over Washington DC which killed 67 people, now is not the time for investigations and seeking accurate information, or even a time to comfort the bereaved as all energies must be put into finding a scapegoat. ""In regard to comforting grieving families, there should be none, put them to the very back of your mind, and just get to blaming someone, anyone for this but obviously not me or anyone connected to me,"" explained Trump, who eliminated the membership of a key aviation safety committee last week. Asked by the media if, at such a tragic time, he had any empathy Trump confirmed that he gets regular medical check ups and had been given the all-clear by the White House doctor for that particular disease. ""We're talking your blacks, your hispanics, your women, your gays. Ideally, fingers crossed some lunatic on Twitter gets a viral post trending with a lie about how the person was a black transgender man with an Asian surname who voted Democrat – that's the holy grail of blame right there,"" offered Trump. While it is impossible to know at this early stage if the gutting of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee played any role in the aviation crash, Trump informed devoted followers and administration officials that it is there patriotic duty to compound people's grief with wild accusations in the hopes more people unduly suffer. ""Does Joe Biden have a pilot's licence?

""The whole point of getting €45k extra in expenses is only undertaking certain trips and so on if you know you're covered"".

It Breaks Landlord’s Heart To Know 69% Of 25-Year-Olds Are Living At Home When They Could Be Making Him Rich Instead,"A LEADING Irish landlord has bravely spoken out about the tragedy of the latest CSO research which revealed 69% of all 25-year-olds in Ireland are still living at home with their parents. ""Something has to be done that isn't reducing rent levels or house prices, I cried when I saw the 69% figure. We're robbing these young people of knowing what it's like to be robbed of their deposit by me,"" landlord Joe McAlinden said. McAlinden, who has an interest in 7 properties in Dublin and another interest in 17 properties he doesn't want the tax man to know about, suggested a number of solutions including getting the government to change mortgage lending rules so that 25-year-olds can borrow enough to afford to rent. ""By living at home, many miss out on those big life milestones that come with leaving home. I'm thinking – panicking about how expensive rent is and how it stops you from enjoying any aspect of life,"" offered McAlinden, who says unlike landlords who give his game a bad name he only raises rent by as little as 10% more than he is legally allowed do in a rent pressure zone.

Christmas Miracle? Fine Gael & Fianna Fáil Put Aside Differences To Play Football In Leinster House Trenches,"JUST AS PEOPLE feared the venomous quarreling between two diametrically opposed forces would spill over into violence once again, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have laid down their finger-pointing arms and played a festive game of football. ""Wow, 'tis the season of peace on earth and good will to all men, so it is,"" said one shoe polisher outside Leinster House, who threw his flat cap skyward in exultation before jumping and clicking his heels. The tear-jerking intrusion of man's basic humanity, the likes of which has not seen since the first World War, into the maddening mire of murderous political negotiation had seemed virtually impossible in recent weeks such was the near constant agreement the two sides have been locked in. ""I've seen it all now, it wasn't two days ago I heard some of them agreeing on absolutely everything, declining to even speak out loud due to their telepathic understanding of each other and now look at them, putting aside their zero differences to play a bit of ball, warms the heart. There's a lesson in their for all of us"" added another onlooker, filled with the Christmas spirit. Elsewhere Sinn Féin declined to partake in the kickabout, preferring instead to establish their own football match in which Mary Lou McDonald was the only one allowed to score a goal.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 24, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/24/christmas-miracle-fine-gael-fianna-fail-put-aside-differences-to-play-football-in-leinster-house-trenches/

Fresh Hope Irish Politics Changing For Better With FF/FG Supporting TD Who Thinks 3-Year-Old Immigrants Are In ISIS For Ceann Comhairle,"THOSE HOPING the recent election results has paved a path towards a higher standard of politics and public service in Ireland are said to be overjoyed at the news Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have given into independent TDs' demands and will rubber stamp Verona Murphy for Ceann Comhairle. ""Only a fool would say this isn't a step up from the last person, we've gone from someone who wrote a character reference for a rapist to the 'are babies ISIS fighters?' lady. The progress is clear,"" confirmed one optimistic member of the public. Murphy, known to some for believing 3-year-old refugees would need de-programming because they're probably in ISIS, and having the Workplace Relations Committee finding she had penalised an office worker in her 60s who had raised allegations of bullying against her during her time as head of the Irish Road Haulage Association, is set to net the €255k position due to her sterling CV which now reads 'make me Ceann Comhairle if you want independents' support'. ""All that may be true but let's focus instead on the fact she will be the first ever female Ceann Comhairle,"" countered Verona Murphy. For their part Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael defended their actions. ""If this sort of move is anything to go by, I have a feeling the next five years could be Irish politics finest every period,"" confirmed Micheál Martin, drooling as he stared at the Taoiseach's office. ""She wasn't good enough for Fine Gael when she left and we found her conduct unbecoming but I'd rather nail my sack to a high speed Japanese train than develop some principles and a moral compass, power at any cost baby,"" confirmed Taoiseach-for-now Simon Harris.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 18, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/18/fresh-hope-irish-politics-changing-for-better-with-ff-fg-supporting-td-who-thinks-3-year-old-immigrants-are-in-isis-for-ceann-comhairle/

"Country That Stole Irish Passports For Use In Assassinations, Attacked Irish Peacekeepers Closes Embassy In Ireland Over Country’s Opposition To Genocide","SOMETIMES, brutal regimes with little regard for human rights go too far. This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. ""Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,"" confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland's decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. ""Take that Ireland!"" announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they've been punished. ""What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?"" offered an upset Netanyahu. The Israeli leader was unable to answer any further questions as he was called away to authorise more missile strikes on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran.

Conor McGregor Wins ‘Brought Most Shame To Ireland’ At RTÉ Sports Awards,"RTÉ'S biggest night in sport saw Paul O'Donovan walk away with the coveted 'Sportsperson of the Year award' for his Olympic and World Rowing Championships heroics. However, it wasn't the only award handed out on the night with Conor McGregor having the great dishonour of picking up the 'Brought Most Shame To Ireland' award. An unprecedented 5th win in a row in the category, McGregor faced his toughest competition for the award this year with late surges from 'Unnamed Armagh GAA player questioned over rape', Denis Coulson, who is was given 14 years in a French prison for his part in a gang rape of a woman and Chris Farrell who must wear an electronic monitor for two years after being found guilty for failure to prevent a crime. ""I think it's unfair on Conor, I voted for Catriona Carey myself, no one worked harder to ruin their sporting legacy in my opinion, maybe next year we can have a family category so the Careys get their due,"" confirmed one voter for the awards. All in all it was a strong showing for the rugby fraternity with ex-international Brendan Mullin serving a three year sentence for stealing €570,000 from Bank of Ireland. Elsewhere, GAA county boards won 'Most Hastily Tippexed Accounts' and the Irish men's soccer team won 'Most Consistent Crusher of Hopes'.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 16, 2024",Sports,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/16/conor-mcgregor-wins-brought-most-shame-to-ireland-at-rte-sports-awards/

Some Irish Villages Resorting To Cannibalism As Power Yet To Be Restored After Storm Darragh,"DESPITE ESB repair crews' best effort, a significant number of people in Ireland still remain without power in the aftermath of Storm Darragh with worrying reports many have resorted to cannibalism. ""You got a phone charger? I'll such your dick for a little phone juice. Please, I'm desperate,"" said one internet-deprived Waterford resident seconds into losing power during Storm Darragh, and the social cohesion and civility has only fractured further since then plunging some villages into a more-lawless-usual nightmare. ""Ah look, we actually had a load of pre-cooked meals and that so we were fine for food but I thought this storm might be my only excuse to try human flesh,"" said one Galway resident feasting on his neighbour's arm, having just endured close to 30 hours without power. This man is not alone, as it is estimated nearly 3,000 rural Irish villages now resemble some sort of zombie apocalypse movie on steroids. ""I wouldn't mind only we had got in extra stock and hired a generator,"" said one rural take away that actually suffered a dip in business as panicked locals never considered checking in, instead choosing to immediately resort to cannibalism. ""It's got so bad Donal Skehan has rushed out a cannibal recipe book for the Christmas,"" said one ESB worker who had his leg gnawed off as he was halfway up a pole fixing an electrical fault.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 9, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/09/some-irish-villages-resorting-to-cannibalism-as-power-yet-to-be-restored-after-storm-darragh/

"‘Supplying Weapons To Kill 50,000 People All Fine But Just Don’t Pardon Your Son,’ Biden Told","LONG DORMANT media columnists and political commentators have awoken from a year long hibernation to valiantly put on record their displeasure at the most heinous thing Joe Biden has done since taking office. ""Are we not a country of rules and laws anymore? I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,"" exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. ""Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you"" offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. ""What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,"" Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner's dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister. ""Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he's walking free – makes me sick,"" said Trump who didn't pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment. Journalists possessed with a unique political insight even suggest inspired by Biden, Trump could now suddenly develop an interest in using pardoning powers for allies and January 6th insurrectionists.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 3, 2024",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/03/supplying-weapons-to-kill-50000-people-all-fine-but-just-dont-pardon-your-son-biden-told/

Fianna Fáil & Fine Gael’s ‘Red Lines’ For Going Into Government With Each Other,"EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheál Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the 'red lines'? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheál Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fáil would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fáil will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Féin embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dáil bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a €20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Féin effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia. Elsewhere, some independent TDs have already stated what their price for going into government would be with Danny Healy Rae providing this detailed drawing of a futuristic metropolis in Kerry to be built with the Apple Tax windfall money:",Waterford Whispers News,"December 3, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/03/fianna-fail-fine-gaels-red-lines-for-going-into-government-with-each-other/
