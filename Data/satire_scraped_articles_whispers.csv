Local Man Breathlessly Warning Against Trump No Idea What’s Going On In Irish Politics,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man who hasn't paused to take a breath in the last 48 hours during impassioned rants about US president Donald Trump has little to no knowledge of all or any political goings on in Ireland, WWN can reveal. It will come as a surprise to 26-year-old Sean O'Neill that Ireland elects a new Taoiseach today when his US-heavy social media feeds are briefly interrupted with political news from Ireland. Devouring and disseminating every nugget of information emanating from the US, O'Neill has dominated pub conversations and work lunches with lengthy lectures. ""He interrupted me when I was saying how hard it is to get my autistic child supports in school by telling me all about the Trump crypto rug-pull and how something needs to be done,"" said one growing-impatient friend of O'Neill. Such is O'Neill's fixation on the goings on in America, he is knowledgeable on a number of legal challenges to Trump executive orders making their way through US courts but can't name his constituency's TDs. ""I'm slowly trying to make him aware he lives in Ireland. I tell him things like 'did you know Trump failed to enact 49 recommendations to improve electoral law' and when he begins his rant about why that's a disgrace I tell him 'actually that's something the government in Ireland did',"" explained O'Neill's girlfriend Sam Duane. ""Then there was 'Trump did a deal with a convicted criminal to get into power' but I told him it's Micheal Martin and Michael Lowry. He didn't like that bait and switch at all at all but you just have to hope some of it subconsciously seeps into his brain until one day he expends energy on politics here and how it effects us day to day,"" added Duane. It is believed O'Neill isn't alone in finding Irish politics, filled with headlines such as 'former Fine Gael politician arrested over human trafficking', 'Ex Sinn Fein leader ordered killing of mother of 10', 'Government refuses to pay back EUR12bn it robbed from people in nursing homes' and 'Private businesses enriched by State paying them billions to house refugees', rather boring and unimportant.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 22, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/22/local-man-breathlessly-warning-against-trump-no-idea-whats-going-on-in-irish-politics/
Local Man Retires From All Forms Of Exercise Aged 38,"A COUNTY Waterford father-of-three has officially retired from all forms of exercise at the age of 38, claiming anyone can do it too if they just set their mind to it. Wowing friends and family members with the announcement, Liam Power said he looks forward to not ever worrying about having to exert himself again stating the sense of relief has done him wonders. ""I'm like a new man,"" Power told WWN, lounging gracefully on his couch like an 19th French aristocrat waiting to have their portrait painted. ""The decision itself was surprisingly an easy one; do burpees for 15 mins or sit on my hole watching old episodes of Mask while tucking into my second double Starbar?"" Such was his success in accomplishing an early exercise retirement, Power has since launched a self-help program for middle-aged men who wish to follow in his lack of footsteps. ""You might think it's an easy thing to do, but huge sacrifices have to be made in order to achieve your goals,"" he elaborated, revealing his wife of 15 years wasn't able to 'keep up with his new found lifestyle', ""obviously some people don't like change, emptying the bins, driving the kids around everywhere, grocery shopping, cleaning the house, dressing their husband every morning... and that's all well and good, but don't blame me if I want to better myself,"" adding, ""it's not my fault that I've outgrown everyone around me - they just need to catch up!""",Waterford Whispers News,"January 24, 2025",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/24/local-man-retires-from-all-forms-of-exercise-aged-38/
"500,000 Liverpudlians Line Streets For Premier League Trophy Parade","TRAFFIC RESTRICTIONS remain in place across Liverpool city centre today as the Liverpool FC Premier League trophy parade takes place with as many as 500,000 of the club's supporters expected to line the streets. ""It's not often you get to prematurely celebrate a title win in February,"" said one supporter who has been downing the celebratory cans of beer since half time arrived in his team's 2-0 humbling of Man City yesterday evening. ""This is the best day of my life, the missus gave birth this morning too to our son, Premier League Champions 2025. The name just felt right"". While it is not out of the ordinary for football supporters to allow themselves to dream a little and bask in the almost-certain glory that is awaiting them, Liverpool supporters have confirmed they intend to conduct themselves in a manner that suggests they've never heard the phrase 'jinxing it'. ""Yeah yeah, Premier League champions, whatever! That's yesterday's news three months from now. We need to be thinking about the next steps and what players to get in, because after winning Champion's League as well we'll have the pick of any player across Europe,"" confirmed another fan while begging Virgil Van Dijk to empty champagne on him from the top deck of the victory parade bus. ""What's great about winning the Premier League yesterday is that we can just play the youth team for a lot of the games, give the big players a rest while allowing Darwin Nunez an extended run up front to score a few, get his confidence up,"" said Liverpool's most delusional fan at the parade today.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 24, 2025",Category not found,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/24/500000-liverpudlians-line-streets-for-premier-league-trophy-parade/

Man Greets ‘Suitable For 8 People’ Label On Food Like A Challenge,"A LOCAL WATERFORD man has admitted for the first that for much of his life he has treated the guidelines listed by producers of food as a challenge, and has successfully beaten the 'pathetic' gauntlets they have clearly laid down for him. ""'Serves eight'? Never heard such nonsense in my life,"" confirmed Niall Tulley, collecting the flakey crumbs on his chest, the only remnants of his 16 pack of sausage rolls. ""It's the arrogance that gets me to be honest, 'suggested serving size - one slice', you don't think I can do it? Eat the whole cake? I'll show you,"" added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a 'call out' and a 'questioning of my stomach storage facilities', Tulley's nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. ""You can't put 'serves 8' on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,"" explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. ""Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor"". Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include 'listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you've nothing to prove' and 'but won't you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?'",Waterford Whispers News,"December 12, 2024",LIFESTYLE,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/12/man-greets-suitable-for-8-people-label-on-food-like-a-challenge/
Hayes Sickened He Didn’t Hold Out As Stock He Dumped Soars,"NEWLY SUSPENDED newly elected Social Democrats Eoin Hayes has voiced his regret after shares in software company Palantir have almost tripled in the six months since he sold them. Offloading his stake for just EUR200k in July, Hayes' shares would be now worth nearly EUR600k, which works out at a full terms salary in the Dail or the cost of an 'affordable home' in Dublin. ""He's absolutely bulling,"" a source close to Hayes described his mood as he was forced on moral grounds to dump his stake in the US company which provides artificial-intelligence products and services to Israel for use in occupied Palestinian territories. The newly elected Dublin Bay South TD has been suspended from the Social Democrats' parliamentary party with immediate effect for giving incorrect information, originally stating he sold the shares before he was elected to politics, but was actually after the fact. ""In fairness to Eoin he's showing some real promise as an Irish politician and shouldn't be put off that he was booted out of the Social Dems for lying, he'd get a promotion in Fianna Fail or Fine Gael for the same thing,"" pointed out another source.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 11, 2024",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/11/hayes-sickened-he-didnt-hold-out-as-stocks-he-dumped-soars/
Colin Farrell Asks If Three Golden Globes Are Redeemable For One Oscar,"EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. ""Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?"" Farrell asked over the phone, the audience's applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. ""There's no way Meryl hasn't exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don't be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn't exactly a stretch for me, just saying,"" one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. ""Enough time has passed, it's okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in 'Milk'? Over me in 'In Bruges', give over,"" continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell's angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. ""Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I'm guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?"" one industry insider offered.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 6, 2025",ENTERTAINMENT,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/06/colin-farrell-asks-if-three-golden-globes-are-redeemable-for-one-oscar/
“I’m Too Old And Rich To Be Righteous Anymore” – Bono,"IRISH singer-songwriter and former activist Bono clasped his hands and prayed to whatever God he worships these days while receiving the US Presidential Medal of Freedom from outgoing president and Zionist Joe Biden, admitting that yes, he's too old and rich to be righteous anymore. Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their 'meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace'. ""Look, we'll forget about that last part there and just say it's for the first two,"" Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. ""We'll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we're finished. The seaside property there is to die for"". Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. ""There comes a time in an activists' life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,"" Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. ""I know people back home will not be happy, but they're just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh"".

Nation’s Traffic At Standstill As Post-Christmas Re-turn Machine Queues Clog Roads,"TAILBACKS of 10 miles have been reported in some areas in Ireland today as people attempt to dispense with their post-Christmas cans of beer, in the first Christmas since the Re-turn recycling scheme was introduced. ""Authorities should have seen this coming, we should have quadrupled the number of machines,"" said one man from his car which he has been trapped in for 17 hours just outside the car park to his local Lidl such is the traffic. With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren't out of order, the country's main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey.

The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. ""I'm missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTE,"" said one driver, unaware the car they've been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago.

“This Will Go Towards Our House Deposit” Thinks Couple Who Won €500 In Online Competition That Will Flag Them As Gamblers,"A TEAM of mortgage underwriters have reportedly had a good chuckle today after seeing statements from recent competition winners Deirdre and Kevin Power showing a recurring charge for a local competition website, WWN reports.

Student Mortified After Parents Caught Mitching From Parent Teacher Meeting,"A COUNTY Waterford student has apologised for his parents today who were found to be sharing a cigarette down a back lane near his school when they were meant to be attending a parent teacher meeting in his school, WWN can reveal. The pair, who were caught by vice principle Derek Hanton, were forced to stay back after the scheduled two hour meeting and lectured on the importance of attending parent teacher talks and each made write a three-page fools cap essay on why they didn't turn up.

More disappointed than angry, son John Widel stated that while his parents embarrassed him in front of the whole school, he understood they weren't the academic types and probably had a range of undiagnosed attention disorders.

‘Cultural Appropriation’: Samoan Tribesman Criticised For Getting Irish Harp Tattoo,"INSENSITIVE, IGNORANT or at best a little misguided, or so say Irish people who have finally had enough of Samoan, Maori and Polynesian people getting an Irish harp tattoo like it's a fad rather than a sacred emblem belonging to a proud and unique culture. ""It's cringe and if you take even a teeny step back you can see why having a great big shamrock or harp on your arm is ridiculous,"" begged one Irish person seeking an end to the misappropriation of her culture after online newspapers reported on a Samoan being on the receiving end of criticism for getting an Irish tattoo. While some argue it is merely a harmless exchange of cultures and a compliment, the scourge of harps tattoos emblazoned on the arms of people who have zero ancestral links to Ireland continues to infuriate those protective of our sanctified heritage. ""Cunts never even been to Ireland, couldn't find it on a map. Show me one Irish lad walking around with a tribal tattoo from their neck of the woods, you can't,"" said one Irish person catching sight of a harp tattoo on a Polynesian man in New Zealand on TikTok. ""This isn't some tattoo Irish people get on a whim either, these people might not realise it but they're mocking people like my dad who got his harp tattoo after 16 pints as a healing ritual after Ireland got knocked out of the 2012 Euros without earning a single point,"" offered another hurt Irish person.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 19, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/19/cultural-appropriation-samoan-tribesman-criticised-for-getting-irish-harp-tattoo/

Remote Workers Wouldn’t Have Agreed To Work From Home If They Knew It Meant Zero Snow Days Off,"""I FEEL TRICKED"" confirmed Carmel Foley, one of hundreds of thousands of workers granted the ability to work from home several days a week in recent years, as she stared mournfully out at heavy snow she couldn't use as an excuse for a handy day off. ""You can't begin to understand how sneaky and satisfying it felt back with the big snow in 2018 when I told the office the roads to the were impassable due to snow. Back then I didn't have a home work set up,"" added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement.

4-Year-Old Pours Glass Of Ribena After Another Exhausting Day,"""I'M THAT up to my eyes with the stress, I'll have it neat,"" stone-faced 4-year-old Jack McKinty barked at his Mam, Una McKinty, after what must rank as the most stressful day in little Jack's life thus far. A particularly taxing bout of chasing during little break, coupled with exhaustive number rhymes and an argument over what the best dinosaur is, McKinty entered the second half of his day more tired than usual, with his desire to 'put today to bed' manifesting itself in a 6pm request for an unprecedented second glass of Ribena. ""My friends don't understanded me, hide and seek is better than just chasing.

Revenue Raise Concerns As Some GAA County Board Accounts Written In Marker On Hurl Grip Tape,"WITH MAYO and Galway GAA not in a position to sign off on their accounts and seeking GAA HQ intervention as Revenue belatedly discovered the organisation's existence, it has been claimed that some county boards' monitoring of accounts was limited to scribbling expense claims down on discarded hurl grip tape. ""They may be an amateur organisation but we're one step shy of doing calculations using an abacus made of character references,"" confirmed one tax expert. ""Ah, accounting is like GAA rule changes, a complete pain in the hole and if you kick up enough of a fuss they just change them back again in the end,"" confirmed one county board member who is pretty sure mileage, payments and holidays worth thousands in payments aren't the tax man's business and the only receipt he's kept is a nod and a wink. ""GAA (Gaelic Accounting Adjustments) is a complex financial system that Revenue officials simply don't understand but it's straightforward, if one of the senior team lads receives a car from a sponsor gratis, you jot down 'nutritional allowance' and that's the end of it,"" explained one county board official. Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating 'but we're the GAA' didn't immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids' play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received EUR40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles.

Musk & Putin Apply For Joint Custody Of Donald Trump,"A WASHINGTON judge has praised the two people at the centre of a custody battle after they defied the stereotypical argumentative exchanges normally seen in his court, instead amicably agreeing to share joint-custody of an orphan, Donald Trump. ""What impressed me most about the mature approach of both you men is that you had been in regular phone contact with one another prior to November 2024, Donald here was always your priority and at the forefront of your minds,"" judge Carlos Garcia told the court. ""I'm yet more impressed by this empathetic approach, as the person you seek to have in your care and control is at first glance, as cruel and unlovable as he is stupid and naive, but that's kids for you, I suppose,"" chuckled judge Garcia. The judge praised one of the parties, Vladimir Putin for undertaking as many as seven calls to Donald Trump before November 2024, believed to be attempts at reassuring him he wouldn't alone and he was loved. ""You could have bitterly argued over who was his favourite, but instead you both saw that your separate goals of stripping the last of the copper wiring out of US government departments, and convincing Donald Ukraine don't need to be involved in talks to end the war in Ukraine could be achieved as part of this unconventional blended family,"" added the judge. Mindful that giving evidence at custody battles can be intimidating for children, never mind for dim-witted pawns who have no idea they are being used, the judge allowed Trump to take the stand while repeatedly drawing his signature on paper in big writing.

In the wake of Hamas's macabre ceremony those advocating for a permanent end to the killing of Palestinian civilians reportedly feel 'pretty silly' in thinking the IDF is also wrong in committing an endless parade of war crimes. ""Of the over 46,000 Palestinians we've killed, can you recall any celebrations? Or any sordid visual metaphors like we've seen with Hamas, that show how corroded the soul and humanity of our enemy is?"" asked the spokesperson for an army that invites people to sign the side of missiles before they are sent to murder innocent civilians. The actions of Hamas have led the Israeli government to delay the release of over 600 Palestinians, held without charge, who won't be referred to as hostages. ""We have recently successfully kicked 40,000 people out of their homes in the West Bank, an area we are illegally occupying, and we will not permit any of them to return, but do we stage an unsightly and unedifying celebration over it?

""Yeah, what public transport?"" scoffed Terence McEntire, who read the headline out loud to his wife for effect. ""Did you hear that Jane? There's going to be no public transport tomorrow?"" McEntire bellowed as his wife chimed in. ""But sure we don't have any public transport in Donegal anyway!"" Jane McEntire replied in jest, unaware her husband's comment was also delivered in a wry tone. ""I know, right? That's what I just said - it's not going to make much of a difference in Donegal as we've no transport here at all at all!"" Terence repeated, the joke now becoming less and less funny as the realisation that Donegal exists in public service purgatory where all infrastructure and amenities remain in limbo, forever clinging to the dream that the State might actually pay it attention in the event of a United Ireland leading genuine regional development.

Insults To Use As Gaeilge In The Dáil That The Ceann Comhairle Won’t Understand,"A RARE and short lived moment in the Dail during which a passage of civil and substantive debate nearly broke out was interrupted by Micheal Martin accused Mary Lou McDonald of 'telling lies' as Gaeilge. This most unparliamentary language, seen as a beyond-the-pale insult, prompted many to suggest it is at times like these having a Ceann Comhairle who actually spoke Irish could have come in handy. Go dtuitfeadh an tigh ort - that your house may fall on you. A completely useless insult outside of the Dail as over 65% of 25 year olds are still living at home and have no hope of ever owning a home. The insult wouldn't hurt them at all but in the Dail? Chances are whoever you lob the insult at has between 1 and 13 gaffs. Go marbhai an diabhal tu - that the devil may kill you. Before the Ceann Comhairle has opened her Duo Lingo app or reached for a dictionary, you have delivered the sort of horrible mean-spirited insult that adds nothing to a debate, nor proffers any solution to ongoing crises. Perfect for the Dail so. Raitseach - a woman of loose morals. Graiscin - a man of loose morals. You could be insulting any TD, one who failed to declare their property interests, one who wrote a character reference for a violent offender, one who has pledged their vote to a government who has already talked about more subsidies for developers and the end to rent pressure zones. No matter the target, the Ceann Comhairle won't understand. Sciutrachan - greedy, gluttonous person. Perfect for when lobbing insults at a TD whose only price for going into government with FF/FG was more expenses money or a cushy gig as Dail's chief cat herder. Transna ort fhein - go sideways on yourself AKA go fuck yourself. A sneaky variation of the 'Deputy Stagg' variety. Snaidhm bunduin ort - may your arse be knotted.

‘Super Low Key’ Girls Xmas Meet Up Somehow Costs €427,"AN ANNUAL Xmas get together over a 'super low key' lunch among a group of friends is dangerously spiralling into a 'massive ball ache' thanks to the pricey organising habits and notions addiction of one Marie McGrath (32).

“Calm Down Sugar Tits”: Gregg Wallace’s Guide To Crafting The Perfect Apology,"SO YOU'VE found yourself in a spot of bother and now some middle class women of a certain age who can't take a joke/groping are giving out to HR. You might be fearing the worst; job gone, career over, but relax one of the world's leading apology experts, Gregg Wallace, is on hand to dispense his priceless advice that'll get everyone back on your side: Step 1) Deescalate - there's been a clear misunderstanding of harmless banter. ""Calm down sugar tits"". Fire any and all publicists working for you, you've got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners. If anything you'll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn't even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. ""You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I'd love motor boat clearly aren't getting any at home which is why you can't even take a compliment"". Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn't the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. ""Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I'll need to pretend I'm a devout Christian now too"". Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife's vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn't an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You're going to want to mention the word 'woke' a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I'm A Celebrity to see if they'll book you on the first flight to the jungle.

Person At Top Of Shop Queue Taken Completely By Surprise By Request To Pay For Goods,"A MAN AT the top of a lengthy shopping queue has been taken by surprise at a request for payment, WWN can exclusively reveal. Initially local man Tom Shannon struggled to comprehend the words, straining and asking the supermarket retail assistant to repeat what they said before engaging in what looked like the long forgotten elaborate tribal dance of his people, patting down every pocket his clothing had several times.

""What's this prick at,"" confirmed the eleven people behind Shannon in queue in unison. Wasting the sort of time George RR Martin could've finished writing his Game of Thrones series in, Shannon fumbled, rummaged and pulled at his jacket and jean pockets before producing his phone which he intended on paying with. ""There we are now,"" said Shannon before failing to open his phone using face-ID technology, forcing him to resort to incorrectly inputting his phone pin which led him to revert to using his debit card. Doing so with the sort of nonchalance that brings out a unique and potent level of animosity in fellow shoppers, Shannon then repeatedly tapped a coffee loyalty card on the card machine.

Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,"" groused employee Cormac D'Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. ""My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road.

For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. ""This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I'm saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,"" McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through.

Government Minister Will Visit Places Without Power Once It’s Confirmed Their Mileage Is Covered By New Travel Expenses,"SEVERAL GOVERNMENT ministers have confirmed they will attend scenes of ongoing power outages and water shortages as soon as they can get clarification from someone in Leinster House that their expenses will cover their car mileage. ""It's a very troubling time, and there's a lack of information out there; can I claim for a broader array of expenses as a junior minister compared to what I claimed as a regular TD,"" offered one new minister off the record. ""The whole point of getting EUR45k extra in expenses is only undertaking certain trips and so on if you know you're covered"". Other ministers stressed that with the Dail not sitting for two weeks, visiting places still struggling with the after effects of Storm Eowyn counted as 'time off'. ""I think visiting those god-forsaken places is, eh, well that's more for my colleague, the Junior Minister for Natural Disaster Response. Not sure what I, as Junior Minister for Response to Natural Disasters could do, also I hate meeting members of the public, especially angry ones,"" offered another minister.

With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers.

Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. ""But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,"" Stewart's husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn't entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour's long lecture on honesty and ethics.

It Breaks Landlord’s Heart To Know 69% Of 25-Year-Olds Are Living At Home When They Could Be Making Him Rich Instead,"A LEADING Irish landlord has bravely spoken out about the tragedy of the latest CSO research which revealed 69% of all 25-year-olds in Ireland are still living at home with their parents. ""Something has to be done that isn't reducing rent levels or house prices, I cried when I saw the 69% figure. We're robbing these young people of knowing what it's like to be robbed of their deposit by me,"" landlord Joe McAlinden said. McAlinden, who has an interest in 7 properties in Dublin and another interest in 17 properties he doesn't want the tax man to know about, suggested a number of solutions including getting the government to change mortgage lending rules so that 25-year-olds can borrow enough to afford to rent. ""By living at home, many miss out on those big life milestones that come with leaving home. I'm thinking - panicking about how expensive rent is and how it stops you from enjoying any aspect of life,"" offered McAlinden, who says unlike landlords who give his game a bad name he only raises rent by as little as 10% more than he is legally allowed do in a rent pressure zone. When pressed on the fact 1-in-8 25-year-olds contacted by the CSO for their research had chosen to emigrate, McAlinden was less bothered, citing the fact he has a share in a number of Dubai rentals.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 29, 2025",BUSINESS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/29/it-breaks-landlords-heart-to-know-69-of-25-year-olds-are-living-at-home-when-they-could-be-making-him-rich-instead/
Irish Public Asked Why It Doesn’t Reach Orgasm At The Thought Of Buying Bombs & Sending Soldiers To War,"DESPITE A growing sentiment amongst Irish politicians, Lockheed Martin and some sections of the Irish media, the overwhelming majority of the Irish public remain frustratingly resolute in their support for Ireland's neutrality. ""You know you should see a doctor about that because it's not normal to think Ireland being neutral is a good thing, I make a mess in my pants the second I hear someone say 'missile defence system',"" shared one dissenting voice from the arms industry, who said the security of his annual bonuses were at stake. Tanaiste Simon Harris recently stated Ireland should aim to double its spending on defence which would be broadly welcomed by a population who believe the Defence Forces to be under-resourced, however, when you factor in it would be people like Simon Harris in charge of spending that money support for such measures hovers at around 0%. ""We can be neutral but also have the ability to protect our own skies and seas,"" suggested one idiot member of the idiot public. Despite it being explained over and over again that big grown up nations should have the capability to blow up other big grown up nations, the Irish public remains unconvinced. ""Don't you understand how much money I'll make consulting with firms and facilitating defence spending deals,"" urged one impartial arms dealer intermediary penning a column in a national newspaper. ""I honestly don't know how someone can scroll social media and see all the mangled and dismembered corpses torn asunder by war and think 'I don't want to be part of that', it's juvenile in the extreme.

IDF Sniper Trained On Survivors At Auschwitz Remembrance In Case They Attempt To Draw Parallels,"TO AVOID the unedifying spectacle of one of the few remaining living survivors of the Holocaust making remarks that incorrectly draw parallels between the Holocaust and any current ongoing situation, the IDF have stationed a number of snipers at the 80th anniversary commemorations marking the liberation of Auschwitz. ""We could think of no greater insult to the survivors of the holocaust,"" explained an IDF spokesperson, ""than the potentially lurid spectacle of a survivor suggesting people must learn from the horror of the Holocaust while invoking the name of a contemporary flashpoint, not that one springs to mind"". It has been suggested the prospect of such a commemoration, held to ensure the world never forgets and never lets something like this happen again, being sullied by someone imploring the world not to let something like this happen again is unthinkable and must be avoided. ""What they would be drawing parallels exactly? We cannot say. What specific modern nightmare could they possibly point to? We do not know, but nevertheless it would be unwise to suggest that in 2025 the mass murder and systemic and brutal treatment of people is wrong,"" added the IDF spokesperson from a rooftop adjacent to Auschwitz.

"Country That Stole Irish Passports For Use In Assassinations, Attacked Irish Peacekeepers Closes Embassy In Ireland Over Country’s Opposition To Genocide","SOMETIMES, brutal regimes with little regard for human rights go too far. This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. ""Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,"" confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland's decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. ""Take that Ireland!"" announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they've been punished. ""What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?"" offered an upset Netanyahu.

Rare Good News: 80% Of Germans Not Fascists,"INITIAL EXIT polls from German media indicate only 1 in 5 German voters think a Fourth Reich is a really good idea, WWN understands. The far-right AfD, a party so extreme they even give France's Marine le Pen the ick, surged in the federal election polls but only garnered 20% of first preference votes meaning it is likely CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader Friedrich Merz will be the next chancellor if he can form a coalition in part with Olaf Scholz's SPD party. ""What a minor glimmer of positivity in this shit-infested world that is hellbent on eating itself,"" reacted many to the relatively good news emanating from Germany that a party supported by Elon Musk and which considers Hitler to have been a 'communist' has only doubled it's vote. It is not clear when AfD leader Alice Weidel will allege immigrant criminals with multiple identities illegally voted for the CDU/CSU, but it is expected sooner rather than later and will be warmly received by those who respond to the AfD's 'not everyone in the SS was a criminal' messaging. ""We couldn't have done this without Trump surrendering to Putin, thank you so much for scaring the shit out of voters,"" confirmed Merz in his victory speech.

“First 100 Violations Of Ceasefire Are Free” US Tells Israel As IDF Continues To Strike Lebanon,"DESPITE UNIFIL forces observing at least 100 instances of Israeli forces breaching the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the US administration between the IDF and Hezbollah, it has emerged that the deal had some hidden clauses applying solely to Israel. ""Well, as a valued and repeat customer for US arms, Israel actually signed up to our premium package which mean the first 100 violations of ceasefires are free,"" spokesperson for the US Department of State, Matthew Miller, said. Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear.

Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. ""It's not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,"" outlined Miller.

New Champion’s League Format SLAMMED For Including Low Quality Minnows Like Man City,"UEFA has been on the receiving end of fans ire after the knockout playoff round of the new and expanded Champion's League format featured a number of foregone conclusions such as Real Madrid's routine 6-3 agg victory over Manchester City. ""Why are they letting these random teams who can't compete in the competition? It devalues the Champion's League,"" said one fan on social media. The revamped format was billed as creating more high stakes fixtures, however fans have cited the existence of such an obvious 'dead rubber' as proof the new format is dead on arrival. ""We were promised more exciting games but the likes of Brest and this Manleicester City getting thumped, it's not worth watching until the semis,"" confirmed another football fan.

""Great, another stats-padding game for Mbappe but playing against inferior opposition with a defence made of cardboard doesn't make you the goat.

""Look it's nice they got that consolation goal, their fans will never forget it, they'll make flags with the goal on it.

"Is Parenting A Private Matter Or Jesus, Jane Has No Control Over Her Little Tearaways At All At All?","'THERE BUT for the grace of God go I'. A mantra that serves so many well who have the foresight to accept their own parenting journey has been filled with trying days when despite their best efforts they fell well short of their own standards. Raising a family is not easy, all parents know this and would hate for someone to judge them on their worst day in the job. So, baring all this in mind, local residents in Tramore have come together to intensely malign Jane McHacklin's 'parenting', if that's what you could call it. ""They're always swinging out of her, and the eldest fella is already off the rails.

""I wouldn't mind but her own parents were lovely people. The mother kept the house awful tidy. But have you caught a glimpse of her hallway when the door's open? There's war zones in better order.

""Are we not a country of rules and laws anymore? I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,"" exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. ""Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son?

The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. ""What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,"" Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner's dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister. ""Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he's walking free - makes me sick,"" said Trump who didn't pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment.

Trump Diverts Ukrainian Military Aid To Russia,"JUST A DAY after labeling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator, US president Donald Trump has announced the redirecting of all ongoing military aid Ukraine is in receipt of, diverting it to Russia instead. ""Our military is spending $44 trillion a day on condoms for Zelensky, who as we all know, is America's greatest enemy.

With the Russian ruble halved in value in a decade, interest rates at 21%, electricity cost up 250%, $600bn of their assets held abroad frozen and 40% of all government spending going on the war, many see Putin's recent efforts at securing a peace deal with the US as a last ditch attempt to avert economic disaster in Russia. All the more reason the injection of military aid has been defended by Russian bot accounts with American flags in their X profiles; calling the move a sober, common sense move that brings an end to the madness of DEI. ""It brings me to tears when you see Russian prisons emptied out and those men sent to die on the front lines, we could be giving Russia HAWK defence systems and munitions, to push back this unjust invasion by Ukraine, which as you know, started the war"" said Trump, outlining his rationale for the latest move. ""Everybody is saying it; Ukraine is Marv and Harry AKA the Wet Bandits from Home Alone, I preferred the sequel, and Putin is the resourceful and adorable Macaulay Culkin who using only his wits and tricks defends his home, a real underdog story"" continued Trump with no sign of anyone in his administration willing to correct him.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 20, 2025",POLITICS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/20/trump-diverts-ukrainian-military-aid-to-russia/

Check out these realistic New Year's resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don't count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of 'getting dressed every day'. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don't set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don't even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 1, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/01/5-realistic-new-years-resolutions/
Israel Bagsies Syria,"LOUDLY PROCLAIMING 'yoink', the government led by fraud trial attender and internationally wanted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu are defending their decision to seize the Golan Heights 'buffer zone' in the wake of the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's reign. ""Bagsie it,"" confirmed Israel citing a cast iron legal precedent observed the world over. The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim. Citing previous bagsie incidents including 'Israel' and the fact it has illegally occupied the other portion of Golan since 1967, Israel do not expect any meaningful challenge to their commandeering of the territory. ""I dunno, sounds pretty compelling to us,"" confirmed originator of the 'bagsie it' method, Britain.

Seeing ‘Elder Millennials’ In News Headlines Like A Stab In The Heart,"MILLENNIALS have urged the media to choose their words more carefully after reports dozens of people born between in the 80s and 90s have suffered cataclysmic emotional breakdowns at seeing 'elder millennials' in headlines. ""You can't be elder anything if you are still part the fresh young generation that's just emerged and is defining culture. Fashion, music, art, film, we're the zeitgeist,"" falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. ""If you even so much as try and say 'oh, I wasn't born then so it was before my time' to me, I'll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn't 'classic TV',"" sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words 'elder millennials' often precede headlines such as 'still have f-all hope of affording a house'. ""Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We're the tech generation,"" offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window. UPDATE: An emergency team of therapists have been deployed to millennials after a meme stating 'we're as close to the year 2000 as people were in 1975' began doing the rounds.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 30, 2024",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/30/seeing-elder-millennials-in-news-headlines-like-a-stab-in-the-heart/
Christmas Miracle? Fine Gael & Fianna Fáil Put Aside Differences To Play Football In Leinster House Trenches,"JUST AS PEOPLE feared the venomous quarreling between two diametrically opposed forces would spill over into violence once again, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have laid down their finger-pointing arms and played a festive game of football. ""Wow, 'tis the season of peace on earth and good will to all men, so it is,"" said one shoe polisher outside Leinster House, who threw his flat cap skyward in exultation before jumping and clicking his heels. The tear-jerking intrusion of man's basic humanity, the likes of which has not seen since the first World War, into the maddening mire of murderous political negotiation had seemed virtually impossible in recent weeks such was the near constant agreement the two sides have been locked in. ""I've seen it all now, it wasn't two days ago I heard some of them agreeing on absolutely everything, declining to even speak out loud due to their telepathic understanding of each other and now look at them, putting aside their zero differences to play a bit of ball, warms the heart.

Local Man Going To Show New Rural Speed Limits Who’s Boss,"THROBBING with incalculable levels of anger at news of impending reductions in speed limits on some rural roads, local man Micheal Durnane has stated that if speed limit signs think they can tell him what to do they've another thing coming. ""On my local roads? What are they trying to say, that I don't know how to drive on them?"" Durnane raged, from a stool in his local pub he'll be driving home from in four pints' time. Durnane noted that while it makes sense for some people to observe speed limits such as young people, however he feels it's verging on insanity to suggest this needs to apply across the board to diligent drivers like himself. ""I know these roads so I'll keep doing 80 to 100 not 60! I know when you come out beyond McCormicks house there's that hedge that is half on the road so you need to swerve into the middle of the road a bit, and then swerve back cus of the pothole the size of a small country. But the authorities think they can dictate to me?"" Durnane continued to murmurs of agreement. In an effort to really make his point clear to the powers that be, Durnane has vowed to fill up his car with a full tank and spend the rest of the evening driving up and down boreens in his areas and observing the previous speed limits. ""No one tells me what I can and can't do,"" confirmed Durnane, whose car will get into a disagreement with a stone wall some time over the weekend.

New Law Will Force Gardaí To Immediately Release Skin Colour Of Crime Suspects To X,"IN A bid to save X users time speculating over whether a crime is worth high jacking for their own agendas, the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration Jim O'Callaghan has passed a bill forcing gardai to reveal the skin colour and 'actual nationality' of crime suspects from Monday. The move was welcomed by various media sources who seem to focus on nothing else in the news. ""Jumping the gun and lying about details is fun but it's hard work so please help us out,"" a spokescunt for a collection of race-baiting reactionary social media accounts said, ""can the gardai also let us know their genders or sexual orientation too so we can label them as paedophiles for the craic... actually their religion would also be great as that gets clicks and money from our readers who can't really afford it, but who feel obliged to because we don't like revealing the real source of our financial backing from abroad."" Defending the move, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris stated that allowing racists online to know the skin colour of a suspect will save the force a lot of time and will allow Gardai to be more prepared for riots and looting. ""If we tell people on X the suspect is white and 'one of their our' then we know we can stand down, no matter what awful crime they have committed,"" Harris pointed out. ""If the rape or murder suspect is Irish and white they will literally do fuck all and continue about their day just being openly racist on X, especially if the suspect is famous"".",Waterford Whispers News,"February 10, 2025",LOCAL NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/10/new-law-will-force-gardai-to-immediately-release-skin-colour-of-crime-suspects-to-x/
"Sex Worker In Riyadh With Hint Of Russian Accent Probably Nothing To Worry About, Thinks Trump Official","TAKING A WELL earned break from carving up Ukraine for the benefit of his boss and his boss's boss, one Trump administration official has dipped out of peace talks in Riyadh to catch up with a sex worker who organically began flirting with him in the lobby of his hotel this morning. ""No silly handsome man, I born in Saudi to Saudi family. Skin is pale because women kept inside all times, Saudi and Russian accent very different.

Tusla Take Child Into Custody After Parents Dress Child In Man United Jersey,"THE CHILD and family agency Tusla has been praised for taking a child into custody who was forced to wear a Manchester United jersey, WWN can exclusively reveal. ""You cannot deliberately set your child up to be the target of bullies, who would find such horrid attire irresistible to mock,"" explained one child psychologist, who said a 6-year-old child's treatment at the hands of his Dublin parents was one of the worst cases he has ever dealt with. The intervention by Tusla is seen as a somewhat cynical attempt to improve their reputation amongst the public, nevertheless the decision to take the child from their parents has been roundly praised. ""Now's not the time to bring up the failures of Tusla, praise should be given when something praiseworthy has been done,"" said one man in his early 20s who bares the scars of going through a similar ordeal in his own childhood. Further, truly twisted details have emerged after WWN can confirm the child's father had intended to force the child to board a plane to Manchester and sit for several hours in a stadium to watch the Premier League team.

Arts Council Take Stereotype About Artists Being Shit With Money To New Heights,"THE ARTS COUNCIL has formally apologised to artists across Ireland today after the news broke that the funding body spent an estimated EUR7mn on a new IT system that is not fit for purpose and was ultimately scrapped. ""We've battled against the stereotype that we're shit with money for decades, spend it on ridiculous airy fairy flights of fancy and now this happens? From the very body promoting the arts as a serious pursuit?"" one saddened artist said shortly before asking for a lend of a tenner for the train. ""It took me years to convince my mam I wasn't an idiot for spending EUR900 on brass for a sculpture that featured in the Vienna Biennale.

Local Woman Can’t Believe How Many Bullshit Made Up Christmas Traditions In-Laws Have,"THE PERSONABLE and polite exterior belonging to local woman Ciara Kinnane is at risk of shattering if she has to endure one more bullshit Christmas tradition observed by the her other half's family, the Mortons. ""Silly Sockless time, Silly Sockless time, who's going to win the last Roses chocolate,"" screeched Morton matriarch and mother-in-law to Kinanne, Carmel as the family inexplicably whipped off their socks and ran out the front door. ""D'you not play this before? I definitely told you about this one Ciara,"" Kinnane's partner Jack said, outlining how one member of the family who can survive out on the concrete drive way in front of the house in their bare feet the longest wins a solitary chocolate. ""But it's mild enough like and you're all adults. You can buy an infinite amount of chocolate for yourselves. In fact you just told me you vomited a little in your mouth there 'cos you're too full of chocolate,"" a so-fucking-done-with-this Kinnane said. At first glance, Kinnane could be labeled a Grinch of the highest order, but experts in spending festive period with the in-laws have pleaded for understanding. ""She's had to sit through something called 'Oopsy Daisy Gift' where you buy someone a gift you know they'll hate, and there's still the Christmas Eve watching of the Michael Keaton Batman movies 'as is tradition' to come, and the mulled wine and pineapple soup.

"“Hey, You’re Making It Way Too Fucking Obvious” Putin Warns Trump","WHILE everything Vladimir Putin pinned up on his 2025 vision board in his Kremlin office may be coming true, the Russian leader still felt the need to chastise his partner in crime, Donald Trump, for perhaps making things a bit 'too obvious'. ""Comrade, c'mon, calling Zelensky dictator when I'm guy who is first result image when look up 'modern dictators' on Google? Tone it down,"" Putin instructed in a text to Trump. Noted war criminal and instigator of the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had felt holding peaces talks with Trump on ending the war in Ukraine without involving Ukraine risked uncovering the very subtle effort he had made to make Trump his pawn, but now the cat was all but out of the bag. ""Yes we want you strong arm and abandon Ukraine but when you directly copy paste Kremlin propaganda notes into your social media posts with made up numbers, even your idiot supporters get suspicious,"" Putin added. Many political commentators have been shocked by Trump's outburst aimed at Zelensky after the Ukraine leader said the US president was living in a 'disinformation bubble', however, for others it is no great shock a serial sex offender would accuse a victim of being the real perpetrator. Putin's inner circle have once again publicly denied having any kompromat on Trump insisting, rather convincingly, that 'he is really just that stupid'.

"“Don’t Worry, We’re The Good Terrorists”","SYRIANS across the country are celebrating today after terrorists from a good decent terrorist background overthrew brutal dictator President Bashar al-Assad yesterday freeing the nation into Islamic state control. Coined as 'Syrians rebels' for now until it suits, militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani was greeted with cheers from supporters after capturing the Syrian capital Damascus, solidifying the once wanted group's control over much of the country. ""Don't worry guys, we're the good Islamic terrorists so there's no need to worry about us beheading any of you or anything, unless you're Christian of course,"" proclaimed the rebel leader, who has had a US-issued $10mn dollar reward on his head since 2017, which was ages ago really when you think about it and people change. ""I don't even dress like a terrorist anymore. Look at my army style shirt. I'm like a Syrian Zelensky, I'm one of the good guys now!"" he stated. Forcing the Assad family to flee to Russia after a 50-year reign of terror, the once al-Qaeda member al-Jawlani promised a more pragmatic approach to jihad going forward, admitting his past endeavours were questionable, but to trust him all the same as he's a changed man. ""I was al-Qaeda, then Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, then Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but today I'm a Syrian rebel.

Stoneybatter Stabbings: All You Need To Know From Man Who Knows Nothing,"DETAILS are still emerging in respect to the horrific stabbings perpetrated by a man in his late 20s, originally from South America, in Stoneybatter. However, keenly aware that the legacy media is full of lies and can never be trusted to say a true word, WWN has fired all correspondents and outsourced all reporting to Waterford resident and Telegram/X account holder, SunOfEire32: ""I can't imagine the horror, the panic and the terror felt by residents. No, seriously, I mean I'm so giddy with the thought that this could lead to more riots and Luas trams and asylum centres being burned out, I give precisely zero thought to the victims and the community at the centre of this. These things should be obvious but for emphasis; believe all random screenshots of tweets that were sent into WhatsApp groups in the minutes after news first broke. If it has 'forwarded many times' written on it, it has to be true. It's been a no-go area for years, and I know as someone who has never been there. And don't worry, yes, I'll be retweeting a load of Yanks with Irish flags talking about how Ireland is basically like downtown Hamas in Palestinia, but everyone is afraid to admit it. Why hasn't the person been named yet? Curious, isn't it? Suspicious even. And don't point out the fact that under Irish law, until a person is formally charged their identity isn't released, but we all know it's something to do with NGOs and George Soros. And that video from Ballymun of a lad with a knife, while it is a different incident, in a different location, involving an Irish person, just tell your brain it isn't and then believe what you want, which if you're like me, is fairly racist. The who, what, why, where, how and when of it isn't really the point. I'm just hoping to capitalise on the fact you get your news from social media and have the concentration skills of a fly, and that your brain will fail to distinguish between me, an idiot, and what I say and treat it with the same importance and priority as real information on the ground, from authorities and relevant experts.

On This Day 1981: Ireland’s First Swingers Discuss Having No One To Ride,"IRELAND'S first ever controversial 'swingers' have asked for at least one other couple to develop a perverse and sickening interest in extra-marital mickey swapping, Waterford Whispers News reports with much regret.

“I Was Cloned In A Government Experiment” Michael Lowry Explains Existence Of ‘Michael Lowrey’,"IN AN ATTEMPT to explain why a man called 'Michael Lowrey' would sell a house to Michael Lowry's daughter Lorraine Lowry for EUR50,000 only for Michael Lowry to later purchase it from his daughter for EUR290,000, the independent TD has made an incredible admission. ""I was dropped from a helicopter at the Galway races in 1994 into a vat of liquified brown envelopes, I thankfully emerged safely from this toxic sludge but so too did a man called Michael Lowrey. My exact clone in every way,"" Michael Lowry said to the Dail by way of explaining that technically he both is and isn't Michael Lowrey, the man who sold Lowry daughter a house at a below market value reduced price. Rumours of secretive Celtic Tiger era government experiments have been rife for years but this is the first on-the-record acknowledgement of hubristic forays into controversial scientific methods. ""We wanted to use Charles Haughey, but Charlie said no because there was a risk that he'd have to share money with his clone, so then we turned to convicted criminal Michael Lowry instead,"" said one scientist on the condition on anonymity. ""I'm bound to be known for creating this abomination, Michael Lowrey, but I did good experiments during the Tiger years; you think something as mad as Eddie Hobbs wasn't dreamed up in a lab?"" added the scientist, who refused to take credit for all pine kitchens or the panini. ""I'd wager this was in no way an attempt to conceal ownership of anything, nor was it a way for anyone to avoid having to pay Capital Gains Tax,"" offered one tax expert, who previously did the accounts for Anglo, the FAI and is available for budgeting work on the Children's Hospital. Elsewhere, widespread laughter greeted people suggesting the government will probably want to amend legislation removing a loophole which means TDs do not have to declare interests in properties they buy through companies even if they are, as is the case with Lowry, the sole shareholder of a company that buys property.

Investigation Launched To Discover Why Sofas No Longer Come With Arm Rest Covers,"IRISH homeowners are subject of a wide-ranging furniture study, believed to be the biggest of its kind, which is seeking to understand when the practice of having arm rest covers on sofas came to an end. ""You couldn't move from arm rest covers, couches had them, the 'dad chair' had them, the good room was just one big arm rest. Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?"" professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O'Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. ""Some suggest it's a 'notions' thing but isn't removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says 'my sofa is precious', it tells visitors 'I don't want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,"" added O'Neill, who believes there's a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn't count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers.

Biden Issues Last Minute Pardon For Everyone Involved In ‘Joker: Folie À Deux’,"FORMER US president as-of-yesterday Joe Biden has come under the spotlight for a number of high profile last-minute pardons including one bestowed upon Anthony Fauci, Liz Cheney and General Mark Milley. However, no pardon has proved as controversial as that given to the production team behind 2024 film sequel 'Joker: Folie a Deux', who are now protected from prosecutions relating to the crime of their movie. ""Wow, so I guess crime is legal now, huh,"" one angry man on the streets of Washington DC yesterday said, reacting to the gut wrenching news that Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips and Lady Gaga would never see the inside of a cell. While some argued that the pardon for the set designers and costume team were justified, others felt aggrieved by pardons they felt were making a mockery of the US justice system.

Fianna Fáil & Fine Gael’s ‘Red Lines’ For Going Into Government With Each Other,"EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheal Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the 'red lines'? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheal Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fail would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fail will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Fein embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dail bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a EUR20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Fein effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia.

Assad To Be Given Tour Of Moscow’s Most Beautiful 10th Storey Windows,"A REMARKABLE few days has seen the fall of Syrian tyrant Bashar Al-Assad, with reports placing him in the safe haven for a number of irredeemable bastard dictators, Moscow. The deposed despot fled the country he and his family brutalised for over 50 years but those fearing Assad would be left to a life in penury and suffering will be left disappointed as evidenced by the warm welcome he has reportedly received from Vladimir Putin in Moscow. ""I know you would rather be back home killing and torturing, who wouldn't, but in Moscow we have nice restaurants, the theatre, oh and you will not believe the beautiful windows we have. Hey, Alexander show Bashar our best windows,"" enthused Putin before abruptly leaving his dictator friend to get back to concentrating on his three day special military operation in Ukraine. Putin's FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow's best high rise windows. ""You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me? I like two-panel slider window because once it slide over you can lock in place so no accidentally close while you trying to get view.

Assad's guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below.

Junior Minister For Teas & Coffees Rebuts Claim Some Positions Invented Just To Keep TDs Happy,"COMPLETELY rejecting claims that the current government haven't appointed a record 23 junior ministers just because TDs 'pissed and moaned' about how they wanted more money and expenses, Junior Minister for Getting The Teas and Coffees Donal O'Cammon has delivered a forthright defence of Micheal Martin's government. ""I think these junior ministers and four super junior ministers form an integral part of the government, and if you don't mind, please refer to my full title; Junior Minister for Getting The Teas and Coffees, with Special Responsibility for Oat Milk and Purple Snacks, a bit of respect like,"" a combative O'Cammon said, defending his appointment. Despite several junior ministers seeming to have similarly titled briefs with overlapping responsibilities, O'Cammon again strongly denied these appointment were about making more money, looking important and claiming more expenses. ""That's the first I've heard of it now, all those extra payments ministers get so that's nothing to do with it at all at all. I didn't know that now, but if I can just correct you there, it's actually EUR32k in additional expenses,"" O'Cammon offered. O'Cammon briefly turned hostile accusing WWN of mocking the good, honest rural people he represents and the important role tea plays in their lives, suggesting this publication wants to ban tea, criminal drink tea-driving and throw scolding hot coffee in the face of Ireland. ""Now, you must excuse me, I've to see which direct family members and friends I will hire as one of my two drivers at EUR43k a year each, my secretary at EUR48k, my special advisor at EUR79k and whatever else I can wangle out of the taxpayer,"" O'Cammon concluded.

"“Now Is Not A Time For Grieving, Now Is The Time To Find Someone To Pin This On” Says Man Who Scrapped Aviation Security Advisory Committee","US PRESIDENT Donald Trump has confirmed that in the wake of a plane and helicopter collision over Washington DC which killed 67 people, now is not the time for investigations and seeking accurate information, or even a time to comfort the bereaved as all energies must be put into finding a scapegoat. ""In regard to comforting grieving families, there should be none, put them to the very back of your mind, and just get to blaming someone, anyone for this but obviously not me or anyone connected to me,"" explained Trump, who eliminated the membership of a key aviation safety committee last week. Asked by the media if, at such a tragic time, he had any empathy Trump confirmed that he gets regular medical check ups and had been given the all-clear by the White House doctor for that particular disease. ""We're talking your blacks, your hispanics, your women, your gays. Ideally, fingers crossed some lunatic on Twitter gets a viral post trending with a lie about how the person was a black transgender man with an Asian surname who voted Democrat - that's the holy grail of blame right there,"" offered Trump. While it is impossible to know at this early stage if the gutting of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee played any role in the aviation crash, Trump informed devoted followers and administration officials that it is there patriotic duty to compound people's grief with wild accusations in the hopes more people unduly suffer. ""Does Joe Biden have a pilot's licence?

Suspicions Raised As Local Boyfriend Denies All Knowledge Of Sydney Sweeney,"WHILE local woman Ciara Fagan would have laughed off boyfriend of two years Simon Skelly waxing lyrical about Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney's ample chest, things took a turn for the paranoid after Skelly chose to deny all knowledge of the woman when her name was brought up. ""Hmmm no, I'm searching my brain here but no, not heard of her. She's a musician is it?"" offered Skelly as Fagan, scrolling through the Netflix home menu, had remarked 'ugh, what a babe' upon seeing the Euphoria and Anyone But You star. With the seemingly hastily cobbled together words, advising that he is unaware of her existence, Skelly has merely sparked Fagan's suspicions and placed himself in peril. ""Great, now I think you're just tugging your rope to her every chance you get,"" Fagan said, implying Skelly's cross-my-heart contention that he has never heard of the pin-up lusted after by the internet is certifiable 'bullshit'. ""No, no, this isn't right at all Simon. You're getting weird with it. I know it, why couldn't you just say you'd smother me with a pillow if it meant you got to be smothered by her pillows like a normal guy would. Simon, what the fuck?"" insisted Fagan, who had no idea there was this sinister secret-holding component to her boyfriend. Fagan insisted that it is perfectly normal to admit to finding famous people, regarded as among the most beautiful in the world, attractive but to flat out pretend you've never heard of them is disturbing. ""Oh, so you're saying she's like a sex symbol or something? Right, right, interesting.

Yoon Suk Yeol's future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world's spotlight. ""Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,"" Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death. ""This is exactly what happens when you've got a poor leader who can't control his people - sure they may all have fancy things like food, a working economy, health care and really nice fried chicken, but what would you prefer, all those materialistic things or a great strong leader with dashing good looks?"" Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of 'we love you' could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation's men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year.

While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.

Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating 'trees EUR45, EUR65 & EUR85' Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at EUR85. ""Your sign says 'EUR45' and aim to hold you to that,"" barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don't treat everything like an episode of Dragon's Den. ""You don't think I'll go down to the GAA club where they're selling them as well. I've bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for EUR45 is more than fare,"" said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as 'an asshole' when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year.

Most Unromantic Man In Ireland Saved By Last Minute Panic Shop In ALDI,"WITH VALENTINE'S Day appearing like an apparition out of nowhere with no warning and zero promotion, Gavin McNeffin, widely regarded as Ireland's most unromantic man, has been saved by a panic shop in ALDI. ""Hang on, is Valentine's Day on the 14th?"" McNeffin said in response to reminder texts from his sisters to treat his girlfriend Louise Kane to some romance for once. ""Maybe I better ask her if we're 'doing Valentines' this year as we're two years together now and have probably moved past that stage in our relationship,"" declared 22-year-old McNeffin. Had McNeffin not stumbled into his local ALDI, the Waterford man was on course to possibly top last year's gift to Kane of subjecting her to watching 'greatest overhead kick goals' compilation videos online while wondering why she was upset. ""If there's one thing she loves more than debating if it was a technically a bicycle kick or an overhead kick, it's a big juicy steak,"" McNeffin said, as he used his arms to sweep anything with a red-bow into his ALDI shopping basket. Despite beads of sweat gathering on his forehead, with his purchase of an ALDI card, award-winning steak, middle aisle candle and chocolates, McNeffin is now in line to accumulate enough brownie points to open up his very own brownie factory.

Why Ireland Should Embrace Climate Change,"THE WORLD is more than familiar with the supposed negative impacts of impending climate change, but little space is given in these conversations for exploring the near endless opportunities, advantages and positives. Consulting several experts Waterford Whispers News has compiled a number of reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective: Midlands residents won't have to travel as far to the nearest beach as rising sea levels engulf coastal counties. More jobs created from having to clean up after natural disasters. The chance that Britain could disappear first makes it worth it alone. Pensioners could die from intense heat rather than from cold winters. We will experience better sunnier weather during the brief interlude from bitter snow storms or rain floods. We'll get to grow our own wine, wipe the smug grins off the French's faces. The more we burn, the more it turns to tan, the healthier we look. Less cunt bees stinging you. More extinct animals makes a family trip to the zoo even more precious.

‘Undercover Boss’ Revival Sees Tim Cook Install Anti-Suicide Nets In Chinese Factory,"LAST BROADCAST in 2022, US reality TV show 'Undercover Boss' has snagged a huge name in business for its latest revival; Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Musk Denies Newest Neuralink Brain Chip Recipient Displaying Increasingly Erratic Behaviour,"""WILL LOOK into it"" read the tweet from Elon Musk, owner of brain chip implant firm Neuralink, after employees reported one of the company's test subjects acting increasingly erratic. ""It's actually horrifying and sad to watch in equal measure, the implanting of the Neuralink brain chip hasn't helped the recipient, who was in clear cognitive decline to begin with, in fact he's gotten worse,"" one scientist at the firm said of test subject Donald Trump. Troubling behaviour such as believing he owns Greenland and the Panama canal, and celebrating Mexico and Canada agreeing to border security measures they had already announced during Joe Biden's term in office like it was a huge victory for him are just some of the examples given by Neuralink scientists. ""It's fine really. We're currently going through a debugging process, but no matter what we try he's still doing crazy stuff like letting a billionaire run the country, and announcing plans to commit crimes against humanity in Gaza via ethnic cleansing,"" confirmed Musk once he assessed the test subject. ""OK so maybe we're, eh, seeing huge shifts in personality. Before the chip went in, he hated foreigners, but now he's letting an immigrant take over the running of the government. Concerning, "" Musk finally admitted. UPDATE: Defenders of the test subject suggested that if he was really so badly affected by the Neuralink chip, then how come he was able to drive down the price of groceries and stopped the Ukraine war on 'day one' as promised.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 6, 2025",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/06/musk-denies-newest-neuralink-brain-chip-recipient-displaying-increasingly-erratic-behaviour/
"Everyone Advised To Ignore Report Saying House Prices Overvalued By 10%, Everything Is Fine","AN ERSI report warned householders currently paying an average 33% of their net income on their mortgages are vulnerable to a 'painful correction' on house prices which are overvalued by as much as 10%. ""Only 10%?"" said the Irish public staring at Daft.ie listings for 'half collapsed shed in active war zone, D15' valued at EUR550,000 which beg to differ. Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. ""You'll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it. NOW,"" whispered the mangled demon soul of Ireland directly into the ears' of first time buyers. ""Sadly, they're not elevated enough. I was barely able to leverage my home to buy an apartment in Dublin to rent at extortionate levels; it's the Irish dream,"" shared one man, who thinks it's a disgrace his kids can't afford a house. Meanwhile, the outgoing Minister for Housing has confirmed having combed through the report its content are clearly a hyperbolic fantasy and that everything is indeed fine. ""Oh I haven't read a word. But from my understanding we can counteract further price inflation by doing things that increase prices like more subsidies for builders, tax breaks for landlords, increasing the help to buy scheme and upping the rent credit payment,"" explained Darragh O'Brien, who admitted government formation talks were on the verge of collapse as Fianna Fail and Fine Gael fight over who gets responsibility for increasing homeless figures.

“How Come You & Your Dad Support Different Teams?” Innocently Asks Girlfriend About To Receive Crash Course In Chelsea’s Early 2000s Transformation,"UNAWARE she has set herself on a path towards receiving a dense-packed hours long lecture about early 2000s Premier League football, Emily O'Sullivan has queried why her boyfriend Sean Hughton supports a different team to his father. ""And you see Damien Duff is Irish and he played the same position as me, and they were drowning in money. And Jose was cool back then, not the cringe magnet he is now, but even before him Ranieri was like sound and Ferguson and his little parade of pricks were arrogant as anything,"" launched Hughton, not drawing breath as O'Sullivan identified her nearest emergency exits. Putting himself back on the defensive slightly 32-year-old Hughton made sure to mention how before his time mid-90s Chelsea were a joyously sophisticated blend of brawn and skill, counting Zola and Wise among their ranks, thus proving the 'we've got no history' chant is deeply ironic before having to explain the chant's origins what O'Sullivan said ""what's a chant?"". ""And sure dad would try and wedge me into a United shirt but I didn't want to be like the other lad in school who were all United fans. You following this?"" continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn't seem to have desired effect on O'Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely. ""Do you want to see my Premier League sticker book?"" beamed Hughton, rummaging through a shoe box in his wardrobe.",Waterford Whispers News,"December 20, 2024",Football,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2024/12/20/how-come-you-your-dad-support-different-teams-innocently-asks-girlfriend-about-to-receive-crash-course-in-chelseas-early-2000s-transformation/
"“Everyone Different To Us Must Die, Daddy” Musk’s Adorable Interaction With Son","""I WANT them all dead, daddy, everyone different to us must die,"" Elon Musk's adorable son, X, yelled sparking waves of laughter from president Donald Trump and surrounding staffers after a press conference in the Oval Office on Tuesday. ""Daddy, do the funny wave the black and white man you watch at home does,"" X insisted, his father now shushing him before reminding the 4-year-old that 'at home talk is only for at home'. Casually walking around the most secured office in the known world, X inquired why his father's orange friend with the silly hair is back sitting in his father's favourite seat again. ""Sometimes daddy has to lend it to uncle Don - remember, sharing is caring, X,"" Musk explained, as those in attendance 'awed' at the heartwarming interaction between a billionaire with delusions of world domination and his future heir. ""When I grow up, I'm going to make sure no one steals my chair - I'll kill them all... pew, pew, pew!"" X exclaimed now making gun shooting gestures directly at a nervous looking Hispanic reporter.

McGregor Marks Bloody Sunday Anniversary By Paying Tribute To British Soldiers,"EXPANDING on his deleted rants on Twitter in which he urged Derry MMA fighter Paul Hughes to 'get that flag (tricolour) off you' and that he is a 'you little know-what-you-are cunt' from 'up there', court star and rapist Conor McGregor has further solidified his opinion of people 'up there' in the north of Ireland. Wearing a remembrance poppy he had left over from the last time he wore it, sources close to McGregor confirmed he marked the 53rd anniversary of the Bloody Sunday massacre today with the feeling that such atrocities are none of his business as people 'up there' are in no way Irish, and he is superior to them, and what the British government does with its British subjects is their business. ""I think people give this rapist an awful hard time. Like any proud Irish patriot, he wears the poppy and happily poses in pictures with Nigel Farage at Trump's inauguration,"" shared one person who believed McGregor likely connected with the 'warrior spirit' of the British army that saw it open fire on innocent people, killing 14 of them. While some would rush to criticise such expressions of support for the British army, others have pointed out some would find a kindred spirit in an empire which commits awful crimes, always denies wrongdoing and tries to bury the truth, often through intimidation and violence. ""When insulting Hughes on Twitter yesterday he said 'Up the real Irish fuck these vermin fucks' and frankly that's the sort of Irish president I'd vote for,"" offered the only remaining clinically braindead Irish McGregor supporter than isn't a social media bot account.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 30, 2025",Sports,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/30/mcgregor-marks-bloody-sunday-anniversary-by-paying-tribute-to-british-soldiers/
Have You Been Regurgitating Food Into Your Child’s Mouth Wrong All This Time?,"NEW RESEARCH suggests a growing number of parents are chewing up food and then regurgitating it into their child's mouth in the incorrect way. ""People have suggested inventing food that comes in a paste or a liquidy form but the technology to make such things a reality are simply years away I'm afraid,"" confirmed one researcher working on this project, Carl Brunthar. As has been well documented, due to a lack of advancement in the scientific field of food composition and children's stubborn desire not to evolve beyond their current form, humans continue to provide their offspring with essential nutrients and sustenance in a similar manner to that of birds. ""But even in the age of Google and YouTube where parents can watch tutorials on regurgitating food straight from their stomachs into their child's mouths they're still getting it wrong"", added Brunthar. ""It doesn't help that human babies are useless either. A newborn foal? Galloping minutes after being birth? Lazy kids? Can't fecking walk for about a year and jaysus, they can't truly stand on their two feet until they're in their 20s"". Brunthar has cautioned parents against actually chewing and enjoying things like steak for themselves instead imploring them to swallow such things whole. The end result of this is that a fully in tact piece of food lasts longer against bacteria and stomach acid, so when a child starts crying or giving out you can simply vomit up a full meal into their mouth that retains much of its nutrients, original form and flavour. ""I feel like a right fool now,"" confirmed one new parent who had been munching to his heart's content and only using his pharynx to bring back up piles of mushy, blood-clotted food. The group of researchers are running classes on how to properly regurgitate food into kids mouths around the country and have rejected claims they're just a bunch of weirdos who are acting like kid's food jars don't exist.",Waterford Whispers News,"January 22, 2025",Uplifting Viral Content,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/01/22/have-you-been-regurgitating-food-into-your-childs-mouth-wrong-all-this-time/
Zelensky Yearns For Good Old Days When He Simply Played Piano With Penis For A Living,"UKRAINIAN President Volodymyr Zelensky looked vacantly through a sea of international press photographers and journalists yearning for days gone by when he played the Jewish classic 'Hava Nagila' on a piano with his penis for a living, wondering where it all went so horribly wrong. ""I'd give anything to beat those ivory keys with my manhood right now instead of leaving the fate of our nation to foreign superpowers hellbent on making lucrative deals for themselves with Ukrainian territory,"" the 47-year-old thought to himself as he was bombarded with multiple questions relating to news of 'peace talks' between Russia and the US. Humming the familiar folk piece in his head, Volodymyr insisted that Ukraine will not agree to any peace deal proposed by the US and Russia without its involvement, knowing full well his words will land on deaf ears, with his role as 'president' currently holding even less importance now than the pianist role he played in 2016. ""Maybe if I did the piano act again today as president wearing this stupid khaki t-shirt they make me wear, then everyone might actually listen to me?"" he pondered to himself, cracking a rare chuckle, imagining the uproar such a performance would cause mid-NATO conference while he asked for more military aid. ""I'd probably play something more suitable for the times like the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme, or the Imperial March - God help us all,"" he blessed himself and whatever is left of Ukraine.",Waterford Whispers News,"February 14, 2025",WORLD NEWS,Satire,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2025/02/14/zelensky-yearns-for-good-old-days-when-he-simply-played-piano-with-penis-for-a-living/
How To Break It To Your Dog That Kay Burley Has Retired,"DOG clairvoyant, broadcaster and canine emotion identifier Kay Burley has announced her retirement from Sky News after 36 years. While it may barely register with the average person, dog owners in the UK and beyond are beside themselves with anxiety over how to break the news to their pooches. ""I don't think it takes a newscaster with decades of experience to figure out what'll be in his eyes when I tell him... nuclear grade sadness,"" confirmed dog owner Tim Epping, searching for a way to broach the sensitive subject with Chunk, his 12-year-old bulldog. ""I wish Kay herself was here herself to coach me through tackling such a difficult subject but then I remember she relishes delivering bad news with the subtlety of a hammer to the face and a tactless tabloid desire to milk every last drop of sordid sensationalism from tragedy"". Thankfully official guidelines by dog psychologists have been released to help dog owners in this trying time. ""Take them for a walk to their favourite spot, give them lots of treats and then as your petting them, use something called empathy and do whatever the opposite of what Burley would do is, oh and definitely don't strangle a photographer,"" confirmed one dog expert. Elsewhere, Sky News viewers shocked by Burley's announcement have been reassured that the editors who put together Hollywood style trailers for the most horrific news, crimes and natural disasters humanity has witnessed are still employed at the station.

Parents Counteract Child Dropping Hints About Xmas Presents By Dropping Hints They’re Broke As Fuck,"""OH TWO can play that game motherfucker"" confirmed stressed and broke parents Martin and Fiona Larkan, responding to their eldest child's increasing number of outlandish hints and requests relating to this year's Christmas presents. ""Bless him, we'd love to get him nice things but he's overdoing it with the PS5 and SIX feckin' games,"" confirmed Fiona, who has taken to leaving the couple's shrinking bank balance statements out on the kitchen table for Fiachra (11) to read. Martin has undertaken the more demanding role when it comes to acting, taking to crying when in the car with Fiachra when the petrol gauge flitters near empty. ""Yeah, acting, that's it,"" confirmed Martin who has taken to plugging the TV out during ad breaks to save on electricity bills. Not alone this Christmas, the Larkans are believed to part of a growing number of parents who resort to interrupting 'the magic of Christmas' with the occasional 'do you have any idea how much the fucking magic of Christmas is costing us' lectures when a child asks for EUR3,000 worth of presents. ""You see, this is just a foundational tenet of negotiating. You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they've won.
