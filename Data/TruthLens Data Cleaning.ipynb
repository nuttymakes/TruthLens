    "## Phase 1: Real vs. Fake News Classification\n",
    "The first stage leverages the Misinformation & Fake News text dataset, which contains almost 79,000 long-form articles evenly distributed between two classes: real and fake news. The dataset is well-suited for binary classification due to its balance and scale. Using an existing dataset eliminates the need for custom data collection for this phase and accelerates development.\n",

    "Phase 1 preprocessing includes tokenisation, stop-word removal, and text normalisation. These steps ensure consistency and reduce noise in the input data, enabling efficient model training.\n",

       "      <td>U.S. President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction on Tuesday with the federal response to Hurricane Maria s devastation of Puerto Rico, despite criticism that the government was slow to address the crisis. Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget.  I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico,  he said.  And that s fine. We ve saved a lot of lives.  Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico s 3.4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34.  The U.S. territory s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a $72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island s debt would have to be erased.  They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we re going to have to wipe that out. You re going to say goodbye to that, I don t know if it s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that,  Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody s on Tuesday estimated Maria s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at $45 billion to $95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a  real catastrophe like Katrina,  the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800.

This makes magistrates the only professional category with a system dedicated to investigating them. The bills also enforce more restrictive criteria for prosecutors seeking to join anti-corruption and anti-organized- crime prosecuting units. On Monday, lawmakers approved a bill that changes the way magistrates are supervised and amends the definition of prosecutor activity to exclude the word  independent .  The three bills must now be approved by the senate, with a vote expected next week. Opposition parties and President Klaus Iohannis could also challenge the bills at the Constitutional Court, but the outcome of that was unclear. The ruling Social Democrats also plan changes to the country s criminal code. In November, the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern. At the start of this year, attempts by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the country s largest street protests in decades.

       "      <td>Of course, America s favorite criminal candidate says America shouldn t believe the infamous hacker who claims he accessed her unsecured server because he s a criminal. LOL if anyone can spot a criminal, it s Crooked Hillary The infamous Romanian hacker known as Guccifer, speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily and repeatedly breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s personal email server in early 2013. For me, it was easy easy for me, for everybody, Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker Guccifer, told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.Guccifer s potential role in the Clinton email investigation was first reported by Fox News last month. The hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with Fox News.Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar s claims.In response to Lazar s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying, There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell. In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton s server are inaccurate. It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. The former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the Top Secret level. Via: FOX News</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction on Tuesday with the federal response to Hurricane Maria s devastation of Puerto Rico, despite criticism that the government was slow to address the crisis. Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, he said. And that s fine. We ve saved a lot of lives. Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico s 3.4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34. The U.S. territory s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a _CUR_72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island s debt would have to be erased. They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we re going to have to wipe that out. You re going to say goodbye to that, I don t know if it s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that, Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody s on Tuesday estimated Maria s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at _CUR_45 billion to _CUR_95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a real catastrophe like Katrina, the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800.

       "      <td>Romania s lower house of parliament approved on Wednesday legislation to overhaul its justice system, legislation that the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and the country s president have criticized as threatening judicial independence. Two bills, and a third which was approved on Monday, are part of a wider overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks and which thousands of magistrates oppose The European Union state, ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, joins its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the protesters. Changes approved on Wednesday include setting up a special unit to investigate criminal offences committed by judges and prosecutors. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a system dedicated to investigating them. The bills also enforce more restrictive criteria for prosecutors seeking to join anti-corruption and anti-organizedcrime prosecuting units. On Monday, lawmakers approved a bill that changes the way magistrates are supervised and amends the definition of prosecutor activity to exclude the word independent . The three bills must now be approved by the senate, with a vote expected next week. Opposition parties and President Klaus Iohannis could also challenge the bills at the Constitutional Court, but the outcome of that was unclear. The ruling Social Democrats also plan changes to the country s criminal code. In November, the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern. At the start of this year, attempts by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the country s largest street protests in decades. Romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on top-level graft.

LOL if anyone can spot a criminal, it s Crooked Hillary The infamous Romanian hacker known as Guccifer, speaking exclusively with Fox News, claimed he easily and repeatedly breached former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s personal email server in early 2013. For me, it was easy easy for me, for everybody, Marcel Lehel Lazar, who goes by the moniker Guccifer, told Fox News from a Virginia jail where he is being held.Guccifer s potential role in the Clinton email investigation was first reported by Fox News last month. The hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with Fox News.Fox News could not independently confirm Lazar s claims.In response to Lazar s claims, the Clinton campaign issued a statement Wednesday night saying, There is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell. In addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims, his descriptions of Secretary Clinton s server are inaccurate. It is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. The former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified, and another 22 at the Top Secret level. Via: FOX News   \n",

Trump, who has grappled with hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the past six weeks, said at a briefing that the disasters were straining the U.S. budget. I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you ve thrown our budget a little out of whack because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, he said. And that s fine. We ve saved a lot of lives. Two weeks after it was hit by the worst hurricane in 90 years, many of Puerto Rico s 3.4 million residents are still struggling without basic necessities. Shortly after Trump left Puerto Rico, Governor Ricardo Rosello said the death toll had risen from 16 to 34. The U.S. territory s economy already was in recession before Hurricane Maria and its government had filed for bankruptcy in the face of a _CUR_72 billion debt load. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said the island s debt would have to be erased. They owe a lot of money to your friends on Wall Street and we re going to have to wipe that out. You re going to say goodbye to that, I don t know if it s Goldman Sachs but whoever it is you can wave goodbye to that, Trump said in the interview, conducted while he visited the island. Moody s on Tuesday estimated Maria s total cost to Puerto Rico, including lost output, at _CUR_45 billion to _CUR_95 billion and significant relief from the federal government would be required. Trump said the federal response to Maria compared favorably with a real catastrophe like Katrina, the 2005 storm that swamped Louisiana and Mississippi and killed more than 1,800. What s happened in terms of recovery, in terms of saving lives   \n",
       "2  Romania s lower house of parliament approved on Wednesday legislation to overhaul its justice system, legislation that the European Commission, the U.S. State Department and the country s president have criticized as threatening judicial independence. Two bills, and a third which was approved on Monday, are part of a wider overhaul that has triggered street protests across the country in recent weeks and which thousands of magistrates oppose The European Union state, ranked as one of the bloc s most corrupt, joins its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, defying EU concerns over the rule of law. Romania s ruling Social Democrats, which command an overwhelming majority in parliament together with their junior coalition partner, ALDE, have so far ignored the protesters. Changes approved on Wednesday include setting up a special unit to investigate criminal offences committed by judges and prosecutors. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a system dedicated to investigating them. The bills also enforce more restrictive criteria for prosecutors seeking to join anti-corruption and anti-organizedcrime prosecuting units. On Monday, lawmakers approved a bill that changes the way magistrates are supervised and amends the definition of prosecutor activity to exclude the word independent . The three bills must now be approved by the senate, with a vote expected next week. Opposition parties and President Klaus Iohannis could also challenge the bills at the Constitutional Court, but the outcome of that was unclear. The ruling Social Democrats also plan changes to the country s criminal code. In November, the European Commission said justice reform has stagnated this year and challenges to judicial independence remain a persistent source of concern. At the start of this year, attempts by the Social Democrats to decriminalize several corruption offences triggered the country s largest street protests in decades. Romanian prosecutors have investigated thousands of public officials in an unprecedented crackdown on top-level graft. The lower house and senate speakers are both currently on trial in separate cases.   \n",

    "Readability metrics help us to understand the complexity of the text. We can see that there are some differences between the misinformation and real news with regards to readability. \"True\" news (class 0) has a slightly lower average Flesch score than \"fake\" news (class 1), indicating that the fake news is easier to read on average. Looking at the spread for each class - the real news content has a relatively tight range, while the texts in the other class have more variance as well as some outliers."

    "### Stemming/Lemmatisation\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatisation are standard text normalisation techniques in natural language processing. The purpose of stemming and lemmatisation is to reduce words to their root or base form. This helps improve the accuracy of text processing because it reduces the amount of word variance. The major difference between the two techniques is that stemming reduces words to stems, which may or may not be valid, while lemmatisation reduces the words to linguistically valid lemmas. For example, the word \"nothing\" is reduced to \"noth\" with a Porter stemmer, while it remains as \"nothing\" using the WordNet lemmatizer. Here I am testing the results of four different techniques to see which is the most appropriate for my data:\n",
    "- Porter stemmer\n",
    "- Snowball stemmer\n",
    "- WordNet lemmatiser\n",
    "- WordNet lemmatiser with part of speech (POS) tagging."

       "      <td>Among the senseless beatings inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night was the discussion of New York City's tactics. Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the practice by, variously, \"a judge, who was a very judge,\" and the \"current mayor. \" This was multilayered fiction. Murder declined. A judge did not end . Neither did the current mayor. In fact, the Police Department began to drastically curtail its use in 2012, under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent. This is well documented but only lightly noticed. On July 9, 2012, an editorial in The New York Post warned that the reduction in its use would lead to \"more blood in the street. \" By the way, did more blood run in the street? No, less blood did. Murder is down 32 percent since 2011, the last year of the old era, having dropped to 352 homicides in 2015 from 515 in 2011. In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department. During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting. \"Under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,\" she said. \"So there is — — \" \"No, you're wrong,\" Mr. Trump interjected. \"You're wrong. \" \"No, I'm not,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"Murders are up, all right,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You check it. \" All right, as Mr. Trump said, let's check it. A Google search for \"Historical New York City Crime Data\" will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies. Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year. In the used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014. \"It was terminated by the current mayor,\" Mr. Trump said. Actually, no. Last year, the city police conducted 22, 939 stops, or about 63 a day. So was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It's true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights. By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city's wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011. \"But had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,\" Mr. Trump said during the debate. \"Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. \" During the era praised by Mr. Trump, about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever, according to police data. Of those few who were arrested, the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana, not having guns. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed. Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping. It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order. As Mr. Trump said, it was \"tremendous beyond belief. \" Just so.</td>\n",

       "23724  Among the senseless beatings inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night was the discussion of New York City's tactics. Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to actions that never happened, namely, the ending of the practice by, variously, \"a judge, who was a very judge,\" and the \"current mayor. \" This was multilayered fiction. Murder declined. A judge did not end . Neither did the current mayor. In fact, the Police Department began to drastically curtail its use in 2012, under the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent. This is well documented but only lightly noticed. On July 9, 2012, an editorial in The New York Post warned that the reduction in its use would lead to \"more blood in the street. \" By the way, did more blood run in the street? No, less blood did. Murder is down 32 percent since 2011, the last year of the old era, having dropped to 352 homicides in 2015 from 515 in 2011. In the same period, stops were down by about 97 percent, said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the department. During the debate, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, alluded to a few of these numbers. Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, started shouting. \"Under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders,\" she said. \"So there is — — \" \"No, you're wrong,\" Mr. Trump interjected. \"You're wrong. \" \"No, I'm not,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"Murders are up, all right,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You check it. \" All right, as Mr. Trump said, let's check it. A Google search for \"Historical New York City Crime Data\" will bring you to a site with charts of serious felonies. Frisks went down. So has murder, a steady decline that has continued, with slight annual variations, through this year. In the used by Mr. Trump, those details land upside down. Also, he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the tactics, attributing it to a federal judge hearing a lawsuit against the city, and to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014. \"It was terminated by the current mayor,\" Mr. Trump said. Actually, no. Last year, the city police conducted 22, 939 stops, or about 63 a day. So was not terminated by Mr. de Blasio, or by anyone else for that matter. It's true that the use of the tactic has declined. During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg, the number of reported stops skyrocketed, but then was scaled back as the city faced pressure from the litigation, brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights. By the end of 2013, the year Shira A. Scheindlin, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the city's wholesale search practices violated the Constitution, the number of stops had declined by 72 percent from its peak in 2011. \"But had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City,\" Mr. Trump said during the debate. \"Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. \" During the era praised by Mr. Trump, about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever, according to police data. Of those few who were arrested, the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana, not having guns. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest tens of thousands for having weed. Applied almost exclusively to minorities, the tactics in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money, degrading both to the personhood of the men and women who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping. It was poor social hygiene, not defensible as a matter of law or as effective law and order. As Mr. Trump said, it was \"tremendous beyond belief. \" Just so.   \n",

Crew on board Etihad flight EY450 landed the plane at 5 a.m.  at Adelaide Airport, in the state of South Australia. The Boeing 777 passenger jet had 349 passengers on board who disembarked via emergency exits, according to online news service Adelaide Advertiser. A technical fault with a cargo hold air recirculation fan had been found, Etihad Airways told Reuters in an email. Etihad Airways apologizes for the inconvenience. The safety of our guests and crew is of paramount importance, it said. Australia s ABC News had reported that a smoke alarm had activated. Passengers would make their onward journeys via other airlines due to crew rest requirements, the airline said. Saturday s Etihad flight EY451, from Sydney to Abu Dhabi, had been canceled and passengers would be rescheduled on later Etihad services out of Sydney, the airline said. It was the second incident this year for the Etihad flight that connects Australia s biggest city with the hub of Abu Dhabi, where passengers transit for worldwide destinations. In July, four men were arrested in Sydney over an Islamist plot to attack the flight.

Its director, Peter Bray, declined to speak about the man who had suddenly usurped Lena Dunham as the nabe s most famous inhabitant.Comey said in his testimony that he decided to give the content of his Trump memo to his good friend to leak to the press after President Trump tweeted out about possible takes of their conversations. Comey also said of leaking the memo, I thought it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Via: NYPWho knew the FBI Director was a leaker! This is too much! Our intel community has become so politicized that it prohibits them from following the law or even focusing on gutting to the truth! During testimony today, Susan Collins asked if Comey ever shared memos from President Trump:COMEY S RESPONSE WAS A SHOCKER. HE SAID HE FELT HE NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE SO HE ASKED A FRIEND TO SHARE THE MEMO WITH A REPORTER:The person that Comey gave the memos to is a former classmate from Columbia Law School. He is considered to be a and adviser to Comey. Daniel Richman is in the video below and is a rather interesting guy. The video is dated but is meant to give you an idea of the character of this friend and adviser to the former FBI Director.Comey stated:James Comey leaked details of his conversation with _USER_ to friend and confidant Daniel Richman.Does this man look sane to you? _URL_ Josh Caplan  June 8, 2017 Does this man look sane to you? _URL_ Josh Caplan  June 8, 2017   \n",

       "23724  Among the senseless beating inflicted on reality during the presidential debate on Monday night wa the discussion of New York City 's tactic . Donald J. Trump attributed a nonexistent increase in murder to action that never happened , namely , the ending of the practice by , variously , `` a judge , who wa a very judge , '' and the `` current mayor. `` This wa multilayered fiction .

So ha murder , a steady decline that ha continued , with slight annual variation , through this year . In the used by Mr. Trump , those detail land upside down . Also , he repeated a more common mistake about the decline of the tactic , attributing it to a federal judge hearing a lawsuit against the city , and to Mayor Bill de Blasio , a Democrat , who succeeded Mr. Bloomberg in 2014 . `` It wa terminated by the current mayor , '' Mr. Trump said . Actually , no . Last year , the city police conducted 22 , 939 stop , or about 63 a day . So wa not terminated by Mr. de Blasio , or by anyone else for that matter . It 's true that the use of the tactic ha declined . During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg , the number of reported stop skyrocketed , but then wa scaled back a the city faced pressure from the litigation , brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights . By the end of 2013 , the year Shira A. Scheindlin , the federal judge hearing the case , ruled that the city 's wholesale search practice violated the Constitution , the number of stop had declined by 72 percent from it peak in 2011 . `` But had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City , '' Mr. Trump said during the debate . `` Tremendous beyond belief . So when you say it ha no impact , it really did . It had a very , very big impact. `` During the era praised by Mr. Trump , about 90 percent of the people who were stopped were young black or Latino men who had committed no crime whatsoever , according to police data . Of those few who were arrested , the vast majority were charged with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana , not having gun . Hundreds of thousand of innocent people were being stopped every year so that the city could arrest ten of thousand for having weed . Applied almost exclusively to minority , the tactic in New York became an elephantine government project that wasted time and money , degrading both to the personhood of the men and woman who were stopped and to the professionalism of the people doing the stopping . It wa poor social hygiene , not defensible a a matter of law or a effective law and order . As Mr. Trump said , it wa `` tremendous beyond belief. `` Just so .   \n",

Its director , Peter Bray , declined to speak about the man who had suddenly usurped Lena Dunham a the nabe s most famous inhabitant.Comey said in his testimony that he decided to give the content of his Trump memo to his good friend to leak to the press after President Trump tweeted out about possible take of their conversation . Comey also said of leaking the memo , I thought it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel . Via : NYPWho knew the FBI Director wa a leaker ! This is too much ! Our intel community ha become so politicized that it prohibits them from following the law or even focusing on gutting to the truth ! During testimony today , Susan Collins asked if Comey ever shared memo from President Trump : COMEY S RESPONSE WAS A SHOCKER . HE SAID HE FELT HE NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE SO HE ASKED A FRIEND TO SHARE THE MEMO WITH A REPORTER : The person that Comey gave the memo to is a former classmate from Columbia Law School . He is considered to be a and adviser to Comey . Daniel Richman is in the video below and is a rather interesting guy . The video is dated but is meant to give you an idea of the character of this friend and adviser to the former FBI Director.Comey stated : James Comey leaked detail of his conversation with _USER_ to friend and confidant Daniel Richman.Does this man look sane to you ? _URL_ Josh Caplan June 8 , 2017 Does this man look sane to you ? _URL_ Josh Caplan June 8 , 2017   \n",

No , less blood do . Murder be down 32 percent since 2011 , the last year of the old era , have drop to 352 homicide in 2015 from 515 in 2011 . In the same period , stop be down by about 97 percent , say J. Peter Donald , a spokesman for the department . During the debate , Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee , allude to a few of these number . Mr. Trump , her Republican opponent , start shout . `` Under the current mayor , crime have continue to drop , include murder , '' she say . `` So there be — — `` `` No , you 're wrong , '' Mr. Trump interject . `` You 're wrong. `` `` No , I 'm not , '' Mrs. Clinton say . `` Murders be up , all right , '' Mr. Trump say . `` You check it. `` All right , a Mr. Trump say , let 's check it . A Google search for `` Historical New York City Crime Data '' will bring you to a site with chart of serious felony . Frisks go down . So have murder , a steady decline that have continue , with slight annual variation , through this year . In the use by Mr. Trump , those detail land upside down . Also , he repeat a more common mistake about the decline of the tactic , attribute it to a federal judge hear a lawsuit against the city , and to Mayor Bill de Blasio , a Democrat , who succeed Mr. Bloomberg in 2014 . `` It be terminate by the current mayor , '' Mr. Trump say . Actually , no . Last year , the city police conduct 22 , 939 stop , or about 63 a day . So be not terminate by Mr. de Blasio , or by anyone else for that matter . It 's true that the use of the tactic have decline . During the mayoralty of Mr. Bloomberg , the number of reported stop skyrocket , but then be scale back a the city face pressure from the litigation , bring by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights . By the end of 2013 , the year Shira A. Scheindlin , the federal judge hear the case , rule that the city 's wholesale search practice violate the Constitution , the number of stop have decline by 72 percent from it peak in 2011 . `` But have a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City , '' Mr. Trump say during the debate . `` Tremendous beyond belief . So when you say it have no impact , it really do . It have a very , very big impact. `` During the era praise by Mr. Trump , about 90 percent of the people who be stop be young black or Latino men who have commit no crime whatsoever , accord to police data . Of those few who be arrest , the vast majority be charge with nothing more serious than possession of marijuana , not have gun . Hundreds of thousand of innocent people be be stop every year so that the city could arrest ten of thousand for have weed . Applied almost exclusively to minority , the tactic in New York become an elephantine government project that waste time and money , degrade both to the personhood of the men and woman who be stop and to the professionalism of the people do the stopping . It be poor social hygiene , not defensible a a matter of law or a effective law and order . As Mr. Trump say , it be `` tremendous beyond belief. `` Just so .  \n",

Its director , Peter Bray , decline to speak about the man who have suddenly usurped Lena Dunham a the nabe s most famous inhabitant.Comey say in his testimony that he decide to give the content of his Trump memo to his good friend to leak to the press after President Trump tweet out about possible take of their conversation . Comey also say of leak the memo , I think it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel . Via : NYPWho know the FBI Director be a leaker ! This be too much ! Our intel community have become so politicized that it prohibit them from follow the law or even focus on gutting to the truth ! During testimony today , Susan Collins ask if Comey ever share memo from President Trump : COMEY S RESPONSE WAS A SHOCKER . HE SAID HE FELT HE NEEDED TO GET THAT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC SQUARE SO HE ASKED A FRIEND TO SHARE THE MEMO WITH A REPORTER : The person that Comey give the memo to be a former classmate from Columbia Law School . He be consider to be a and adviser to Comey . Daniel Richman be in the video below and be a rather interesting guy . The video be date but be mean to give you an idea of the character of this friend and adviser to the former FBI Director.Comey state : James Comey leak detail of his conversation with _USER_ to friend and confidant Daniel Richman.Does this man look sane to you ? _URL_ Josh Caplan June 8 , 2017 Does this man look sane to you ? _URL_ Josh Caplan June 8 , 2017  \n",
