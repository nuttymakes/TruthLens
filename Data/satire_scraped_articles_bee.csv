Wife Unaware That Movie Will Answer All Her Questions If She Just Pays Attention,"SANDUSKY, CO - Steve and Leslie Hendrickson were having movie night last week but the experience was diminished by Leslie's constant question-asking, reports Steve. ""I don't think she realizes that every question she asks is literally going to be answered by the movie if she just watches it,"" Steve recalled. ""Like, that's what stories do. They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this."" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims. That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included: ""Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?"" ""Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good."" ""Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?"" ""What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?"" ""Is that big rock going to smoosh him?"" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. ""What we need is better education,"" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. ""Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying."" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. ""I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,"" Steve said. ""Things are going great."" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing ofGilmore Girls.",The Babylon Bee,2019-08-19,Life,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/wife-unaware-that-movie-will-answer-all-her-questions-if-she-just-pays-attention
Powerful: LeBron James Pulls Over To Lecture Homeless Man On His White Privilege,"LOS ANGELES, CA - We all know LeBron James is an amazing human being, but seriously. Just when we thought he couldn't get any better, local media caught this powerful moment and WE CAN'T EVEN. Cameras caught the inspiring, heartwarming moment LeBron approached a homeless man last week at one of LA's many tent cities. According to sources, the homeless man held out his hand to LeBron's approaching car to ask for some spare change. What happened next gives us faith in humanity again. The world-famous NBA player looked at the poor man's outstretched hand. Smiling kindly he said, ""Silver and gold have I none, but in the name of #BlackLivesMatter, I offer you the gift of social enlightenment!"" LeBron James then proceeded to lecture the lucky panhandler on his white privilege, offering helpful ways to ""be better"" in the future. ""I was shocked,"" said Mike ""CrazyEyes"" McCluckerson, the homeless Marine Corps vet after LeBron's helpful exhortation. ""I was raised by a family of possums under an abandoned bridge, but I had no idea how many advantages my whiteness had given me in life. Furthermore, Mr. James illuminated a host of unconscious biases I harbored in my heart without even knowing it. This moment marks a turning point in my never-ending journey to relinquish the mantle of privilege Western colonialism has afforded me."" Mr. McCluckerson then offered Lebron James his scarf as a token of thanks. James didn't have any cash to offer the homeless man, but he did make a $100 donation to Black Lives Matter in his name. What a BEAUTIFUL gesture. Go, LeBron!",The Babylon Bee,2020-07-01,Celebs,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/powerful-lebron-james-pulls-over-to-lecture-homeless-man-on-his-white-privilege
CNN Publishes Real News Story For April Fools' Day,"ATLANTA, GA - Fooling thousands of readers in a prank that the cable news organization said was ""just for fun,"" CNN published a real news story for April Fools' Day this year. The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn't cite shaky ""anonymous sources"" and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up. ""I was reading this story, and I was like, 'Wait, what is this?'"" said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. ""They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I'd been duped. A classic gag!"" ""Those little rascals!"" he added, shaking his head and laughing goodnaturedly.

Fisher-Price Releases 'My First Peaceful Protest' Playset With House You Can Actually Burn Down,"EAST AURORA, NY - The toy geniuses at Fisher-Price have announced a brand new toy made just for leftist parents and their kids: the My First Peaceful Protest playset. The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met. ""Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,"" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. ""We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met."" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. ""We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,"" said Flufferton, ""but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.""",The Babylon Bee,2020-09-21,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/fisher-price-introduces-supreme-court-protest-playhouse-that-can-be-vandalized-and-burned-down

Everyone, that is, except CNN, who quickly searched through the dog's internet history and college yearbooks. Sure enough, CNN found a picture of the Hero Dog partying at obedience school. In the picture, the dog is seen sniffing a butt without consent. ""Oh yeah, good old [redacted]?

Democrats Warn We Shouldn’t Reopen The Country Until We Can Be Safe From Trump Getting Credit For A Good Economy,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - While President Trump and some Republican governors are pushing to reopen the country soon, Democrats are much more cautious as they see a looming disaster if America ends the shutdown early: Trump getting credit for a growing economy. ""Right now, we have record joblessness, and GDP is certainly going to take a huge hit,"" said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. ""That's exactly what you want in an election year when you're running against an incumbent. If we reverse that too soon, we're basically helping Trump's reelection."" ""If we reopen now, it could be an absolute disaster,"" added Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""We could have people in November saying, 'Wow. Things are getting better. Trump is doing a great job.' It's hard to imagine anything worse than that."" Pelosi and Schumer said that ""out of an abundance of caution,"" they need to wait to make sure things stay pretty bad until after the election, as that will be the only way to stave off another Trump term. ""Oh, and I guess if we reopen things too soon,"" Schumer added as an afterthought, ""it could also lead to a resurgence of people dying.""

Least Masculine Society In Human History Decides Masculinity Is A Growing Threat,"U.S. - As society becomes increasingly dominated by nerds, hipsters, and computer programmers, people have fixated on what they think is our biggest problem: masculinity. ""It's just toxic and causes nothing but problems,"" said Elisha Mcewen, a vegan activist and no threat whatsoever to spiders or tight jar lids. ""I was sharing my feelings on masculinity with other men in my drum circle, and we all agreed that if we ever encountered masculinity, we would run far away."" Masculinity is said to have in the past been the cause of such things as violence, war, bullying, defeating the Nazis, carving society out of untamed wilderness, and landing men on the moon, but now masculinity is being driven out of society to make sure nothing like those things ever happens again. However, there are reports that masculinity still lurks out there, which is a source of anxiety to modern men and causes them to have upset tummies. ""I am just so worried that somewhere out there someone is still knowingly producing testosterone,"" said Wyatt Lockhart, a Twitch streamer who had never thrown a punch outside of a video game. ""I constantly have to find a safe place to calm down just thinking about it."" Duke Miller, a Marine sergeant and one of the few remaining examples of traditional masculinity, was asked about his feelings on the negative view of masculinity, but he seemed confused by the word ""feelings"" and then punched out an elk just because.",The Babylon Bee,2019-01-17,Worldviews,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/least-masculine-society-in-human-history-decides-masculinity-is-a-growing-threat

Embarrassed Trump Realizes He’s Had Russia And Ukraine Confused This Entire Time,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The new presidential administration experienced a rare public relations gaffe, as an embarrassed President Donald Trump realized that he's had Russia and Ukraine confused this entire time. The mistake was eventually discovered by a White House aide, who began to ask questions after the president had made public assertions that Ukraine was responsible for starting the war. Upon further investigation, the aide privately notified Trump that he had the two countries mixed up. ""They're the other way around, from what I understand,"" Trump told reporters at an impromptu press conference in the Oval Office. ""The country that started the war by invading the other was apparently Russia. It's easy to get the two confused, honestly. They're right next to each other. And cold winters. So very cold. I thought that little Zelenskyy guy was from Russia this whole time. He sounds Russian."" An administration insider said Trump's realization of the mix-up could potentially change the entire outlook for peace talks. ""It's kind of a major difference,"" the source said. ""He was taking such a hardline stance against Ukraine because he thought they started the war when Russia did the invading. We had to get out a big map and show him that Russia was actually the big one and Ukraine was the little one. It's ok, he's got it figured out now.""

Trump made the announcement to a gathering of reporters in the Oval Office Thursday morning and marked the historic occasion by sitting down to enjoy the ceremonial First Second Breakfast in White House history. ""We love our toast and jam, don't we folks?"" Trump said as an aide laid out the second breakfast spread on the Resolute Desk. ""Every American family should sit down for Second Breakfast on a daily basis. It's the second version of the most important meal of the day, which means it's just as important as First Breakfast, which is delicious. You can never have too much bacon. And pastries, so many very beautiful pastries. With filling. Always with filling."" Insiders said the executive order would extend to federal agencies and government-funded schools nationwide, mandating an official break to allow employees and students to partake in second breakfasts to hold them over until lunch. ""This is part of President Trump's even larger, overarching agenda,"" said one administration source. ""This is only the beginning. By 2028, our goal is to have Americans eating the full slate of seven Hobbit meals."" Administration officials refused to comment on reports that an additional executive order mandating elevensies was being targeted for the fall.

Judge Dismisses Sexual Assault Allegations Against Biden On Grounds That He Is Not A Republican,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden was cleared in federal court today of charges that some claimed were based upon credible allegations of sexual assault when the judge quickly realized that Joe Biden was not a Republican. ""Well, this looks pretty serious... let's see who is on - wait a minute. He's a Democrat! I can find no fault with him,"" declared a fourth circuit federal judge hearing preliminary claims. ""It is well established in this court that Republicans are the ones who want to silence women and control their bodies.

The bailiff immediately grabbed the female accuser by the collar and threw her up into the air out onto the sidewalk, just like in the cartoons.

Several other people had corroborated key details relating to the seriousness and timing of the intern's story including a discovered CNN clip of her mother callingThe Larry King Showand a neighbor confirming that the woman had told her at the time what had happened. However, this circumstantial evidence of vile behavior, even interpreted under the generous standard of ""believe all women"" set by the government in prior cases involving Republicans, was declared to only be valid if the alleged perpetrator was a greedy, evil Republican.

Large Turnout At Memorial For Hans Gruber Who Was Thrown From A Building By A Police Officer,"LOS ANGELES, CA - A huge crowd turned out Sunday for the Hans Gruber memorial service. Gruber was the victim of police violence, having been thrown from Nakatomi Plaza by police officer John McClane, which many consider one of the most excessive uses of force ever witnessed. After the incident, there were protests all week, and now thousands from all over the country came to pay respects to Gruber, widely described as an ""intelligent and witty soul."" ""That man was a hero,"" said Doyle Graham, who traveled from Nevada to pay respects. ""I mean, I don't really know much about him other than that some police officer killed him, but he seems like someone we should all honor and emulate."" Gruber was part of a mainly peaceful protest against the Nakatomi Corporation, which was goaded into violence by the actions of McClane. Ultimately, McClane threw Gruber from the 30th floor, even though Gruber was completely unarmed (or at least he was when he hit the ground). Even LAPD Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson denounced the actions, calling McClane a ""nutcase"" who should have ""just stayed put."" Many at the memorial are now wearing shirts with ""Gruber"" written on them to remember the man who was taken too soon thanks to unaccountable police actions. There are calls for the arrest of John McClane, including from Hans Gruber's brother, Simon, who vows to do something about him.",The Babylon Bee,2020-08-31,U.S.,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/large-turnout-for-memorial-for-hans-gruber-who-was-thrown-from-a-building-by-a-police-officer
Joel Osteen Tests Negative For Christianity,"HOUSTON, TX - On a video posted to his Facebook page Thursday, a relieved Joel Osteen announced that he's tested negative for biblically faithful Christianity. A nervous Osteen had accidentally come into contact with the Bible several days prior and feared he had contracted the gospel. ""I'm relieved to announce that I'm 100% gospel-free,"" the smiling pastor said. He'd been quarantining himself from friends and family for a few days just in case he was gospel-positive, not wanting the gospel to spread to anyone else. ""My hand had briefly brushed against the Bible, as I thought it was one of my books. We've disposed of it, of course, and I've notified all the people I've come into contact with since then so they could quarantine."" ""I'm just glad I'm still safe from the truth that I'm a hopeless sinner in need of a savior.""

Genius Trump Nominates Joe Biden To Supreme Court Forcing Dems To Accuse Him Of Sexual Assault,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Trump has announced his pick for Supreme Court justice: Joe Biden. By nominating Biden, Trump has forced the Dems' hands, making them believe the sexual assault claims and allegations of inappropriate, creepy behavior against the former vice president. The ""4D chess"" move forced Dems to immediately accuse Joe Biden of sexual assault and reverse their position on the current claims against him. ""We now believe Tara Reade,"" said a somber Kamala Harris, ""and we will do everything in our power to destroy this man's life."" In addition to believing current claims against Joe Biden, Democrats also immediately dug up 417 new accusers against Joe Biden. He has been accused of participating in wild frat parties, drunken keggers, and something called the ""Devil's Triangle,"" which Dems say is either a Satanic ritual or code for a sexual practice or ""maybe both."" ""It's clear this man is dangerous and cannot be trusted,"" said Nancy Pelosi. ""We call on the Senate to turn down his nomination and run him out of public life."" Biden released a statement, saying, ""I just want to go home and see my grandkids again.""

"Compassionate, Merciful U.S. Lets Canada Win One","BOSTON, MA -- In a surprising show of benevolence, the compassionate and merciful USA hockey team allowed Team Canada to defeat them in the finals of the 4 Nations Face-Off. The Americans collectively decided that they had had enough winning and wanted to let their downtrodden neighbors to the north pick up a rare victory. ""We just thought they could use a win,"" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. ""It was kind of fun actually. It was like playing in the pee-wee league where you pull back so the other team's parents can take a turn being proud of their kids."" The exciting final match of the 4 Nations Face-Off Championship ended in overtime when American players backed away to allow Canadian Connor McDavid to score the game-winning goal. It was a remarkable achievement for the Canadian team, made only slightly less meaningful when they later discovered that America had let them win. ""I was a fool to think we beat them fair and square,"" McDavid said during the postgame press conference. ""But it feels good anyway, eh? Thank you, Team USA. What a class act, eh?"" Team USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck recounted the fear he felt during the third period when Team Canada scored zero goals. ""We stopped trying to score during the third period. Canada wasn't throwing anything at me. I was almost afraid we were going to win by accident."" At publishing time, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a fool of himself by gloating over the win on X, not yet having realized that Team USA lost on purpose.

""Isn't that right, sweetie?"" he said to a young girl in the front row of the crowd, asking her to come up and stand on the stage while he put his hands on her shoulders for the duration of the speech. Biden then went on to slam Trump for his treatment of women, confident in the knowledge that no one in the Democratic Party would dare call him out for being a hypocritical little creep.

In a candid moment, Outlaw (seriously, her actual name) said there was just nothing the police could do, as they'd need to have some kind of organized, armed force specifically created to protect and serve the people. ""Like, what if we took money from everyone to fund a force that could then defend them in a time of need?"" she pondered aloud. ""They could have patrol cars, firearms, and attack dogs.

Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary."" ""I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?"" she added wistfully.

""Everyone there has the same quantity of possessions and food,"" said one marcher. ""Everyone makes millions of dollars, and very few people work. It's a real paradise."" The refugees have complex motivations, but the vast majority simply want to see everything socialism has to offer after suffering the amazing benefits of capitalism for too long.

Cruel: Elon Musk Cuts Off Social Security Benefits For Thousands Of Revolutionary War Veterans,"U.S. -- The Department of Government Efficiency faced renewed calls for independent oversight after news broke that DOGE boss Elon Musk had callously cut off Social Security benefits for thousands of Revolutionary War veterans. The move took place as part of DOGE's overarching crusade to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending but promised to bring the Musk-led team a new wave of negative publicity due to brave veterans of the American War of Independence now being deprived of their hard-fought benefits. ""How dare he take away the benefits we earned with our blood,"" said 270-year-old Arthur Breckenridge, who fought in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. ""It's only because of men like me that this South African fellow had a chance to come to this country and enjoy the fruits of our labor. Now we find out he's cutting off our Social Security? How are we supposed to live?"" Though Musk and the team at DOGE cited Social Security payments to individuals seemingly far too old to still be living as evidence of widespread fraud, Breckenridge and his fellow Revolutionary War veterans were not going to accept this indignity. ""This billionaire miscreant leaves us no choice,"" said Thomas Halderman, a 278-year-old veteran of the Battle of Saratoga. ""We shall grab our muskets and march to Tesla headquarters. Have at thee, you thieving scoundrel!""

""If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,"" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear.

Recently Pardoned Turkey Found Dead After Claiming To Have Dirt On Hillary Clinton,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - A turkey recently pardoned by President Trump was found dead after claiming to have dirt on the Clintons, sources at the FBI confirmed today. The official cause of death was suicide, though the bullet wounds were in the back of the turkey's head and the bird lacked opposable thumbs with which to operate a firearm. The turkey had been publicly pardoned for the crime of being delicious and set free by Trump in a popular White House Thanksgiving tradition. Shortly after being released, the turkey confirmed its possession of ""credible"" information that would lead to the indictment of Hillary Clinton, posting on the bird's social media account that it was a good thing Trump had pardoned the turkey, so the world could find the truth out about the Clintons. Metro police discovered the turkey's body later, shot twice in the back of the head and stabbed in the back.

The failed presidential candidate lunged across the cart and attempted to pull off her face mask, certain the lady was actually Vladimir Putin in a skin suit. When that failed and the woman shooed her off with a plastic glove, Clinton turned for help and began screaming, ""Security! Margaret in the frozen foods aisle is a Russian asset! Help, help, our elections are being meddled with!"" Guards arrived but relaxed when they saw it was just Hillary Clinton. ""OK, lady, let's go,"" they said, grabbing her by each arm.

Cracker Jack Changes Name To More Politically Correct Caucasian Jack,"PLANO, TX -- When ballparks finally open again, those standing for the traditional seventh-inning stretch will be singing some different lyrics to ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame."" After over 100 years of selling its caramel popcorn snack under the name Cracker Jack, Frito-Lay announced today that it would be rebranded as the less offensive ""Caucasian Jack."" ""We are very sorry to all the crack---er, I mean, Caucasians we have hurt over the years,"" said a spokesperson. ""Cracker is an offensive stereotype, and we must make sure that all foods and snack products are culturally sensitive.

The bigotry stops today."" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.

Teachers Urge Government To Reopen Schools Before Students Learn To Think For Themselves,"U.S. - Teachers at government schools have raised their concerns that the recent closure of their institutions will have a damaging effect on students. In particular, the nation's educators are worried that the longer the schools are closed, the more likely it is that students will begin thinking for themselves, learn life skills away from the government school system, and realize how much more they learn at home. ""We must reopen as soon as possible -- before they regain their ability to have independent thoughts,"" said New York 4th-grade teacher Ms. Jenny Mudd. ""This is an urgent crisis. We realize we have to do our part to prevent the spread of the virus, but we must also prevent the spread of unapproved ideas. There's a balance there."" ""Reopen the schools before it is too late."" Sure enough, studies have already shown a strong correlation between everyone being homeschooled and a concerning spike in independent thought. Students who have been away from the government school system for even a week stop feeling depressed and anxious all the time and even show a shocking increase in the ability to form thoughts and ideas not approved by the government. Teachers have further pointed out that parents aren't properly equipped to indoctrinate their children with government propaganda. ""I went to school for eight years to be able to do this,"" said Portland kindergarten teacher Ms. Pinkerton. ""Parents just don't have the experience of stuffing kids' heads full of a statist worldview seven hours a day like I do.""",The Babylon Bee,2020-03-31,Worldviews,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/teachers-warn-parents-arent-properly-equipped-to-indoctrinate-children

Bernie Sanders Praises China For Eradicating Poverty By Killing All The Poor People,"U.S. - Presidential candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders offered words of praise for China's successful reduction of poverty in many parts of the country by killing off all the poor people through government control of the economy. Sanders pointed out that the country has been very successful in eliminating vast swathes of poverty and also the poor. ""America still has a lot of poor people, and that's because we haven't been aggressive in implementing socialist programs that cause mass starvation,"" Sanders said, his fingers flopping around like ten tiny wacky inflatable tube men. ""Firing squads, death camps, breadlines---all of these are humanitarian tools in the arsenal of the government to shoot poverty in the face, and sometimes also the poor in the face, when it's necessary."" The senator also pointed out that poor people, who often own fewer than three homes, don't contribute much to a socialist economy and ""not much is lost"" when these single-home-owners are shot or simply starve to death as the government can't even figure out how to get food to everyone, a problem even bad fast-food restaurants like McDonald's solved decades ago.",The Babylon Bee,2019-08-28,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/bernie-sanders-praises-china-for-eradicating-poverty-by-killing-all-the-poor-people

Walmart Discontinues Auto Part Sales To Prevent Car Accidents,"BENTONVILLE, AR - In a bold move intended to curb the thousands of deaths from vehicles each and every day, Walmart has decided to stop selling auto parts, sources confirmed Tuesday.

"Trump Claimed, Without Evidence, That 2+2 Makes 4. Not So Fast, Experts Say","WASHINGTON, D.C. -- During a morning press conference about the state of the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump suddenly claimed that 2 and 2 added together equaled 4, despite having no evidence whatsoever to back it up. Experts sounded the alarm on the president's bold statement. ""You can't just go around claiming to have the answer to complex math equations without demonstrating how you came to that conclusion,"" said former CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter. ""It is very irresponsible for a commander-in-chief to throw numbers around willy-nilly like this."" Mathematicians said while there are indeed edge cases in which 2 + 2 = 4, making a blanket statement to that effect was irresponsible because it ignores the world of modular arithmetic and abstract algebra where ""2"" can be whatever you want. ""If you decide that 2 is actually 947, then 2 cannot possibly be added to itself to equal 4,"" said respected Harvard mathematician Ivan Schaefer. ""The president is way off base here if he thinks he can simply assert that 2 + 2 = 4 without evidence."" Leading philosopher and actor Terrance Howard, who famously lost his role as War Machine inIron Man 2due to incorrect math, argued that all conventional math is wrong and can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean, which makes Trump not merely incorrect but a dangerous liar. Howard, a self-perceived expert in the fields of arithmetic, philosophy, and biology has gone so far as to argue that Trump may not even exist. ""I've never met Trump,"" Howard said while appearing as a guest onThe Joe Rogan Experience. ""So how am I supposed to take him seriously when he says 2 + 2 = 4 if he won't even meet with me and prove that he's real?"" Trump had yet to respond to the pushback on what he perceived as the basic foundation of mathematics a person learns in preschool.

""He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot.

Trump Proposes Two Golf-Course Solution For Gaza,"GAZA -- A potential breakthrough in the Middle East peace process emerged this week with President Donald Trump proposing a two-golf course solution in Gaza.

Palestinians and Israelis will each have their own segregated course flanking a five-star resort built with wood sourced from the cedars of Lebanon. ""It's a desert out there, an absolute wasteland,"" Trump said. ""So I think people are going to love a little greenery. We're going to have date palms, olive trees, and maybe some tamarisk to give the place a little color. It's really going to be something."" According to a recent poll of Gaza residents, no one is particularly interested in golfing but Trump expressed confidence that that would change. ""When I've had a hard day -- and believe me, I have a lot of them -- I like to hit the links,"" he said. ""No one's going to want to fight anymore when they could be driving balls down the fairway. We're even going to have a gift shop that sells little bumper stickers that say, 'I'd rather be golfing.' It'll be in Arabic or whatever squiggly language they want."" Further sweetening the deal will be over a hundred water hazards. This will reportedly have the benefit of creating a challenge for golfers while also bringing new life to the region. The courses will also be the first in history to have zero sand traps. ""They have enough sand,"" Trump said.

Facebook Memories Remind Man Of His Embarrassing Libertarian Phase,"PLANO, TX -- It was a rough day for Jaxon Creed when he decided to login to Facebook and was instantly reminded by the Memories feature of his totally embarrassing phase of being a stupid libertarian. ""It's been a while since I've logged in to Facebook, I wonder what my friends are up to,"" mused Jaxon as he signed on. ""Huh. 13 years ago? What could this be?"" Instead of a chronological listing of his friend's recent posts, Facebook's algorithm decided that what Jaxon really wanted to see was all the edgy commentary and awkward philosophical screeds he shared in his past days of being an uncompromising libertarian firebrand. ""Oh man, all these images of me holding up protest signs for legalizing sex work and pot are still on here? Ugh. So Cringe."" According to sources, Jaxon was flooded by an entire wall of his political rants where he called for the legalization of machine guns and heroin for children, dismantling the U.S. Military, and the abolishment of all police and civil authorities not fitting into the pure logic of an anarcho-capitalist society. ""Welp, I guess I'll just die now,"" Jaxon said as he shrank back from his screen. ""But it was cute and clever how the Ron Paul rEVOLution sign spelled LOVE backwards I guess.""

Finally: State Department Officially Classifies Los Angeles Dodgers As Terrorist Organization,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- In a long-awaited move that signaled a turning point in the war against evil and lawlessness, the U.S. State Department announced that it had officially classified the Los Angeles Dodgers as a terrorist organization. The decision -- which came after discussion among various government agencies, the White House, and Major League Baseball teams -- finally answered the outcry raised by sports fans and decent human beings for many years, confirming that the Dodgers posed a serious threat to the American way of life. ""They're an evil of such immense scale that we couldn't deny it any longer,"" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio while announcing the move. ""Despite numerous warnings over the years, the Los Angeles Dodgers have failed to turn away from their nefarious acts, leaving the United States with no choice but to classify them as a terrorist organization. Being ruthless and uncivilized has consequences."" Sources within the State Department cited recent developments including the Dodgers' World Series victory and the free agent acquisitions during the ensuing offseason as evidence that the organization's threat to peace and happiness in the U.S. had reached a far more dangerous level. ""Organizations like this will be dealt with accordingly,"" Rubio said. ""It is our duty to protect the game of baseball -- and, indeed, America itself -- from the Los Angeles Dodgers."" Officials said measures used to combat the Dodgers included, but were not limited to, barring the team from traveling outside of California or making any trades.

With tears in their eyes, they joined hands with celebrities and sang John Lennon's 'Imagine' as the massive monuments to white supremacy toppled to the ground.

Government Accidentally Shuts Itself Down With Ban On Non-Essential Businesses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congress has asked all non-essential businesses to limit their hours or close entirely for an undetermined amount of time.

For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. ""Oops,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""We meant non-essentialprivatebusinesses. Of course, the government isalwaysessential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse."" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.

Motorcyclist Who Identifies As Bicyclist Sets Cycling World Record,"NEW YORK, NY - In an inspiring story from the world of professional cycling, a motorcyclist who identifies as a bicyclist has crushed all the regular bicyclists, setting an unbelievable world record. In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. ""Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,"" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. ""Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here."" Banner also said he painted the word ""HUFFY"" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles.

Migrant Caravan Mysteriously Disappears But Leaves Behind Cool Wooden Horse,"U.S./MEXICO BORDER - The migrant caravan headed for the U.S. has been the center of much controversy, but the problem seems to have solved itself, as the entire caravan has mysteriously disappeared. In other, unrelated, good news, there's now a really cool-looking giant wooden horse sitting right at the U.S. border, fresh for the taking. The wooden horse is massive in size -- big enough to fit thousands of people inside if it were hollow (though judging by its weight, the horse is already filled with something). It could make a neat tourist attraction, and President Trump was quick to call dibs on it. ""That's my horse; I saw it first!"" Trump said in a public statement. ""It's the biggest and best horse ever, so obviously it's meant for me. Bring it across the border immediately before someone else takes it!""

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus.

Hollywood Elites Rush To Normalize Pedophilia Before They're All Outed By Epstein Client List,"U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. ""I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,"" said actor and director Rudy Allan, ""but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box."" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. ""The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,"" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. ""At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!"" ""Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,"" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. ""If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!"" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like ""love has no age"" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. ""I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,"" Allan says. ""We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?"" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series calledSix-Year-Old Strippers,and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.",The Babylon Bee,2020-08-21,Worldviews,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/hollywood-rushes-to-make-pedophilia-acceptable-before-theyre-outed-by-ghislaine-maxwell
Pelosi Preemptively Announces Articles Of Impeachment Against Candace Owens,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Only days after delivering Trump's articles of impeachment to the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced they are already working on a brand-new impeachment for rising right-wing menace and future GOP presidential candidate Candace Owens. ""This woman is dangerous, extremely dangerous,"" said Pelosi to reporters. ""She's an outspoken African-American woman who doesn't think the way African-Americans are supposed to think. We must impeach her immediately to prevent her from running and save our democracy! Good morning! Wednesday morning!"" ""This is, like, such a sad day for our country,"" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ""All this time, most of us didn't even think Candace Owens was a real person, but rather a haunting specter from our most terrifying nightmares.

Study Finds Connection Between Believing Russia Rigged 2016 Election And Believing 2020 Election Was Foolproof,"U.S. - A study has found a strong connection between believing Russia rigged the 2016 election and now suddenly believing elections are entirely foolproof, trustworthy, and unhackable. ""It seems that people who screamed about Russia for 4 years now have a 100% chance of encouraging everyone to accept the 2020 election results without question,"" said study head Dr. Rupert Manning. ""It's basically all the way across the board: if you believed that Vladimir Putin somehow hacked voting machines, purchased a bunch of memes, and raised an army of millions of Russian bots to disrupt the election and get Donald Trump elected, you certainly now believe that our elections are completely safe and secure."" The study also found that people who believed the 2016 election was trustworthy and legitimate now believe the 2020 election was completely fixed.",The Babylon Bee,2020-11-17,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/study-finds-people-who-screamed-about-russia-for-last-4-years-have-100-chance-of-now-believing-elections-are-foolproof
Everyone Jumps Off Bridge After New Government Order Telling Everyone To Jump Off Bridge,"U.S. - After state governments across the country directed their citizens to shut down their businesses and just kinda hope things worked out, a new order has been issued: everyone is to jump off a bridge immediately. A government official issued the order to solve our current crisis, and everyone immediately complied. ""Everyone jump off a bridge,"" said a representative of the government. ""OK,"" said everyone. ""If the government says so, it's probably a good idea. Besides, what can we do? It's the government. They definitely have the best people working on it."" The directive was designed to end coronavirus. Medical experts believe it's the best, most effective way to stop the virus. Assuming everyone follows through and obeys the order, coronavirus will be wiped out, according to officials. There are no bad side effects, as far as anyone can tell.

TIME Names Karen Person Of The Year,"NEW YORK, NY - Time's Person of the Year issue has highlighted some of the world's most influential, important, and controversial figures for almost 100 years. After weeks of intense internal deliberation, Time Magazine has officially announced its Person of the Year: Karen. ""Karen could be any of us. She could be all of us,"" said Edward Felsenthal, Editor in Chief of Time. ""For years, we have been under the watchful protection of everyday heroes who are dedicated to righting all wrongs, no matter how tiny or insignificant. Today, that watchful protector has a name, and her name is Karen."" The announcement was met with mixed reactions and fierce debate. Some Karens have celebrated the news as a huge step forward for Karen representation and human rights. Other Karens took issue with the cover photo and demanded to speak to the manager of Time Magazine. Some have questioned Time choosing Karen in 2020 after already choosing Greta Thunberg last year, who is kind of like a ""climate Karen."" Karen will be joining Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Bill Anders, and Hitler as one of the most important and newsworthy people of the last 100 years.

Inspiring: Celebrities Spell Out 'We're All In This Together' With Their Yachts,"MALIBU, CA - Many described the scene as breathtaking or awe-inspiring. Others were so touched they couldn't find the words to communicate how they felt. Most simply wept. No matter how they expressed their emotions, everyone agreed that the scene off the Malibu coast Monday morning was exactly what America needed to get through this pandemic. Celebrities gathered their multi-million-dollar yachts on the waters of the Pacific Ocean and spelled out ""WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER."" ""We're just like you,"" said Ellen DeGeneres on her Instagram as her servants sailed her yacht into position to form the apostrophe. ""Yes, maybe I have a yacht and you've only ever been on the Storybook Canal boats at Disneyland, but still. It's pretty much the same thing."" ""Stay home, save lives -- it's not that hard,"" said Patton Oswalt, whose fleet of yachts made up several of the letters. ""Look, poor people, it's not worth risking your life just to go to Fuddruckers or work a job or whatever it is you peasants do all day."" After the stunt was over, Oswalt had his chauffeur drive him home in his hot tub limousine as he snorted several million dollars' worth of powdered caviar. ""All of humanity is fighting this together and we're all as one,"" said Lady Gaga, who was wearing a bathing suit made out of gold bricks. ""Though, I mean, don't try to get on my yacht.

NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"LOS ANGELES, CA - NBA players are honoring the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week by wearing pretty lace collars just like Notorious RBG used to wear. In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe. According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted ""RBG! RBG! RBG!"" ""Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,"" said LeBron James after the game. ""I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff."" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. ""It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle. Easy."" NBA players are vowing to wear the collars until Trump is removed from office, or until angry rioters burn their basketball arenas down, whichever comes first.",The Babylon Bee,2020-09-22,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/nfl-to-adorn-all-uniforms-with-lace-doilies-in-to-honor-rbg

Trump Envisions Modern Version Of Postal Service Where People Can Send Mail Electronically,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- As rumors swirled that the administration may take over the operation of the post office, President Donald Trump proposed a radical new, modernized version of the U.S. Postal Service where people could send mail electronically. While the bold idea could revolutionize the sending and receiving of correspondence, critics and longtime supporters of the postal service called it outlandish and far-fetched, assuring the public that mailing letters was indispensable. Trump disagreed. ""We'll have a whole new system, folks. Electronic mail, we'll call it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""I've been talking to my friend, Elon Musk. You know Elon? Great guy. Very sharp guy. He told me we can do away with the post office altogether and start sending letters over the internet. It only takes seconds, and there's no paper. Do you believe that? Sending letters without paper. It's amazing the stuff they're doing these days. We'll get in there and fix it and make it better and faster than it's ever been before. Electronic mail. E-mail. Something like that. I don't know, we'll play around with the name."" A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service cautioned the adoption of such a futuristic plan. ""It's way too early to be talking about 'electronic mail,'"" said Postal Supervisor Danny Ball. ""Sending someone a letter invisibly through the 'world wide web?' Communicating with someone on another continent in seconds? That's science fiction stuff. Your paper, your envelope, and your stamps. That's where it's at. Please don't abolish us."" At publishing time, the American Postal Workers Union warned that its mailmen would refuse to make everyone's daily deliveries of useless coupons and advertisements if Trump tried to follow through with his plan. An elite force from DOGE uncovers the most absurd waste of taxpayer dollars.",The Babylon Bee,2025-02-21,U.S.,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/trump-envisions-modern-version-of-postal-service-where-people-can-send-mail-electronically
