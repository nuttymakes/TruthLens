Trump: 'I Have Done More For Christianity Than Jesus',"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In response to the Christianity Today editorial calling for his removal, Trump called the magazine a ""left-wing rag"" and said, ""I have done more for Christianity than Jesus."" ""I mean, the name of the magazine is Christianity Today, and who is doing more for Christians today? Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals."" While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. ""I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,"" Trump stated. ""How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it."" Furthermore, Trump asserted that he ""saved Christmas."" ""Look what I've done,"" he said. ""You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

Senate To Be Replaced With Room Full Of Monkeys Throwing Feces,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In an emergency, overnight referendum, the American people voted on Thursday to replace the United States Senate with a room full of monkeys throwing feces. The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats. ""About 100 people"" voted for the current Senators to keep their jobs, with this tiny voting bloc centered in Washington, D.C. Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  ""It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,"" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. ""No more 10-12 hour hearings. With these monkeys, all the fecal projectiles will have been flung in under 30 minutes. One and done.""

Motorcyclist Who Identifies As Bicyclist Sets Cycling World Record,"NEW YORK, NY - In an inspiring story from the world of professional cycling, a motorcyclist who identifies as a bicyclist has crushed all the regular bicyclists, setting an unbelievable world record. In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. ""Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,"" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. ""Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here."" Banner also said he painted the word ""HUFFY"" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.",The Babylon Bee,2019-10-25,Sports,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/motorcycle-that-identifies-as-bicycle-sets-world-cycling-record
Trump Announces He Has Hidden 5 Golden Tickets Among Stimulus Checks,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Trump has built up a lot of buzz over the coming stimulus payments, saying he has hidden five golden tickets among the checks heading to Americans this week. Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago.

NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"LOS ANGELES, CA - NBA players are honoring the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week by wearing pretty lace collars just like Notorious RBG used to wear.

RBG!""  ""Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,"" said LeBron James after the game. ""I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge.

"In Bold Anti-Trump Statement, Pelosi Rips Up Bible","WASHINGTON, D.C. - In a bold, powerful statement to oppose Trump, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi solemnly tore up the Bible after Trump was seen holding one up in front of a church. At a press conference, the Speaker of the House held up a Bible and then ripped it in two, declaring that she was against anything Trump was associated with. ""If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,"" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear.

Biden Cuts Hole In Mask So He Can Still Sniff People's Hair,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Joe Biden has committed to wearing a mask in public to be a good example and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. ""That's better,"" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. ""Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus."" ""Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire. Vote for Joe!""

Man Identifying As 6-Year-Old Crushes Game-Winning Homer In Tee-Ball Championship,"AUBURN, CA - Local 36-year-old man Nate Ripley, who identifies as a six-year-old, ""absolutely crushed"" a game-winning homer at a local tee-ball game and won the championship for his team Monday evening, reports confirmed. Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, ""Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!"" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. ""I'm just proud to be here with my team. It's all for the love of the game,"" an emotional Ripley told reporters while enjoying an orange slice and juice box after the championship.

Fisher-Price Releases 'My First Peaceful Protest' Playset With House You Can Actually Burn Down,"EAST AURORA, NY - The toy geniuses at Fisher-Price have announced a brand new toy made just for leftist parents and their kids: the My First Peaceful Protest playset. The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  ""Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,"" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. ""We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met."" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. ""We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,"" said Flufferton, ""but selling them isn't the point.

Cracker Jack Changes Name To More Politically Correct Caucasian Jack,"PLANO, TX — When ballparks finally open again, those standing for the traditional seventh-inning stretch will be singing some different lyrics to ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame.""

""We are very sorry to all the crack---er, I mean, Caucasians we have hurt over the years,"" said a spokesperson.

The bigotry stops today."" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.

Joel Osteen Tests Negative For Christianity,"HOUSTON, TX - On a video posted to his Facebook page Thursday, a relieved Joel Osteen announced that he's tested negative for biblically faithful Christianity. A nervous Osteen had accidentally come into contact with the Bible several days prior and feared he had contracted the gospel. ""I'm relieved to announce that I'm 100% gospel-free,"" the smiling pastor said. He'd been quarantining himself from friends and family for a few days just in case he was gospel-positive, not wanting the gospel to spread to anyone else. ""My hand had briefly brushed against the Bible, as I thought it was one of my books. We've disposed of it, of course, and I've notified all the people I've come into contact with since then so they could quarantine."" ""I'm just glad I'm still safe from the truth that I'm a hopeless sinner in need of a savior."" Osteen has, however, tested positive for a novel prosperity gospel virus -- a new but still very deadly mutation of an ancient heresy.",The Babylon Bee,2020-03-26,Celebs,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/joel-osteen-tests-positive-for-heresy
Caravan Of Liberal Americans Makes Way Toward Socialist Paradise Of Venezuela,"MEXICO - A migrant caravan full of leftists desiring to enter the socialist paradise of Venezuela departed the United States Thursday and began marching toward the country through Mexico, stating they will demand asylum so they might experience the far better life that socialism offers. The migrants claim they are leaving America because of its high standards of living, strong economy, and record employment numbers, and hope to find a better life in Venezuela's much more equitable system. ""Everyone there has the same quantity of possessions and food,"" said one marcher. ""Everyone makes millions of dollars, and very few people work. It's a real paradise."" The refugees have complex motivations, but the vast majority simply want to see everything socialism has to offer after suffering the amazing benefits of capitalism for too long. Caravan organizers dispelled rumors that they were funded by Bernie Sanders, claiming the caravan was an organic grassroots movement.

"In Genius Move, Trump Supports Impeachment, Forcing Democrats To Oppose","WASHINGTON, D.C. - The impeachment hearings have been thrown into chaos after President Trump announced that he supports impeachment, forcing Democrats to oppose their own impeachment inquiry.

""And Joker is alt-right propaganda,"" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year.

The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn't cite shaky ""anonymous sources"" and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever.

Government Accidentally Shuts Itself Down With Ban On Non-Essential Businesses,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congress has asked all non-essential businesses to limit their hours or close entirely for an undetermined amount of time. But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. ""Oops,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell. ""We meant non-essential private businesses. Of course, the government is always essential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse."" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she would have caught the mistake but had passed the ban in a hurry, saying, ""We had to pass the ban to see what it did.""",The Babylon Bee,2020-03-26,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/government-accidentally-shuts-itself-down-with-ban-on-non-essential-businesses
Wife Unaware That Movie Will Answer All Her Questions If She Just Pays Attention,"SANDUSKY, CO - Steve and Leslie Hendrickson were having movie night last week but the experience was diminished by Leslie's constant question-asking, reports Steve. ""I don't think she realizes that every question she asks is literally going to be answered by the movie if she just watches it,"" Steve recalled. ""Like, that's what stories do. They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this."" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims.  That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included:  ""Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?"" ""Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good."" ""Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?"" ""What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?"" ""Is that big rock going to smoosh him?"" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. ""What we need is better education,"" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. ""Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying."" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them.

Sanders continued his long-winded rant about the need for the government to own the means of production, how great breadlines are, and how bad things are in capitalist America as protesters got dragged away by police to be disappeared. ""Just think---in America, we have to pick between 14 different types of deodorant!"" he said, his fingers flopping around like limp sausages.  According to sources, Beto O'Rourke is planning on joining Sanders to inform Chinese citizens how lucky they are that they don't live in a racist country like America.",The Babylon Bee,2019-08-19,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/bernie-sanders-arrives-in-hong-kong-to-lecture-protesters-on-how-good-they-have-it-under-communism

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going.

""Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,"" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter.

In a candid moment, Outlaw (seriously, her actual name) said there was just nothing the police could do, as they'd need to have some kind of organized, armed force specifically created to protect and serve the people. ""Like, what if we took money from everyone to fund a force that could then defend them in a time of need?"" she pondered aloud. ""They could have patrol cars, firearms, and attack dogs.

""I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?"" she added wistfully.

Hollywood Elites Rush To Normalize Pedophilia Before They're All Outed By Epstein Client List,"U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. ""I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,"" said actor and director Rudy Allan, ""but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box."" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. ""The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,"" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. ""At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!"" ""Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,"" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. ""If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!"" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like ""love has no age"" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. ""I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,"" Allan says. ""We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?"" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.",The Babylon Bee,2020-08-21,Worldviews,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/hollywood-rushes-to-make-pedophilia-acceptable-before-theyre-outed-by-ghislaine-maxwell

""Water's tremendous, very powerful stuff,"" he said. ""You won't believe the things they can do with water. Water balloons. Water slides. Water beds. It's amazing. You can freeze it and make ice, I'm told. Ice is great for lots of things. Ice cream. Ice cubes. Igloos."" ""Anyway, drink water."" Horrified journalists scrambled to warn Americans not to drown themselves in their pools and bathtubs. ""Trump says water is good -- but this is very misleading,"" said Rachel Maddow. ""Did you know that water kills many people every year? These dangerous, unhinged remarks from the president could cause many to drown themselves. Plus, do you know what's hidden in water? Sharks. This president wants you to die from a shark attack!"" Representatives for various bottled water companies quickly released a statement distancing themselves from the president's remarks and warning everyone not to submerge themselves in the ocean for minutes at a time.",The Babylon Bee,2020-04-24,Politics,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/trump-says-to-drink-lots-of-water-media-reports-as-deranged-trump-tells-everyone-to-drown-themselves
Starbucks Unveils New Satanic Holiday Cups,"SEATTLE, WA - Starbucks Corporation has unveiled its annual holiday design for the 2017 Christmas season, and it features a prominent inverted Satanic pentacle. ""It is our company's mission to destroy Christianity,"" Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a press conference as he showed off the new design. ""We would like to see the dark lord Satan's designs for this nation carried out, beginning with a holiday cup proclaiming our allegiance to the Prince of Darkness."" ""All hail Lucifer! All hail Lucifer!"" Schultz declared, chanting in unison with Starbucks employees gathered at the press event. Christian groups expressed concern over the new design, but many believers were reportedly relieved that Starbucks was not promoting something like unity or tolerance with this year's cup design. Schultz ended the press conference by announcing that variant designs would be introduced throughout the holiday season depicting the number of the beast as well as quotes from prominent atheists and other anti-Christian personalities.",The Babylon Bee,2016-11-03,U.S.,Satire,https://babylonbee.com/news/starbucks-unveils-new-satanic-holiday-cups
Bill Clinton: 'Allegations Of Sexual Misconduct Should Disqualify A Man From Public Office',"WASHINGTON, D.C. - In the midst of Judge Kavanaugh's ongoing confirmation process, Bill Clinton offered a few words in order to discourage the Senate from confirming the man to the Supreme Court, claiming that ""allegations of sexual misconduct should disqualify a man from public office."" Speaking to an interviewer on MSNBC, Clinton came out swinging, stating in no uncertain terms that ""any single allegation of sexual misconduct should immediately call into question a man's ability to help lead a nation.""  ""How can you trust somebody who has some accusations against them?"" he said thoughtfully. ""I know for my part, if a judge or president had even a single allegation - let alone several credible ones - I wouldn't want that person to be representing our entire country. It just wouldn't make any sense.""
