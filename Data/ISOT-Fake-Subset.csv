 Snowflake Trump Demands An Apology From The Media And The Internet Laughs At Him,"Donald Trump went on a whining rant about the media on Tuesday morning and got totally humiliated.As he usually does, Trump woke up and immediately took to Twitter to attack Democrats, the courts, and the media.He accused Democrats of being obstructionists and once again declared that the Affordable Care Act is in a  death spiral,  a spiral he himself caused by attacking the law through executive orders.Trump also bitched about the 9th Circuit Court blocking his Muslim ban.But he saved most of his vitriol for the media.The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty.

 Trump Displays Incredible Ignorance Yet Again — Claims Credit For Term Coined Over A Hundred Years Ago,"Have you ever wondered where a phrase started? How about the phrase  prime the pump?  It is widely considered to mean the use of government money to get a project going. While it dates back to the 1800s, President Donald Trump is now claiming that he invented the phrase. In reality, the use of the phrase  prime the pump  predates Trump s own birth by a hundred years, and the use of it in the current economic sense has existed since the 1930s.In a recent conversation with The Economist, this exchange happened (they were talking about Trump s tax plan):The Economist: But beyond that it s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit? Trump: It is OK, because it won t increase it for long. You may have two years where you ll you understand the expression  prime the pump ? The Economist: Yes. Trump: We have to prime the pump. The Economist: It s very Keynesian. Trump: We re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event? The Economist: Priming the pump? Trump: Yeah, have you heard it? The Economist: Yes. Trump: Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven t heard it. I mean, I just I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It s what you have to do.According to The Free Dictionary:Prime the Pump: Encourage the growth or action of something, as in  Marjorie tried to prime the pump by offering some new issues for discussion.  In the late 1800s this expression originally was used for pouring liquid into a pump to expel the air and make it work. In the 1930s it was applied to government efforts to stimulate the economy and thereafter was applied to other undertakings.It is hardly surprising that a) Trump had never heard this phrase, as it is rarely used on Twitter and b) he would take credit for it. In a week with so many gaffes, lies and just strange behavior, this may not be as big an issue but it s clear how little this man knows and how little he understands the world and reality that the rest of us live in. Another explanation could be that Trump is much, much older than we have been led to believe and has gone completely senile.Featured image via Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2017"
" Obama Tells Dems: This Is As Important As Hillary Vs Bernie, And You’re Blowing It!","Speaking to Democrats at a fundraiser at actor Tobey Maguire s house in California, President Obama issued a warning to his party that in addition to their focus on the presidential race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, they desperately need to think about moving Congress out of Republican hands and back towards the Democrats.President Obama collected more than $1 million for his party s House and Senate candidates from Hollywood s Democratic elite Thursday and Friday, and left his deep-pocketed backers with what he termed a  professorial  lecture on the importance of recapturing Congress.Obama also told supporters that he would not be making an endorsement yet in the presidential contest (incumbent presidents usually wait until the party has chosen a successor in order to make a formal announcement). And he joked that he and his staff were too tired to run for a third term, even if he could.At another fundraiser, Obama pointed out that getting Democrats back in charge of Congress is very important.On Thursday night, Obama attended a large gathering at the Bel Air mansion of Disney Chairman Alan Horn and his environmentalist wife, Cindy. There, the president stressed the importance of  recognizing the enormous power of Congress and the difference between a Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House and a Paul Ryan being Speaker of the House. The President also highlighted the GOP blockade of Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, even though Garland has received praise from across the political spectrum. And he pointed out that the blockade would be eroded with more Democratic votes in the Senate since,  What we ve seen out of the Republicans in the Senate is not simply a refusal to confirm him thus far, but a refusal to meet with him or to have a hearing, or to have a vote. Obama went on to point out that crazed statements from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have also helped to expose some of the extremism that happens every day in the House and Senate from Republicans, saying,  People act as if these folks are outliers. But they re not. The President said widespread coverage of their speeches and statements could help to motivate voters.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 8, 2016"
 Ben Carson: Homeless Shelters Shouldn’t Be “Comfortable” Because People Might “Stay”,"If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration. As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising   but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.  But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say. He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them. The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people  a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say:  I ll just stay here. They will take care of me. It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word  compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit. Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami. While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves. Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",News,"May 3, 2017"
RACIST OPRAH MAKES SAME MISTAKE…TWICE,"Just remember, the woman who believes Hillary is the best candidate for the job because she has a vagina, is the same person who thought America needed the first Black President to bring us together  Never mind that the only thing keeping Hillary from spending the next two decades in jail is the  first black President  Oprah endorsed 8 years ago.Oprah Winfrey is throwing her support behind Hillary Clinton.Winfrey spoke with ET s Nancy O Dell at the premiere of her new OWN drama, Greenleaf, and the media mogul opened up about the possibility of America electing its first female president. I really believe that is going to happen,  said Winfrey, 62.  It s about time that we make that decision. Regardless of your politics, it s a seminal moment for women,  she continued.  What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom! It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world. I m with her,  Oprah added, touting Clinton s campaign slogan and effectively endorsing the former Secretary of State.

SAY “HELLO” TO YOUR NEW NEIGHBORS! Clooney Begged For Open Borders…Now Massive Refugee Camp Is Erected In His Front Yard,"Karma it s a beautiful thing A massive makeshift refugee camp has been established in Lake Como, the popular and secluded celebrity hideaway in Italy where Hollywood A-lister George Clooney keeps a home.The migration of hundreds of people from Arab nations, Africa, and Asia was triggered following the Swiss government s decision to close its southern border with Italy.Now, waiting for smugglers to lead them into northern Europe, groups of migrants are camping out in tattered tents around the Lake Como resort.https://twitter.com/ScatterBrainPOD/status/753134667490930688Flimsy dwellings, clothes and trash are scattered around the Northern Italian town s railway station, where dozens of new families and refugees have flocked.https://twitter.com/PatriceArnold25/status/753183423573794825The migrant camp is, oddly enough, just steps away from the front door of immigration activists  George and Amal Clooney s multi-million dollar lakeside mansion in Lake Como, according to the Daily Mail.The power couple has spent some time talking about the migrant crisis. The Clooneys met privately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in February and praised and thanked her for her leadership during the crisis.The Clooneys have taken refuge from the Hollywood spotlight in their summer home in Italy for years.

"Trump Bares Himself at UNGA, “In a Kind of Neocon Full Monte”"," President Trump speaking at the UNGA. (Photo: Screenshot)Robert Parry Consortium NewsIn discussing President Trump, there is always the soft prejudice of low expectations   people praise him for reading from a Teleprompter even if his words make little sense   but there is no getting around the reality that his maiden address to the United Nations General Assembly must rank as  one of the most embarrassing moments in America s relations with the global community.Trump offered a crude patchwork of propaganda and bluster, partly delivered as a campaign speech praising his own leadership   boasting about the relatively strong U.S. economy that he mostly inherited from President Obama   and partly reflecting his continued subservience to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.However, perhaps most importantly, Trump s speech may have extinguished any flickering hope that his presidency might achieve some valuable course corrections in how the United States deals with the world, i.e., shifting away from the disastrous war/interventionist policies of his two predecessors.Before the speech, there was at least some thinking that his visceral disdain for the neoconservatives, who mostly opposed his nomination and election, might lead him to a realization that their policies toward Iran, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere were at the core of America s repeated and costly failures in recent decades.Instead, apparently after a bracing lecture from Netanyahu on Monday, Trump bared himself in a kind of neocon Full Monte: He repeated the Israeli/neocon tripe about Iran destabilizing the Middle East when Shiite-ruled Iran actually has helped stabilize Iraq and Syria against Sunni terrorist groups and other militants supported by Saudi Arabia and   to a degree   Israel; He again denounced the Iranian nuclear agreement whose main flaw in the eyes of the Israelis and the neocons is that it disrupted their plans to bomb-bomb-bomb Iran, and he called for  regime change  in Iran, a long beloved dream of the Israelis and the neocons; He repeated the Israeli/neocon propaganda about Hezbollah as a terrorist organization when Hezbollah s real crime was driving the Israeli military out of southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an Israeli occupation that began with Israel s 1982 invasion; He praised his rush-to-judgment decision to bomb Syria last April, in line with Israeli/neocon propaganda against President Bashar al-Assad and partly out of a desire to please the same Washington establishment that is still scheming how to impeach him; He spoke with the crass hypocrisy that the neocons and many Israeli leaders have perfected, particularly his demand that  all nations   respect   the rights of every other sovereign nation    when he made clear that he, like his White House predecessors, is ready to violate the sovereignty of other nations that get in Official Washington s way.A Litany of WarsJust this century, the United States has invaded multiple nations without U.N. authorization, based on various  coalitions of the willing  and other subterfuges for wars of aggression, which the Nuremberg Tribunals deemed the  supreme international crime  and which the U.N. was specifically created to prevent.Not only did President George W. Bush invade both Afghanistan and Iraq   while also sponsoring  anti-terror  operations in many other countries   but President Barack Obama acknowledged ordering military attacks in seven countries, including against the will of sovereign states, such as Libya and Syria. Obama also supported a violent coup against the elected government of Ukraine.For his part, Trump already has shown disdain for international law by authorizing military strikes inside Yemen and Syria. In other words, if not for the fear of provoking American anger, many of the world s diplomats might have responded with a barrage of catcalls toward Trump for his blatant hypocrisy. Without doubt, the United States is the preeminent violator of sovereignty and international law in the world today, yet Trump wagged his finger at others, including Russia (over Ukraine) and China (over the South China Sea).He declared:  We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. Then, with a seeming blindness to how much of the world sees the United States as a law onto itself, Trump added:  The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. Of course, in the U.S. mainstream media s commentary that followed, Trump s hypocrisy went undetected. That s because across the American political/media establishment, the U.S. right to act violently around the world is simply accepted as the way things are supposed to be. International law is for the other guy; not for the  indispensible nation,  not for the  sole remaining superpower. On Bibi s LeashDespite some of his  America First  rhetoric   tossed in as red meat to his  base    Trump revealed a global outlook that differed from the Bush-Obama neoconservative/liberal-interventionist approach in words only. In substance, Trump appears to be just the latest American poodle on Bibi Netanyahu s leash.For instance, Trump bragged about attacking Syria over a dubious chemical-weapons claim while ignoring the role of the Saudi/Israeli tandem in assisting Al Qaeda and its Syrian affiliate; Trump threatened the international nuclear agreement with Iran while calling for regime change in Tehran, two of Netanyahu s top priorities; and Trump warned that he would  totally destroy North Korea  over its nuclear and missile programs while making no mention of Israel s rogue nuclear arsenal and sophisticated delivery capabilities.Ignoring Saudi Arabia s ties to terrorism, Trump touted his ludicrous summit in Riyadh in which he danced with swords and let King Salman and other corrupt Persian Gulf monarchs, who have long winked and nodded at ideological and logistical support going to Al Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups, pretend their governments were joining an anti-terror coalition.Exploding the myth that he is at least a street-smart operator who can t be easily conned, Trump added,  In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. No wonder Netanyahu seemed so pleased with Trump s speech. The Israeli prime minister could have written it himself while allowing Trump to add a few crude flourishes, like calling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un  Rocket Man   on a suicide mission ; referring to  the loser terrorists ; and declaring that many parts of the world are  going to hell. Trump also tossed in a plug for his  new strategy for victory  in Afghanistan and threw in some interventionist talk regarding the Western Hemisphere with more threats to Cuba and Venezuela about escalating sanctions and other activities to achieve more  regime change  solutions.So, what Trump made clear in his U.N. address is that his  America First  and  pro-sovereignty  rhetoric is simply cover for a set of policies that are indistinguishable from those pushed by the neocons of the Bush administration or the liberal interventionists of the Obama administration. The rationalizations may change but the endless wars and  regime change  machinations continue.

 Oregon Congressman Rips Justice Department For Not Arresting And Prosecuting Bundy Militants (VIDEO),"Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio took federal authorities to the woodshed on the House floor over their failure to do their job and arrest the armed terrorists led by Ammon Bundy.As you probably already know, Bundy and his band of right-wing militants illegally seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge two weeks ago. Ever since then, they ve destroyed government property, snooped through government files, struck fear into the hearts of the local citizens, and have broken several laws in the process. But law enforcement has done very little to remove the armed occupation, which is a stark contrast to the way law enforcement treats unarmed black men in this country.And DeFazio wants that to change right now. The heat and the lights are on at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, illegally occupied by ultra-rightwing anti-government extremists, but you gotta wonder if the lights are on or is anybody home down there at the Justice Department,  DeFazio said.DeFazio then angrily demanded that federal authorities take down the militants and end the standoff so that people can move on with their lives. Hello! I don t think there s anybody there. I believe that this illegal occupation, this destruction of federal property was directly emboldened by the fact that their father of the two leaders, Cliven Bundy, stood down the government two years ago when he owed a million dollars   other ranchers paid their grazing fees, he refuses to do it. And he was grazing in areas that were prohibited. And he stood down the government at the point of a gun, and he s still grazing and nobody, nobody at the Justice Department has seen fit to raise a finger against him.He celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said  this is how it s done.  And now his sons are replicating that in my state of Oregon, where we abide by the laws. Yeah, we disagree over a lot of federal policies, but we abide by the laws.It s time for the Justice Department to take some action. Wake up down there! Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, so far, the only militants who have been arrested were caught driving a federal vehicle to town in search of snacks. Meanwhile, the rest of the militants have been allowed to come and go as they please and they ve even been allowed to destroy federal fence lines and access government computers. Furthermore, the militants broke the law by carrying firearms on federal property and their seizure of a government building is an act of domestic terrorism that should not be tolerated.If this were a group of African-Americans or Muslims, law enforcement would have already shot up the place and killed every one of them by now. But because these gunmen are white rednecks, authorities are treating them with kid gloves, which perfectly demonstrates that law enforcement truly has different rules for different people. These militants are costing taxpayers millions of dollars, and they are interrupting the daily lives of citizens who do not want them there. Their actions are illegal and they should be treated like any other terrorist. It s time for law enforcement to do the job they are paid to do or they should resign in disgrace so that we can hire people who will actually do it.Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 16, 2016"
TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER and Dartmouth Grad Says He’d Be “OK if #BetsyDeVos was sexually assaulted” After DeVos Announced Law Would Be Restored In College Sex Assault Cases,"Texas Civil Rights lawyer Rob Ranco is a partner at The Carlson Law Firm at the Round Rock, TX location. He is the supervising attorney for the firm s three Austin offices.When Rob isn t busy chasing ambulances or using a bullying incident his daughter allegedly faced at school to gain celebrity, he s publicly telling the world he d be okay if Betsy DeVos, a mother, grandmother and US Secretary of Education was sexually assaulted. It looks the real bully has been exposed Here s Rob Ranco s vile tweet, that he quickly deleted after it started to get traction on Twitter:This is what Rob s Twitter account looks like now:Here is a link to the archived tweet and to the responses Ranco got to his disgusting comment: https://archive.fo/xNdigRob Ranco, a partner in the Texas Carlson Law Firm was apparently referring to a decision made by Betsy DeVos, that she announced earlier in the week regarding changes that would be made to  Title IX as it relates to the unfair and unlawful way sexual assault cases are currently being tried on college campuses.Betsy DeVos spoke on Thursday, September 7, at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen. Rob offered to give up his salary before the case was even settled in an effort to get the Austin Police Department to admit guilt before the settlement. The Youtube videos showing him asking for an apology for his client have all been mysteriously scrubbed, but we have managed to locate the grandstanding video and can be seen below:Rob mentions his wife Tonia, who has her own website and Youtube channel that caters to women in his profile on Twitter.Tonia has also shut down her Twitter account, as her husband s disgusting remarks are sure to harm her business whose primary market appears to be women.Leave it to a liberal to be so filled with hate for anyone who doesn t agree with him, that he s willing to destroy his own career, and in the process, destroy his wife s career as well.Here s a video of Rob promoting himself and his excellent skills as a lawyer: ",politics,"Sep 9, 2017"
DEMOCRATS THREATEN KIDS EDUCATION: CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION DEMANDS RAISES AS Chicago Public Schools Run Out Of Money In One Week,"It s painful to watch the stupidity and irresponsibility of the Democrats who run the city of Chicago along with Chicago Teachers Union president, Karen Lewis, one of the most hard-core radical, leftist s in the business. It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million. Via: EAG News",politics,"Jun 24, 2015"
"AFTER MONTHS OF TRASHING OUR PRESIDENT, Senator McCain Explains How To Fix Rancor In DC : “Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet…To hell with them”","Conservative talk radio, tv and websites are no friends of RINO Senator John McCain, and he knows it. McCain used his moment he was given to shine on the Senate floor after being diagnosed with brain  cancer, to excoriate conservatives who speak out against him on talk radio, TV and the internet. For years, conservatives on social media have declared  open season  on RINO s (Republicans In Name Only) in DC. like Senator s John McCain (R-AZ) and his close ally Lindsey Graham (R-SC). In June 2015, candidate Hillary Clinton used her good working relationships with McCain and Graham as examples of how she can reach out across the aisle.McCain has been a thorn in the side of President Trump and has been openly antagonistic towards him since it became apparent Trump would be the Republican candidate for president. Only one day after his surgery and diagnosis with brain cancer, Senator John McCain just couldn t help himself. While millions of Americans were praying for his recovery, McCain took to Twitter to admonish President Trump over his decision to end a failed program that was supposed to train, fund and arm Syrians to fight Assad and ISIS.Tuesday on the Senate floor, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) gave a speech upon returning from Arizona after having an emergency craniotomy to remove a blood clot and a subsequent diagnosis of cancer.McCain cast the deciding vote to begin the health care debate and chided both sides for not being bipartisan over the last several years, saying,  I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for this bill as it is today. McCain said,  I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing, better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet. To hell with them. They don t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood. Here s how conservative radio and tv host Mark Levin reacted to McCain s comments:Oh my. I'm hurt to the core.   https://t.co/jfnssmz9RJ  Mark R. Levin (@marklevinshow) July 26, 2017McCain went on to encourage his fellow Senators to get behind him and help find a way to fix the disastrous Obamacare,  Our health care insurance system is a mess. We all know it. Those who support Obamacare and those who oppose it. Something has to be done. He added,  We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. We haven t found it yet. And I m not sure we will. All we have managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn t very popular when we started trying to get rid of it. I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for this bill as it is today. It s a shell of a bill right now, we all know that. I have changes urged by my state s governor that will need to be made before I support any bill. I know the bill has to change substantially before you will support it.

POLITICAL AGITATOR: Globalist George Soros Linked to Over 50 ‘Partners’ of the Women’s March on Washington,"21st Century Wire says More than 50 NGO  partners  of the Women s March on Washington were found to be tied to social movement financier George Soros. While the DC gathering was billed as a grassroots movement for women s rights in America, it was anything but as a string of multi-million dollar Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was clearly an anti-Donald Trump event following the US presidential inauguration this past week.  DIVIDE BY DESIGN    (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)As we ve stated before here at 21WIRE, this kind of political protest is designed to first cause public disruption, while also fomenting a form of socially-engineered cultural, gender and class warfare.In the case of the Women s March on Washington, a militant style of identity politics was on a full frontal display. Enter stage left   the celebrities This was never more apparent than the hate filled diatribe of Hollywood actress Ashley Judd, whose angry rhetoric was eclipsed only by famed singer Madonna, who during her obscenity laced speech admitted to harboring violent thoughts directed at the White House. Consequently, the Material Girl is now reportedly under Secret Service investigation for her bomb related threat this past Saturday.Watch how both Judd and Madonna are driven by rage during their politically divisive speeches at the Women s March on Washington https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-5ZkrQHyNcDuring an interview with ABC NEWS, Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway  didn t see the point,  of the Women s March. Additionally, Conway underscored that 29-30 million women across America voted for Trump and their voices were heard in the 2016 election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEiGcT9wD4QUESTION: Was the heavily organized Women s March on Washington just another example of a radical globalist and cultural Marxist  progressive  agenda at play?Historically speaking, many social movements have worked to erode the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial  color  upheavals (color revolutions), and where possible   weakening a country s national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public s political perspective.This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization  color revolution  campaigns overseas, and now astute observers will recognize these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US.Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State.Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org, as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO, and UNITE HERE. These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this latest protest movement in America.While it still remains to be seen if Trump s stated political vision for America can unite an embattled nation, one thing is clear   many NGO groups operating inside the US will continue their organized opposition to the newly elected president over the course of his time in the White House.  BITTER PILL    Madonna s waning singing career gives way to cultural upheaval and demagoguery. (Image Source: Extra.ie)Other  partners  for the march included the American Atheists and UniteWomen.org, who ran a public relations campaign which featured videos with the hashtags #ImWithHer, #DemsInPhily and #ThanksObama. Once again, all road lead back to billionaire Hillary Clinton financier, George Soros and his Open Society NGO empire.Writer Asra Nomani expands on the Soros web here: By my draft research, which I m opening up for crowd-sourcing on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march s  partners,  including  key partners  Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with  Women s March  organizations include the partisan MoveOn.org (which was fiercely pro-Clinton), the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as  a leader of tomorrow  as a march co-chair and another official as  the head of logistics ). Other Soros grantees who are  partners  in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven t yet returned queries for comment. NOTE: See her full story below.The Free Thought Project illustrates the contrived socially engineered nature behind the Women s March on Washington in lengthy passage below:Washington, D.C.   An investigation by a New York Times affiliate has revealed that billionaire globalist financier George Soros, who recently called Donald Trump a  would-be dictator  during an interview at Davos, and whose Open Society Foundation works to finance and forward progressive causes across the world, and is intimately connected to numerous color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and various other political uprisings across the globe, has been revealed to be connected to more than 50 of the groups that organized the nationwide  Women s Marches  that saw millions of Americans take to the streets across the country.The march s official website says,  We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us.  Many people turned out to be a manifestation of that ideal, but it s important to understand the reality of what is happening on a strategic political level as an inorganic politically contrived and funded event. This, in no way, takes away from the validity of standing up for women s issues but is important to note that women are being used as pawns in a larger ideological political game that has international overtones of power politics.These marches were largely billed as  spontaneous  and  grassroots  actions, by publications like The Guardian and Vox. However, the reality exposed by an investigation by self-described liberal feminist Asra Q. Nomani, writing for New York Times affiliate Women in the World, revealed that after studying the  funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march, contrary to the non-partisan rhetoric used in these marches, they were not really  women s march  but were rather  for women who are anti-Trump. Nomani reveals that the  Women s Marches  were actually organized as political tools to be used to strategically forward a progressive political agenda against President Donald Trump   exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down driven political operation   and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media.

Nomani NY Times   Women in the WorldIn the pre-dawn darkness of today s presidential inauguration day, I faced a choice, as a lifelong liberal feminist who voted for Donald Trump for president: lace up my pink Nike sneakers to step forward and take the DC Metro into the nation s capital for the inauguration of America s new president, or wait and go tomorrow to the after-party, dubbed the  Women s March on Washington ? The Guardian has touted the  Women s March on Washington  as a  spontaneous  action for women s rights. Another liberal media outlet, Vox, talks about the  huge, spontaneous groundswell  behind the march. On its website, organizers of the march are promoting their work as a grassroots effort with  independent  organizers. Even my local yoga studio, Beloved Yoga, is renting a bus and offering seats for $35. The march s manifesto says magnificently,  The Rise of the Woman = The Rise of the Nation. It s an idea that I, a liberal feminist, would embrace. But I know   and most of America knows   that the organizers of the march haven t put into their manifesto: the march really isn t a  women s march.  It s a march for women who are anti-Trump. As someone who voted for Trump, I don t feel welcome, nor do many other women who reject the liberal identity-politics that is the core underpinnings of the march, so far, making white women feel unwelcome, nixing women who oppose abortion and hijacking the agenda. To understand the march better, I stayed up through the nights this week, studying the funding, politics and talking points of the some 403 groups that are  partners  of the march.

WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT To Recognize Jerusalem As Israel’s Capital,"After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.

WOW! Disturbing Reason ONLY 3 Airports Screen Their Employees Every Day Before Work [VIDEO],"Never mind that at least 50 identified ISIS sympathizers are currently working at recently bombed Brussels Airport. Meanwhile Obama and his corrupt EPA make no secret that global climate change is our nations first priority when it comes to our national security At Senate Commerce Committee session (VIDEO BELOW), lawmakers heard that only three airports in the United States require their employees to undergo a security check before they begin their work day. Atlanta, Miami, Orlando. What about the other 297 airports nationwide?  asked committee co-chair Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida).TSA (Transportation Security Administration) head Robert Neffenger answered that while the TSA has  increased the inspection of employees five-fold in the last five months,  more needs to be done.Neffenger said that all airports were asked to provide a report by the end of the month assessing their vulnerabilies.A 2015 TSA committee concluded most airports could not afford daily employee screening. In addition, they said the full screening would not  appreciably increase the overall system-wide protection. No single measure can provide broad-spectrum protection against risks or adversaries,  the committee concluded.  Therefore, risk-based, multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation. The report argued daily screening  is incapable of determining a person s motivations, attitudes and capabilities to cause harm, among other limitations.

" Chicago Cop Executes Mentally Ill Black Teen, Then Sues Family For ‘Emotional Distress’ (VIDEO)","Cops are out of control when it comes to getting away with murdering black people with impunity and without consequence. The case you re about to read about just got much, much worse, though.As we recently reported, Chicago cop Robert Rialmo shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier when the teen called the authorities for help three times, only to be hung up on. Another casualty of the trigger-happy Rialmo was 55-year-old Bettie Jones. As if the murders weren t bad enough, the cops already investigated themselves and cleared themselves of all wrongdoing, as seems to be so typical in these cases. But it gets worse. Much worse.As if this family hasn t been through enough, Rialmo is now suing the LeGrier family for  emotional distress  after he murdered their child.Also, it smacks of a potential cover-up, because Mayor Rahm Emanuel was forced to release text messages relating to the shooting. One string alluded to his probing to see what the media what up to, and what kind of coverage this story was getting. Emanuel s texts say, in part: Media acting breathlessly? You are positive no public negative reaction? Further, the LeGriers  lawyer, Bill Fourtis, has a very good point: Quintonio was shot in the back four times by this deranged cop. This lawsuit comes at an awfully convenient time   just as details that make what happened that night look less than kosher become public, and just as the LeGrier family sues the city of Chicago for the wrongful death of their loved one.This cop needs to be in jail, as does everyone involved what is clearly a cover-up.Watch a news report on this developing story below:Featured image via video screen capture from Latest",News,"January 29, 2016"
"US-Saudi Plan: Let 9,000 ISIS Fighters Walk Free from Mosul – to Fight in Syria"," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJudging by both the words, and deeds of the Obama White House and its political  diplomatic  appointees led by perfidious John Kerry and caustic Samantha Power   all evidence to date points to the US wanting to escalate its war on Syria   while happily baiting a military confrontation, and World War  scenario with Russia and its allies in the process. If this latest leak is indeed true   and time will certainly tell whether or not it is, it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both US and international law   by the United States government and its theocratic dictator partner in Saudi Arabia.Washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups, and this US-Saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations  According to news released today (see report below), US President Barack Obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the ISIS stronghold in Mosul in Iraq is scheduled for the second half of October. Here s what makes this a potential shocker: the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 ISIS fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from Iraq to eastern Syria in order to help US plans for  regime change  there. At the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city, which are empty, the source said. According to him [the source], the plan of Washington and Riyadh also provides that the rebels move from Mosul to Syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops. Essentially, Washington and Saudi Arabia, will allow 9,000 ISIS (Islamic State) fighter FREE passage into Syria if they agree to join Washington s  regime change  operations there. This could also include,   eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source added.Before you write this story off as some ornate Russian psychological operation, consider the long trend arch. The US along with its generous Gulf sidekicks, have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting ISIS   not just in Syria, but in Iraq too.The record shows that the US is guilty on a number of counts If the Mosul leak is true, then it wouldn t be the first time that the US has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as  the fight against ISIS.  When large ISIS convoys crossed the Syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra in May 2015, the US  Coalition  airforce did nothing, and allowed ISIS to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage, along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.Professor Tim Anderson from Sydney University states: U.S. weapons with Israeli ammunition were used by Islamic State group when taking over Palmyra. The extremists also had U.S. military rations. The U.S., which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region, did nothing to stop the huge ISIS advance on Palmyra. The US isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with ISIS in the field, with the New York Times openly boasting,  Any airstrikes against Islamic State militants in and around Palmyra would probably benefit the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. So far, United States-led airstrikes in Syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control, to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster President Obama has called for. Following the derelict incident, New York Times reporters Hwaida Saad and Kareem Fahim, were still kicking and screaming for  regime change like petulant children at the news of ISIS fleeing and Palmyra being liberated by the Syrian Army and Russians. They said that,  Mr. Assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group  has been bolstered, but added that  his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in Syria. In other words:  we still want regime change!  This says volumes about who is really enforcing New York Times editorial lines (either the US State Dept, or the CIA, take your pick).More importantly however, is what kind of message an US statement like that sends to ISIS, as well as Al Nusra and other terrorist brigades inside Syria, which is basically,  we do not need to worry about US air strikes, only Syrian Army and Russian strikes.  This situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the US deception in Syria, and it s no surprise that the Russian Foreign Ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the US is concerned.Then, in March 2016, when ISIS fled Palmyra, back across the desert towards Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa   the great and powerful US  Coalition  airforce actually helped ISIS in a number of ways, including allowing them free passage once more.In late August, we were told that the Turkish Army, alongside  allied Syrian rebels  (terrorist group Faylaq al-Sham) backed by the US air cover, invaded Syria in order to capture the  ISIS-held  town of Jarabulus, Syria, this supposedly to cut off ISIS s last open route into Turkey. But what happened to ISIS?The NYT even admitted that,  it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight. Here, ISIS appears to have been given advanced warning   by either US or Turkish intelligence, as they left the contested town of Jarabulus quietly, but in droves. In reality, Turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade Kurdish militias including the US-backed artificial construct called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and pro-Kurdish People s Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian affiliate of the militant Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) in Iraq and Turkey   all of whom are meant to be fighting ISIS. Instead, they are now busy dodging Turkish artillery rounds. Confusing, yes, but true nonetheless.It s also common knowledge now, that top of the line US weaponry is being used by ISIS, both in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Syria as well. In fact, if not for US weapons and supplies (along with US air intervention, or noninterventions), ISIS would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today. For the last 3 years, US officials have been dodging this issue, and when they do admit this is true, their patronizing party line is that,  this must be a mistake, if they do have US weapons, we didn t mean it.  As if the world was born yesterday.Perhaps the most flagrant violation by the US-led forces in aiding and abetting ISIS took place on Sept 17, 2016, when the US-led Coalition bombed Syrian Army positions outside of Deir ez-Zor near al-Tharda Mountain, killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more.  As if by design, an ISIS offensive began immediately following the US massacre of Syrian soldiers. Clearly, this bold move by the Pentagon paved the way for a major ISIS advance.To any normal observer, the US attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement, and yet the US response was to somehow blame Russia for calling an emergency UNSC meeting to discuss the incident. Judging by this response, it s pretty clear that US wants to see the Syrian Conflict carry on for a while, and it will need groups like ISIS to make that happen. The other problem with Washington s hollow righteousness in the Middle East is that there are key members of the US-led Coalition  who are financing ISIS, Al Nusra Front, Nour al Din Zinki, and Arar al Sham (all  moderate terrorists we re told) militants in Syria, Iraq and beyond. This fact was recently admitted by former US Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, as revealed in this week s batch of Wikileaks emails. Clinton writes: While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the US CIA illegally trafficking lethal arms to Al Nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like Timber Sycamore.Still, US and NATO member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb, rather than come clean that the United States and its  partners  in the region are helping, not hindering ISIS terrorism.Some might ask: why would they do a thing like that? By now, the answer should be simple, but threefold:What s so comical yet even more tragic, is how prominent the topic of  ISIS  factors into all of the vapid  national security  debates and media panels in this year s US Presidential election, and in the dumbed-down  coverage of the delusional US mainstream media, led by Pentagon surrogate CNN, and hopeless FOX News. Judging by their prosaic  coverage , neither the networks, nor Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is. Instead we here,  My ISIS plan is better than yours!  The US political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.The corps of US military and CIA media spokesman aren t much better. The sad part is some of them do know what is really happening, but would rather lie to the American public.With so much double dealing, who can you trust? Certainly not anyone in Washington.More on the White House s latest dangerous proposition .RTThe US and Saudi Arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of Islamic State militants before the Iraqi city of Mosul is stormed. The jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in Syria, a military-diplomatic source told RIA Novosti. More than 9,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) militants will be redeployed from Mosul to the eastern regions of Syria to carry out a major offensive operation, which involves capturing Deir ez-Zor and Palmyra,  the source said.According to the anonymous diplomatic source, US President Barack Obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate Mosul, due to take place in October.During the storm of the city in northern Iraq the US-led coalition s planes would only strike detached, vacated or uninhabited buildings, while keeping terrorists as targets, he said.In September, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed that Washington would send an additional 600 troops to Iraq to help liberate Mosul at the request of the local authorities.The source suggested that redeployment of IS militants is necessary because  Washington must somehow counter Russia s achievements in Syria, try to diminish their importance. Apart from the purely political dividends, the other purpose of this operation, obviously, will be to discredit the success of Russian Airspace forces. And, of course, it s an attempt to undermine Syrian President (Bashar) Assad,  he said.The leadership of Saudi Arabia s General Intelligence Directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from Mosul, he claimed.The source added that a similar scheme had been used by the US and its allies during the liberation of the Iraqi city of Fallujah Continue this story at RTREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 13, 2016"
JUST IN: CLOSE FRIEND of Hillary Clinton Who Planned To “Step Away From Politics” Found DEAD In Apparent Suicide,"Houston, Texas trial lawyer and Democrat mega-donor Steve Mostyn died on Thursday in what authorities are saying was a  suicide,  according to the Houston Chronicle. Mr. Mostyn was only 46, he left behind a wife and several children, and earlier this year had announced that he was going to be stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family.Details about how Mr. Mostyn allegedly committed suicide are slim. However, his family said that it happened after he  suddenly  became afflicted with some sort of mental illness then took his own life, although they weren t clear as to what type of mental illness he suffered from.But it is worth noting that Mr. Mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past, according to his family, further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died.Mr. Mostyn was a progressive powerhouse who was heavily involved in politics throughout his career. He made his fortunes off of suing insurance companies after hurricanes ravaged his state, and used his wealth to fund numerous Democrat and progressive causes, including the Super PAC  Ready for Hillary,  which he and his wife co-founded with Susie Tompkins Buell, a radical environmentalist and member of George Soros s Democracy Alliance.Mr. Mostyn s wife, Amber, was also a member of the Democracy Alliance and a close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the keynote speaker at a 2010 Annie s List event honoring Amber. The Mostyns were close to the Clintons in general, having held numerous high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary s failed 2016 presidential run at their Houston home.Houston Chronicle  In 2012 alone, Mostyn donated $5.2 million to various pro-Democratic Super PACs ranging from Planned Parenthood to Texans for America s Future to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Barack Obama PAC, according to the Center for Public Integrity.In 2014, he and his wife donated approximately $3 million to Democratic candidates, including state Sen. Wendy Davis, who we running against Republican Greg Abbott. Davis lost. I am heartbroken,  Davis tweeted Thursday.  Texas has lost an extraordinary person. Steve was a committed and effective fighter for justice, a wonderful husband, father and friend. He leaves behind a lasting impact on everyone who s life he touched. Mostyn and his wife, Amber, were co-founders of the Ready for Hillary PAC, a political action committee supporting Clinton s unsuccessful campaign for president. At the same time, state campaign finance records show he also contributed to a police-affiliated PAC that supported Republican primary candidates.Mostyn also help fund the Texas Organizing Project and Battleground Texas, two Democratic comeback strategies for the party that has not won a statewide election in two decades. It s hard to really quantify the hole it leaves for progressives. He s probably the first true financial benefactor for progressives in Houston, and I say that because it s really different than supporting individual candidates the way trial lawyers have collectively in the past. He really supported the underlying causes, which is a different kind of take, and I m not sure that gets filled, certainly not immediately. Despite the Mostyns and the law firm s high-profile political activism   they contributed more than $1.8 million to Texas politicians in 2016   Mostyn told the Texas Tribune in a September interview that he was growing tired of almost single-handedly funding Democratic candidates in a state that was solidly Republican.He said he intended to downscale his political giving to Democrats in Texas elections to encourage others to step forward.  We ve asked other people to do it and they want to do it and I want other people to get credit for doing it,  the Tribune quoted him as saying.  I mean this is a giant, giant state, if we were trying to flip Vermont we d be done. However, their relationship came under stress in 2015, when ethics watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a formal complaint against Hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, the Daily Caller reported. FACT has also asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to look into an April 21 meeting in which Clinton campaign aides attended a weekly meeting of Senate Democrats. FACT asserts that the meeting violates ruleThis wasn t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.Just a short time later, Boeing s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary s planned presidential campaign.  America s Freedom FightersFrom FOX News   When Hillary Clinton was America s top diplomat, she also appeared at times like a top salesperson for America s biggest airplane maker, Boeing.Traveling abroad on official business as secretary of state, Clinton often visited Boeing facilities and made a pitch for the host country to buy Boeing jets. During one visit to Shanghai in May 2010, she boasted that  more than half the commercial jetliners operating in China are made by Boeing. A sales plug in Russia in 2009, though, may have proved especially fruitful. While touring a Boeing plant, Secretary of State Clinton said,  We re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rossiya, is actively considering acquisition of Boeing aircraft, and this is a shameless pitch. In 2010, Boeing landed the Russian deal, worth $3.7 billion. And two months later, the company donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation.This chain of events is raising new questions for Clinton, and Boeing, as the former secretary of state launches her 2016 presidential campaign. The Boeing deal only adds to a growing list of business deals involving Clinton Foundation donors now coming under scrutiny.Boeing shareholder David Almasi recently confronted CEO James McNerney about the ethics of it. That opens the door to charges of honest services fraud, that there was a quid pro quo between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and Boeing,  Almasi said.In prepared answers to questions posed to Boeing by Fox News, a spokesman defended the company s actions. Our contribution to the Clinton Foundation to help the people of Haiti rebuild was a transparent act of compassion and an investment aimed at aiding the long-term interests and hopes of the Haitian people,  the spokesman said. The company also pointed out that it gave the American Red Cross $1.3 million after the devastating 2010 earthquake.Clinton defenders say there is no smoking gun.  There s zero evidence that Hillary Clinton went to bat for Boeing for any reason other than to benefit the U.S. economy and U.S. workers,  said former Clinton/Gore adviser Richard Goldstein.But the financial connections don t end there. Boeing also paid former President Bill Clinton $250,000 for a speech in 2012. It was a speech that was approved by the State Department s Ethics Office   which according to an Associated Press report often approved the ex-president s speaking engagements within days.Here is a list of mysterious deaths tied to the Clinton s:1   James McDougal   Clinton s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement.

WOW! NEW Batch Of Emails Show Hillary’s State Department Was “CORRUPTION CENTRAL” For Obama Regime…Reveals Favors Huma Did For Clinton Foundation Insiders,"A nonprofit legal watchdog claimed Thursday that newly unearthed documents show Hillary Clinton sent and received more classified information on her private server than previously known, and that the papers also show top aide Huma Abedin did favors for Clinton Foundation insiders.Judicial Watch released more than 2,000 pages of documents it obtained pursuant to a May 5, 2015 court order, after filing a lawsuit against the State Department for failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.The new documents included 115 Clinton email exchanges that were not previously turned over by the State Department.According to Judicial watch, on Dec. 6, 2010, Clinton shared classified information with non-U.S. government employees Justin Cooper, an aide to former President Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Director Doug Band. The email allegedly shows Clinton instructing her aide to print the correspondence, which involved allegations of theft by Bangladeshi banker and Clinton Foundation donor Muhammad Yunus.Yunus was accused of embezzling $100 million from the Grameen Bank, which he founded.Judicial Watch s new emails appear to show multiple Abedin email exchanges from an unsecured server. They also appear to show that Clinton s then-scheduler, Lona Valmoro, forwarded Clinton s daily Secretary of State schedule to top Clinton Foundation officials, along with a  number of favors  that were requested.In a May 10, 2010 email between Abedin and Band, Abedin said she  hooked up  people from the Russian American Foundation with the  right people  at the State Department. The Russia-American Foundation was then staffed by Clinton political supporters, according to Judicial Watch.Additional documents allegedly show that Chelsea Clinton emails, an email sent by Clinton to Abedin saying she did not wish to fly on the same plane with former First Lady Michelle Obama to Betty Ford s funeral, and an email chain between Clinton staffers showing they drafted a  doctors statement  as to why Mrs. Clinton fainted due to  dehydration  causing her to hit her head and suffer a  concussion  in December 2012. Judicial Watch s email shows that the same group, including Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, Jake Sullivan and Philippe Reines, prepared a discharge statement when she was released from the hospital.

" BUSTED: Trump Supporter Tries To Rig Election For The GOP, Gets ARRESTED","Donald Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of rigging the election against him, but it turns out his own supporters are doing everything they can to rig it in his favor.And that includes voting twice, something Republicans continually claim that Democratic voters always get away with doing.The Des Moines Register reports,Terri Lynn Rote, 55, was booked into the Polk County Jail about 3:40 p.m. Thursday on a first-degree election misconduct charge, which is a Class D felony.Rote, a registered Republican, reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the Polk County Election Office, 120 Second Ave., and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in Des Moines, according to a Des Moines police report.So just to recap, Rote literally committed voter fraud in a desperate attempt to get Trump and the Republican Party an extra vote in this election.That s the precise definition of election rigging, but you won t hear Trump say anything about this because he thinks that Democrats are the ones committing voter fraud, which is why he has called for his supporters to intimidate minority voters at polling places.But this incident is far from the only time during this election that a Republican has been caught trying to rig the election.A Wisconsin city clerk was recently busted for trying to deny an extra polling place near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she argued in an email that students lean Democratic. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. Imagine if a Democratic clerk denied letting a church be a polling place on the premise that most religious people are Republicans. The outrage and whining would last for days.And a right-wing group is literally creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day. Keep in mind that Republicans often accuse Democratic voters of using fake IDs to vote multiple times, but here s a right-wing group making fake IDs so they can use voter suppression tactics to swing the vote in favor of Trump.Thus far, it appears that only Donald Trump s supporters are trying to rig the election, not Democrats as he so often claims. And just think, there are still ten days left until Election Day. Still plenty of time for even more hypocritical Trump supporters to be caught trying to rig the election for the small-handed man who whines about how unfair our democratic system is.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016"
 38% Of Trump Supporters Wish South Had Won Civil War And Other Disgusting Findings In New Poll,"A new poll conducted in South Carolina on the heels of the state s Republican primary reveals the true extent of hatred from Donald Trump s base   and it is terrifying.Currently, Trump is expected to easily win South Carolina. His nearest competitor isn t even close. The landslide is so bad that Trump has hardly had to campaign in the state, while others scramble to fight for second place. What makes Trump so popular? A look at the values these voters hold gives us the disturbing answer.Public Policy Polling asked South Carolinians several questions about issues Trump has alluded to on the campaign trail and found that many of them support his most hateful rhetoric. Some even feel he doesn t go far enough.On the question of banning Muslims from entering the United States, one third of Trump s supporters said they would like to add  homosexuals  to the  Can Not Enter  list. No other candidate s supporters came even close to that level of intolerance. But they weren t finished.There s also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else s voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. To put all the views toward Muslims in context though, 32% of Trump voters continue to believe the policy of Japanese internment during World War II was a good one The message is clear: Making America Great Again means purging everyone who isn t white and Christian.Trump s supporters also felt that slavery wasn t so bad, either. In fact, 38 percent of them said they wished the South had won the Civil War. Another 38 percent weren t sure. As PPP dryly put it, Trump s were  the only one[s] whose supporters actually wish the South had won.  Needless to say, an overwhelming majority of his fans (70 percent) felt that the Confederate flag should still be flying over the State Capital.And as if all of those wistful call-backs to a time when white people owned black people were just too subtle, a full 16% of Trump s supporters say they think whites are the  superior race    the only candidate to have double digit support for this racist concept.Following Trump s latest snafu (During the debate, he correctly pointed out that George W. Bush had been president during 9/11. A Republican no-no.), there was some speculation that he would suffer in the polls. That appears to not be the case. It is Ted Cruz, in fact, who was found to be the most unlikable candidate in the race. (No surprise there, everyone hates Ted Cruz once they get to know him.) Meanwhile, Trump has actually gained a few points since the debate.It s clear that targeting Trump on any particular gaffe or talking point won t work. Trump s supporters are fanatical, singularly focused, and fueled by intolerance and hatred. Trump can continue to attack his fellow Republicans or their beloved George W. Bush just as long as he doesn t forget to mock and scapegoat minorities as well. His base demands it.It is often said that Trump s popularity is due to his ability to say what others won t. If that s the case, he s saying an awful lot about the toxic underbelly of the Republican Party.Featured image from Flickr/Alex Hanson ",News,"February 16, 2016"
" This Congressman Has Literally Created BRUTAL ‘Illegitimacy Clock’ For Trump, And It’s Magnificent","If you thought no one in Washington D.C. was feeling the same way about Donald Trump as you are, think again. Several people within the halls of Congress think he s as illegitimate as you do.In fact, one Congressman, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) has gone so far as to create a  Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock  in honor of Trump.If you visit Lieu s Media Center portion of his official Congressional website, this is what you ll see:lieu.house.govHere s Lieu s statement regarding Trump s violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution: The second after Donald Trump took the oath of office, he violated the Constitution and continues to do so. The Framers wrote Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution to prevent foreign influence over our elected officials. It mandates that no person holding office  shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State.  While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive by virtue of his continued interest in the vast and global Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents. This is illegal.Trump can stop his illegal behavior by divesting his global business interests or putting them into blind trusts. He refuses to do so. Not only is he violating the law, he is explicitly putting his financial interests and those of his family above the interests of America. Trump is not making America First, he is making America Second.As a Member of the House Judiciary Committee, I will do everything I can to hold Trump accountable. My first action is the creation of a Cloud of Illegitimacy Clock that keeps track of the seconds, minutes, hours, and days that Trump is operating outside of the law. At some point, the Clock is going to catch up to Trump. For now, Trump appears to be taking the position of former President Richard Nixon that  when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.  How did that work out? What Trump is doing is illegal and action must be taken to stop it. Either he needs to cut all financial ties completely or he should be forced to resign or impeached and brought to justice as the crook that he so apparently seems to be.Good on Rep. Lieu for taking the first steps in holding Trump accountable. You can t do anything without calling him out on his illegal activity first. Well done.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 17, 2017"
 Ted Cruz’s Crazy Dad Goes Off About What Will Happen If His Son Doesn’t Win The Election (AUDIO),"Since Jeb Bush started to bring his mother Barbara Bush with him on the campaign trail, it s become more common for the parents of the Republican presidential candidates to swoop in and give their struggling little GOPers a boost.Pastor Rafael Cruz, the father of Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz, tried to do the same for his own son during a chat with Greg Corombos of WorldNetDaily over the weekend, to basically talk about how his son is going to  eclipse Trump and emerge as the nominee.  Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election. Rafael said: I think what is going to happen is the body of Christ is going to rise up. Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word   two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do. That Rafael called his son a  man of truth  is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio. Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president. Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was  not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans. Rafael topped off his insane claims with a warning, reminding Americans that  this election is the most important election of our lifetime,  and that if they didn t vote Ted into the White House,  a lot of our freedoms would disappear .You can listen to the crazy interview below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248365072  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Rafael Cruz honestly just makes his son look like an even more terrifying candidate whenever he speaks. And now that Jeb Bush has just dropped out of the presidential race, Ted might want to rethink having his bible-thumping dad involved in his campaign affairs. Clearly, the GOP needs much more help than mom and dad can give.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"February 22, 2016"
" After Pepsi Botched Its Ad Campaign, Heineken Gets Theirs Exactly Right (VIDEO)","A few weeks ago, Pepsi decided to try to bridge the racial divide with what someone must have thought was a great idea. They ran an ad featuring Kendall Jenner, who, in the ad, tried to show police and African-Americans that their lives matter by letting a cop drink Pepsi.Here it is:The internet hated it (which might have been the point):Within 48 hours the video got nearly 1.6 million views on YouTube (five times as many downvotes as upvotes), and Twitter and Facebook lit up with people pointing out just how gauche the whole thing was. Activist DeRay Mckesson called it  trash,  adding  If I had carried Pepsi I guess I never would ve gotten arrested. Who knew?  People made memes (some even reaching back and evoking Pepper Spray Cop). And, rightfully, many folks pointed out that using protest imagery in order to peddle soda particularly images that evoked the photo of Ieshia Evans facing down police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana last year was pretty tasteless. It was one of the few times the internet ever agreed on anything.Source: WiredWhether in response to Pepsi s ad that never should have been, or whether this began organically, Heineken beer had their own version of an ad that addresses the political divide, but they got it right.In an experiment, they had complete strangers who would hate each other under normal circumstances, and put them in situations that created bonding.

 Major Newspaper Breaks 100 Year Tradition With 2016 Endorsement,"The Cincinnati Enquirer has endorsed Republicans for president for nearly a century but Donald Trump forced the paper to break the streak..Despite having reservations about Hillary Clinton, the longtime newspaper could not justify supporting the Republican nominee this time around. Trump, despite all of his bluster about wanting to  make America great again,  has exploited and expanded our internal divisions,  the Enquirer noted.The Enquirer has supported Republicans for president for almost a century   a tradition this editorial board doesn t take lightly. But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times. Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst.That s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton.The Enquirer pointed out that Clinton has worked on both sides of the aisle to craft bipartisan legislation and has the experience necessary to be a good president in both domestic and foreign affairs. Furthermore, the Enquirer appreciates that her campaign is inclusive, noting that she has fought for LGBT rights and supports income equality for women.Trump, however, only represents national ruin and embarrassment.Trump is a clear and present danger to our country. He has no history of governance that should engender any confidence from voters. Trump has no foreign policy experience, and the fact that he doesn t recognize it   instead insisting that,  I know more about ISIS than the generals do    is even more troubling. His wild threats to blow Iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at U.S. ships is just the type of reckless, cowboy diplomacy Americans should fear from a Trump presidency. Clinton has been criticized as being hawkish but has shown a measured approach to the world s problems. Do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem? The fact that so many top military and national security officials are not supporting Trump speaks volumes.The Enquirer also noted that Trump is aligned with white supremacists and has filed bankruptcy multiple times, which defeats the notion that he is a successful businessman.In the end, there is only one real choice for president in 2016, and the Enquirer bucked a 100 year tradition and picked Hillary Clinton.In these uncertain times, America needs a brave leader, not bravado. Real solutions, not paper-thin promises. A clear eye toward the future, not a cynical appeal to the good old days.Hillary Clinton has her faults, certainly, but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of Americans both inside and outside of Washington. It s time to elect the first female U.S. president   not because she s a woman, but because she s hands-down the most qualified choice.This endorsement is particularly important because Ohio is a swing state that will likely be a close call this November.

" Kellyanne Conway, Trump Jr. Spread False Info About Capitol Shooter To Blame It On Liberals","It took Trump s family and friends under an hour after a mass shooting at a congressional Republican baseball practice to win the awards for  Worst Reaction to a Mass Shooting.  And sadly, many Trump voters appear to be eating it up.Both Kellyanne Conway and Donald Trump Jr. managed to promote unsubstantiated and largely debunked information coming out to push a narrative that the shooter had targeted Republicans and not Democrats. The reality is: Nobody knows why the shooter did it. Not yet.Don and Kellyanne both used a single source: Rep. Jeff Duncan, whose narrative began coming to pieces shortly after he had made the comment.The man Duncan and other Republicans described as having asked whether the people playing baseball were Republicans or Democrats looked nothing like the man who later shot at them, as numerous reporters began noting.The description of the guy who asked lawmakers if GOP or Dems was practicing and the actual shooter appear to be different people.

Emily Crockett (@emilycrockett) June 14, 2017In fact, as Andrea Mitchell reported, the FBI is now saying it does not appear to, at first glance, have a political motivation.FBI takes over investigation discounts reports of political motive Alexandria police say 5 people transported to hospital community is safe https://t.co/ZifZ6pZa4V  Andrea Mitchell (@mitchellreports) June 14, 2017Despite that lack of confirmation, right-wing media ran with the unsubstantiated reports like they were official statements by investigators. Drudge, in one egregious example, even misquoted one of the Republicans at the scene to make it seem like the shooter said he wanted to kill as many Republicans as possible. Breitbart and InfoWars both quickly joined in. No such words were said.The White House released a statement saying the president had been  briefed  on the situation, but it s unclear what his briefing looked like. Trump gets much of his news from Drudge, Breitbart and Fox News. It s entirely possible that the President of the United States believes the lies being spread by right-wing media and his advisors.At this time no one knows the true motives of the shooter. Police have him in custody and, unlike Trump s son, are conducting a thorough investigation before blasting out unsubstantiated reports into the public. Rather than waiting, the right-wing media and Trump s own White House decided to exploit the tragedy in order to further their agenda of smearing liberals. It s beyond maddening to watch the group who once called President Obama  divisive  for expressing sorrow for Trayvon Martin now openly and gleefully delight in spreading vitriol and lies about their political opponents.UPDATE: FBI investigators identified the shooter as James Hodgkinson. There is evidence to suggest he supported Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Police have again dismissed the idea that he had asked people at the baseball game what political affiliation they were.What still isn t known is why he decided to go on a shooting spree.BREAKING: Gov't official: Suspect in shooting of congressman in Virginia identified as Illinois man named James T.

 Snyder Gets Served Some Very Bad News From Court: It’s Time To Answer For Flint,"Michigan Governor Rick Snyder stood before the state legislature and declared that the  buck stops  with him. He said that the people of Flint deserve the truth and that they will get it. Hew said he takes full responsibility and that the government had failed the people.Then he refused to resign, denying the people the basic satisfaction of seeing their grossly incompetent  leader  step down.The hope for some kind of satisfaction isn t completely gone, however, as the lawyers in a class action suit filed for the people of Flint obtained subpoenas requiring the governor, his staffers, city managers and the Department of Environmental Quality to turn over all documents, records and emails pertaining the crisis in Flint.Lawyers are looking for anything dating back to 2011 referring to three specific items: The Flint River tapped for drinking water, the quality of the water in the river or the KWA pipeline, the main transfer route at the root of the problem.The bad news didn t stop there for Governor Snyder. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that it was assigning the former head of the FBI s Detroit field office to lead a criminal investigation. What the citizens of Flint want, desire and deserve is what laws may have been broken,  said Schuette.The controversy surrounding Flint has been treated by Republicans like a simple  oops  moment. Jeb Bush has praised the governor for his handling of the situation that has already taken at least ten lives from Legionnaire s disease while calling for the head of Hillary Clinton on a pike over Benghazi. The entire situation has highlighted just how little republicans tend to think of the people when making decisions that could save a few dollars   or earn a few more.Hopefully, Governor Snyder will have no choice when the facts are presented but to step down. The people of Flint deserve no less.Feature Image via screen capture",News,"January 26, 2016"
SHOCKER: Washington Post Publishes OpEd Critical of Pro-Israel Law Which Shuts Down BDS,"21st Century Wire says It s no secret that the US mainstream media enforces a very tight party line when it comes to saying anything about Israel. Generally speaking, any criticism of the  Jewish State  normally ends up in the editorial waste bin.The reason for this should be academic by now: powerful Israeli Lobby exists in Washington and with satellite branches across the US and Canada. The lobby s attack apparatus regularly coordinate media incursions and smear campaigns against any publication or journalist who dares to break rank and criticize Israel s appalling human rights record, endless violations of international law and flagrant ignorance of multiple UN resolutions. It consists mainly of the following organizations: the Anti-Defamation League (which devotes a large portion of its time and resources to defaming people it seeks to discredit), the quasi Masonic organization and godfather of the Jewish political attack organs B nai B rith International,  and of course, the ADL s ugly step child, the dubious  NGO  Southern Poverty Law Center. These organizations enforce their strict public relations code through a collection of tactics like threats and boycotts, including targeting a publication s advertisers and sponsors, or featuring a journalist, media pundit, author or academic on one of their many  Hate Lists , and by lobbing the standard charge of antisemitism against anyone who sounds remotely critical of Israel and its many failings.This week, David Cole, a national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Faiz Shakir national political director of the ACLU, penned a piece (see article below) in Jeff Bezos s recently acquired deep state propaganda mill, The Washington Post. In their impassioned piece, they posed the question of whether or not the recent US legislation called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act is moral in a modern democracy, or even legal for that matter. Incredibly, this new Pro-Israel law threatens fines and imprisonment to anyone who speaks of or campaigns to boycott, divest or sanction the Israeli state for its many and sundry documented international crimes. The level of tyranny inherent in this new piece of legislation is breathtaking to say the least. Simply put   it s a direct attack on the US First Amendment. What s worse is that it s being orchestrated from outside of the United States by a foreign entity. The bill s target is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which is a global campaign that applies economic and political pressure on Israel to actually comply with international law (something the US government itself should also be doing). According to the authors, the new Orwellian law would also make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or its businesses called out by the United Nations, the European Union or any other  international governmental organization.  At its core, this law would constitute an anathema to any modern republican or democratic concept, and yet, this is what the Israeli Lobby seeks to impose on the people of the United States. So far, 45 US Senators have lined-up to support this bill, and not one member of Congress has joined the ACLU in denouncing it. On the Israeli payroll: US Senator Tom Cotton.Here s a fact that might be hard for some to swallow, but it s true: this law was only able to make it as far as it has because of the virtual stranglehold The Lobby has on nearly every member of the US House and Senate by way of lucrative campaign contributions to public officials by way of foreign lobbies like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and backed-up by public and media pressure campaigns which, for those who have dared to step off the reservation, have ruined many a career in Washington. This lop-sided situation not only threatens US democratic interests at home, but it s also a serious threat to US national security. What this also demonstrates is how easily US Senators will disregard the US Constitution for a few hundred thousand dollars stuffed into their campaign bank accounts by a foreign lobby. You can see their financials here and here.It s left many onlookers asking: what s going on at the Amazon Post? The article is certainly measured and very careful in its wording, but the fact that it was allowed to appear at all might indicate that the deep state is loosening its restrictions on speech on Israeli issues in the US mainstream media. We hope this is the trend anyway, although maybe not if the ADL, B nai B rith, and the SPLC have anything to say about it.By far, this is the biggest attempt yet by Israel at hijacking the US democratic system, albeit from within. If this bill passes, it will mark the near end of what remains of the sovereignty of the United States of America. That is no exaggeration.Here s the OpEd . By David Cole and Faiz ShakirThe right to boycott has a long history in the United States, from the American Revolution to Martin Luther King Jr. s Montgomery bus boycott to the campaign for divestment from businesses serving apartheid  South Africa.Nowadays we celebrate those efforts. But precisely because boycotts are such a powerful form of expression, governments have long sought to interfere with them   from King George III to the police in Alabama, and now to the U.S. Congress.The Israel Anti-Boycott Act, legislation introduced in the Senate by Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and in the House by Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), would make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or its businesses called by the United Nations, the European Union or any other  international governmental organization.  Violations would be punishable by civil and criminal penalties of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. The American Civil Liberties Union, where we both work, takes no position for or against campaigns to boycott Israel or any other foreign country. But since our organization s founding in 1920, the ACLU has defended the right to collective action. This bill threatens that right.The Israel Anti-Boycott Act is designed to stifle efforts to protest Israel s settlement policies by boycotting businesses in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. The bill s particular target is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, a global campaign that seeks to apply economic and political pressure on Israel to comply with international law.Whether one approves or disapproves of the BDS movement itself, people should have a right to make up their own minds about it. Americans engage in boycotts every day when they decide not to buy from companies whose practices they oppose. Students have boycotted companies that sold clothing manufactured in sweatshops abroad. Environmentalists have boycotted Nestl  for its deforestation practices. By using their power in the marketplace, consumers can act collectively to express their political points of view. There is nothing illegal about such collective action; indeed, it is constitutionally protected.In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., the Supreme Court in 1982 upheld the right of NAACP activists to hold a mass economic boycott of segregated businesses in Mississippi. The court stated that the boycotters  exercise of their rights to  speech, assembly, and petition . . . to change a social order that had consistently treated them as second-class citizens  rested  on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values. This is not to say that all boycotters are automatically free speech heroes; indeed, BDS advocates have themselves at times shut down Israeli academics or speakers to the detriment of academic freedom. Thus, it s understandable that free speech advocates might not immediately identify BDS supporters as victims of censorship. But when government takes sides on a particular boycott and criminalizes those who engage in a boycott, it crosses a constitutional line.Cardin and other supporters argue that the Israel Anti-Boycott Act targets only commercial activity. In fact, the bill threatens severe penalties against any business or individual who does not purchase goods from Israeli companies operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and who makes it clear   say by posting on Twitter or Facebook   that their reason for doing so is to support a U.N.- or E.U.-called boycott. That kind of penalty does not target commercial trade; it targets free speech and political beliefs. Indeed, the bill would prohibit even the act of giving information to a U.N. body about boycott activity directed at Israel.The bill s chilling effect would be dramatic   and that is no doubt its very purpose. But individuals, not the government, should have the right to decide whether to support boycotts against practices they oppose. Neither individuals nor businesses should have to fear million-dollar penalties, years in prison and felony convictions for expressing their opinions through collective action. As an organization, we take no sides on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But regardless of the politics, we have and always will take a strong stand when government threatens our freedoms of speech and association. The First Amendment demands no less.See the original article at the Washington PostREAD MORE ISRAEL NEW AT: 21st Century Wire Israel FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"July 30, 2017"
MIKE ROWE SENDS A BRUTAL MESSAGE To The Media Trying To Label TRUMP Supporters As “Uneducated”,"An electrical contractor wrote to the 54-year-old host of  Dirty Jobs  to say that he finds it offensive when the media constantly refers to majority of the Republican nominee s supporters as  uneducated white men. If the media is referring to Trump supporters who happen to be male caucasians suffering from a lack of knowledge brought about by an absence of formal or practical instruction, than I guess  uneducated white men  is a fair description,  Rowe responded in a lengthy Facebook post.  However, if the Trump supporters in question are being dubbed  uneducated,  simply because they didn t earn a four-year degree, I d say the media s slip is showing. Let s assume that Donald Trump is indeed popular among white men who didn t graduate from college. The first question is, so what? Is this information newsworthy? Obviously, thousands of journalists think it is. To your point, the words  uneducated white men  now appear in hundreds of articles about Trump. But if this is truly important information, where were these reporters four years ago? In the last election, an even greater majority of African-American males who voted for President Obama had no college on their resume. Maybe I missed it, but I don t recall any headlines or articles that delved into Obama s popularity among  uneducated black men. If the media didn t care about the lack of college among black men supporting Obama, why do they care so much about the lack of college among white men supporting Trump? Moreover, when exactly did a lack of college become synonymous with a lack of education? There are many ways to become educated that don t involve the purchase of a diploma. Why would the media ignore thousands of apprenticeship programs, on-the-job-training opportunities, and all the other alternative educational options that have led so many people into so many successful careers? The answer is obvious   many in the press are looking for ways to impact the election. If a biased reporter can get away with labeling Trump supporters who didn t graduate from college as  uneducated,  he can simultaneously imply that any ballot cast for Trump is the hallmark of an  uneducated  voter. It s impossible for me to have this conversation and not think of my grandfather. Pop never made it to college. In fact, he never made it out of the 7th grade. But he never stopped learning or studying. He started as an electrician s helper, became an apprentice, a journeyman, a master electrician, a contractor, and then a small business owner. Later, as an electrical inspector for the state, he was responsible for guaranteeing the safety of hundreds of buildings in Maryland, as well as all the rides on the carnival midway at the State Fair. He was a modest man of real intelligence, admired and respected by everyone who knew him. But today, he d be right there with you, Albert   swelling out the ranks of  uneducated white men. Closing the skills gap and making college more affordable is beyond my pay grade, but it seems like we could start by reminding the media that a college degree is not the only path to success. It s well and good to promote higher education, but it s crazy to suggest the most expensive road to enlightenment is the best path for the most people. And it s equally nuts to pressure our kids to keep borrowing vast sums of money to become  educated  in careers that no longer exist. The media has minimized your work, insulted your intelligence, and ignored your contribution to civilized life. Try not to take it personally. Just keep doing what you do. Run your business. Vote your conscience. Keep the lights on for the rest of us. Read more: Daily Caller ",left-news,"Aug 28, 2016"
GRIFTER HILLARY CLINTON WAS PAID For Speeches Given To Government Contractors…No Ethics!,"A new report tells us what we already knew about Hillary s speeches government contractors paid Clinton big bucks for speeches opening a conflict of interest up that calls into question the ethics of the woman who wants to be our next president  Grifters like the Clintons don t care much for ethics though so this will be spun by the mean stream media and her supporters. Pitiful! WASHINGTON (AP)   It s not just Wall Street banks. Most companies and groups that paid Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to speak between 2013 and 2015 have lobbied federal agencies in recent years, and more than one-third are government contractors, an Associated Press review has found. Their interests are sprawling and would follow Clinton to the White House should she win election this fall.The AP s review of federal records, regulatory filings and correspondence showed that almost all the 82 corporations, trade associations and other groups that paid for or sponsored Clinton s speeches have actively sought to sway the government   lobbying, bidding for contracts, commenting on federal policy and in some cases contacting State Department officials or Clinton herself during her tenure as secretary of state.Presidents are not generally bound by many of the ethics and conflict-of-interest regulations that apply to non-elected executive branch officials, although they are subject to laws covering related conduct, such as bribery and illegal gratuities. Clinton s 94 paid appearances over two years on the speech circuit leave her open to scrutiny over decisions she would make in the White House or influence that may affect the interests of her speech sponsors.Via: AP",politics,"Apr 23, 2016"

"BREAKING: SECRET RECORDINGS About Clinton Foundation Caused Hostility, In-Fighting Between FBI Agents","Wow Peter Schweizer, author of  the chilling  Clinton Cash  book better make sure he has bodyguards wherever he goes, because his book could be the reason for the  collapse of the Clinton Crime family s house of cards .Secret recordings of a suspect talking about the Clinton Foundation fueled an internal battle between FBI agents who wanted to pursue the case and corruption prosecutors who viewed the statements as worthless hearsay, people familiar with the matter said.Agents, using informants and recordings from unrelated corruption investigations, thought they had found enough material to merit aggressively pursuing the investigation into the foundation that started in summer 2015 based on claims made in a book by a conservative author called  Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich,  these people said.The account of the case and resulting dispute comes from interviews with officials at multiple agencies.Starting in February and continuing today, investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and public-corruption prosecutors became increasingly frustrated with each other, as often happens within and between departments. At the center of the tension stood the U.S. attorney for Brooklyn, Robert Capers, who some at the FBI came to view as exacerbating the problems by telling each side what it wanted to hear, these people said. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Capers declined to comment.The roots of the dispute lie in a disagreement over the strength of the case, these people said, which broadly centered on whether Clinton Foundation contributors received favorable treatment from the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI didn t think much of the evidence, while investigators believed they had promising leads their bosses wouldn t let them pursue, they said.These details on the probe are emerging amid the continuing furor surrounding FBI Director James Comey s disclosure to Congress that new emails had emerged that could be relevant to a separate, previously closed FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email arrangement while she was secretary of state.On Wednesday, President Barack Obama took the unusual step of criticizing the FBI when asked about Mr. Comey s disclosure of the emails.Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter, some have blamed the FBI s No. 2 official, deputy director Andrew McCabe, claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer. His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.WSJ   The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said.Much of the skepticism toward the case came from how it started with the publication of a book suggesting possible financial misconduct and self-dealing surrounding the Clinton charity. The author of that book, Peter Schweizer a former speechwriting consultant for President George W. Bush was interviewed multiple times by FBI agents, people familiar with the matter said.The Clinton campaign has long derided the book as a poorly researched collection of false claims and unsubstantiated assertions. The Clinton Foundation has denied any wrongdoing, saying it does immense good throughout the world.Mr. Schweizer said in an interview that the book was never meant to be a legal document, but set out to describe  patterns of financial transactions that circled around decisions Hillary Clinton was making as secretary of state. As 2015 came to a close, the FBI and Justice Department had a general understanding that neither side would take major action on Clinton Foundation matters without meeting and discussing it first. In February, a meeting was held in Washington among FBI officials, public-integrity prosecutors and Leslie Caldwell, the head of the Justice Department s criminal division. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York Mr. Capers  office didn t attend, these people said.The public-integrity prosecutors weren t impressed with the FBI presentation, people familiar with the discussion said.  The message was,  We re done here,    a person familiar with the matter said.Justice Department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions.Following the February meeting, officials at Justice Department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to  stand down,  a person familiar with the matter said.The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made, these people said. The agents listening to the recordings couldn t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate, but it was, they thought, worth checking out.For entire story: WSJ ",politics,"Nov 3, 2016"

Then ranting about blood-stained sheets upon those women s beds. Somewhere a doctor s wondering why he took her off her meds.Madonna parked her walker to begin her caustic din, Dreams of blowing up the Whitehouse as senility sets in. Even in her senior years . . . the party never ends. She dances  round her nursing home in Vera Wang Depends.The Liberals, you must admit, have done some crazy things.

 Drunken Cop Arrested After Holding Fast Food Workers At Gun Point (VIDEO),"New released video shows Santa Clara County sheriff s deputy Benjamin Lee in a standoff with fellow police officers, after he pulled a gun on employees of a fast food restaurant in January.Cop Block reports that the video was recorded by an Uber driver who was waiting to pick up his drive thru order at a Jack In the Box restaurant at the same time that Lee was there. The line was backed up, with at least a dozen cars waiting for orders. Lee was reportedly several cars ahead of the uber driver.According to the driver, the manager of the restaurant came out to inform the drive-thru customers that the cook was  having some kind of breakdown and did not want to cook anymore. The unidentified uber driver says he decided to leave and go to another restaurant.The drunken police officer reportedly became enraged at the manager, saying  I want my food.  When the manager was unable to deliver, Lee pulled out a gun. He reportedly held both the restaurant manager and the drive-thru worker at gunpoint. The worker later told witnesses that he thought he was being robbed.Someone inside the restaurant called the police. When officers arrived on the scene, Lee refused to exit his vehicle or follow commands given by police. The video shows Lee engaging in a long standoff with the officers, who are attempting to get the drunken cop to surrender.Watch the video below, courtesy of FreeFresno on YouTube.  If this had been anyone other than a drunk, armed off-duty cop, it s likely the person would have been shot the minute the police rolled up.Lee was placed on  administrative leave  pending an internal investigation.In a public statement regarding the incident, Roger Winslow of the Deputy Sheriff s Association of Santa Clara told KGO: Mr. Lee has a good reputation with the sheriff s office. He s a hard worker and respected by his peers. Members of the a newly-created community task force expressed their frustration with the way the police department polices its own.Retired Santa Clara County Sheriff s Captain Kevin Jensen summed it up by saying: This is too much. It s overwhelming evidence that there is a cultural problem at the top, as well as many problems at the bottom. Image credit: video screen capture KGO-TV",News,"July 24, 2016"
"WATCH: ANGRY PARENTS WALK OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL’S RACIST, ANTI-COP COMMENCEMENT SPEECH [Video]","Another leftist educator uses the precious time they ve been given to deliver an inspirational speech to high school graduates to instead, deliver a radical, divisive and hateful message. A Missouri high school principal sent some parents toward the exits last week when he made a disparaging remark about police  killing young black men  during a graduation speech.Belton High School Principal Fred Skretta was talking about why he became a teacher when he suddenly veered off in an unexpected direction. I wanted to be a teacher because I wanted to change the world, I wanted to make it a better place,  he told the audience.  I m going to be honest with you, in a lot of ways I fear that we are not there yet. If we were there, we wouldn t have conflicts between police killing young black men. https://youtu.be/mQHKFGBPREUNever mind the poor sentence structure. Some parents were so offended by the commentary they got up and walked out of the ceremony, according to Fox 4 News. I found it very inappropriate, I am highly offended,  a parent said.  You don t use the platform of a child s graduation to push a political agenda or push your personal opinions.  Your job is supposed to inspire, educate, inform and not indoctronize one way or the other. Interestingly, Fox4News reported that Skretta posted an apology on social media after the ceremony, but the Twitter account appears to have been deleted since then.The apology, according to the Fox affiliate: TY all at #BHS graduation! I apologize if my remarks were offensive.

" ‘Go F*ck Yourselves’: Larry Wilmore SLAMS Ted Cruz, Fox News Over Anti-Muslim Rhetoric (VIDEO)","The terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium have brought out the Muslim-haters on the right in full force   particularly GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. The creepiest candidate on the right has openly called for the police to increase patrols in  Muslim neighborhoods,  and has gotten backing for his disgusting statements from the network that is a longtime mouthpiece of the bigoted right   Fox News.Well, there s one person who isn t taking their bullshit lying down: Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore. On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Wilmore blasted Cruz and Fox over their bigotry, and especially their insistence that anyone questioning their hateful words is just being  politically correct. Gooooooooo f*ck yourselves.   I mean, a major news network, so-called major news network, and a major presidential candidate slamming a major religion has nothing to do with political correctness. It s just wrong. To round out the hilarious   but truthful   segment, Wilmore interviewed Masir Ali, an expert on the Middle East. He weighed in from a snowy vacation, complete with snowboard, to show everyone just how dumb Ted Cruz and Fox News really are.The Nightly Show host is right. They are wrong. Bigotry and discrimination are a huge and major selling point with right-wingers, and here in the year 2016 that is just shameful.

 Hillary Just Personally Went On Twitter To DESTROY Trump’s Ridiculous Visit To Mexico (TWEET),"Donald Trump got to play make-believe on Wednesday afternoon as he went to Mexico to speak with President Enrique Pe a Nieto.Trump, who has absolutely no diplomatic experience whatsoever, apparently got cold feet when it came to his big, beautiful, great, wonderful, and spectacular wall he wants to build along the border between the United States and Mexico.It would seem the reality television star couldn t muster up the courage to demand Mexico to pay for it because Mexico s president said afterwards that he would never pay for the wall, and Trump, instead of saying that, decided to try to cover up the conversation by saying it never happened.Al inicio de la conversaci n con Donald Trump dej  claro que M xico no pagar  por el muro.  Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) August 31, 2016Translated, that says: At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, I made clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.

 Federal Judge Rules That Trump DID Incite Violence During 2016 Campaign (DETAILS),"Hearing about violence at Trump s rallies was a regular occurrence during his 2016 campaign and that violence was often brought on by Trump himself.At a rally back in March of 2016, Trump yelled,  Get  em out of here,  referencing the peaceful protesters in the crowd, which then prompted his supporters to physically attack them. The protesters who were attacked brought suit against Trump and it looks like he s finally going to have to pay for it   in more ways than one.Trump s lawyers have been using the free speech defense, but a Federal Judge isn t buying it. Citing case law from 1960 s student protests and race riots, Judge David Hale of Kentucky, rejected motions to dismiss the case and said that Trump did indeed cite violence at his rally. It is plausible that Trump s direction to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force. Unlike the statements at issue in the cases cited by the Trump Defendants,  get  em out of here  is stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command. Trump craves the sound of people cheering him on, and no doubt probably enjoyed seeing his supporters attack people who were brave enough to show up and stand against him, so it wasn t surprising when Trump denied wrongdoing of any sort and blamed it all on the  bad dudes  who were protesting. In fact, that phrase became a regular mantra for Trump. We have some protesters who are bad dudes,  he said. They have done bad things, and they are really dangerous and get in there and start hitting people, and we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people.   It s usually the police, the municipal government because I don t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. The suit against Trump also names the three individuals responsible for the attacks, one of whom, Matthew Heimbach, is a leader of the white supremacist group Traditional Youth Network from Paoli, Indiana, which will probably make it that much worse for Trump. Watching him try to squirm his way out of this one should be really fun!Featured image via Getty/Sarah Rice",News,"April 2, 2017"
MUSLIM ATHLETE Given “Hero’s Welcome” ARRESTED For Sexual Abuse Of 12-Yr Old Girl After Senator Schumer Helped Him Get Around U.S. Visa Denial,"An Indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of U.S. lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the World Snowshoe Championship in New York has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor.It was a long journey for Indian snowshoe champion Hussain and his coach to the World Snowshoe Championships in Saranac Lake, New York last weekend.The pair were initially denied visas to travel to the U.S. in the chaotic days following the Trump administration s travel ban, but with the help of Saranac s mayor and   according to Mir   the office of Democratic Sen. Chuck Schemer, the American Embassy in New Delhi reversed their decision Feb. 17 and allowed them to travel to the competition.Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, an outspoken opponent of President Trump s attempts to more carefully vet refugees and visa holder s coming into the United States, bragged about getting around Trump s temporary travel restrictions on his Facebook page:Hussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. Although India is not one of the seven countries that was part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States were turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.  National PostHussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying. There was a moment when the two were alone, and that s when the incident occurred,  Potthast said. The girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.Hussain remains jailed on $10,000 bond. Khan said the athlete told him he had done nothing wrong.A spokesman for Schumer said the senator helped with the visa process at the request of Saranac Lake and described the charges against Hussain as  extremely troubling. A spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator thinks the charges are  extremely serious. During their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf.  Pack your bags. Next year you are coming to Kashmir,  Hussain told them, according to one of Khan s Facebook posts. Washington PostThe athlete s coach said he is innocent. Mir had said that the visa would not have been issued without the  personal efforts  of Schumer and New York s other Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand. On Saturday, Schumer celebrated Hussain s  rock star  welcome in a Facebook post, saying that the United States is  still a country that welcome athletes from across the globe to compete in our stadiums, our snow-covered fields and everywhere in between.

BREAKING: OBAMA’S RACE WAR PART II…BRAWL BREAKS OUT IN FRONT OF SC STATEHOUSE OVER CONFEDERATE FLAG,"A defender of the Confederate flag who says the flag is NOT about race says: I m gonna tell you one thing, I ain t sitting down; this ll just make me walk taller. One man has been arrested after a fight over the Confederate flag in front of the South Carolina Statehouse.The brawl started about 7:15 p.m. Monday when about a dozen vehicles with Confederate flag supporters pulled up in front of the Statehouse and stopped in the middle of the street, Public Safety Department spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said in a statement. About 10 of the flag supporters clashed with about 30 people who were on the Statehouse grounds protesting the flag, the statement said. The blood on my face, the blood in my teeth, the blood on my hands is no comparison to the Southern blood that runs through my veins,  Joe Linder told CBS News.Linder, who was hit during the fight, supports the Confederate flag and says  racism has no part  in it. I m gonna tell you one thing, I ain t sitting down; this ll just make me walk taller,  he told CBS News.About 50 officers responded and contained the clash, including officers from the Bureau of Protective Services assigned to the Statehouse, as well as Columbia police, University of South Carolina officers and the South Carolina Highway Patrol. Two blocks of the street in front of the Statehouse was closed for a brief time during the disturbance. Sydney Baldwin told CBS News the fight began when someone took his flag.  I jumped out of my truck,  Baldwin said.  That was all I did, was grab my flag and I got hit in the side.  Nicholas Thompson, 25, of Irmo, South Carolina, has been charged with disorderly conduct. It wasn t clear if he has an attorney. The Confederate flag has been a focus of protests since the fatal shooting of nine people at a historic black church in Charleston on June 17. Public Safety Director Leroy Smith told reporters it was unfortunate that Columbia had a fight when there have been no problems reported in Charleston, where the shooting occurred. The suspect in the Charleston shooting, Dylann Storm Roof, appears in a number of photographs online with the Confederate flag, prompting calls for removal of the flag from in front of the Statehouse. South Carolina lawmakers are expected next week to consider proposals to take the flag down and move it to a museum. The flag has flown at the Statehouse since the 1960s. It was removed from the Statehouse dome and placed at a Confederate Soldier Monument in front of the Statehouse in 2000.Via: Atlanta CBS Local",politics,"Jun 30, 2015"

Many believe that John  Songbird  McCain spilled his guts to get out of being tortured. There is evidence that McCain received  special  medical treatment from a Soviet physician and other  considerations  to avoid being tortured just so he could come home.No one disputes that McCain was a Vietnam POW, he spent 5  years in captivity in North Vietnam when he was shot down in his Skyhawk dive bomber on Oct. 26, 1967, and was taken prisoner with fractures in his right leg and both arms.Despite the notoriety he received upon his return he has been the subject of damning articles, and criticism by other veterans, and for good reason. McCain has a lot to hide, and has gone to great length to keep what happened in Vietnam a secret.He voted against a bill that was otherwise unanimously passed that would have released sealed records that would have revealed what happened in Vietnam, presumably because those records would have confirmed his dishonorable actions.

CHURCHES OFFER SANCTUARY To Protect Illegal Aliens Ahead Of DHS Raids,"The DHS has announced that they ll be raiding places that house illegals and deporting them. This could get ugly and it will only garner sympathy for the illegal aliens who ve broken federal law by crossing our border. Over 10,000 illegal minors came across our border in Sept/Oct which is a record for this time of year. The big question in all of this would have to be why Jeh Johnson s rules for deportation have been so lenient. Because of his leniency, word has gotten back to Central America that you can just surrender to border patrol and you re in. Now we have millions and millions of illegals who re roaming around America and we have no clue who they are. The Sanctuary Movement is taking it upon themselves to bring in and protect illegals while putting Americans in danger. Thousands of criminal illegal aliens were simply released last year. Yes, Obama let them go All Americans are in danger from this open border policy and those in the church community should go to jail for aiding this invasion of our southern border. Leaders of the church-based Sanctuary Movement vowed on Friday to offer their places of worship as refuge for immigrants facing deportation under an Obama administration crackdown on Central American families who entered the United States illegally.The statement came two days after The Washington Post first reported the U.S. government was planning a series of raids to remove hundreds of undocumented families as early as January in the first such large-scale effort targeting the recent flood of border crossers.The Department of Homeland Security preparations to intensify deportations of Central American migrants, confirmed by U.S. government sources, drew immediate fire from Democratic presidential candidates and human rights groups.Leaders of the multi-denominational Sanctuary Movement, which has sheltered at least 10 immigrants from deportation over the past 18 months, joined in the criticism on Friday, alluding to the biblical Nativity story of Mary and Joseph seeking refuge before the birth of Jesus. As pastors we know that each and every family is a holy family,  said the Rev. Alison Harrington, pastor of Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Arizona.  We open our doors to today s Josephs and Marys.   The gift we have to offer on Christmas Day is the gift of sanctuary. The Sanctuary Movement, which Harrington said encompasses about 50 congregations in a dozen U.S. cities, made headlines in January by providing refuge in Philadelphia to a Honduran woman whose two children were born in the United States. She ultimately won a two-year reprieve from deportation.The Rev. Noel Anderson, a coordinator for the affiliated Church World Service, put the overall number of congregations supporting the sanctuary network at about 300 in more than 20 states nationwide.Immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua have been streaming into the United States from Mexico by the thousands since early 2014   many of them unaccompanied minors and families   fleeing extreme poverty, gangs and drug violence in their home countries.Most were detained after turning themselves in at the border seeking asylum, but were released to surrounding communities after initial screening to await further proceedings.A 2008 U.S. anti-human tracking law bars undocumented Central American children from being summarily sent back, as they could be if they were from Mexico or Canada.Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the new campaign by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency marks an expansion from mostly targeting individuals to pursuing families with undocumented members who have already been ordered to leave.Asked why the agency was singling out families, a spokesperson said the crackdown focused on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security,  whether alone or with family members. Support for the move came from U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, who said it would help  eliminate the incentive that results from allowing 95.6 percent of these illegal immigrants to stay. Harrington said she feared the crackdown will ensnare many who lacked sufficient time or legal representation to prepare asylum claims and  were too quickly put through the system.

SOCIALIST BERNIE SANDERS Can’t Explain Single Payer or Why Blue States Rejected It [Video],"Bernie Sanders should know his socialized medicine but in an exchange on Sunday he failed when he was pressed to explain why a single-payer health care system was rejected in Vermont and California, two staunchly Democratic states:CNN host Jake Tapper said that California and Vermont are  cobalt blue states  and asked how single-payer could be affordable at the national level if they rejected the system at the state level because of the expense:Single-payer failed to pass in both California and Vermont after lawmakers were unable to figure out how to fund the system. Voters in Colorado also rejected single-payer last year.Sanders pushed back against Tapper, citing  studies that he has seen,  and said that single-payer would save the average family  significant sums of money. If you look at Canada s single-payer health care system per capita, their costs are far far less than the United States,  Sanders said.   If you look at the UK, if you look at countries around the world, all of which have different approaches to a national health care system, in every instance, they are spending substantially less per capita than we pay in the United States.

 Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around. As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had.

"RUSH LIMBAUGH: TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION STANCE MAY WIN REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS","Trump s not dropping in the polls in spite of the GOP and mainstream media s best efforts On The Rush Limbaugh Show, the popular conservative talk radio host discussed Donald Trump s immigration plan and told listeners that Trump s meteoric rise in the polls is entirely attributable to his mainstream position on immigration, which appeals to a broad array of voters.In a lengthy segment, Limbaugh laid out several of the policy items addressed in Trump s in-depth immigration proposal, such as ending birthright citizenship, deporting illegal immigrants, and building a border fence.Limbaugh argued that Trump s mainstream stance on immigration stands in stark contrast to the extreme position held by the open borders class that runs the country:Now, the inside-the-Beltway people, when they hear that, they cringe,  Oh, my God, don t say that s what Republicans [stand for]   oh, God.  [But the] people are standing up and cheering. They don t want their country given away, for crying out loud! [ ] I m telling you, that one has people standing up and cheering.Limbaugh explained that Trump s success is,  due to substance and it is due to immigration,  insisting that,  It s obvious that that issue is the foundational issue for Trump.  Limbaugh told listeners that Trump has used the issue of immigration to distinguish himself from all of the other Republican candidates currently running:It s amazing. Sixteen people are running for the presidency, and  15 of them are perceived to have essentially the same policy on immigration. One of them is entirely different from the other 15, and he s the one who s leading. Now, don t you think people inside the Beltway should be able to look at this and put two and two together and figure out what is causing this? They can chalk it up to celebrity, they can chalk it up to pop culture, they can chalk it up to circus.Limbaugh argued that Trump has been able to surpass all other Republican candidates because he has adopted a position on immigration that prioritizes the desires of the American voter above the desires of Republican donors and inside-the-beltway elites:Both parties, conservative-liberal, Republican-Democrat, I don t think they have the slightest idea what the vast majority of people in this country think about immigration and what s happening to the country, and they don t want any part of it. And of course the establishment is seen as wanting to ramrod their view of immigration down everybody s throat. Trump s the only guy standing up against it  I don t think these people have any idea just how angry, frightened, fearful, a pretty big majority of the people in this country are, that we are losing the country, and we re losing it because of immigration  And they see both parties in cahoots to make it happen, and they don t understand it. People that love America do not understand this. I mean, even when you tell  em,  Well, big-money donors say this because they want X, Y, and Z,  it still doesn t make any sense. How does that trump patriotism? How does all that matter more to these people, elected officials, than patriotism, love of country, America, shining city on a hill and all that, why does that not matter anymore? And there isn t a single candidate for president addressing the issue in a way that resonates with the American people, particularly Republican primary voters, not one, until Donald Trump comes along.Limbaugh explained that Trump s position represents the mainstream view on immigration:  Trump is not seen as a radical at all in this by average, ordinary Americans. He s not seen as an extremist. He s not seen as a fringe kook.  Instead,  Trump s ideas are not fringe, are not outliers, they are mainstream. They represent the views and the attitudes of the people who make this country work. To reinforce this point, Limbaugh highlighted a recent article by The Washington Examiner s Byron York which  found a recent academic paper published by Stanford Professor David Broockman and Berkeley PhD candidate Douglas Ahler, and it suggests a majority of the public s views on immigration are closer to Trump s than to the advocates of comprehensive immigration reform. Limbaugh argued that by embracing a platform of immigration moderation   i.e. returning immigration to lower, more normal historical levels from today s surging record highs  Trump will appeal to a wide-range of Democratic and Independent voters.Republican Party officials, inside-the-Beltway officials tell us that we can t win the White House anymore without getting additional votes besides just Republican votes  We need to get Democrats. We need to get independents  Okay, fine, well, guess what, who s doing that? Who is expanding the party beyond what it is normally thought to be? Trump, of all people. And yet they re lowering the hammer on the guy each and every day, when it is Donald Trump who is executing what the Republican Party says they need to win.Indeed, polling commissioned by the National Republican Senate Committee (NRSC) recently found that a populist position on immigration has mass appeal amongst women, minorities, and non-Republican voters in addition to the base of Republican voters.Limbaugh believes that other Republican candidates could see similar success if they were to adopt Trump s position on immigration:If just one of these Republican candidates   just one of them   had come out forcefully for America on this immigration business, Trump wouldn t even exist as a candidate. Well, he might exist, but he wouldn t have such a free road in this one issue.In fact, Limbaugh predicted that Trump s announcement will influence many candidates on the critical issue of immigration:The me-toos are beginning.  Hey, my proposal is just like Trump s.  You watch  The me-toos are now starting. Rather than people trying to steal it, people are gonna want to get in on it. It has the potential here to be a genuine movement, so transformative that the inside-the-Beltway people, even while studying it and looking straight at it, still stand a chance of being blindsided by it.Limbaugh also made the larger point that much of the hand-wringing in the GOP over Trump s immigration platform is curious given that uncontrolled immigration has put one of the largest states in America firmly outside the reach of the GOP, and if it is not curtailed, more states like Virginia will follow:If you want to find the future of the Republican Party and the country, look at California. There isn t a single Republican in statewide office. There never will be in the future. It s not gonna happen. The Republican Party practically doesn t exist statewide. The economy in California, you talk about inequality, the haves and have-nots, it s no more pronounced anywhere in the country than in California.You don t have to go back that far where the Republican Party owned it. Routinely elected governors, those governors became presidential candidates. And I ll tell you when you can tie it to. You can tie the end of the Republican Party in California to 1986, and that was the Simpson-Mazzoli amnesty immigration bill. We re talking back then 3.9 million illegal aliens granted amnesty. Since then it s been curtains for the Republican Party, which means constant victory for the Democrat Party. They have shaped that state, and it s a mess. And it s a harbinger of where we re going nationwide. Via: Breitbart",politics,"Aug 17, 2015"
" So, About That ‘Stand Down’ Order In Benghazi From Hillary– IT NEVER HAPPENED (VIDEO)","That dreadful night in Benghazi, Libya in September of 2012 when the lives of four Americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget. We shall never forget it for two reasons: because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life, and because Republicans and Fox News insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in her reaction to events that took place.Clarifying one of the longest held myths by Fox News and conservatives, Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta spoke to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell. Not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove Hillary as uncaring and incompetent, but he also explained how everything that could have been done, was done.Mitchell first asks Panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in Benghazi:Now you re here in Washington because you re going to be testifying to the Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. You have already testified to other committees, but to this committee, and there s a new movie coming out, 13 Hours, and it s about to be released. It is accusing the CIA operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time. And the suggestion is that, if not for that order to stand down, that Chris Stevens and the others might have been saved. First of all, you were at the Pentagon at the time, I believe. Was there any order to stand down that you know of?Panetta responds:Absolutely not. You know, I m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented, but from my experience, and from the role that I played as secretary of defense, there was never any order to stand down. On the contrary, the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives.Delving further into if there were any sort of Hillary Clinton misstep, Mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order:There s also a report, several reports, that the Pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort, military effort to the State Department, and that someone, the suggestion is Hillary Clinton, said,  no thanks, we don t need the help or stand down or stand back.  Was there any effort by the Pentagon to intervene that the State Department rejected and would she have even been in the role?Panetta offers an answer that many right-wingers are not going to like whatsoever, the truth:I m not aware of any such effort at all. As a matter of fact, after meeting with the president, I immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces, to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved, and we in fact put forces in place. The problem was that [the] attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there. This is a tragic event. It s tragic in a number of ways. But most importantly, it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately, I think, doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives.Panetta is exactly right. This tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against Hillary Clinton. We need to learn from what happened in Benghazi and make sure it never happens again. We also need to, once and for all, put the myth to bed that Hillary was incompetent. She, of all people, is quite aware of the loss that happened that day. She s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again. Video/Featured image: MMFA",News,"January 8, 2016"
 National Police Union Begs Trump To Make Racial Profiling Legal Again – And He Just Might,"The National Fraternal Order of Police knows exactly what the President-elect s values are and knows it s a massive advantage in its quest to return America to a less progressive time.With full knowledge that Donald Trump does not give a damn about minorities and is in full support of profiling African Americans and Hispanics, the National Fraternal Order of Police has called on Trump to reverse or amend the broad, Bush-era ban on racial profiling. The ban on racial profiling has been around since 2003, when President George W. Bush created guidelines that prevented federal agents from factoring race or ethnicity in investigations. Now, the Fraternal Order of Police is acting to reverse that ban, as its website states that racial profiling is a  statistical disparity  and that the current ban burdens  law enforcement agency to somehow prove itself innocent of engaging in the unlawful use of race in its procedures and practices.  The organization also doesn t like that the ban is meant to protect racial and ethnic minorities,  which they feel is  excluding members of other races. While the proposed lifting of the ban is absolutely ridiculous, it becomes truly scary when you consider that Trump himself has implied that he is in favor of racial profiling. It was only a few months ago, in September, when Trump said that police forces needed more leniency when it comes to investigating people based on their race. Trump said: Our local police   they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don t want to be accused of profiling.They see somebody that s suspicious, they will profile. Look what s going on: Do we really have a choice? We re trying to be so politically correct in our country, and this is only going to get worse. Apparently, Trump is oblivious to the fact that there have been various studies proving that racial profiling is ineffective and may actually be counterproductive. Of course, the National Fraternal Order of Police has accurately identified Trump as their guy. They not only supported him during his campaign, but noted his  real commitment to law enforcement.  The organization s president, Chuck Canterbury, said: Mr. Trump, however, has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today. He understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make America safe again. Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",News,"December 19, 2016"

 Heidi Cruz Is Not Doing Her Husband Any Favors By What She Just Said On Camera,"While she has come out and defended her husband against the very serious allegations that he is, in fact, the Zodiac Killer, Heidi Cruz may have said something more damaging at a campaign stop in Indiana.The Cruz campaign misspoke, but some say it was a Freudian slip when Heidi Cruz said, on camera: Do you know that Ted has been winning the millennial vote in state after state. He s been winning the women s vote in state after state. Ted is an immigrant. He is Hispanic. We can unify this party.

Cruz just gave all the ammo in the world to the Trump campaign with that statement. Considering the fact they encompass a group of xenophobic bigots, there is no way in hell they ll consider voting for  an immigrant  and a  Hispanic  now, especially after the  alliance  between Cruz and Kasich.And of course Trump pounced on Heidi s comments, saying: Heidi Cruz   nice woman. She said this one:  My husband s an immigrant!  He s an immigrant! That s what I ve been trying to say   She was maybe trying to put a Latin turn on it. He was born in Canada, folks.I wonder when Republicans are going to accuse the Cruz campaign of playing the race card. While Fiorina accuses the Clinton campaign of playing up gender for support, maybe she should paying attention to what her running mate s wife is saying.Coupled with his  basketball ring  comment and now Heidi s  he s an immigrant  comment, Cruz s chances of winning in Indiana have plummeted.

 WTF: Top Trump Advisor Tells Trump To Kill Liberals (AUDIO),"As if Donald Trump isn t paranoid and delusional enough on his own, one of the people who carries a lot of influence with 45 is one of the most certifiably insane (in my amateur opinion) people to ever hit the airwaves, rabid right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones is now advising Trump to use violence against those who oppose him, and the frightening thing is, Trump could listen.On his YouTube channel show on Monday, Jones fed into Trump s ridiculous conspiracy theory that his offices were wiretapped by President Obama.And I feel so sorry for people that can t see it, that have been caught by this weird demon spirit of the age, to just go along with evil and corruption and just thank god, Mr. President, that we re not the scumbag Obama, the loser of eight years, the failure.

Codify the data each day, go after them with their own words. Hold up where they admit they were wiretapping your Trump Tower and then show The New York Times saying they re not doing it, just like you have been doing it, and they will fall.There were even more paranoid rantings, but the bottom line was that Trump should kill all his enemies before they take him down:They re going to destroy you, they re going to destroy Barron, they re going to destroy Eric, they re going to destroy Donald Jr., they re going destroy me, they re going to destroy Matt Drudge, they re going to destroy Ron Paul, they re going to destroy anybody like [White House senior adviser] Stephen Bannon that actually stood up for the little people, because that example can t be allowed.

"McMaster Gave Susan Rice Continued Access To Classified Info, She Still Has Clearance","This very important scandal is unfolding before us. It has many, many  legs  with different Obama administration officials involved. Don t count on the main stream media to fill you in. This is a big deal!Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests. Circa News has been uncovering disturbing information regarding the  unmasking  of American citizens and how Obama provided a way for the unmasking to go  unfettered . Susan Rice and Samantha Power both have  unfettered access  to classified material and likely unmasked many in government. Sara Carter reports below on H.R. McMaster s involvement in this unmasking:Almost one month after it was disclosed that former President Obama s National Security Adviser Susan Rice was unmasking members of President Trump s team and other Americans, Trump s own national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, sent an official letter giving her unfettered and continuing access to classified information and waiving her  need-to-know  requirement on anything she viewed or received during her tenure, Circa has confirmed.The undated and unclassified letter from McMaster was sent in the mail to Rice s home during the last week of April. Trump was not aware of the letter or McMaster s decision, according to two Senior West Wing officials and an intelligence official, who spoke to Circa on condition that they not be named. This is the letter from McMaster to Rice. Names, phone numbers and personal addresses have been blurred. I hereby waive the requirement that you must have a  need-to-know  to access any classified information contained in items you  originated, reviewed, signed or received while serving,  as National Security Adviser,  the letter said. The letter also states that the  NSC will continue to work with you to ensure the appropriate security clearance documentation remains on file to allow you access to classified information. Circa revealed in March that during President Obama s tenure, top aides   including Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch   routinely reviewed intelligence reports received from the National Security Agency s incidental intercepts of Americans abroad. They were doing so by taking advantage of rules Obama relaxed starting in 2011 to help the government better fight terrorism, espionage by foreign enemies and hacking threats, according to documents obtained by Circa.In June, the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Rice as part of the committee s larger investigation into the unmasking of Americans under the Obama administration. Rice maintains that she never accessed the information inappropriately and has agreed to testify before the committee.Under the law, and under certain conditions, it is common practice for some senior government officials to be given the unfettered access to classified information, and their  need to know  is waived under  Executive Order 13526 Section 4.4 Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government Personnel.  But the White House officials told Circa that under the current congressional investigation, and given President Trump s ongoing concern that members of his team were unmasked, Rice s clearance should have been limited to congressional testimony only or revoked until the end of the investigation. Rice and Brennan have confirmed they sought the unredacted names of Americans in NSA-sourced intelligence reports, but insisted their requests were routine parts of their work and that they did nothing improper. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also has legal authority to unmask officials.In a June tweet, Trump called the revelation that Rice and other Obama senior officials were unmasking members of his team the  big story  the  unmasking and surveillance  that took place during the Obama administration. Basically, this letter which was signed in the last week of April undercuts the president s assertion that Susan Rice s unmasking activity was inappropriate. In essence, anybody who committed a violation as she did would not be given access to classified information,  said a senior West Wing official, who was shown the document by Circa and verified its authenticity.  In fact, they would have their security clearance and right to  need-to-know  stripped. The point is, is that it lowers the bar for her,  the Senior West Wing official said. This memo McMaster sent to Rice makes it so that she doesn t have to prove a continuing  need-to-know  to have access to classified information and in effect is a White House pardon of Susan Rice and could be used by other Obama officials who conducted targeted unmasking of the campaign as a defense,  the official added.REMEMBER THAT RICE RECENTLY LIED AGAIN ABOUT THE UNMASKING   SHE DID IT ON NATIONAL TV:If the Obama administration was good at anything, it was good at lying to hijack the narrative.Remember when Susan Rice lied after Benghazi? It is what she does so well. Flash forward to the latest hot water she s in and it s hard to tell what she d want us believe this time WHICH SHOULD WE BELIEVE? WHAT SHE SAID TO ANDREA MITCHELL OR TO JUDY WOODRUFF?Susan Rice appeared on Andrea Mitchell. She claimed she didn t leak  nothing to nobody Did you catch that double negative?There might be more to that because she s using words in the two sentences very carefully .Check it out:SUSAN RICE VERSION ONE:WATCH: Susan Rice insists  I leaked nothing to nobody  https://t.co/kAsbu4VJDN  MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 4, 2017SUSAN RICE VERSION TWO: I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble!Read more: circa news",politics,"Aug 3, 2017"

 Tim Kaine BURNS Unhinged Trump: He’s ‘Swinging At Every Phantom Of His Own Imagination’,"Donald Trump has been coming apart at the seams before our very eyes. The public has noticed, certainly, but so has someone else: Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Hillary Clinton s veep said the following of Trump s attempts to blame the rest of the world for the accusations of groping that keep coming out against him: He is swinging at every phantom of his own imagination because he knows he s losing. These remarks were made on ABC s This Week, and Kaine also made it crystal clear that Trump s allegations that Hillary s campaign had anything to do with the avalanche of unflattering stories that have come out ever since Trump was caught on a hot mic with then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, insisting that he could do anything he wanted to women because he is a star.While discussing Trump, Kaine also reminded America of the orange buffoon s bullying behavior, and said that the hot mic tape is what gave these women the courage to tell the stories of their experience with Trump: That s what s going on. It s not because of our campaign, but it s very characteristic of Donald Trump that now he s blaming these women.He s making weird claims that, no, I couldn t have assaulted this person, she s not attractive enough to assault. How bizarre is that? He s blaming the media; he s blaming the GOP; he s saying that America can t run a fair election. And this is what bullies do. Tim Kaine is right. Trump bullies and threatens anyone who he can t get his way with. He makes sure that people understand that he ll make their lives a living hell if they dare to go against him, no matter how horrible his behavior has been.Well, it looks like Trump has finally met his match, and the tantrum he throws when he loses on election night is sure to be one for the ages.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2016"

It is unclear what set the bees off, but Mikesell warns that if you see bees you should call a professional rather than attempt to deal with a problem yourself. Experts say that the attack was unsurprising, as it is the height of  swarm season. The attack left numerous prayer rugs   and pretty much everything else   drenched in foam that members spent an exhorbitant amount of time shoveling out of the mosque with  whatever they could find,  Fox 10 s Marcy Jones, who called the prayer rugs  oriental,  reported. She warns people not to wear black, red, or yellow because the bees might  think that you are a bear  and become more aggressive around you.It s fortunate that no one was hurt too seriously, but when Fox News Insider posted this important national story on Facebook, readers reacted exactly how one would expect people who have been groomed by Stupidville to react   with utter glee.Some declared this to be God s judgement on the followers of Allah, completely ignorant that  Allah  is simply Arabic for  God  and the two religions actually worship the same deity. Others publicly wished that some of the Muslims injured in the attack had died. Some wanted more bees. The Stupid Part of America completely outdid themselves as they referenced Biblical plagues (because a swarm of bees is totally like a plague of locusts,  while others seized upon the opportunity to tell each other how much they hate Muslims.In short, finding out about this bee attack was the best thing that happened to many conservatives this week:                            This is Trump s America, folks. The supposed  Christian  Right is so wrapped up in hate that they are unable to show a shred of compassion when a group of people are attacked by a tiny-yet-deadly creature   all because they believe their imaginary friend is better than the other, who is actually the same guy.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 3, 2016"
DIGITAL TYRANNY: Google and Facebook’s Automated Censorship Program (I Hope You Can Speak Chinese),"21st Century Wire says Based on their own reports and public statements, it was clear that both Google and Facebook, and others, were engaged in formulating a wide program of censorship in order to  tackle  what the corporations deem as  offensive speech  or  hate speech . Although based on the political biases of members of these corporations, the actual administration of this will be done by fully hidden and unaccountable automated computer algorithms. According to new reports, the new methods are not merely the manipulation of metrics used to downplay content. These are incredibly clandestine and very sinister measures: without visibly shutting down an account, this new automated censorship process will simply make an account holder s posts invisible to their friends, fans and followers, in what Google/YouTube is calling  a limited state  in order to  isolate and contain  a targeted user   even if they have NOT violated the user terms of services. This is designed not only to  disappear  important opinions and information   but also to frustrate users, in the hopes that they will eventually abandon the platform as a viable content distribution network.We believe that Facebook may also be implementing similar restrictions on political speech. Mark Zuckerberg s admission to Angela Merkel that Facebook was working on eliminating  hate speech  was an early indicator, and undoubtedly the election of Donald Trump, and the subsequent scapegoating of  fake news  by Clinton supporters, has since pushed many  progressive  Silicon Valley executives over the edge. However, things may have advanced considerably since then. On August 5th, 21stCenturyWire.com Editor Patrick Henningsen had his personal Facebook newsfeed for 21WIRE articles  disappeared : UPDATE: Sunday afternoon GMT, it seems that the invisible admins at Facebook has (quietly) re-opened his profile s newsfeed which seems to be visible to some of my friends now, although yesterday s posts are still HIDDEN (you can see them by scrolling down his timeline). They did not respond to Henningsen s written complaint via customer service however   no surprise there, as they never have done before. The important aspect to focus on here is that these secretive measures are all part of a wider political agenda. With Silicon Valley corporations clearly determined to preside over an all-encompassing social media monopoly, such restrictive politicized policies become even more dangerous. The following story which broke yesterday details an apparent backlash from a Google employee against the company s  diversity policies  has gone internally viral at the company. This was reportedly filed by VICE magazine s tech section, Motherboard: The person who wrote the document argued that the representation gap between men and women in software engineering persists because of biological differences between the two sexes, according to public tweets from Google employees. It also said Google should not offer programs for underrepresented racial or gender minorities, according to one of the employees I spoke to. The 10-page Google Doc document was met with derision from a large majority of employees who saw and denounced its contents, according to the employee. But Jaana Dogan, a software engineer at Google, tweeted that some people at the company at least partially agreed with the author; one of our sources said the same. While the document itself contains the thoughts of just one Google employee, the context in which they were shared Google is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for its gender pay gap and Silicon Valley has been repeatedly exposed as a place that discriminates against women and people of color as well as the private and public response from its workforce are important.

DETROIT: BIKERS SHOW UP In Big Numbers To Defend Kid Rock Against Leftist Protesters [VIDEO],"Leftist agitators showed up tonight at the opening of the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit where Detroit legend Kid Rock was scheduled to open the new home of the Detroit Red Wings and Detroit Pistons. The protesters who are likely being organized by the Democrat Party and George Soros are hilariously protesting Kid Rock for speaking out against the unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during our national anthem. Some of them are using the excuse that he used a confederate flag as a backdrop to his concerts years ago to protest Rock, who is likely going to challenge the 2-term liberal Democrat US Senator Debbie Stabenow in 2018. Kid Rock is the recipient of the Detroit NAACP Great Expectations award for his exceptional contribution to the black community of Detroit and is the single father of a black son.Here s a look at the small group of protesters whose numbers were estimated from between 50-200.

 Minnesota Woman Writes Amazing F*ck Off Letter To Men Who Want To Ban Abortion (IMAGE),"Attention, conservative men. This one is for you.After reading a pair of anti-abortion letters written by men published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune in response to the Supreme Court striking down Texas s draconian abortion law, Heidi Seltz couldn t stand to sit back and take the bullshit any longer.Texas law had forced abortion clinic doctors to obtain admitting privileges at an area hospital in order to continue providing reproductive services to patients. It also required clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers or they would be forced to shut down. Both requirements shuttered many clinics that women rely on for care and would have closed many more had the Supreme Court not ruled 5-3 against the law.Apparently, some men in Minnesota were very angry that the high court blocked their ability to tell women what they can and cannot do with their bodies and they publicly whined to the newspaper about it.So Heidi felt she should respond so that women are represented among the opinions published. And she only needed a few sentences to rip them a new one and put them in their place. It would be nice if men would shut up and if editors would help them,  she wrote. Unless you have a woman s body, I don t want to hear your opinion on what women s bodies should or should not do. In fact, it would be a delight if the Star Tribune Editorial Board ceased publishing men s letters about women s bodies entirely. Perhaps newspaper readership among young people would grow if every time we opened a paper, we didn t have to read old men s fusty opinions about uteri. Here s the letter via Twitter.Heidi is sick of your bullshit. pic.twitter.com/7TGEz5Q3TD  Stacey Burns (@WentRogue) June 30, 2016More women like Heidi Seltz must speak up in this way so that men do not dominate the conversation on reproductive rights. For too long, men have spearheaded the movement to restrict the reproductive rights of women to the detriment of women s health and freedom. The men in this movement are mostly conservatives who want to control women s bodies and make them submit to their will. That s why whenever Republicans in Congress form a committee to whine about abortion and contraceptives it s very noticeable that they rarely include a woman on the panel. Usually it s old white men who think they know everything about women s bodies and how they work. That has to change and it will only change if women stand up for themselves and demand it.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"July 2, 2016"
" Nobody Likes Donald Trump, And These Three DEVASTATING New Polls Prove It","A devastating new round of political polls shows that Donald Trump is one of the least liked political figures in the United States, and is poised for a loss in this November s presidential election. Polling from multiple media organizations shows Trump in dire straits, with numbers that have to have Republican leaders worried they have to find some way out of nominating the reality TV star.The poll with the best news for Trump comes from NBC/Wall Street Journal. In that poll, Trump is losing by 5% to Hillary Clinton.Forty-six percent of registered voters back Clinton, versus 41 percent who support Trump   slightly up from Clinton s three-point lead in May, 46 percent to 43 percent.When the best news is a margin of defeat larger than Barack Obama had over Mitt Romney (3.9%), you have a problem.Turning to the Washington Post/ABC News poll, things get very bad for Trump, like on the verge of a 1984-style landslide bad. In that poll, Clinton has a 12% lead over Trump. She is ahead 51% to 39% in a poll taken after the mass shooting in Orlando.The key to Trump s poor performance in that poll is the widespread public perception that Trump is biased against Muslims and Latinos, combined with the strong belief that he is just not a credible world leader.Sixty-four percent of Americans now see Trump as unqualified to serve as president, up 6 points from an already-high 58 percent last month. Thirty-four percent see him as qualified.Clinton s numbers are essentially the opposite, and unchanged: Sixty-one percent see her as qualified for the office, 37 percent as not qualified. Moreover, while 33 percent feel strongly that Clinton is not qualified, many more   56 percent   feel strongly that Trump doesn t pass this test.The third piece of evidence that Trump is taking on more water than the Titanic comes from Reuters  poll, where he loses to Clinton by 13%. In that poll 46.6% support Clinton, while only 33.3% back Trump. In their write-up of that poll, Reuters took note of the giant gulf in financial support between the candidates.Campaign finance disclosures released earlier this week showed Trump started June with a war chest of just $1.3 million, a fraction of Clinton s $42 million. Trump sought to ease concerns among his allies by saying that he could tap his  unlimited  personal wealth if needed, and also by bolstering efforts to raise money through fundraising events and online donations.Clintons leads in these polls are notable for a few reasons. They are all headed in the same direction, they all come after a terrorist attack, where many believed that Trump may see an increase in support. And this lead comes as President Obama s approval takes a major uptick (he s headed for Clinton-Reagan type support in his last year) and he has yet to campaign with Clinton along with Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Joe Biden. And finally, Clinton s strong polls come before her campaign and super PACs aligned with it have begun to drop millions of ads in swing states as Trump and the Republican Party remain woefully unprepared and underfunded.It could get much, much worse for Donald Trump. And its only June.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 26, 2016"

" Despite Whining, Trump’s Kids Actually Can Vote For Him In NY Primary (If They Weren’t Lazy)","Donald Trump s kids may support him in spirit (and terrible tweets), but they won t be going out to vote for him in the New York primary. Ivanka and Eric Trump both failed to register as Republicans in time to do so. According to Trump, this is because New York s primary registration rules were unfair. After all, the cutoff was in October, and at that point people   including, apparently, his own kids   still sort of expected Trump to have dropped out by now.On CNN, Ivanka claimed New York s voting regulations are  onerous. New York has one of the most onerous rules in terms of registration, and it required us to register a long time ago, almost   close to a year ago. And we didn t do that. We found out about it sort of after the fact. to which the millions of disenfranchised Democratic voters who have watched  Voter ID  laws sweep the country responded by playing the world s smallest violin.Trump himself told his supporters that Ivanka and Eric feel very, very guilty.  Adding:  They feel very guilty. But it s fine. I understand that. Except here s the thing: The Trump kids could probably vote for their dad if they really wanted to. It would just require a little work.In a highly informative piece on Gothamist, writer Nathan Tempey explained how someone who missed the primary registration deadline could still vote in the election. It s certainly not ideal, but it s not exactly rocket science, either.One is to try to get a court order stating you should be allowed to vote in a certain party s primary. As difficult as this sounds, the city Board of Elections actually stations judges at offices in each of the boroughs on Primary Day to do exactly this. For reasons unknown, this information doesn t appear on the board s website, but a spokeswoman provided a list of locations and hours judges will be at them Something tells me explaining to a judge  My dad s on the ballot  will be a good enough reason to get your vote counted. However, it s highly unlikely Trump s kids will reduce themselves to standing in a busy borough office waiting to have a judge hear their case, fill out the appropriate paperwork, then travel to a voting site.

LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT Knows of Russian Bribery and Info ‘That Involves the Clintons’ [Video],"DC lawyer Victoria Toensing is one smart cookie. She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

WHY RUSH LIMBAUGH Thinks GOP Voters Shouldn’t Count This “Dark Horse” Presidential Candidate Out,"He s always been in our top three. A rock solid conservative who s not afraid to fight back against the establishment on behalf of his constituents. A politician with a spine who respects our Constitution. You really can t ask for much more at this critical time in our nation RUSH: I think that there is a dark horse in this entire thing. I think there is one candidate who is positioned here. Now, I know it s getting late. Trump has had the lead for a hundred days here or more. Well, he s been in the lead ever since he got in. And there are now fewer days to Iowa than he has been in the lead. I mean, he s over the hump in that regard. But there s still a long way to go. It s politics. Any number of unforeseen, unpredictable events are potentially out there, and there has been somebody trucking along here, steady Eddie that has continued to be who he is and continues to lay down foundational markers for himself, and that s Ted Cruz. I think Ted Cruz is positioned, I wouldn t say ideally, I mean I m sure Cruz would love to be in the top two, top three here, but of all the others in the race, Trump and Carson here, and they re at number one and two, Carson s pulled ahead of Trump even in Iowa now, in two polls. But overall Trump leads and his lead continues to expand.But what if it doesn t? What if something happens? We re not shut out here. We still have somebody in our roster who opposes every bit of the Democrat agenda, perhaps more than anybody else in the race, and that s Cruz. I mean, Cruz does not have in his record any statement like Trump does of having supported certain things the Democrats have done. Cruz is inarguably thoroughbred conservative. The more I read about the Millennials, by the way, and I ve got some stuff about them in the Stack today, the more I read about Millennials and where they are attitudinally, politically, socially, economically, Cruz is somebody I think has a great opportunity to connect with them.In fact, before we get to the Trump sound bites, let me find this little thing on the Millennials.  Survey: Millennials Around the World Worry Most About Economic Inequality.  Now, this is typical of young people, young generations. They see injustice and unfairness and inequality out there and they want to right it, they want to correct it. When you have half of the country making   this is unbelievable   51% percent of the country making under $30,000 a year, that just cannot stand. We will not have a standard economy with that kind of reality. We just won t.The website here is USA Today, and the survey comes from the World Economic Forum, and they released it yesterday.  Millennials around the world worry most about social and economic equality, remain skeptical of government and the media, and count Tesla CEO Elon Musk as one their heroes, according to a World Economic Forum survey released Sunday. More than 1,000 young people, ages 20 to 30, from 125 countries and who are all active in the forum s Global Shapers Community. It s a left wing bunch, the World Economic Forum, it s an establishment left-wing bunch, understand, but they still went out and they talked to these Millennials all over the world, 125 different countries.  The average age was 28. The results were released at the beginning of a three-day World Economic Forum conference in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.  It s right down the road from Dubai.  The survey showed that 65% of the Millennials said one of their top three goals in selecting a job was to make a difference in society, their city or country.  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, of course they want that. They want to right wrongs. They want to correct social injustice wherever they see it. And when Ted Cruz gets going, that s ultimately what he s all about.He s all about everybody being the best they can be using their natural   he s conservative top to bottom, through and through, no matter how you slice it, left, right, up, down.  They also look for an opportunity to learn, followed by career advancement. More than nine out of 10 said they would be willing to relocate to advance their career.  That is the number one obstacle most people put in their own way. They re unwillingness to move. I ve always said that most of the obstacles people face in life are self-imposed, and the number one obstacle is the unwillingness to move. If you live in a place, let s say you want to be a brain surgeon and you live in a place where there s not a hospital, you re gonna have to move.If you want to get big in media and you live in Peoria, you re gonna have to move. And a lot of people don t want to move. The comfort level of being at home, friends, family, all that, it s a big obstacle. People get past that and nine out of 10 of these Millennials say they would be willing to relocate in order to advance their career, that s a big deal. Anyway, it s just a long way to go here and the Republican establishment has made it clear they are not interested in a conservative nominee. The Republican establishment has made it clear that the role of conservatives in this primary is to once again split the vote and split money.It was the money, don t forget, it was the money that was gonna save Jeb, or, if not Jeb, the next chosen establishment candidate. And the money, the ads, are not working. The ads simply are not overcoming, and they always have, the opposition to some of these candidates. So there s sheer panic out there now.END TRANSCRIPT  Via: RushLimbaugh.com",politics,"Oct 26, 2015"
" Of All The Candidates Running For President, Only One Pays Their Interns","Here s a nice little factoid for you: out of all the candidates running for president this year, only one actually pays their interns. Can you take a guess as to who that one person might be? It s none other than your favorite democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders.You heard that right: No one else, not Donald Trump, not even Hillary Clinton, pay their interns, not in a house, not in a tree, not anywhere (to borrow a line from Dr. Suess).The Washington Post ran an unofficial investigation from the angle of how  Presidential candidates ignore the costs of unpaid internships  despite their rhetoric to the contrary. It s particularly fitting considering they talk a big game about the  eroding middle class and rising social inequality,  yet they treat their own workers like slaves.Even the leading Republican candidates talk about income inequality openly, even though they may not get as much press coverage on the topic, yet still, somehow Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump don t care enough to pay their interns. Not Bernie Sanders, though. He pays his interns $10.10 an hour. Not too shabby!While we will admit this is nowhere close to the $15.00 an hour Bernie advocates for on the campaign trail, it s far and above anything else the other candidates are offering.If you believe in a higher minimum wage, this should be important to you. If you think workers need to be treated with respect, this difference between the candidates should be important to you.

 Ted Cruz Used #ScienceFacts Hashtag And Instantly Became Laughingstock Of Scientific Community,"Sen. Ted Cruz, a man whose climate science expertise extends no further than his ability to hold his arm out a window to see if it s raining, tried to troll Democrats by proving climate change was wrong in a single tweet   and it backfired massively.A vehement denier of climate change who once claimed he was just like Galileo because both held unpopular opinions (*eyeroll*) and who accused the 97% of scientists who say climate change is real of being liars, Cruz caused considerable damage to America s scientific community while he was in the Senate. Now he is poised to be in the White House, where he could downright derail it.With those stakes in mind, over the weekend the Democratic Party s Twitter account took a dig at Cruz for brushing off the idea that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming.Yesterday Ted Cruz said that ""carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant."" Someone needs to go back to science class  pic.twitter.com/cTp3QBxa2X  The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) April 16, 2016Cruz, whose philosophy appears to be  Well if I m already in a hole, I may as well dig,  immediately fired back with of a tweet of his own.Dems kill jobs, ignore facts. CO2 is what every human breathes out; every plant, in turn,consumes CO2. #ScienceFacts https://t.co/0eESF2Oz08  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 16, 2016To which the scientific community responded in unison:  You can t be that stupid, can you? Cruz may not be an avid reader, but even a quick google search can debunk his premise conclusively. In an article published in Scientific American in 2014 and aptly titled  The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide , writer Gayathri Vaidyanathan walks us through the reasons why: as far as climate change goes, the gas that truly matters is carbon dioxide. Unlike its shorter-lived cousins, CO2 sticks around in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, wreaking climate havoc. It has become very clear that if you want to stabilize warming at any level, you have to start talking about phasing out CO2,  said Joeri Rogelj, a research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and lead author of the study.  Reducing other climate pollution can help in different ways and for different things, but in climate stabilization terms, it s noise on the fact that you have to phase out CO2. Here s a simpler experiment Ted can do in his own home. Take a blanket. Put the blanket over your head. Breathe in and out. Notice how it starts to not feel great? Now imagine that on a planetary scale. Too much CO2 can be a disaster and it wouldn t be a great place to live.The always on point science writer for Slate, Phil Plait, tackled this exact climate denier myth just a few months ago on his blog. CO2, so the deniers say, is harmless because it s just what we breathe out, and isn t carbon what all life is based around? How can that be bad?This is nonsense, says Plait:This is a stunning statement. Like most denier talking points, there s a germ of truth to it the carbon in living tissue does come in large part from atmospheric CO2 but to say that means it can t be a pollutant is pretty silly.For example, our bodies produce formaldehyde naturally; it s a byproduct of the metabolic process. Yet the Center for Disease Control and Prevention classifies it as a pollutant. Why? Because too much of it under the wrong conditions is a bad thing.As ever, Cruz managed to be both wrong and smug at the same time. He s not just ignorant, he s proud of it.Why does this matter?As you may have noticed, last October was the hottest October ever recorded. So was November. So was December. So was January. So was February. So was March. Climate change isn t just theoretically possible, it s happening now and more quickly than many scientists ever dared worry it would. This means the time for action is already here. President Obama has done several key things to help America play catch up on the war against climate change. First he dumped tons of money into researching alternative energy and America is finally getting serious about solar and wind power. But perhaps most significantly of all, we are beginning to work with other countries around the world to globally combat the worst effects.This all goes away with Ted Cruz. A President Cruz not only doesn t believe climate change is worth fighting, he doesn t believe it exists. For four to eight years, America will rollback and dismantle the progress it has made at this crucial time. What this means for the future is the stuff of nightmares.But on the bright side, if our cities are flooded and our crops are failing at least President Cruz can provide us have plenty of good, healthy carbon.Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images ",News,"April 17, 2016"
 Kellyanne Conway Says Trump Should Be Treated With The Respect He Deserves (AUDIO),"Whiny White House advisor Kellyanne Conway does not like how the media treats her illegitimate president, Donald Trump. She s continuing her crusade against the First Amendment. Interestingly, she, President Steve Bannon, and Trump, have treated the press very badly, yet they feel they should get favorable coverage anyway. Conway appeared on Sean Hannity s radio show, and talked about how mean the press is to Donald.Hannity asked Conway if the media at large was being  beyond disrespectful  to Trump and his staff, according to Mediaite. Conway agreed then said that the coverage was  inciting mob mentality if not mob violence. The coverage never changed [of Trump]. It never progressed, it never matured,  Conway said.Conway said she thought protesters had  a very low level of literacy  of the issues against which they demonstrated, when the truth is that her boss s grammar sits at just below a 6th grade level. It never took on the aura of respect that it deserved, and if you are not showing the President and his main spokespeople respect, then you re not showing the office respect, and you are inciting mob mentality if not mob violence,  she said.  You are encouraging people to go out there and unpeacefully protest and block airport entrances for people who are going to visit a sick parent and can t make their flight, or are going for a bereavement call and can t make their flight. Listen below:People are treating Donald with the respect he deserves. Protesters know exactly why they went to airports across the country. People were being unconstitutionally detained and handcuffed, even children. Conway said at the time that the whole idea that these people are being separated from their families is  temporary.  She called it an  inconvenience.  So, Kellyanne, just consider the treatment Trump is getting an  inconvenience,  and something that is  temporary  until his impeachment.She literally complained that the press is being mean to Donald to a Fox News host who treated former President Barack Obama like dirt for 8 years . Quit being so PC, Kellyanne. Conservatives tell me it s destroying our country.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images.",News,"February 3, 2017"
"OBAMA STONEWALLING ON Why He Sent 13 Payments Of $99,999,999.99 To Iran…Where Was Congress?","Leave it to the one and only Andrew McCarthy to put together a fantastic case against Obama and his lying administration when it comes to the latest race on the Treasury. This time it was a raid on a Treasury slush fund to give $1.3 billion to Iran. The Iran Deal is a great example of just how corrupt and dysfunctional our government is. Please take the time to read this incredible overview of the inner workings of giving billions to Iran It s UNREAL!The structured transfers of $1.3 billion from a Treasury slush fund remain shrouded in mystery.  Confidentiality ? Yes, that s the State Department s story on why the Obama administration is stonewalling the American people regarding the president s illegal and increasingly suspicious Iransom payoff. The administration refuses to divulge any further information about the $1.7 billion the president acknowledges paying the world s leading state sponsor of terrorism.Grilled on Wednesday about how Obama managed to pay the final $1.3 billion installment   particularly given the president s claim that it is not possible to send Tehran a check or wire-transfer   State Department spokesman Mark Toner decreed that the administration would continue  withholding this information  in order  to protect confidentiality. Whose confidentiality? The mullahs ? That of the intermediaries the president used? Whose privacy takes precedence over our right to know how Obama funneled our money to our enemies?The closest thing to an answer we have to the latest round of questions comes courtesy of the perseverance of the investigative journalist Claudia Rosett. (You weren t expecting the Republican Congress to be minding the purse, were you?) Recall that we have been asking about the $1.3 billion payment since the first revelations about this sordid affair. After all, if, as Obama and his toadies maintain, the payment is totally on the up and up   just a routine legal settlement involving Iran s own money   then why won t they answer basic questions about it? Why are such matters as the administration s process in tapping a congressionally appropriated funding source for the settlement   a settlement Congress did not approve and seems to be in the dark about paying for   being treated as if they were state secrets so sensitive you d need have a Clinton.mail account (or be a Russian hacker of a Clinton.mail account) to see them?Generally speaking, the State, Treasury, and Justice Departments cannot issue press releases fast enough to salute themselves over legal settlements that supposedly benefit taxpayers by billions of dollars   at least according to the same math that brought you all those Obamacare savings. How is it that, in what is purportedly a completely aboveboard legal case, we are not permitted to know how our own money was transferred to the jihadist plaintiff?With the administration taking the Fifth, it was left to Claudia to crawl through Leviathan s catacombs. In her New York Sun report on Monday, we learned that she hit pay dirt: stumbling upon a bizarre string of 13 identical money transfers of $99,999,999.99 each   yes, all of them one cent less than $100 million   paid out of an obscure Treasury Department stash known as the  Judgment Fund.  The transfers were made   to whom, it is not said   on January 19, just two days after the administration announced it had reached the $1.7 billion settlement with Iran. They aggregate to just 13 cents shy of $1.3 billion, the same amount the State Department claims Iran was owed in  interest  from the $400 million that our government had been holding since the shah deposited it in a failed arms deal just prior to the Khomeini revolution. So, stacked atop of the pallets of $400 million in foreign cash that Obama arranged to shuttle from Geneva to Tehran as ransom (or, as the administration prefers,  leverage ) for the release of American hostages   via an unmarked cargo plane belonging to Iran Air, a terrorist arm of the mullahs  terrorist coordinator, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps   we now have a second whopping money transfer that (a) violates federal criminal laws against providing things of value to Iran and (b) looks like it was conceived by Nicky Barnes.Read more: NRO",Government News,"Aug 27, 2016"
BREAKING: MORE HACKED E-MAILS From DNC Released By A Vengeful Guccifer,"It s not the first time that the name of Vladimir Putin has been brought up in the US presidential campaign, but this time the US president used this  argument  while openly campaigning for Clinton against Trump. The situation has become  really ludicrous and it borders on the ridiculous,  believes Gregory R. Copley, editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs. In my 50 odd years covering the US government, I have never seen this level of partisanship within the administration where a sitting president actually regards the opposition party as the enemy of the state,  Copley told RT.The analyst said that the democrats are  blaming the messenger to revert the attention from the message. The message which Donald Trump delivered on RT was unambiguous in his campaign. Just like the fact that WikiLeaks revelation of the hacked emails was very explicit in showing up what the Democratic party itself was doing,  Copley added.The US establishment is  sacrificing key bilateral relationships in order to win [a] domestic election,  believes Copley. He added that neither Obama nor Clinton are interested in unifying the country, but they are rather  interested in winning and engaging in what modern democracy seems to have become   the tyranny of the marginal majority over the marginal minority. When you think about the number of times that the Clinton campaign has brought up President Putin and the alleged Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton s service, it makes you wonder just how desperate they are,  Copley noted.  President Obama has lost literally all prestige in an international community with the loss of prestige he has become desperate.  Read more: RTAnother round of hacked Democratic National Committee documents have been released. Provided by an anonymous representative of a hacker, Guccifer, the 500 megabytes detail the DNC s information technology infrastructure and internal reports on donors.Forbes reports that on Tuesday in London at the Future of Cyber Security Europe conference, Guccifer addressed cybersecurity experts through an unknown and remote transcriber.The notorious hacker then shared a trove of documents ostensibly obtained via a breach of the DNC s cybersecurity. According to Forbes, a password and login was given to them, and the documents they accessed appeared to show details of DNC donors and finances as well as the information technology setup to protect the sensitive data.In July, just as the Democratic National Convention was getting underway, WikiLeaks released the results of the first DNC hack carried out by Guccifer. That hack revealed signs of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton over her primary opponent Bernie Sanders, and consequently led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, as well as several other top officers.The DNC responded to the latest hack claim Tuesday through its Interim Chair Donna Brazile, who stated that the  DNC is the victim of a crime,  which she blamed on  Russian state-sponsored agents,  while also cautioning that the hacked documents were still being authenticated by the DNC legal team, as  it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents.

 Ohio Fireman Suspended Indefinitely Over Extremely Racist Facebook Post (VIDEO),"An Ohio fireman from Franklin Township has just been suspended over his Facebook post which contains racist remarks. Tyler Roysdon used his social media account to say that if there was an emergency he would rather save a dog than a  n*gger.  While Roysdon is a volunteer fireman, he does receive payment for each emergency run which he takes part in, according to WHIO.And now, with his social media post easy to Google for any potential employers, he might have a hard time getting a job.Roysdon wrote on Facebook that if he had to choose between saving a dog and an African-American man from a burning building, he would save the dog s life because  one dog is more important than a million n*ggers. Roysdon has just learned a valuable lesson: when you write something on social media, other people can read it. The Facebook post was deleted after Fire Chief Steve Bishop instructed him to do so.At this point. Roysdon s case is under review. Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media. Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed,  the statement reads.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action. Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees. Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. Watch:Roysdon s post didn t go over well, according to the responses. One of them read,  Wow is all I can say  while another commenter wrote,  SMH. The fireman s Facebook page looks like Ted Nugent took a sh*t all over it.Apparently, Roysdon likes to go mudding, shooting, fishing, and now he can start collecting coupons, too, since he ll be in a lower income bracket.

 WATCH: Video Shows Cops TRYING To Run Over Black Man With Cruiser,"In something you might expect from a video game instead of real life, police in Sacramento, California are under fire on Monday after a dash cam video was released that showed police trying to run down a black man who reportedly had only a knife. They missed, but they did manage to shoot 50-year-old Joseph Mann 14 times. Now, the community is calling for the police involved to be charged with murder.The incident happened on July 11th. As those on the right will happily point out, the police were called to an apartment complex because Mann was reportedly acting erratically and he had a knife. When police ordered Mann to drop his weapon and get on the ground, Mann instead threw a thermos at the police car.That s when Officers Randy Lozoya and John Tennis came to the scene. They are the officers in the video.In the video, the officers are heard saying,  I m gonna hit him  and  Okay, go for it,  before gunning the engine and aiming for him. Mann was able to evade the police cruiser, but the officers stopped the car, got out and during a foot chase, shot Mann 14 times, killing him.Here it is: Mann was standing stationary on a sidewalk with no one in close proximity when the officers unloaded their guns,  Burris wrote in a letter he said he sent the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch.The family wants murder charges filed.The officers  behaved like big game hunters closing in on an animal,  said John Burris, a lawyer for the family of 50-year-old Joseph Mann.Source: CBS NewsThe Sacramento police are reserving judgement, of course. Spokesman Matthew McPhail didn t say whether cars are permitted as weapons, but he did say,  our officers are encouraged to assess each circumstance and think critically about the tools at their disposal. The two cops have not been fired. They were placed on paid leave for a whole week after the shooting and now they are on desk duty.Again, Mann wasn t an innocent bystander. Methamphetamine was found in his system. The family s lawsuit claims that Mann was  displaying obvious signs of mental distress.  The police followed no protocol for dealing with a mentally distressed person and they made no attempt to deescalate the situation.The bottom line, though, is that the punishment did not fit the crime. If police can t even subdue a man who is armed with only a knife, how are they supposed to deal with a mass shooter or a terrorist? Not all crimes are equal and this certainly wasn t a crime that warranted the death penalty, not that police have that authority anyway.Featured image via video screen capture.

TWISTED LIBERAL KINDERGARTEN Teacher Allows Transgender Student To “REVEAL” Her “TRUE GENDER” To Class,"Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

Dyer: ‘LA Times ‘Fake News’ Article is an Attack on Independent Media’,"Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAccording to a recent feature article published by the LA Times, and which has since gone viral, this website, 21st Century Wire, has been placed at the top of a  list  of  fake  news sites compiled by Dr Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts. Aside from being a highly political attempt to discredit a number of online news source which Dr Zimdars and the Democratic Party establishment probably labels as  Alt Right,  this coordinated effort also points directly to a much deeper agenda, as part of a larger as psychological operation to create an algorithm for  filtering  (censoring) news items on major internet platforms and social networks.I take that to heart, since I write for 21WIRE. It s no coincidence that this LA Times hit piece comes in the same week that Democratic Party pundits and leaders are blaming Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump on  fake news  posted on Facebook which they claim wrongly influenced voters. Also just by coincidence this week, Facebook, Google and other DNC affiliated Silicon Valley media partners have announced they are planning to draw-up lists of numerous alternative media websites including  right wing  websites as well as known satire sites, and ours  as  fake.  Google and Facebook will then be able to flag and restrict banned websites from being able to earn revenue through their advertising networks. Of course, the real reason for this is explained in my video (watch below) outlining the absurdity of the most astounding liars on the planet   the Mainstream Media  accusing websites like ours as pushing out fake news.  Ultimately, this is an attack on all independent media.It seems that Dr Zimdar s master list  was made to place 21WIRE at the top   and yet, it s perhaps the best site on the list and is the only one that has  been to Syria,  reported on the ground in Aleppo, and even met with Syria  president Assad   all things that most corporate mainstream media outlets have not managed to do. 21WIRE also blasted faux NGO the White Helmets away as a western-funded propaganda front. 21WIRE is subject to regular DDoS attacks and regularly does real journalism. It is also edited by accredited journalists and is frequently featured on radio and television. That is why it has been targeted in this hit piece   because it is independent and not attached to any political party.Watch my video analysis here: ***Jay Dyer is the author of the new book, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Publishers.

 Fox’s Shep Smith Has Yet Another EPIC Anti-Trump Rant; Schools Him On ‘Fake News’ (VIDEO),"As Donald Trump has turned his presidency into an all out war against the mainstream media, the media is finding heroes in strange places   namely Fox News, without whose propaganda we likely would never had had even a candidate Trump let alone the new occupant of the White House.Last week, after Trump s disastrous press conference in which he attacked the media, and especially CNN, Fox s Shep Smith had an eight minute rant defending the media and calling out Trump for his lies. Listen to it if you haven t already. It s amazing.A week has passed and Trump hasn t let up on the media. On Friday, he went so far as to call the media the  enemy of the people,  and he vowed to do something about it.  That s beyond dangerous. It s dictator 101.Oh, but it got worse on Friday a lot worse. The White House, in an unprecedented move, banned several news outlets from the briefing room.Shortly after Mr Trump s speech on Friday, a number of selected media organisations were invited into Mr Spicer s office for an informal briefing, or  gaggle .Those allowed into the room included ABC, Fox News, Breitbart News, Reuters and the Washington Times.When asked why some were excluded, Mr Spicer said it was his decision to  expand the pool  of reporters.He also warned the White House was going to  aggressively push back  at  false narratives  in the news.Politico, Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail were also left out, but CNN was the only major US television network to be denied entry.Source: BBCSmith is not happy. He once again called out Trump and this time, told him exactly what  fake news  means.For the report,  fake news  refers to stories that are created by entities pretended to be news organizations and based on nothing of substance. Fake news is made up nonsense delivered for financial gain. CNN s reporting was not fake news. Its journalistics followed the same standards that other organizations, including Fox News, adhere. Senior administration officials regularly speak without attribution so that the public needs to be informed of what our government is doing off the record.Source: MediaiteHere s the video: Even other Fox personalities were upset with the ban:Some at CNN & NYT stood w/FOX News when the Obama admin attacked us & tried 2 exclude us-a WH gaggle should be open to all credentialed orgs https://t.co/8Vjcs0KCPR  Bret Baier (@BretBaier) February 24, 2017IF true that @SeanSpicer & #WH are banning certain disfavored news organizations All must refuse to play along.

" Clinton Campaign Announces BAD News For Trump, Will Participate In Recount (TWEETS)","On Saturday morning, Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel posted a statement to Medium to announce that the campaign will back recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Green Party candidate Jill Stein follows through with reexamining the votes in those states.The post was written by attorney Marc Erik Elias, who said that the campaign had been questioning the results since the election ended, weighing different options. Elias said: It should go without saying that we take these concerns extremely seriously. We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. Since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia. TwitterTwitterTwitterElias said that although actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology  was not found, Stein s successful movement to get votes recounted in Wisconsin has persuaded the Clinton campaign to support the initiative. Now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states Michigan well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. Echoing Stein s own words about making sure that America s elections maintain integrity, Elias said: We believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported. Elias  entire statement can be read here. On Friday afternoon, Stein had filed for a recount in Wisconsin, promising to also follow through in Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Trump is leading by narrow margins. The deadline Stein must file for recounts in those states is Monday and Wednesday.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"November 26, 2016"

FRIDAY DOCUMENT DUMP: 300 CLINTON E-MAILS RELEASED,"The Friday document dump today included 300 of the thousands of yet to be released Clinton e-mails. How convenient to release these on a holiday weekend. We re all being scammed in all this because these are the e-mails hand picked by Hillaries minions. We won t get to the truth because it was destroyed. This entire thing is smelling to high heaven The State Department released its first round of emails from Hillary Clinton s time as Secretary of State on Friday, offering a new look at her handling of the attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.The roughly 300 emails, about 850 pages, are part of the 30,000 that she turned over to State from her private email server, which she used almost exclusively to conduct both private and public business during her time at State. They reveal a range of correspondence from Clinton, everything from policy briefs to scheduling requests to friendly exchanges with staff.White House press secretary Josh Earnest says the new emails  do not change in any way anyone s understanding  of what happened in Benghazi, and the State Department reiterated the same in a tweet. The emails we release today do not change the essential facts or our understanding of the events before, during, or after the attacks,  the department tweeted.Clinton herself commented on the release at a campaign stop in New Hampshire on Friday, telling reporters she was happy they were out but was waiting for more. It s beginning. I just would like to see it expedited, so we could get more of them out more quickly,  she said.Below, a collection of some of the most newsworthy tidbits from the emails:A supportive boss In one email, sent four days before Christmas in 2012, Clinton sent a note to her entire State Department staff, acknowledging a  challenging week.  She had fainted about a week prior and suffered a concussion, which prevented her from testifying before House and Senate committees on the attacks. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi and make every possible improvement   and we will,  she wrote in the five-paragraph note.One day earlier, Clinton wrote in an email to two top aides headed to the Hill on her behalf:  I ll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you  remain calm and carry on!' One of those aides, Tom Nides, hints that he s not entirely excited about the grilling.Clinton replies:  Well, what doesn t kill you, makes you stronger (as I have rationalized for years), so just survive and you ll have triumphed! In most emails, she s referred to simply as  H. Stress over Benghazi scrutiny One email hints at the scrutiny the State Department was facing over Clinton s response to the Benghazi attacks. In their remarks the day after the attack, both Clinton and President Barack Obama made reference to an anti-Muslim video that some intelligence initially suggested prompted the attacks, a claim that was later found to be mistaken.On Sept. 24, 2012, Jake Sullivan, Clinton s deputy chief of staff at State, forwards her a 24-page document compiling all of the statements she had made after the attacks, and reassures her that she was careful in her wording. You never said spontaneous or characterized the motives. In fact you were careful in your first statement to say we were assessing motive and method,  he says.Sullivan also writes:  The way you treated the video in the Libya context was to say that some sought to *justify* the attack on that basis. Advice on foreign affairs Clinton received advice on foreign affairs from a range of former advisers from outside of the department, including Sidney Blumenthal, the former Clinton White House aide who s drawn scrutiny for issuing over two dozen memos to Clinton on Libya while also advising businesses looking to break into post-Gaddafi Libya.The emails reveal that Clinton often read, commented on and forwarded Blumenthal s memos   which laid out information obtained from his own sources on the situation in Libya   to Sullivan. Blumenthal will comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee on Benghazi this week after his role in advising Clinton emerged.In a September 2012 email, Burns Strider, a senior adviser and director of Faith and Values Outreach on Clinton s 2008 campaign, forwards her a post from CNN s Belief blog by Stephen Prothero titled  My Take: A deadly link between Islamic and anti-Islamic terrorists.  She typically forwards these to State Department aides.Libya security concerns In the years leading up to the attack covered by the emails, there were a number of hints at the decaying security situation in Libya   key sticking point for Republican critics of Clinton s performance at State. Many believe she ignored warnings that the security there was declining and showed poor judgment in failing to beef up protection for U.S. officials there.In June of 2011, Sullivan emailed Hillary warning of a  credible threat against the hotel that our team is using,  and told her security officials would be moving personnel to other locations.She received an update in 2011 from Stevens on how fragile the security forces were in the country. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation, Another email, sent in February of 2012 by then Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, warned of  concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. Congratulations and condolences on Benghazi In the days following the attacks, Clinton received a stream of condolences and congratulations from diplomats, lawmakers and world leaders on her handling of the situation.On Sept. 13, Clinton is forwarded an email from U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, who says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called him to offer  profound condolences  about the Benghazi attack.  He said Israelis know too well how difficult these moments are, and he wanted us all to know that Israelis stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us at such a difficult time,  Shapiro writes.Christian Brose, Sen. John McCain s national security adviser, emailed Sullivan on Sept. 12, 2012, the day Clinton gave a speech honoring those who died in the attacks, sending his boss s compliments.  What a wonderful, strong and moving statement by your boss. Please tell her how much Sen. McCain appreciated it. Me too,  he wrote.Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also sent his condolences.Intelligence holes? One October 2012 email underscores the limits of U.S. intelligence. Clinton emailed senior aide Cheryl Mills asking about an NPR report on the attacks. I just heard an NPR report about the CIA station chief in Tripoli sending a cable on 9/12 saying there was no demo etc.,  she wrote.  Do you know about this? Thoughts on the media A transcript of an interview with Wall Street Journal Reporter Monica Langley was circulated among a few top aides with commentary from Philippe Reines, a longtime spokesman for Clinton.He declared the October 10, 2012, conversation as an  awesome interview.  But he went on to say that Langley violated Clinton s personal space, by moving her chair knee-to-knee with the secretary, comparing it to  the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on which tooth she was trying to get access to. I ve never seen a westerner invade her space like that,  Reines wrote. But he went on to describe the interview as  wonderful. One of the best interviews I ve ever witnesses. Wish it were on live TV.

"REAL INDIAN, GOP Senate Hopeful Shiva Ayyadurai Just Got Great News…FAKE INDIAN Elizabeth Warren Aligns Herself With Hillary Clinton In New Fundraising Email","Mass Live  Ayyadurai, who announced his Republican U.S. Senate bid in February, said that while he may not be the GOP establishment s candidate, his track record of overcoming barriers and fighting big institutions makes him the best person to take on the high-powered incumbent. I know that Warren   in spite of (what) people think she is   is extremely weak,  he said in an interview.  She s a formidable enemy, but weak in the sense that where she s fundamentally coming from, her basis of where she s coming from, has massive weakness and I know how to expose that weakness. Ayyadurai, 53, moved to the U.S. from India as a child. He compared the Democratic senator and former Harvard University professor to those at the top of India s caste system   a social structure in which he said his family held a low position. If you look at what we have today, we have a neo-caste system and at the top of that heap is people like Warren,  he said.  They are the academics, career politicians and lawyer/lobbyists. And that clan   is extremely spineless, they never expect to be challenged. And I ve challenged them. Last month, Ayyadurai made news when he sent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren a DNA kit for her birthday (which she rejected) after Warren was caught lying about being a Native American on a application for a teaching position at Harvard University, allegedly hoping that her fake minority status would place her ahead of other applicants for the job.Senator Elizabeth Warren is not only a liar, she s also not very bright. Warren sent out an email today that was clearly designed to appeal to women. In the email, Warren names the very unpopular Hillary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Warren starts out the email by mentioning Hillary s name in the first sentence:Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. Warren used Hillary s name again near the end of her email:Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.Apparently, Warren missed the dreadful polls showing how the wildly unpopular Hillary Clinton s like ability continues to plummet, even after the race.If Warren stays the course and continues to align herself with Crooked Hillary, the very successful entrepreneur and President Trump supporter Shiva Ayyadurai will no doubt be able to use her embarrassingly bad decision to his advantage.Mass Live- If elected, Ayyadurai said he hopes to bring a sense of innovation to the Senate when it comes to addressing hot-button issues, as well as to look at problems from an engineering and science perspective.Casting himself as a  Lincoln Republican,  the entrepreneur said his campaign platform will largely focus on three areas: immigration, education and innovation.As an immigrant, Ayyadurai said he believes it is important that the U.S. secure its borders, root out so-called sanctuary cities and ensure people enter the country legally.He added that he also supports ensuring parents and students have choices when it comes to public education, and argued that more must be done to address what he called  pay-to-play  academic science research.Ayyadurai, who holds four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the founder and chairman of CytoSolve, a startup that has developed a  computational platform for scalable integration of molecular pathway models  used in drug development.He is one of three Republicans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2018.To donate to Shiva Ayyadurai s senate campaign, click HERE.Here is Warren s email:Friend  Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. I ve seen what a village, a community, and a movement can do, one action at a time. And I ve seen how women can help women   especially when we run for office.I sure remember what it was like running for the Senate as a first-time candidate in 2011. I had to learn everything it took to raise money, build a grassroots organizing operation, and stand up to a Republican incumbent with $10 million in the bank   and I had to do it fast.And here s what I know: I absolutely, positively couldn t have done it on my own.So when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told me they wanted a strong launch of the Women s Senate Network for the 2018 cycle, to help women run and make sure more voices like mine and Hillary s are in the Senate, I immediately told them:I m all in.Today, I m asking you to join me in becoming a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network. Because you were there for Hillary, I m hoping you ll add your name to help us build a community to support women who run for office.Now let me be blunt: 2018 is going to be a hard year for Democrats. We ve got 10 women who are up for reelection to the Senate, including me   more than ever before in history. And many are in some really tough races.That s why the DSCC s Women s Senate Network is ramping up its 2018 efforts early to elect and protect smart, tough, and experienced candidates to fight for what s right   senators who understand that being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, that we deserve equal pay for equal work, and that we sure as heck need Planned Parenthood and affordable health care for hardworking families.Let s continue our fight and get more women in leadership in this country.I m counting on you to keep fighting for what we all started: become a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network today. You ll even get your very own  Nevertheless, She Persisted  sticker when you do!Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.And with your help, we can be there for the women who need help defending their seats now and for the next generation of women candidates ready to move into leadership. Early help makes all the difference.Thank you for owning a piece of this.Elizabeth ",left-news,"Jul 20, 2017"

BURN! NYT TAKES JAB AT FOX NEWS…Watch How FOX Got Even in a Big Way! [Video],"Sometimes, the left just makes it far too easy to win.It is a well-known fact that President Trump is a big fan of FNC s  FOX & Friends,  tweeting about it often. New York Times  James Poniewozik recently ran a hit piece criticizing the show for its friendly relationship with the president, stating that  President Trump is the show s subject, its programmer, its publicist and its virtual fourth host. The stars offer him flattery, encouragement and advice. While furthering his point, Poniewozik complimented the morning show by calling it the most powerful TV show in America  due to Trump s support. Instead of getting mad, FNC got even. They purchased ads in the New Yorks Times featuring its own accidental compliment. A Fox News source confirmed that the advertisement was in direct response to the article. But the sweet revenge didn t end there. After hearing about FNC s clever move in response to Poniewozik s piece, President Trump tweeted his own jab at the New York Times:Wow, the Failing @nytimes said about @foxandfriends  .the most powerful T.V. show in America.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2017 FOX & Friends  host Steve Doocy held up the ad on air to share the victory with viewers. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt gave the show s viewers all the credit, saying  we have the best viewers. You guys are so awesome. Long-time host Brian Kilmeade joked that it must have been tough for the Times to admit the success of the show before stating the ad was also featured in the New York Post.Looks like Trump isn t the only one in town who can go head to head with the liberal media and come out on top.Read more: Biz Pac Review",politics,"Jul 29, 2017"
CHICAGO THUGS Watched 9 Yr Old Play On Swings Before Carrying Out His Brutal Murder In Retaliation Against Dad’s Gang,"UPDATE: No #BlackLivesMatter Protests PlannedChicago has no shortage of thugs. What they do have a shortage of is support from the #BlackLivesMatter terrorists and Obama Regime. You don t hear our Community Organizer In Chief running to a microphone every time a young black man or woman is murdered at the hands of another black man or woman. Sadly, it doesn t fit their narrative. This young boy s murder is far more tragic than the plight of the Muslim boy, with a history of discipline issues, who took a fake bomb to school in Texas on 9-11 and was rightly punished for his behavior by school officials. The phony outrage that Obama showed the world over this little fake  clock boy s  arrest should sicken every American. It is especially disturbing when one considers Obama s deafening silence over the horrific gang violence that plagues his hometown of Chicago. Where were the tweets of outrage from the White House over the loss of this beautiful young boy s life? Crickets On Friday, prosecutors laid out their case against a man accused of murdering 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee on Nov. 2Corey Morgan, 27, of suburban Lansing, was charged in the murder. Police have one other man in custody who has not yet been charged, and a third man, Kevin Edwards, is also wanted in the slaying.Prosecutors say Corey Morgan (left) and Kevin Edwards planned the heinous murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee.Assistant State s Attorney George Canellis said Friday the shooting stemmed from an ongoing feud between Morgan s gang, the BBG (Bang Bang Gang)/Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones and the Killaward faction of the Gangster Disciples.The feud came to a boil after an Oct. 13 shooting in which Morgan s brother, Tracey Morgan was killed and his mother was wounded. Morgan was so enraged he threatened to shoot  grandmas, mamas, kids and all  in retaliation, prosecutors said.Tyshawn was hit in his back, forearm and head, and part of his thumb was shot off as if he was raising his hand to block the shots, Canellis said. This murder was committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner,  Canellis said.Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy vowed to destroy the group responsible for the boy s brutal murder. They are going to be obliterated,  he said.  That gang just signed its death warrant. McCarthy did not detail each suspect s role in the shooting. We know that there were three individuals involved in this,  he said.Morgan s arrest comes nearly a month after Tyshawn s Nov. 2 shooting death.Police are hunting for Kevin Edwards, also suspected in the shooting.Court documents paint a disturbing picture of the planned attack, explaining that Morgan and his accomplices allegedly saw Tyshawn playing on the swings in a playlot with his basketball beside him. One of the suspects allegedly started dribbling Tyshawn s ball, ultimately luring him into the alley where police say he was  executed.

New York Times is Advocating for Internet Censorship (controlled by them and other ‘approved’ agents)," The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.  Robert Parry  Consortium NewsIn its lead editorial on Sunday, The New York Times decried what it deemed  The Digital Virus Called Fake News  and called for Internet censorship to counter this alleged problem, taking particular aim at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for letting  liars and con artists hijack his platform. As this mainstream campaign against  fake news  quickly has gained momentum in the past week, two false items get cited repeatedly, a claim that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump and an assertion that Trump was prevailing in the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. I could add another election-related falsehood, a hoax spread by Trump supporters that liberal documentarian Michael Moore was endorsing Trump when he actually was backing Clinton.But I also know that Clinton supporters were privately pushing some salacious and unsubstantiated charges about Trump s sex life, and Clinton personally charged that Trump was under the control of Russian President Vladimir Putin although there was no evidence presented to support that McCarthyistic accusation.The simple reality is that lots of dubious accusations get flung around during the heat of a campaign   nothing new there   and it is always a challenge for professional journalists to swat them down the best we can. What s different now is that the Times envisions some structure (or algorithm) for eliminating what it calls  fake news. Photograph published by the New York Times purportedly taken in Russia of Russian soldiers who later appeared in eastern Ukraine. However, the photographer has since stated that the photo was actually taken in Ukraine, and the U.S. State Department has acknowledged the error.But, with a stunning lack of self-awareness, the Times fails to acknowledge the many times that it has published  fake news,  such as reporting in 2002 that Iraq s purchase of aluminum tubes meant that it was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program; its bogus analysis tracing the firing location of a Syrian sarin-laden rocket in 2013 back to a Syrian military base that turned out to be four times outside the rocket s range; or its publication of photos supposedly showing Russian soldiers inside Russia and then inside Ukraine in 2014 when it turned out that the  inside-Russia  photo was also taken inside Ukraine, destroying the premise of the story.These are just three examples among many of the Times publishing  fake news    and all three appeared on Page One before being grudgingly or partially retracted, usually far inside the newspaper under opaque headlines so most readers wouldn t notice. Much of the Times   fake news  continued to reverberate in support of U.S. government propaganda even after the partial retractions.Who Is the Judge?So, should Zuckerberg prevent Facebook users from circulating New York Times stories? Obviously, the Times would not favor that solution to the problem of  fake news.  Instead, the Times expects to be one of the arbiters deciding which Internet outlets get banned and which ones get gold seals of approval.The Times lead editorial, following a front-page article on the same topic on Friday, leaves little doubt what the newspaper would like to see. It wants major Internet platforms and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, to close off access to sites accused of disseminating  fake news. The editorial said,  a big part of the responsibility for this scourge rests with internet companies like Facebook and Google, which have made it possible for fake news to be shared nearly instantly with millions of users and have been slow to block it from their sites.  Facebook says it is working on weeding out such fabrications. It said last Monday that it would no longer place Facebook-powered ads on fake news websites, a move that could cost Facebook and those fake news sites a lucrative source of revenue. Earlier on the same day, Google said it would stop letting those sites use its ad placement network. These steps would help, but Facebook, in particular, owes its users, and democracy itself, far more. Facebook has demonstrated that it can effectively block content like click-bait articles and spam from its platform by tweaking its algorithms, which determine what links, photos and ads users see in their news feeds.   Facebook managers are constantly changing and refining the algorithms, which means the system is malleable and subject to human judgment. The Times editorial continued:  This summer, Facebook decided to show more posts from friends and family members in users  news feeds and reduce stories from news organizations, because that s what it said users wanted. If it can do that, surely its programmers can train the software to spot bogus stories and outwit the people producing this garbage.  Mr. Zuckerberg himself has spoken at length about how social media can help improve society.   None of that will happen if he continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform. Gray AreasBut the problem is that while some falsehoods may be obvious and clear-cut, much information exists in a gray area in which two or more sides may disagree on what the facts are. And the U.S. government doesn t always tell the truth although you would be hard-pressed to find recent examples of the Times recognizing that reality. Especially over the past several decades, the Times has usually embraced the Official Version of a disputed event and has deemed serious skepticism out of bounds.Former New York Times reporter Judith Miller, co-author of the Iraq  aluminum tube  story.That was the way the Times treated denials from the Iraqi government and some outside experts who disputed the  aluminum tube  story in 2002   and how the Times has brushed off disagreements regarding the U.S. government s portrayal of events in Syria, Ukraine and Russia. Increasingly, the Times has come across as a propaganda conduit for Official Washington rather than a professional journalistic entity.But the Times and other mainstream news outlets   along with some favored Internet sites   now sit on a Google-financed entity called the First Draft Coalition, which presents itself as a kind of Ministry of Truth that will decide which stories are true and which are  fake. If the Times  editorial recommendations are followed, the disfavored stories and the sites publishing them would no longer be accessible through popular search engines and platforms, essentially blocking the public s access to them. [See Consortiumnews.com s  What to Do About  Fake News. ]The Times asserts that such censorship would be good for democracy   and it surely is true that hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories are no help to democracy   but regulation of information in the manner that the Times suggests has more than a whiff of Orwellian totalitarianism to it.And the proposal is especially troubling coming from the Times, with its checkered recent record of disseminating dangerous disinformation.*** Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

 WATCH: Trump ‘Honors’ Black History Month By Praising Himself And Attacking The Media,"It s the first day of Black History Month and Donald Trump was quick to celebrate it inappropriately.February is the month when our country recognizes the long history of African-Americans. Their achievements and struggles are America s achievements and struggles and we must recognize both to move forward and create a better future.But rather than honor Black History Month with the dignity it deserves, Donald Trump made it all about him instead.During a breakfast in the White House Cabinet Room, Trump said a few words about Black History Month.During this month we honor the tremendous history of the African-Americans throughout our country, throughout the world if you think about it, right? And this story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. And then after giving a shout out to his token black cabinet member Ben Carson, who heads Housing and Urban Development despite having zero experience, he started bitching about and attacking the media over a report on Trump s first day that the Martin Luther King bust had been removed from the Oval Office, a mistake that was quickly corrected the same day but Trump still whines about. The statue is cherished, it s one of the favorite things, and we have some good ones, we have Lincoln and we have Jefferson, we have Dr. Martin Luther King,  he said.Trump then praised Fox News for kissing his ass and once again talked about inner cities as if they are crime-ridden war zones. I don t like watching fake news. Fox has treated me very nice, I don t know where Fox is, thank you. We need more jobs, better wages. We re going to work very hard in the inner city. Ben will be doing that, one of his big things. We need safer communities. We re going to do that with law enforcement. We re going to make it safe. We re going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now it s terrible. Not content to just use Black History Month as an excuse to air his petty grievances, Trump chose to pat himself on the back as well. If you remember, I wasn t going to do well with the African-American community. And after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things. We ended up getting   I won t go into details but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. Hillary Clinton received 88 percent of the black vote on Election Day while Trump only received 8 percent, hardly something to brag about.Trump then gave permission to his black supporters to lavish him with praise.An Ohio pastor told Trump that  we love you  and actually dared to mention Trump and God in the same breath. He also somehow kept a straight face while claiming that Trump is a good listener.Trump then returned to bashing the media and whining. So much of the media is opposition party. Knowingly saying incorrect things. It s a very sad situation. But we seem to be doing well. You know, it s almost like, in the meantime we won. So maybe they don t have the influence they think. They really have to straighten out their act. They re very dishonest people. Here s the unbelievable video via YouTube.Basically, Trump said more about Omarosa and his black media surrogates than he did about black history, reducing the names of King, Rosa Parks, and Frederick Douglass to mere footnotes in his remarks and once again demonstrating that he is a disgrace.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 1, 2017"

Here s an example of how DeSantis took on the fake Trump-Russian collusion story:Sun Sentinel   DeSantis, who hasn t officially announced his candidacy, thanked Trump in a press release with the headline,  President Trump Backs Ron DeSantis for Governor of Florida. I m grateful to have the president s support and appreciate what he has done,  DeSantis said, adding praise for Trump achievements that have pleased conservatives: recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, signing the tax reform legislation, and appointing conservative judges.DeSantis, a Republican from Ponte Vedra Beach, has been a strong supporter of Trump.In August, he proposed cutting off funding for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.DeSantis  proposal, which went nowhere, would have stopped money for the investigation 180 days after it becomes law. And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"
 The Anne Frank Center Just TORCHED Trump For Pathetic And Late Condemnation Of Anti-Semitism,"Donald Trump does not care about Jewish people. If he did, he would have strongly condemned anti-Semitism long ago instead of pandering to groups that commit it.In cities across the country on Monday, Jewish community centers were evacuated after receiving bomb threats.This is yet another escalation of the attack on Jewish people in America since Trump was elected in November. Hate crimes are on the rise, and so is anti-Semitism. Trump has been repeatedly called upon to condemn anti-Semitism but he has refused to do so or only weakly does so because he would lose his supporters on the extreme right-wing.On Tuesday, a full day after the bomb threats, Trump finally made a short statement pathetically denouncing anti-Semitism. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,  Trump said.Of course, Trump has contributed to this hate by ignoring it and has insulted Jews ever since taking office a month ago.Shortly after Trump s late statement, Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect Executive Director Steven Goldstein scolded Trump in a statement. The President s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of anti-Semitism,  he began. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti-Semitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, President s Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing.When President Trump responds to anti-Semitic proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that s when we ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump do not make us Jews settle for crumbs of condescension. What are you going to do about #Antsemitism in @WhiteHouse pic.twitter.com/95Z5GP1OBc  AnneFrankCenter(US) (@AnneFrankCenter) February 21, 2017Trump s campaign was heavily supported by Nazis and Trump even hired a Nazi by making Steve Bannon his top adviser. So while Trump s statement on Tuesday is a start, it s not enough because his anti-Semitic supporters still believe he is one of them and that he doesn t really believe what he s saying when he  condemns  them. That s because Trump s statement was weak and his previous actions and words make it clear that he is not a friend to Jews.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 21, 2017"
"NOT SO FUNNY GUY, Liberal WILL FERRELL Makes Movie Mocking Ronald Reagan’s Alzheimer’s…Reagan’s Daughter Has A Few Choice Words For Him","What s next Making a comedy at the Humane Society about euthanizing pets?  Patti Davis, daughter of late President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan, penned a moving open letter to actor Will Ferrell on Thursday criticizing his involvement in an upcoming comedic film that will satirize President Reagan s tragic battle with Alzheimer s disease.The film, based on a 2015 Black List script, centers on a fictional story in which President Reagan begins suffering from dementia shortly after a landslide reelection victory in 1984. A young aide must convince Reagan that he is an actor playing the President in a movie.Ferrell is attached to play Reagan in the film and will produce it under his Gary Sanchez Productions banner.Here is the letter Patty Davis penned to Ferrell:Dear Mr. Ferrell,I saw the news bulletin   as did everyone   that you intend to portray my father in the throes of Alzheimer s for a comedy that you are also producing. Perhaps you have managed to retain some ignorance about Alzheimer s and other versions of dementia. Perhaps if you knew more, you would not find the subject humorous.Alzheimer s doesn t care if you are President of the United States or a dockworker. It steals what is most precious to a human being   memories, connections, the familiar landmarks of a lifetime that we all come to rely on to hold our place secure in this world and keep us linked to those we have come to know and love. I watched as fear invaded my father s eyes   this man who was never afraid of anything. I heard his voice tremble as he stood in the living room and said,  I don t know where I am.  I watched helplessly as he reached for memories, for words, that were suddenly out of reach and moving farther away. For ten long years he drifted   past the memories that marked his life, past all that was familiar and mercifully, finally past the fear.There was laughter in those years, but there was never humor.Alzheimer s is the ultimate pirate, pillaging a person s life and leaving an empty landscape behind. It sweeps up entire families, forcing everyone to claw their way through overwhelming grief, confusion, helplessness, and anger. Perhaps for your comedy you would like to visit some dementia facilities. I have   I didn t find anything comedic there, and my hope would be that if you re a decent human being, you wouldn t either.Twice a week I run a support group called Beyond Alzheimer s for caregivers and family members of those with Alzheimer s and dementia. I look into haunted eyes that remind me of my own when my father was ill. I listen to stories of helplessness and loss and am continually moved by the bravery of those who wake up every morning not knowing who their loved one will be that day, or what will be lost. The only certainty with Alzheimer s is that more will be lost and the disease will always win in the end.Perhaps you would like to explain to them how this disease is suitable material for a comedy.",left-news,"Apr 28, 2016"
 Milo Might Have Gone Too Far This Time – Even For Breitbart (DETAILS),"Right-wing provocateur, Neo-Nazi, all around douchebag and Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos is finally getting his comeuppance for being a terrible human being. It seems that even the internet hellhole of misogynists, anti-Semites, racists, white supremacists, and other assorted bigots that is Breitbart has had enough of Milo since he came under fire for videos in which he openly defended pederasty. These revelations got him banned from speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and now it seems that they may even cost him his job.The Hill is reporting that Milo s fellow employees at Breitbart are disgusted by his remarks, and a fair number of them are threatening to leave the company if Milo isn t given his walking papers. An unnamed senior editor leaked to the Washingtonian that Milo has been a problem for some time now, and that this is the straw that breaks the camel s back for  at least half a dozen  Breitbart employees: The fact of the matter is that there s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister. If the company isn t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it. Talking abut young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys  relationships with older men I m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words. What right-thinking person doesn t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that? Granted, considering the filth that is printed at Breitbart and the types of people who frequent the place, this reaction to Milo s defense of the indefensible here is hardly something that redeems them. But, at the end of the day, if Milo is shunned from polite society and has all of his platforms taken away, it s better for society as a whole. If he s too much for Breitbart, chances are he s too much for any other outlet or news network as well.UPDATE: It is also being reported that Simon & Schuster will not be publishing Milo s book, Dangerous.Simon & Schuster is canceling the publication of 'Dangerous' by Milo Yiannopoulos ""After careful consideration.""

"ARE ANGRY LEFTISTS Planning Violent Communist Revolution?…“It is their goal to “block, obstruct, disrupt” Trump’s Inauguration","Author Ed Klein told Pete Hegseth on Fox and Friends Weekend that Barack Obama is setting up a shadow government in Washington DC to undermine President Trump after Inauguration Day. Does Obama have plans to work with the underbelly of the Democrat Party to disrupt Trump s term as President?But could the left really attempt a violent revolution to overthrow the U.S. government and overturn the American way of life?Not only could they, but they will try, according to Douglas V. Gibbs, who has appeared as a commentator on Fox News and is a radio talk-show host in Los Angeles.And it won t be a liberal revolution. It will be a communist revolution.That s the prediction Gibbs made in an article published Friday in the Canada Free Press titled,  Democrats Prepare for Violent Revolution. Examining the evidence, he concludes a revolution attempt is not necessarily imminent, but that it will happen, once various pieces fall into place.Gibbs declared,  They are in full preparation for social and economic collapse, or a violent revolution. He cites the website DisruptJ20 and its  Call for a bold mobilization against the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017. Gibbs quotes Michael Moore explaining,  It is their goal to  block, obstruct, disrupt, and do whatever they can to prevent the onslaught that is going to happen with Donald Trump. .It is Gibbs  contention that,  The liberal leftists want desperately to sabotage the Trump administration, and possibly overthrow the entire government. For their socialist big government agenda, the ends justifies the means. Why now?Because, he explained,  [U]nder Obama, the veil was raised. Why worry about exposure now? They ve been poking the right-of-center groups in the chest for years, trying to instigate a violent response, and they never got it. Now,  he continued,  they may be realizing, it is up to them to initiate the violence. It is up to the leftists to finally launch the true coup. Or, at least that is what a lot of people think. Evidence that could support his theory is not hard to come by, as the left is becoming increasingly violent.During the 2016 presidential campaign, leftist riots broke out in cities across the country, the worst perhaps in San Jose, California, and in Chicago.WND reported assassination threats against Trump accompanied the nationwide rioting.Often-violent anti-Trump protests broke out in cities including Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Denver, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Seattle, Tampa, Dallas and Oakland, California.In Chicago, a video showed a mob of young black men beating and dragging through the streets a white man who voted for Trump.Portland, Oregon police termed a protest a riot after  anarchists  threw objects at officers, vandalized local businesses and damaged cars.Some 1,000 protesters in Oakland broke store windows, left graffiti on buildings and threw M-80 firecrackers, Molotov cocktails and bottles at police officers, authorities told CNN.And that s only the beginning, if Gibbs is right.He suggests the left will inevitably move on to more violence following the election of Trump, because  the realization that the Democrats are losing grip on their transformational agenda in the rest of the country has slammed the leftists square in the face. Gibbs asserts the leftists  hate any opposition, and are willing to do whatever it takes to either win over their opposition, or silence and eliminate their opposition. The next step by the left, according to Gibbs, is the stockpiling of arms. Now, it s the liberals who are suddenly worried, and stockpiling food, guns, and emergency supplies,  he observed.  Trump s 2016 win was a wake-up call. Their cheating, lying and violence was not enough to stop the man, and his very unorthodox approach to politics. Gibbs sees the left s hysteria as now having gone beyond insanity, marking a transition to violent anger.He believes the hysteria arose because the left they thought they had finally defeated the right permanently with the election of Obama, and that the election of Hillary Clinton would seal the deal. They only needed, now, to disarm the crazy right-wing bastards,  wrote Gibbs.  Then, with a faint whimper, the last of the opposition to the liberal left agenda would be gone. It seemed to them a near-certainty, but when it all came crashing down on Nov. 8, it was a disorienting  shock to the system. Nobody on the left side of the aisle expected that Trump had a snowball s chance in Hell to win the 2016 Election. All of their skewed poll numbers said Hillary was going to win. Gibbs portrayed the left as in a state similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.For entire story: WND ",politics,"Jan 1, 2017"

BREAKING: OBAMA SUCCESSFULLY WHITEWASHES AMERICAN HISTORY…”Racist” President Andrew Jackson To Be Replaced With Harriet Tubman On $20 Bill,"The irony in Obama s radical Treasury Secretary s decision to remove  racist  Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill, lies in the fact that Jackson was the first Democrat to be elected President. Rabid Bernie Sanders supporters are hell-bent on seeing Bernie Sanders fulfill his promise of breaking up the big bank monopolies. Andrew Jackson was pioneer in staving off banking domination in his day.But alas it s official .Moments ago Politico reported that the U.S. Treasury will announce that it plans to replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman, the sources said. There will also be changes to the $5 bill to depict civil rights era leaders.Not every dead president is being scraped however: treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Wednesday will announce a decision to keep Alexander Hamilton on the front of the $10 bill and put leaders of the movement to give women the right to vote on the back of the bill.Lew s decision comes after he announced last summer that he was considering replacing Hamilton on the $10 bill with a woman. The announcement drew swift rebukes from fans of Hamilton, who helped create the Treasury Department and the modern American financial system. Critics immediately suggested Hamilton take Jackson off the $20 bill given the former president s role in moving native Americans off their land.Jackson may remain on the $20 bill in some capacity, but will clearly be demoted.While some pointed to the many accomplishments and qualities of Hamilton for why he should stay on the currency printed by the very Treasury the man created, the more popular argument for the Founding Father s retention was an argument about how awful the man on the $20 dollar bill was.The Daily Beast described Jackson as  villainous  and linked to a February article that called him a  mass murderer. The New York Post argued that Old Hickory  may well have been our most racist president  and was a  vicious, power-mad kook. Lew told POLITICO last July that Treasury was exploring ways to respond to critics.  There are a number of options of how we can resolve this,  Lew said.  We re not taking Alexander Hamilton off our currency. Confused? Disturbed? Angry? You are not alone. The following rant by Mac Slavo expressed many feeling about the proposed change.Andrew Jackson, Who Fought Central Bank, Removed from $20 As  Public Concern for Liberty  ErasedJackson narrowly succeeded in staving off banker domination of the U.S. during his day.Of course, Andrew Jackson, who was the United States  seventh president, was also a complete controversy his entire lifetime. It is no surprise that the same people who took down the Confederate flag from the South on the back of a mass shooting tragedy are now trying to tear down the image of a particularly controversial and intriguing figure from the American past.Jackson was a recalcitrant and unyielding general and war hero, and later an outsider riding a wave of populist support into the White House, bringing in sometimes unscrupulous companions, and plenty of Masons. Many of his backers were diametrically opposed to the entrenched power of New York bankers and speculators, as well as patrician politicians who dominated the first phase of politics in the nation s history. Jackson played a nasty role in the Trail of Tears affairs with Indians, too, and with the South and Western expansion of slave-friendly territories. Many shades of grey.Erasing Andrew Jackson from the faces of the fiat funny-money that is passed around by an increasingly ignorant and dependent society (which itself has adopted digital currency as the new norm) will further cut off the past from the masses, and ensure their enslavement.For entire story: Zero Hedge",Government News,"Apr 20, 2016"
WATCH: COWARDLY ANTIFA THUGS Surround Afghanistan Veteran At Boston Free Speech Rally…Scream In His Face: “F*ck Off Nazi Scum!”,"***WARNING***This video is very disturbing!Try to imagine this brave man who voluntarily enlisted in our US military, traveled halfway around the world to Afghanistan where he risked his life to defend our nation against some of the most evil people on the planet, only to come home to some of the most evil people in America shouting,  F*ck off Nazi scum!  in his face. The saddest part of this video is watching the Afghanistan veteran actually attempt to have dialogue with these anti-American jack-asses, who are likely only there to collect a paycheck from George Soros.The crime of attending the free-speech rally in and of itself, was enough to anger these anti-Americans, but the moment this veteran admitted to supporting President Trump, the angry Alt-Left crowd began to come unhinged.

 ROFL: An Adult Film Company Just Offered To Make Ted Cruz’s Bizarre Dreams Come True (Letter),"A video that recently surfaced of a young Ted Cruz has raised some eyebrows. The creepy little Cruz, aside from declaring his aspirations to be rich, powerful and to take over the world, also expressed an interest in making a  teen tit film,  because he s the perfect Christian. Yes, your sarcasm alarm went off for a reason.Well now Ted Cruz has been given the opportunity to make his dream come true, thanks to adult film giant, Vivid Entertainment. Big shot at Vivid, Steve Hirsch, has extended an offer for Cruz to star in his very own XXX movie that would most certainly be quite a tad more risqu than an 80 s  tit film.  Hirsh offered to send $1 million to the super PAC of Cruz s choice in exchange for his services.This letter to Senator Cruz, obtained by TMZ, lays out the offer, along with a suggested headline for the film, which is nothing short of brilliant and hilarious:Courtesy of TMZThe crack about his home country was a great touch. This is what is called trolling the turd. Mockery at its finest. Ted Cruz, fast becoming the most hated man in Washington, deserves every bit of ridicule he gets.

 Glenn Beck Anchor In Race Attack On Beyoncé For Super Bowl Show (VIDEO),"An anchor for Glenn Beck s TV network, The Blaze, is the latest right-wing media figure to attack Beyonc  for her Super Bowl halftime performance.Tomi Lahren, who hosts the show Tomi, used her program to berate Beyonc s work. Lahren, 23, argues that,  Your husband was a drug dealer. For fourteen years, he sold crack cocaine. Talk about protecting black neighborhoods? Start at home. https://youtu.be/cwVnDRx8EikThat is a reference to Beyonc s husband, rapper and rap mogul Jay Z. The strange bit is that Lahren is referring to behavior Jay Z engaged in when he was a teenager. He is now 46 years old, and has had a multi-decade career topping music charts, producing some of the biggest names in music, working in fashion and other industries. He is worth an estimated $520 million, and has sold over 100 million records and received 21 Grammy Awards.Lahren has inadvertently made a point about the racial injustice and prejudice Beyonc  was alluding to in her performance and in the song  Formation,  when she reduces Jay Z s life to his teenage mistakes   which he has been very open about in his work   and ignores his business success and philanthropy (he was part of a $1 million donation to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina, for instance).She joins other conservatives like former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in attacking Beyonc s performance for having the nerve to bring up Hurricane Katrina, black pride, and police shootings of black civilians.The mindset being promoted by Lahren in this attack definitely fits in with former Fox News host Glenn Beck, who welcomed her to The Blaze  family  in October of last year after several of her right-wing video rants went viral.Beck, who is still heard on the radio after a cascade of dropped sponsors pushed Fox to cancel his show. Has a history of racially charged remarks. He said President Obama had a  deep-seated hatred of white people,  claimed progressives were pushing for a  race war,  promoted a book written by an anti-semite, and repeatedly claimed Obama was trying to enslave people.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016"

Rhodes Is Wrong And Trump Could Have The Last Laugh,"21st Century Wire says Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump accused his predecessor, Barack Obama, of ordering a  wire tap  at Trump Tower prior to the Presidential Election. Yes, a  wire tap . Sounds pretty unsophisticated in this day and age as a means of SIGINT in the post Snowden revelation era where there are numerous more  covert  methods available to agencies. Democrats and other mainstream pundits wasted no time in defending Obama and criticizing Trump s lack of evidence in the matter. One of these voices was Ben Rhodes, Obama s former Senior Advisor. He also said  only a liar  could make the case, as Trump suggested, that Obama wire tapped Trump Tower ahead of the election. Shortly after Rhodes took to Twitter in defense of Obama, this article from 2013 became viral that seemed to hold together Trump s allegation of  wire-tapping . To add to the Obama accusations, Wikileaks weighed in with the following;Obama has a history of tapping & hacking his friends and rivals https://t.co/XbwyNSwTXg #NSA #PRISM #Merkel #Sarkozy #BanKiMoon #WTO #Trump pic.twitter.com/5CebcnkFgn  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 5, 2017More on this report from Zerohedge  Tyler Durden ZerohedgeFollowing Trump s stunning allegation that Obama wiretapped the Trump Tower in October of 2016, prior to the presidential election, which may or may not have been sourced from a Breitbart story, numerous Democrats and media pundits have come out with scathing accusations that Trump is either mentally disturbed, or simply has no idea what he is talking about.The best example of this came from Ben Rhodes, a former senior adviser to President Obama in his role as deputy National Security Advisor, who slammed Trump s accusation, insisting that  No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you.  He also said  only a liar  could make the case, as Trump suggested, that Obama wire tapped Trump Tower ahead of the election.No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you. https://t.co/lEVscjkzSw  Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) March 4, 2017It would appear, however, that Rhodes is wrong, especially as pertains to matters of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, and its associated FISA court, under which the alleged wiretap of Donald Trump would have been granted, as it pertained specifically to Trump s alleged illicit interactions with Russian entities.In Chapter 36 of Title 50 of the US Code *War and National Defense , Subchapter 1, Section 1802, we read the following:(1) Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the Attorney General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this sub-chapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that (A) the electronic surveillance is solely directed at  (i) the acquisition of the contents of communications transmitted by means of communications used exclusively between or among foreign powers, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title; or (ii) the acquisition of technical intelligence, other than the spoken communications of individuals, from property or premises under the open and exclusive control of a foreign power, as defined in section 1801(a)(1), (2), or (3) of this title;(B) there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party; and(C) the proposed minimization procedures with respect to such surveillance meet the definition of minimization procedures under section 1801(h) of this title; and if the Attorney General reports such minimization procedures and any changes thereto to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at least thirty days prior to their effective date, unless the Attorney General determines immediate action is required and notifies the committees immediately of such minimization procedures and the reason for their becoming effective immediately.While (B) seems to contradict the underlying permissive nature of Section 1802 as it involves a United States person, what the Snowden affair has demonstrated all too clearly, is how frequently the NSA and FISA court would make US citizens collateral damage. To be sure, many pointed out the fact that Fox News correspondent James Rosen was notoriously wiretapped in 2013 when the DOJ was investigating government leaks. The Associated Press was also infamously wiretapped in relation to the same investigation.Furthermore, while most Democrats   not to mention former president Obama himself   have been harshly critical of Trump s comments, some such as former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau was quite clear in his warning to reporters that Obama did not say there was no wiretapping, effectively confirming it:I'd be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping. Statement just said that neither he nor the WH ordered it.

Loyal Hope Hicks is Officially Trump’s Replacement for Scaramucci: ‘She started off with us right from day one’,"Connecticut native, Hope Hicks, who had been serving as the interim White House communications director, is getting the job full-time, Bloomberg first reported Tuesday.Of course, the left immediately bombarded  twitter with negative comments. They failed to note that this is the first time the communications team at the White House is two women. Nope, no mention of Hicks and Huckabee Sanders as a dynamic duo for President Trump. They re just taking bets on how long she lasts. What they failed to note is that Hicks has been with the campaign  since day one .Her twitter bio :At age 28, Hicks will be the youngest person to hold the job, and it will mark the first time women have concurrently held the positions of communications director and White House press secretary, with Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the latter.Hicks replaces Trump s campaign donor Anthony Scaramucci, who held onto the job for just 10 days, and the low key Mike Dubke, the administration s first communications director, who left the White House in May.Hicks was one of Trump s originals, when his campaign was just a rag tag team of aides.Hicks is a Southern Methodist University graduate. She had been working for the first daughter, doing public relations for Ivanka Trump s brand, when the businessman brought her in to handle press requests for his young presidential campaign.  She started off with us right from day one,  President Trump told supporters at a rally last year, beckoning Hicks to come onstage.  She used to be in my real estate company,  he explained.  I said,  What do you know about politics?  She said,  Absolutely nothing,  Trump said. With that, Hicks was hired.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Sep 12, 2017"
 Republicans Furious That Even Fox News Is Reporting How Low The Deficit Is Under Obama (VIDEO),"Something extraordinary happened that is certain to have Republicans and Republican voters everywhere furious   Fox News just admitted that the United States deficit is at its lowest level since 2008. That s right, since the last Republican was in office. You have to admit, this must have taken a lot of courage on the behalf of Fox News to admit something like this. It goes directly against their  bash President Obama for everything  policy.However, there it is, in bold print on FoxBusiness.com:They even published this, which will make every Republican that follows Fox News as a religion and believe without question, do a double take: The U.S. ran a budget surplus in January, dropping the annual deficit to its lowest level since August 2008, the Treasury Department said Wednesday.The U.S. deficit fell to $405 billion over the 12-month period ended January, or around 2.2% of gross domestic product, boosted by a $55 billion surplus in January. The deficit figure was down from the year-earlier $495 billion, or 2.8% of GDP.  Quite a change of heart when Fox News actually sees the results of Obama s actions. Unlike how they behaved years ago after the president first took office, which you can view here, when they completely ignored deficit reduction:Fox Business even explained how the reduction in deficit was achieved: Revenues stood around 6% above their year-earlier levels, while outlays were around 3% higher. Receipts of $314 billion collected by the Treasury was a record for the month of January.The latest report showed annual revenues posted their slowest rate of growth since August 2012. Corporate tax receipts for the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1., ran around 10% below their year-earlier level. Individual taxes withheld by employers and payroll tax revenues were up 3%, while other individual taxes, such as capital gains, were 8% higher. Funny how when you have a president that truly believes in math, they can actually achieve success in regards to deficit reduction, and understands that in order to pay for things, we need revenue coming in. Republicans have yet to figure that out.Now, if only we could get Republicans to actually look at the presidents latest budget, which as of now, they have simply refused to even entertain.The GOP is literally a vomit stain on the rug of America that we can t seem to remove.Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 12, 2016"
"NOT KIDDING: Call A Transexual “He” If He Wants To Be Called “She” In Communist NYC…Pay Staggering $250,000 Fine","The LGBT mafia has never been more threatening or powerful Did you call a transsexual person  he  or  she  when they preferred to be called  zhe?  According to a newly updated anti-discrimination law in New York City, you could be fined an eye-watering $250,000.In the latest, astonishing act of draconian political correctness, the NYC Commission on Human Rights have updated a law on  Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Expression  to threaten staggering financial penalties against property owners who  misgender  employees or tenants.Incidents that are deemed  wilful and malicious  will see property owners face up to $250,000 in fines, while standard violations of the law will result in a $125,000 fine. For small business owners, these sums are crippling.It s not as simple as referring to transmen  he  or transwomen as  she,  either. The legislation makes it clear that if an individual desires, property owners will have to make use of  zhe,   hir  and any other preferred pronoun. From the updated legislation:The NYCHRL requires employers and covered entities to use an individual s preferred name, pronoun and title (e.g., Ms./Mrs.) regardless of the individual s sex assigned at birth, anatomy, gender, medical history, appearance, or the sex indicated on the individual s identification. Most individuals and many transgender people use female or male pronouns and titles.Some transgender and gender non-conforming people prefer to use pronouns other than he/him/his or she/her/hers, such as they/them/theirs or ze/hirOther violations of the law include refusing to allow individuals to use single-sex facilities such as bathrooms that are  consistent with their gender identity,  failing to provide employee health benefits for  gender-affirming care  and  imposing different uniforms or grooming standards based on sex or gender. Examples of such illegal behaviour include:  requiring female bartenders to wear makeup,   Permitting only individuals who identify as women to wear jewellery or requiring only individuals who identify as male to have short hair,  and  permitting female but not male residents at a drug treatment facility to wear wigs and high heels. In other words, if a bar owner prevents male bartenders from wearing lipstick and heels, they ll be breaking the law. They ve now got a choice between potentially scaring off customers, and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Regardless of the establishment s client le or aesthetic, every property owner will be forced to conform to the same standard.This is the latest in what Spiked Online editor-in-chief Brendan O Neill calls  The Crisis of Character  in the west, in which identities become grounded in subjective interpretation rather than objective reality. The state is now forcing society to recognise the subjective identities of individuals, regardless of how absurd or surreal they may seem. In New York City, recognising someone s identity is no longer a matter of case-by-case common sense and courtesy. It s zir way or the highway.",politics,"Dec 28, 2015"

" Celebrity Gun Nut Threatens To Shoot His Girlfriend, Gets Arrested With His Pants Down – Literally","A man known primarily for posting videos of himself making the sounds of different types of guns   yeah, apparently there is a market for that   was arrested after he threatened to shoot his underage girlfriend and then kill cops in a rampage. Just another day in gun crazy America!Bryan Silva, 25, has over two million followers on Facebook and Vine, where he thrills fellow gun lovers with short videos of his obsession with firearms.However he went from  good guy with a gun  to violent nutcase in a hurry. On January 4, Charlottesville, Virginia, police received a call from a distraught 17-year-old girl who said she had just escaped Silva s home after he held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her. She also told police that Silva was planning on killing cops.Police responded to a domestic dispute call around 6 a.m. Sunday at the home where the barricade situation occurred.According to police, the call was made by a neighbor. It was a domestic disturbance,  said Longo.  A female caller said that she was threatened with a firearm, we responded and began an investigation. Apparently, a 17-year-old girl had been at the residence when a dispute occurred. She then left go to the neighbor s house.The girl told police she had been held against her will by her boyfriend and that he had also threatened her with a handgun. She also told officers that he had threatened to shoot the police.Virginia is one of several Republican states that recently pushed to make it easier for people to have and carry guns. It seems to be working out well.The police surrounded Silva s house, and Silva took advantage of his infamy by   what else?   posting to his social media accounts about his siege with police and chatting with friends.But while Silva would have loved to posture himself as a gun-toting badass, things didn t work out that way. He eventually surrendered   and was promptly arrested with his pants falling to his ankles. In the ultimate bit of karma, the Vine  star  was immortalized in this hilarious Vine.I can't believe this vine of Bryan Silva being arrested with his pants down #Gratata https://t.co/iSwWXfWvg0  Ryan Broderick (@broderick) January 4, 2016It turns out that Silva was not legally allowed to have all those guns he was bragging about daily on social media. Silva was already a convicted felon. On top of the new charges of abduction, he was slapped with another felony, illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.His legions of gun nut fans will probably be disappointed, but the streets are probably much safer with Bryan Silva off of Vine and the streets.Feature image via Newsplex",News,"January 4, 2016"
ITALIAN CATHOLICS TOLD TO “PRAY SILENTLY” So As Not To “Offend” Muslim Refugees Living In Church [VIDEO],"Italian Catholics are essentially being told to pray silently (hide their religious convictions) to avoid offending anyone, while Muslims are living free of charge in their church? I can t be the only Catholic who has a problem with this Parishioners in the Italian parish of St. Anthony in Ventimiglia, a small town in northwestern Italy about four miles from the border of France, were ordered Saturday by a Catholic aid organization volunteer to pray the Rosary silently so the Muslim migrants living in the church would not be offended.With a population of about 55,000, Ventimiglia has been overwhelmed by Muslim migrants, receiving over 50 every day, many of which are housed in Catholic churches.ANSA reports a parishioner snapped back at the volunteer, telling him to  bring migrants into another church.  The parish priest, Don Rito, instead took the parishioners to another church close by where they could pray out loud.Migrants have been pouring into the little town on their way to France and locals feel overwhelmed. The mayor of Ventimiglia, Enrico Ioculano, said the situation is  untenable.  But the Italian government and Caritas seem to do little to help the burden; already in the first five months of 2016 it has cost the town  220,000, less than half of which will be funded by the government.Caritas is also doing little to allay the town s burden. While it helps migrants who want to file for refugee status, saying they have  a special channel,  in March the local director said the organization can only afford to provide  for a few days  those who are passing through, whether they stay for a day or weeks.The Lepanto Institute describes Caritas Internationalis as a confederation of 165 Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.It has been exposed by the American Life League as being part of the Marxist organization the World Social Forum, promoting communism, abortion, and homosexuality throughout the world.WATCH HERE:Via: Church Militant",left-news,"Jun 8, 2016"
 CBS Reporter Describes Racism At Donald Trump Rallies,"CBS reporter Sopan Deb has been speaking out about the level of racism he has personally encountered at Donald Trump rallies.As Addicting Info reported here, Deb, a U.S. citizen of Indian descent, was arrested earlier this week while covering Donald Trump s canceled IUC rally.His unconstitutional arrest by Chicago police is now helping to draw attention to deeper issues that define the Trump campaign.Deb reports that he has encountered a shocking amount of racism from Trump supporters, during the time he has been assigned to cover Trump s rallies.For example, in January he describes a man accusing him of recording a Trump rally for ISIS. A Trump supporter just asked me at Reno event if I was taking pictures for ISIS. When I looked shocked, he said,  yeah, I m talking to you.  Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) January 10, 2016He went on to describe the encounter in more detail, writing on Twitter,The man then repeated the accusation multiple times. I told him, politely, I was with CBS and that what he said was inappropriate.  Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) January 10, 2016The same man then told him  This is America, be glad you re here. I have a couple of guesses what he meant by that,  Deb said on Twitter.He says that during a different rally, held in December, another Trump supporter told him to  Go back to Iraq. It should come as no surprise to anyone to learn that Trump s rallies are a magnet for the lowest common denominator. If there is any sort of diversity among Trump s supporters, it s only in the slight difference between proud white supremacists with swastika tattoos, and semi-closeted racists, who prefer to hide behind crosses while crying that their  traditional Christian values  are under attack. Politically speaking, however, there s very little difference between the Tea Party platform, the platform of the American Nazi Party, that of the KKK or any other white supremacist organization.As the Washington Post reported here, membership in white supremacist groups grew at an enormous rate after the election of President Obama in 2008. There were 194 such groups in 2000, a number that dropped to 149 by 2008, but after President Obama s election, the number jumped to more than 1,000 Trump has capitalized on the right wing s seething race hatred, and in doing so, he s been propelled to the head of race.Knowing that, it s no surprise that the candidate has refused to condemn the KKK, or that white nationalists have been robocalling voters on behalf of his campaign.In 2016, voters will decide which direction our country will move in. Should Donald Trump, or any other right-wing racist win the presidency, racial tensions are likely to explode across the country.Now s the time to keep our country moving forward, challenging racism and right-wing extremism at every turn. A great battle was won during the historic 2008 election of President Barack Obama, but the war is far from over.Image credit: Darron Birgenheier via Flckr; screen capture, Sopan Deb via Twitter",News,"March 13, 2016"
"HILLARY SUPPORTER, PROMINENT LAWYER Alan Dershowitz: If Dems Elect Muslim Keith Ellison To DNC Chair, He’s Leaving Dem Party…”Loyalty To My Country Exceeds Any Loyalty To My Party”","In today s distorted world of  human rights,  truth takes a back seat to ideology, and false claims   especially those that  support  radical ideologies   persist even after they have been exposed. Alan DershowitzHarvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a high-profile Democrat for decades, said in an op-ed published Friday that he will leave the party if Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is elected chairman this weekend. My loyalty to my country and my principles and my heritage exceeds any loyalty to my party,  Dershowitz, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, wrote in  The Hill  newspaper.When the Jews were being persecuted by the Nazis in 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which focused on rescuing Jews, a religious group. But if the religious group is the subject of the persecution based on their religion, it s perfectly OK for a First Amendment-bound society to emphasize their rescue, just as it is perfectly OK to emphasize the fact that many, if not all of the perpetrators of Islamic terrorism, come from countries with a history of supporting terrorism. Alan DershowitzDershowitz recounted Ellison s history of controversial statements and actions many deemed anti-Semitic, including the congressman s history with Louis Farrakhan s  Nation of Islam  movement. A prominent lawyer   told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school,  Dershowitz claims in the column.Dershowitz slammed Ellison for disavowing Farrakhan at the same time he was first running for office in Minneapolis, adding that his recent claims of support for Israel coincide with his bid to lead the Democratic National Committee.Calling the DNC election a  momentous choice,  Dershowitz said the party could either go the direction of British parliamentarian Jeremy Corbyn, who led a far-left shift in the Labour Party, or try to recapture the  Rust Belt  Democrats who switched their allegiance to President Trump last November. I hope they choose wisely,  Dershowitz said of the DNC s voting members,  If they do not, I have made my choice.   Fox News ",politics,"Feb 25, 2017"
 ‘Go Back To Your Own Country’: Right-Wing Bigot Shoots Man In Fit Of Anti-Immigrant Rage,"Donald Trump s presidency has inspired many bigot to come out of the woodwork and commit acts of violence against those they perceive as not belonging in  their  country. The latest incidence of this was the case of a man of the Sikh faith who lives outside Seattle, Washington in the town of Kent, being shot in his own driveway by a man who told him to  go back to [your] own country. The victim is a 39-year-old man who was working on his car in his yard, minding his own business. According to the Washington Post, a stranger approached the man unprovoked. He was reportedly clad in a mask and was carrying a loaded gun. The criminal is described as a white male, roughly six feet tall. When he invaded the man s property, some kind of confrontation ensued, and then the man told the victim,  go back to your own country,  before shooting said victim in the arm.The name of the victim has not been given to the press, and the perpetrator is still at large. Kent police are considering that this is a possible hate crime.Kent police chief says dept. is investigating last night's shooting as a possible hate crime against member of Sikh community. pic.twitter.com/pLcWsobvm4  Ryan Takeo (@RyanTakeoK5) March 4, 2017This act of violence also comes on the heels of two Indian men being shot by a white man with similar anti-immigrant sentiments, with one of them being killed. Another man was also wounded when he tried to stop the murderous act.Anyone who thinks this has nothing to do with Donald Trump s hateful rhetoric is deluded at this point. Trump s own hatred, and blatant appeals to white supremacists and other fringe bigots has emboldened the worst and the most violent among us. He has given them permission to openly hate again, and they are acting on it, full stop. Donald Trump and his followers are literally getting people killed.

 WATCH: Lewis Black Hilariously BURNS Trump And Mocks Inauguration On The Daily Show,"If Lewis Black really does have a ticket to the inauguration, Donald Trump is probably trying to revoke it right now.Because during Wednesday night s Daily Show, the comedian roasted Trump, taking particular aim at Trump s inauguration problems.For weeks, Trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an A-list celebrity to perform at the inauguration. For the most part, Trump has failed, so he has resorted to hiring a reality show contestant and a has-been band, while forcing the Radio City Rockettes to perform because they can be fired for saying no.Black informed Trump that if he wants to know why many celebrities died in 2016, it s because they didn t want to perform at the inauguration either. You want to know why so many celebrities died in 2016? It was to get out of playing the goddamn inauguration,  Black quipped.Then Black pointed out that Trump is pretending he doesn t really care if A-list celebrities show up, even going so far as to claim that he s the one who rejected them and not the other way around.The so-called  A  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Black was able to get a ticket, however, and he intends to show up on Friday whether Trump likes it or not. I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently. Here s the video via YouTube.With an embarrassment like Trump in office, comedians like Lewis Black are definitely going to have plenty of material over the next four years.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"January 19, 2017"
 BUSTED: Fox News Worked With Trump To Circulate Fake News On Seth Rich Conspiracy Theory,"Psst! Hey, Donald Trump, the  fake news  you rage-tweet about is coming from you. According to an explosive report on NPR, the Fox News Channel and a wealthy supporter of amateur president Trump worked together under the watchful eye of the White House in order to hatch a story about murdered Democratic National Committee aide Seth Rich,  a lawsuit filed Tuesday claims. The story is beyond cruel in that the family of Seth Rich had specifically called for an end to the false stories circulated by Fox News, but now Trump is caught in the middle, too.Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for the news network, claims that Fox News and the Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, intended to deflect public attention from the administration s Russia scandal. His suit further states that a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him in order to propel her story.NPR reports:On April 20, a month before the story ran, Butowsky and Wheeler   the investor and the investigator   met at the White House with then-press secretary Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering.The first page of the lawsuit quotes a voicemail and text from Butowsky boasting that Trump himself had reviewed drafts of the Fox News story just before it went to air and was published.Here it is:The White House previously denied knowledge of Fox News' false report on Seth Rich. pic.twitter.com/Qcmf3lpaFt  Adrienne Watson (@Adrienne_DNC) August 1, 2017The DNC did not murder Seth Rich but Trump supporters would need to have the ability to Google in order to understand that it s a hoax.As a surprise to no one ever, the White House previously denied any knowledge of the Fox News  lie about the false story about Seth Rich s murder.The White House previously denied knowledge of Fox News' false report on Seth Rich. pic.twitter.com/Qcmf3lpaFt  Adrienne Watson (@Adrienne_DNC) August 1, 2017Seth Rich s family released a statement.Statement from the Seth Rich family pic.twitter.com/p7siiOIYKh  Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) August 1, 2017Russia propaganda site Sputnik pushed the story, too.It wasn't just Butowsky who wanted this false story pushed.

OBAMA’S WORLD APOLOGY TOUR To Begin With Vietnam and Japan,"It s been said that all Presidents get the itch to travel in the last year of their term.

If that s not bad enough, Obama plans on visiting the site of Hiroshima to stick his thumb in the eye of America.

It s a schedule that will take him out of the country almost once a month from March through November, when voters will pick his replacement, and it is not unusual for presidents on their way out the door.In March, he became the first U.S. president in more than 80 years to visit Cuba, and he went on to Argentina on the same trip.In April, Air Force One was bound for Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Germany. In the U.K., his trip took on a wistful tone as he dined with the queen   his only British queen; her 12th U.S. president   toured the Globe Theatre and watched part of  Hamlet.

WATCH: UNCOVERED VIDEO REVEALS Dan Rather Saying Americans Are Bored With Bill Clinton Rape Story…Want To “Move On” To The Next Thing,"In one of his regular appearances on the Imus In The Morning radio show, Dan Rather was asked by Imus in 1999, if he had any idea why NBC News was sitting on the story about the rape charges against Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick?   Rather responded that the reason they were  sitting on the story  was  pretty obvious.  First, Rather clarified that they don t call to tell him why or why not they choose to hide a story from their news channel, but suggested:  I think it s pretty obvious that they re nervous about, number one, whether this information is accurate, whether it s really true or not. And number two, even if it does turn out to be true, it happened a long time ago, and number three, they ve got to be figuring that maybe, just maybe the American public has heard all that they want to hear about it and they re saying,  next , let s move on to the next thing. Imus went on to say that he read an article in either the leftist propaganda Newsweek or Time magazine that  even the woman herself, Juanita Broaddrick said she hoped that this thing went away this week, and even she was sick of hearing about it, [Dan Rather interrupted Imus with laughter] and it s her story.  Dan Rather then busted out in laughter and agreed, saying,  Well let s hope she gets her way with that.  More laughter Imus then revealed that  Someone from NBC News told me that she wasn t clear about when exactly this thing happened, but then her son called me and he s an attorney someplace, in, I guess in Arkansas, and he wanted me to know, why he called me god knows, but he wanted me to know that that was not the case, that she knows exactly what it was, and there was some other reason they were sitting on it. Instead of responding to Imus  comments, Rather deflected by making an embarrassing play to stroke Imus  ego and distract him from the reason NBC hiding the Clinton rape story. Rather continued,  But I just don t know if this is going anywhere, you know, I d have to bet for the moment that it isn t. The Washington Post gave it a pretty good ride on Saturday, and there wasn t much pick up from it. So unless there s some new and sensational information developed out of it, my guess is that it probably dribbles away. ",politics,"Nov 17, 2017"
" Trump Blamed Bernie Sanders For Campaign Violence, Here’s His Epic Response","Donald Trump is trying his best to blame the violence associated with his presidential campaign on anyone but the person who instigated it in the first place: himself.Reacting to criticism from the public, the media, and even his fellow Republican presidential candidates (who were largely silent on the violent rhetoric at Trump events before), Trump blamed the violence on the protesters who came out against his Chicago rally on Friday night   and on Democratic candidate on Bernie Sanders.In response, the Sanders campaign absolutely crushed Trump s big lie.The campaign released a statement to reporters that began,  as is the case virtually every day, Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar. Sander then said,  While I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump s rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests. That is a most likely a reference to video taken inside the rally showing loud cheers for  Bernie!  after it was announced that the Trump rally would be canceled (a decision, by the way, that Trump claimed came from police but which they denied).The statement continues,  What caused the protests at Trump s rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against Latinos, Muslims, women, and people with disabilities, and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of President Obama. Sanders previously referenced those same birther attacks and their racially loaded nature during the Democratic debate on Univision earlier in the week.Then Sanders returned to the instigator of the violence, Donald Trump himself, and wrote,  What caused the violence at Trump s rally is a campaign whose words and actions have encouraged it on the part of his supporters.  Sanders points out that Trump recently said he d like to punch a protester  in the face  and yearned for the days when a protester would be  carried out on a stretcher.  Sanders  campaign also pointed out that Trump s campaign manager has been accused of assaulting a female reporter, Michelle Fields of the conservative Breitbart News.Sanders concludes his release with a demand of Trump and his campaign: What Donald Trump must do now is stop provoking violence and make it clear to his supporters that people who attend his rallies or protest should not be assaulted, should not be punched, should not be kicked. In America people have a right to attend a political rally without fear of physical harm. Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 12, 2016"

More Fake News: Mainstream Media Lies About Trump ‘Evicting’ White House Press Corp,"21st Century Wire says Many mainstream news outlets have been abuzz about the headline going around saying that Trump may  evict  the press corp from accessing the White House, but when one looks deeper into what is being written in such articles it quickly becomes clear that there is nothing official stated about disallowing any press from the White House.Here s the facts: Incoming White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, while discussing potentially moving the press corps room from the James Brady Press Room, to the White House Conference Room   in order to add more seating for press to cover President Trump in the White House said: If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Look to the Blaze for how this is spun into a narrative which serves the dual purpose of agitating Trump s detractors into believing that he is going to suppress the freedom of the press and at the same time serves as a rouse to cause his ardent supporters to appear as though they are rejoicing at the potential of a Trump Presidency that would support suppressing the free press. When comparing the actual quotes with the editorial it is obvious that The Blaze and other mainstream media outlets are playing a wicked game of deceit to further the attempts at demonizing the incoming President.We can now see who the real  Fake News  culprits are.Below is one of the fake news articles circulating online   this one was floated out by Glenn Beck and his dubious media organization The Blaze . The BlazePresident-elect Donald Trump s transition team is reportedly considering plans to evict the White House press corps from accessing the White House.According to a report from Esquire, which cited three sources with the transition team, Trump administration officials are  seriously considering  plans to evict the press corps from being able to access the White House, arguing that it would allow the press increased access to Trump. There has been no decision,  incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer told Esquire, adding that  there has been some discussion about how to do it. More from Esquire:If the plan goes through, one of the officials said, the media will be removed from the cozy confines of the White House press room, where it has worked for several decades. Members of the press will be relocated to the White House Conference Center near Lafayette Square or to a space in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.Spicer, in his comments to Esquire, suggested that one of the reasons the administration is looking to evict the press from the White House is because they want to offer more members of the press the ability to cover Trump and the White House.Currently, there are only 49 seats in the White House James Brady Press Briefing Room, not enough to honor the hundreds, and sometimes, thousands of requests from journalists to cover Trump, Spicer said.However, a different, unnamed source told Esquire that the administration might have a different motive. According to the source, the administration is considering the move because of how the media covered Trump during the campaign and after his election victory.Trump has repeatedly lambasted the media for their coverage of him, regularly taking to Twitter to blast a news agency or a reporter by name.

 Is Donald Trump Actually A Fascist? Here Is What Experts Are Saying (VIDEO)," Another fact that allowed Fascism to gain power over men was their blindness. A man cannot believe that he is about to be destroyed. The optimism of people standing on the edge of the grave is astounding.    Vasily Grossman. I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters.    Donald Trump.In the United States, people prove Godwin s Law to be true way too often. Not every politician needs to be compared to Hitler, Mussolini, or any other well-known fascist. It s especially obnoxious when right-wingers call leftists fascists. Fascism is a right-wing ideology.Except when discussing Donald Trump. Trump is definitely a fascist. Or, at the very least, he is acting the part of one. That way he can gain support from actual fascists, and to dominate the vapid corporate media with his atrocious rhetoric.There is a great video going around the internet that asks the question,  Is Donald Trump a fascist?  The answer is yes. Trump is a fascist. The video doesn t overtly state that conclusion, though it does a great job of explaining why he might be, and why people are asking the question in the first place. Here s the video:https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostPolitics/videos/10153699583882911/Is Donald Trump going to lead America into a completely fascist state, where Muslims and other minorities are rounded up and exterminated? No. The political philosopher Sheldon Wolin struck gold when he coined the term  inverted totalitarianism  to describe the rise of the United States  predominately right-wing, corporate run, neoliberalist government. I d highly recommend every progressive read Wolin s book, Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism. The real danger of Trump s fascism is that he is normalizing the ideals of fascism. Facsist hate groups are loving every minute of Trump s campaign. They have their own bully, bellowing the hatred and intolerance that is largely considered taboo to speak of. This normalization of hatred and state violence is one of the first steps towards acts of genocide, and other horrific human rights abuses.Featured image from video screenshot via Facebook",News,"January 31, 2016"
 RNC Spokesman Hilariously Ridiculed After Invoking ‘My Little Pony’ Defense Of Melania (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"Sometimes, politics can get so ridiculous that one is forced to wonder if what he or she is seeing is really happening. One of those moments occurred on the second day of the GOP convention. After Melania Trump blatantly plagiarized part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic convention speech, the GOP leaped into action, offering every ridiculous excuse they could muster to defend the prospective next First Lady   including the Trump campaign s official hamburger delivery boy Chris Christie s  well-she-didn t-plagiarize-all-of-it-so-it-wasn t-plagiarism  defense.But the most insane thing to come out of this scenario is perhaps Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer s  My Little Pony  defense. Melania Trump said,  You work hard for what you want in life.  Akon said,  Work hard for what you get in life.  John Legend said,  Work hard,  Spicer offered during an interview on MSNBC. You re quoting Akon and John Legend?  asked host Craig Melvin. Hold on, it s getting better,  Spicer continued. And he was right   it did get better: Melania Trump said,  The strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.  Twilight Sparkle from  My Little Pony  said,  This is your dream, anything you can do in your dreams. A simple Google search of three phrases comes up with everything from Sparkle Pony to John Legend to Akon,  Spicer said, ignoring that an entire paragraph was quoted by Mrs. Trump nearly word-for-word.Naturally, the internet had a lot of fun with this:A presidential campaign quoting from MY LITTLE PONY.

 WATCH: John McCain Becomes A Confused Babbling Mess While Questioning ‘President’ Comey (VIDEO),"On Thursday, thanks to strange Senate rules, John McCain found himself with the opportunity to question fired FBI director James Comey   and he sure didn t waste the opportunity. OK, we lied: yes he did.Like his GOP colleagues, McCain tried his hardest to swing the Russia hearings back to being about Hillary Clinton. In fact, McCain demanded that President  (yes, he called him President) Comey explain why he has decided that Hillary Clinton is innocent of colluding with Russia to sabotage her own campaign but the FBI insists on investigating Trump   a  double standard  as McCain sees it.McCain, who is apparently unable to wrap his head around the fact that an investigation into Hillary Clinton about something entirely separate had concluded while the investigation into Trump s collusion with the Kremlin is ongoing, appeared to become confused during his questioning   then things got crazy (crazier?). I think it s hard to reconcile one case you reached a complete conclusion and the other side you have not. In fact, obviously, there s a lot more there as we know,  he said.  She s one of the candidates but in her case you say there will be no charges but in the case of President Trump the investigation continues. Both President Trump and former candidate Clinton are involved in the investigation yet one of them you said there s gonna be no charges and the other the investigation continues,  McCain added.  I think there s a double standard. Obviously, there s no double standard here   but McCain s words: You reached the conclusion that there was no reason to bring charges against Secretary Clinton so you reached the conclusion.

POLICE OFFICER Asks Daughter’s School To Remove Hateful Drawing From Display…School Has SHOCKING Response,"What do you think about the school s response to this police officer s request?The painting Officer Dave Hamblin found offensive (Facebook)A police officer father in the United States has taken to social media to complain about a piece of artwork displayed at his daughter s school.Kentucky cop Dave Hamblin is outraged by the painting which depicts two black people with a gun pointed at their head.On one half of the painting, under the title  1930 , a Ku Klux Klan member is pointing the gun.On the other half, titled  2015 , a white police officer is shown pointing the gun at what looks like a African American child.The painting was from a school project inspired by racial violence depicted in Harper Lee s book, To Kill A Mockingbird.Police officer Dave Hamblin, who goes by the name Dave Kingmen on Facebook, says the picture is upsetting and creates  future cop haters . We speak of tolerance, we speak of changing hostile environments, we speak of prejudice, and we speak of racial relations, yet, when it comes to hostility toward police, their families, and profiling them through bigotry we are expected to tolerate it,   Kingmen  wrote..  I will not, nor will my child. The cop has asked for the picture to be removed but the school has seemingly turned down his request. When discussing social injustice, people will likely be offended by some topic,  said Tracy Green, a school spokesperson.

 JetBlue Is Giving Orlando Victims And Their Families Free Flights,"Whenever a tragedy strikes, one can always count on love, support, and compassion to outweigh the horror, sadness and emptiness. The smallest acts are what matter most. And JetBlue is doing its part to help pick up the pieces after the horrific attack in Orlando.With family members all across the nation receiving the devastating news, the airline (which trains all of its employees in Orlando), is giving victims and their families free fights in and out of the city, so those who lost loved ones or need to support those who survived will not be burdened with traveling expenses.A spokesperson for the airliner explained: JetBlue is providing free seats on its available flights to/from Orlando for immediate family and domestic partners of victims who were killed or injured. According to news sources, many of the victims have family members from Puerto Rico, which JetBlue flies in and out of as a popular destination site. JetBlue will also be giving vouchers to those affected who need to make last minute changes to their ticketing.Currently, a 3-day roundtrip flight from Puerto Rico to Orlando on JetBlue costs $399 per person. Ensuring these free flights for victim s family members will be a huge financial relief which is the least anybody can do to help ease any pains for these families.It s companies like JetBlue that show the naysayers how strong and resilient the human spirit can be in times of hopelessness. A free plane ticket might not seem like much, but it is. Human kindness comes in all forms.Also stepping up to the plate is Allegiant Airlines, which will also be offering free flights in and out of Orlando.Hopefully local hotels will follow in ensuring financially stress-free accommodations to the families flying in to pick up the pieces.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"June 14, 2016"

 Watch Stephen Colbert’s Hilarious Response To Sarah Palin’s Crazy Speeches (VIDEO),"No one is happier to see Sarah Palin back in the news than Stephen Colbert. Following the former Alaska governor s endorsement of Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, Colbert now has plenty of material to make fun of the woman he called  the original material girl. God I have missed you. It s like a magical eagle made a wish on a flag pin and it came to life,  Colbert said of Palin s reappearance.  Which is great, for me,  he said,  because while Trump, admittedly, has given me so much material to make jokes about, nobody compares to the original material girl. Colbert played some of Palin s so-called  greatest hits,  referring to bizarre statements Palin made about  community organizer  Obama,  drill, baby, drill  and  we re gonna kick ISIS s ass!  Colbert said:  Sarah Palin just guaranteed Donald Trump the Evangelical vote, because I think she was speaking in tongues! While Donald Trump has been a frequent target of Colbert, no one has come close to the original  material girl.  Palin was a primary target of Colbert s during his 10-year run of his Colbert Report on Comedy Central.There s truly lots to make fun of. It seems that Palin has gone off the deep end lately more so than ever before. She even had the nerve to blame the president for her son s delinquency and her rambling speeches give a clear impression of someone that doesn t seem to have things together.In any case, Trump, who apparently is excited about Palin s endorsement, said that he would have a position for her in his administration, possibly vice president. It all sounds quite frightening. But for now let s laugh at these two.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",News,"January 21, 2016"
UNREAL! GRIFTER BILL CLINTON MAKES $16 MILLION FROM PEOPLE IN HIGH GOVERNMENT PLACES,"Newly released financial disclosures reveal Bill Clinton received $16.46 million in payments from a George Soros-backed for-profit education company, as Hillary Clinton s State Department funneled tens of millions of dollars to a group run by the company s chairman.With $4 billion in annual revenue, Laureate Education is America s largest for-profit college company. From 2010 until just days before the 2015 release of Clinton Cash, Bill Clinton served as Laureate s  honorary chancellor.  When the Clinton campaign team obtained a copy of the book and its Clinton-Laureate connection revelation, Bill Clinton abruptly resigned.Laureate s chairman and longtime Clinton crony, Douglas Becker, is also the chairman of a nonprofit sister organization called the International Youth Foundation (IYF). Indeed, IYF s offices are less than a mile from Laureate s in Baltimore. Shortly after Laureate made Bill Clinton its honorary chancellor in April 2010, Hillary Clinton made Laureate part of her State Department Global Partnership. IYF received USAID funds before Hillary s tenure at the State Dept. But the grants the group received exploded after Bill Clinton was put on the Laureate payroll.According to a Bloomberg analysis of the Clinton Cash revelation:  In 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate, the nonprofit received 11 grants worth $9 million from the State Department or the affiliated USAID. In 2010, the group received 14 grants worth $15.1 million. In 2011, 13 grants added up to $14.6 million. The following year, those numbers jumped: IYF received 21 grants worth $25.5 million, including a direct grant from the State Department. Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Aug 6, 2015"
 Wounded Veteran CONDEMNS Trump For Using Him As Prop To Attack NFL Players,"Donald Trump thought he could get away with using military veterans as props to push his political agenda. He was wrong.Marine Staff Sgt. John Jones lost both of his legs in combat in Iraq over ten years ago. In 2007, he sat down for a photograph showing him with the prosthetic legs that allow him to stand and walk.Jones was back in the news this past weekend after Trump shared the photo on Twitter to attack NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our #Anthem? #MAGA #NFL pic.twitter.com/3AVqnAlu3F  DONNA WARREN ?? (@DonnaWR8) September 24, 2017As of now, the retweet remains on Trump s Twitter feed.Trump literally exploited a wounded veteran to attack the NFL over protests that have nothing to do with the flag or America s men and women in uniform. The fact is that the NFL players are protesting racial injustice and police brutality. Trump, however, is trying to divide the nation by accusing them of disrespecting the military and the flag.But by using an image of a wounded veteran to push his agenda, Trump opened himself up to being humiliated by those veterans because Jones is very much still alive and able to speak up for himself.And he does not appreciate being used as a political prop to oppose the right to free speech.According to Buzzfeed,Jones says he is sick of military veterans being used as props  to push a political agenda  in the renewed controversy over whether athletes  protests, which they say draw attention to racial discrimination and police brutality, disrespect the military. If you really want to honor the troops, listen to them, he says. Just stop with this sycophantic bullshit and actually do something to support us,  said Jones, who works for Workshops for Warriors, a San Diego nonprofit that has trained more than 400 veterans for skilled manufacturing jobs.  I would want Trump to tweet about that, instead of fueling the fire with the people making 10 million to score a freaking touchdown. And for people (seeing the photo) to say,  Look, he s still standing for this country, and getting veterans good jobs. Jones then went on to defend the NFL players. I ve got my own views about this, but that s why I put the uniform on, so people can do whatever they want in a lawful, peaceful manner. I m sorry, but if you want to know what the real issues are   go to Iraq, or Syria, or Afghanistan, go to places that don t have the freedoms that we have and see how far you get. Protesting during the national anthem is not illegal. In fact, it s protested as free speech and expression by our Constitution. And silently kneeling in protest is peaceful.Even John McCain condemned Trump this week by pointing out that NFL players have the right as citizens to kneel during the national anthem.By using wounded veterans as political props, Trump is the one who is truly disrespecting the military and our nation.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2017"
 MI Gov Rick Snyder Appoints Former Oil Lobbyist To Protect MI’s Environment,"Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder has just appointed a new head of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Snyder s new corporate shill, Heidi Grether, is a former executive for BP. Grether also worked as a registered lobbyist for BP America in Michigan for seven years. After her time spent lobbying for big oil, Grether became the Deputy Director of the MDEQ.The former DEQ director, Dan Wyant, resigned from his position after the Flint water crisis. Grether has been working as the interim director for the MDEQ since Wyant s resignation. Heidi has decades of experience in environmental quality issues, and has effectively served during times of crises and recovery,  Snyder said in a statement.  Her expertise in delivering good customer service from a large organization will be of great value as we continue working to reinvent the department and act more proactively to address issues that arise. The Snyder administration is already facing a huge backlash to the decision from environmental groups. Lisa Wozniak, Executive Director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters sent Snyder a letter informs them of their positions on major environmental concerns in the region. Our coalition articulated that this critically important agency is in need of someone who has the background and experience to be a strong advocate for the health of our communities and our environment. Today s announcement seems to fly in the face of that vision,  Wozniak said.Democrats are incredulous over Snyder s decision. Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said Snyder  has again shown he is completely out of touch with the people of this state and the problems they face. Flint is still reeling from the worst man-made environmental disaster in Michigan s history, yet Rick Snyder decides to tap a former BP executive   one of the worst polluters in the world   to lead our state s Departmental of Environmental Quality?  Dillon went on to ask.Because of Grether s almost decade long career of lobbying for the oil industry, she is already being asked to recuse herself from making judgments on one of the biggest decisions Michigan has to make in the near future. There is an oil pipeline that is located at the bottom of the Mackinac Straights, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The pipeline is very old and if it breaks down would create one of the worst if not the worst environmental disaster in human history. It would contaminate the world s largest freshwater supply and be economically devasting to the United States and Canada.It s appalling, though not surprising that Snyder would pull a move like this. The Snyder administration has done nothing but eroded democracy in Michigan, while at the same time, becoming globally infamous for their failures to prevent the Flint water crisis.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"July 15, 2016"
SENATE PASSES USA FREEDOM ACT,"McConnell was shut down completely in this debate as all amendments he put forth were rejected including the McConnell-Burr Amendment.Congress approved sweeping changes Tuesday to surveillance laws enacted after the Sept. 11 attacks, eliminating the National Security Agency s disputed bulk phone-records collection program and replacing it with a more restrictive measure to keep the records in phone companies  hands.Two days after Congress let the phone-records collection and several other anti-terror programs expire, the Senate s 67-32 vote sent the legislation to President Barack Obama, who signed it Tuesday night. This legislation will strengthen civil liberty safeguards and provide greater public confidence in these programs,  Obama said in a statement. Officials said it could take at least several days to restart the collection.The legislation will revive most of the programs the Senate had allowed to lapse in a dizzying collision of presidential politics and national security policy. But the authorization will undergo major changes, the legacy of agency contractor Edward Snowden s explosive revelations two years ago about domestic spying by the government.In an unusual shifting of alliances, the legislation passed with the support of Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, but over the strong opposition of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell failed to persuade the Senate to extend the current law unchanged, and came up short in a last-ditch effort Tuesday to amend the House version, as nearly a dozen of his own Republicans abandoned him in a series of votes. This is a step in the wrong direction,  a frustrated McConnell said on the Senate floor ahead of the Senate s final vote to approve the House version, dubbed the USA Freedom Act. He said the legislation  does not enhance the privacy protections of American citizens. And it surely undermines American security by taking one more tool form our warfighters at exactly the wrong time. The legislation remakes the most controversial aspect of the USA Patriot Act   the once-secret bulk collection program that allows the National Security Agency to sweep up Americans  phone records and comb through them for ties to international terrorists. Over six months the NSA would lose the power to collect and store those records, but the government still could gain court orders to obtain data connected to specific numbers from the phone companies, which typically store them for 18 months.It would also continue other post-9/11 surveillance provisions that lapsed Sunday night, and which are considered more effective than the phone-data collection program. These include the FBI s authority to gather business records in terrorism and espionage investigations and to more easily eavesdrop on suspects who are discarding cellphones to avoid surveillance.Read more: AP",Government News,"Jun 3, 2015"
TOP NAVY COMMANDER RELEASED After Reportedly Revealing Secret About Obama,"Seven years ago, this story would ve seemed like something from  The Onion  (a satirical publication). Unfortunately where Barry Sotoero, aka Barack Hussein Obama is concerned, nothing is unbelievable, and truth seems to be stranger than fiction  Recently, a new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report was released stating that one of the United States Navy s top commanders was released from command after he sent out an email revealing that President Barack Obama was in the process of purchasing a multi-million dollar seaside villa in Dubai.The report indicates that Rear Admiral Rick Williams, Commander of the US Navy s Carrier Strike Group 15, posted a query on January 8 to the Naval Institutes  Readiness Kill Chain.  It inquired why Navy security and intelligence personal had been dispatched from a Naval Support Facility in Thurmont to an  Obama house hunting mission.  The message has since been deleted.As to the  Obama house hunting mission  Admiral Williams was making his query about before being fired, this report continues, SVR intelligence  assests  in the UAE identified it as being a luxury seaside villa located in the Palm Jumeirah development of Dubai being offered for sale at the price of $4.9 million (18 million United Arab Emirates Dirham), and which a deposit on it was made this past week by the Washington D.C. based global public affairs company Podesta Group. Important to note about the Podesta Group, this report notes, is that its leader is Tony Podesta, who aside from being one of the most powerful oligarchs in the US, is a close personal friend of President Obama too.Within 18 hours of posting the query, Vice Admiral Noral Tyson fired Admiral Williams on orders from President Obama. Her action was reportedly  due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command  based on  allegations of his misuse of government computer equipment. To cover their tracks, the Pentagon reportedly began releasing  anonymous  stories that Admiral Williams had been viewing pornography on his computer. Of course, this is an impossibility due to the US Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), which blocks such sites. Via: Conservative Post",politics,"Feb 1, 2016"

 WATCH: Trump Literally Promises To Gut Financial Regulations So His Friends Can Screw The Economy,"Donald Trump was blunt when he explained why he wants to gut financial regulations. So his friends can destroy the economy and get richer from doing so.In 2009, President Obama and Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in response to the Great Recession caused by the big banks and Republican economic policies.The recession nearly collapsed the world economy because Republicans have repealed financial regulations that were put in place after the Great Depression of the 1930s to prevent such economic crises from occurring.The law prevents banks from approving loans for those who are unable to pay them back and puts restrictions on the activities of big banks so that they don t repeat the bullshit they did to get our country into such economic messes in the first place.MSN reports that Trump signed an executive order that  will effectively halt an Obama-era Labor Department rule that requires brokers to act in a client s best interest, rather than seek the highest profits for themselves, when providing retirement advice. In short, it will allow big banks to swindle people and screw Americans over in the name of profit, a practice that hurt millions of Americans during the recession.But Trump wants to keep attacking Dodd-Frank anyway because he wants to help his rich buddies. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can t borrow money,  Trump said on Friday while during a meeting with Wall Street tycoons like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan-Chase.  They just can t get any money because the banks just won t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. Here s the video via YouTube:Again, if a bank is not letting you borrow money, it s because they have determined that you are too much of a risk.Just ask Donald Trump. He has so much trouble getting loans from banks here in the United States that he has to get loans from Deutche Bank in Germany, which has repeatedly violated Dodd-Frank regulations.Trump has repeatedly failed to pay contractors for work he has hired them to perform and his many failed business ventures over the years such as Trump Steaks and Trump Airlines has understandable caused many banks to see Trump as a risk. So if his friends are unable to get loans, it s probably because they they don t run  nice businesses  like Trump claims.When a bank loans money to people, they are risking their capital and if a person like Trump and his friends fail to pay that loan back, it doesn t just hurt the bank, it hurts customers of the bank. One bad loan could result in the bank having to shut down or pass the expense of the loss to customers to cover it.It s a shitty deal for banks and a shitty deal for people who trust their banks to protect their money.Donald Trump isn t doing what is best for the American people by attacking Dodd-Frank. He is doing favors for his wealthy friends and that is going to harm our economy and set the stage for another economic collapse that could be even worse than one President Obama helped our country recover from over the last eight years.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"February 5, 2017"
SOMALI IMMIGRANT Charged With Multiple Stabbings At Mall of America Has Interesting Meaning Behind His Islamic Name,"Minnesota is home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America.  Census numbers put the state s Somali s population at about 40,000, but community activists have said it s higher. The largest share of that group has settled in the Minneapolis area, including one neighborhood near the University of Minnesota campus that s been dubbed  Little Mogadishu.  But significant numbers have also settled in St. Cloud, Willmar and other smaller cities.Being home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America doesn t come without a price WND   For the second time in just over a year, a Somali  refugee  has stabbed shoppers with a knife at a Minnesota mall.The first case, on Sept. 17, 2016, was a clear act of jihad when Dahir Adan injured 10 people in the Macy s at the Crossroads Center Mall in St. Cloud after asking his victims, chosen at random, if they were Muslim.But on Sunday night a man identified as Mahad Abdiaziz Abdirahman, 20, of Minneapolis stabbed two men at the Mall of America after they tried to stop him from stealing clothes inside the dressing room at Macy s.His middle name, Abdiaziz, means  the slave of Allah the master,  a native Arabic speaker told WND.His first name, Mahad, means  the one who preaches and invites people to Islam. Wow! Talk about the perfect ambassdor for Islam According to the NYP, Abdirahaman sneaked into a men s fitting room at the Minnesota mall and tried to swipe something from a customer s belongings while the man was outside the fitting room modeling clothes for his family. But he caught Abdirahaman in the act, and the would-be thief pulled a knife and stabbed him, authorities said.Hearing the victim s screams, his family rushed to his aid, but Abdirahaman slashed a second person before they could wrest the knife from him.The scuffle and ensuing response by police freaked out nearby shoppers waiting in line for their kids to see Santa.Violence by Somali immigrants against Minneapolis residents is nothing new to people who have watched the Somali population explode in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.Last year, we reported about a mob of up to 30 young Somali men paraded through one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last week, yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV.  It was a very traumatizing experience. Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Go HERE for video to see homeowner tell her horrifying story.

Today EMILY s List, the nation s largest resource for women in politics, endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. Clinton is on track to become the first woman to win the Democratic nomination, and if elected, the first woman president of the United States. Hillary Clinton is a lifelong champion for women and families and the most qualified candidate to be president,  said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY s List.  With roots in the middle class, Hillary s top priority is changing the economic reality for American families. Her focus is on strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, and making sure hardworking families get a fair shot. No one will work harder than Hillary. She knows how to lead so Washington fights for all Americans. As president, Hillary will create more opportunities than ever for women and girls (give them access to on demand abortions) and for all hardworking Americans across the country, just as she has done throughout her exceptional career. The EMILY s List community   now more than three million members strong   is proud to endorse Hillary Clinton for president. Hillary Clinton has devoted her entire career to fighting for women and families (supporting the killing of unborn babies). Instead of going to a big law firm after graduating from Yale Law School, she took her first job going door to door for the Children s Defense Fund. She helped lead the fight for the Children s Health Insurance Program as first lady of the United States, and she put emphasis on women s rights as a  cornerstone of American foreign policy  as Secretary of State.A visionary leader who s always worked to create opportunity for others, Hillary has said she believes  our challenge is to be clear-eyed about the world as it is while never losing sight of the world as we want it to become.  When she is elected president, it will mean more opportunities for women, more opportunities for girls, and more opportunities for hardworking Americans across the country.Via: Weasel Zippers",Government News,"Apr 13, 2015"
" The HORRIFYING Reality Of Executions In This State Has Been Uncovered, But It’s Unlikely To Stop","According to Reuters, a grand jury in Oklahoma found that  jail staff did not verify what drugs they were using for lethal injections and were unaware when the wrong drugs were administered.  This report is another damning piece of evidence that shows that there are many flaws in the supposedly  humane  systems in place for carrying out capital punishments.In 2014, the news broke that the execution of an inmate named Clayton Lockett, who was sentenced to death for murder. An executioner failed to properly put an I.V. line into Lockett. The needle used to inject the lethal drugs into Lockett began to spray all over the execution chamber that he was in. He died, after 45 minutes of agony. Not because the toxins that were pumped into his body worked as intended, but because they caused Lockett to die of a heart attack.After, a massive outcry from the public, which included a scathing condemnation from Amnesty International, Oklahoma made some minor changes to their policies regarding executions. In 2015, two more botched executions were performed. One of those executed was Charles Werner. His final words were  My body is on fire. One of the major factors contributing to these botched executions is due to the absence of sodium thiopental, which is the executioner s drug of choice for lethal injections in the U.S. The drug was taken off from the market in 2011 due to increasing international regulations on lethal injections. States who have yet to abolish capital punishment, have been scrambling to find alternatives.That means, once again in its history, the U.S. is desperately clinging to a practice that the rest of the world is moving towards abolishing. There are many good reasons for abolishing the death penalty but there is one reason in particular that even the staunchest advocates of the deathly penalty must admit is terrifying. A recent study found that 1 in 25 prisoners who are sentenced to death are actually innocent.No matter what protocols are put in place, we can never know for sure if they are truly innocent. I share the same stance as many capital punishment abolitionists, that capital punishment is always wrong, no matter what, whether the convicted individual is guilty or innocent. The idea that innocent people might be subjected to what is increasingly becoming not only a death sentence but a sentence to living their final moments in a state of hell ( My body is on fire ) is unconscionable.Oklahoma, you have already proven that reforming your policies on capital punishment are a facade. It s time to for you and the rest of the states that have yet to abolish the death penalty to give up this barbaric practice.Right now, all executions are on hold in Oklahoma. Since then, not a single execution has been botched and not a single innocent person has been murdered by the state. It s sounds as if they have found the perfect solution to their problem   now they just need to make it permanent.Featured image from (Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)",News,"May 20, 2016"
 Trump Imitates Indian Call Center Worker In Latest Racist Tirade On Campaign Trail (VIDEO),"If one were to best describe Donald Trump, especially at one of his campaign rallies, he would be the living embodiment of a Fox News Facebook comment section   just full of vile, fear-filled, xenophobic, racist, hate-filled rhetoric.Making sure he lives up to this reputation while on the campaign trail in Delaware, Trump decided he would tell people about his experiences with call centers, primarily those that are overseas. And while these call centers are taking away American jobs, the people who work in these centers overseas are human beings trying to make an honest day s wage for themselves, and should be treated as such.However, Trump decided to do what he always does, and with no regard for who s he s throwing under the bus because he has a point to make, decided to imitate a call center worker from India.Trump said that he called the center to pretend he was checking on his credit card, then asked the worker,  Where are you from?  and that s when he did the impression, saying  We are from India,  in his disgusting attempt to pander to his racist and xenophobic crowd. Trump then supposedly said to the call center,  Oh, great. That s wonderful. Thank you very much, that s all I need to know,  and proceeds to pretend to hang up the phone.Did he make this story up? Probably, but it doesn t make it any less racist.Here s the thing, Trump doesn t care who he s offending as long as he s winning. He s fanning the flames of racism and hatred everywhere he goes, because it s clearly working, and that should terrify all of us.We need to make sure Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office come November. He s not only bad for the nation, but it would be devastating for the entire world.Donald Trump says he called his credit-card company just to see if an Indian call center answered https://t.co/Cdv0korqNo  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 23, 2016"
 Team Trump Puts A Proverbial Gun To The GOP’s Head: Support The Nominee Or Else,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made life a living hell for party leaders since he first began to rise in the polls way back in the overcrowded GOP primary season. Against all odds, Trump s bombast and demagoguery wooed disaffected GOP base voters, and he managed to steamroll past other established, much more qualified Republican presidential candidates. In the interim since then, Trump s controversies have caused many issues for party leaders who have been forced to try to defend and vouch for their nominee. The worst instance of this, of course, was the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which Trump had a lewd and offensive conversation with Billy Bush.Well, since that tape caused condemnation across the board   even causing many leading Republicans to withdraw their endorsements- the result was a well-publicized and fiery civil war within the GOP writ large. Now, with just 11 days to go until Election Day, the Trump campaign is making an effort to hold the party hostage, and force support for the embattled Trump/Pence ticket. An email, obtained by the Washington Post, was sent around to GOP elected officials, which read: I know we are less than 11 days to the 2016 election. But it is imperative that we continue to drive Republican support for the top of the ticket. That means we need your direct, strong support for the Trump/Pence ticket. Now is the time. No waffling, no week [sic] knees. We strongly urge you today to make a statement   take a stand   and step out for the Trump/Pence ticket. So, in other words, this is a  support Trump or else  message. Trump himself has already floated the idea of punishing party leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan for disloyalty, especially since some of these people are only supporting Trump because they are forced to. Now, Team Trump is essentially holding the GOP hostage, and if their demands are not met, make no mistake   the consequences will likely be dire.Hopefully these Republicans don t cave to Trump s insane, strongman-like tactics, and can show a bit of spine and limp on to election day.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2016"
 Trump Is Trying To Force Dems’ Hand On Border Wall Funding – Here’s Why He’ll Fail BIGLY,"Donald Trump seems to think he can squeeze Congressional Democrats for border wall funding by offering them something in exchange, and he also seems to believe he s hit the jackpot on just what to exchange. He ll hold subsidy payments to insurers on the Obamacare exchanges hostage until Democrats agree to fund his wall. If they continue to stonewall, then, when the ACA s insurance marketplace implodes or the government shuts down (or both), he ll blame Democrats and the whole country will, too.He s not seeing both sides, though. The Democrats actually hold all the good cards here.Why? Surely we can see how both sides have a decent hand, can t we? Trump s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, even said: We d offer them $1 of CSR payments for $1 of wall payments. Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues. A one-for-one trade sounds nice and equitable, doesn t it? Trump gets his wall and we get continued stability in the health insurance market, and the government keeps operating. Here s what he s not seeing: Democrats aren t the only ones who don t want to waste money on a big wall along the southern border. Many Republicans don t, either, and that gives Democrats major leverage over Trump.Chuck Schumer s spokesman issued a statement that said: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.[I]f the administration would drop their 11th-hour demand for a wall that Democrats   and a good number of Republicans   oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal. Some in the GOP have privately said that it would help if the Trump White House would move on from the border wall because there are too many in Congress who don t want to fund it. Furthermore, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are busy working toward creating a more bipartisan spending bill. But they know that, with control of the entire federal government, they will own a healthcare disaster and they will own a shutdown no matter what Trump decides to say about it.Republicans want to avoid a shutdown   they ve long since figured out that the country blamed them for the 2013 shutdown. That means working with Democrats, including scrapping funding for the wall if doing so means Democrats will agree to other things.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi recognizes that Democrats have all the leverage here, and that they need to use that leverage to their advantage. Republicans control both Congress and the White House   people are not going to blame Democrats for a shutdown or for destabilizing the insurance marketplace under these circumstances.Mulvaney actually thinks that Congress should get out of the way of Trump s agenda: This president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the Democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the Senate rules. The border wall is a non-starter and possibly dead, at least for now. There are more important things to think about than a wall that won t do anything that Trump claims it will.Featured image by Shawn Thew   Pool via Getty Images",News,"April 21, 2017"

 Is Trump Purging The Government? Team Asking For List Of Names,"Fears of purges of personnel based on ideology have now reached the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security after a new, unusual request from the Donald Trump transition team has surfaced. The incoming Trump team is demanding a list of names for some reason.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump s transition team has asked two Cabinet departments for the names of government officials working on programs to counter violent extremism, according to a document seen by Reuters and U.S. officials.The requests to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security involve a set of programs that seek to prevent violence by extremists of any stripe, including recruitment by militant Islamist groups within the United States and abroad.Reuters could not determine why the Trump team asked for these names. The Trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump has often attacked President Obama and his team, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for not being tougher on extremists. Often this critique has included the complaint that Obama and his subordinates do not explicitly blame the Islamic faith, rather than point out how extremists deviate from mainstream Islam.It is certainly plausible that the Trump team is considering some way in which to remove those who differ from their ideology from the permanent bureaucracy once they assume power. Such a purge of those seen to be disloyal would be in line with the authoritarian mindset that Trump has so often embraced during the campaign.Trump has also issued a similar demand to the Department of Energy, asking for the names of those who worked on the Obama administration s climate change policy. The Department refused the request, and the Obama White House expressed concerns that the Trump team was trying to target civil servants like scientists and lawyers. Eventually facing bad headlines, the Trump team disavowed the purge request.Featured image via FlickrThese clowns have nothing on Obama",News,"December 24, 2016"

Barack Obama could have been a better party leader, and I think that the fact that he wasn t has put his legacy in jeopardy,  Ellison said.

 Colin Kaepernick Is Not Alone Anymore – Fellow Athletes Join His Protest (IMAGES),"Colin Kaepernick has been taking a whole lot of heat since he made the decision to sit during the national anthem in protest of the way people of color are treated in the United States. On Thursday night, Kaepernick once again refused to stand while the Star Spangled Banner was sung, but this time, he wasn t the only one.Image via InstagramKaepernick was joined in his protest Thursday night by fellow 49er Eric Reid, a safety, who knelt beside the quarterback as the national anthem rang out through the stadium before they played the San Diego Chargers. Reid also serves as the representative for the player s union and has been supportive of Kaepernick all week, despite the uproar over his protest.However, it is not only his teammates who are joining Kaepernick s protest. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane also sat while the national anthem was sung on Thursday night before the start of their game against the Oakland Raiders.Image via Instagram.The 49ers have played four exhibition games this year and Kaepernick has not stood for the national anthem at any of these games. Nobody seemed to notice until  his first game in uniform, which was last Friday. Kaepernick explained that he wasn t standing as a protest of the way the lives of minorities are continually snuffed out by those who are sworn to serve and protect them. He noted that the only consequence for these  murders  is a paid vacation. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick said.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. It is good to see other teammates and professional football players standing beside Kaepernick and standing up for all African American lives in America. Hopefully, their numbers will grow and they will continue to use the national platform at their disposal to help bring awareness to the systemic racism plaguing not only the country in general but the criminal justice system in particular.Kudos to you gentlemen.

 Obama Shuts Down Republicans Not Voting On SCOTUS Nominee With One Brilliant Tweet (IMAGES),"Regardless of what the U.S. Constitution says or what the American people are so clearly demanding, the GOP has decided to throw the rules out the window and refuse to hold hearings for any SCOTUS nominee Obama might choose. This is something that Republicans like Majority Leader of the Senate Mitch McConnell and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz have been threatening to do since the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia   it s just mind blowing to see it actually happening.President Barack Obama has a presidential obligation to nominate a new Justice, and it is the Senate s job to take a vote on that choice, whether they like it or not. But instead, Senate Republicans are going to leave Scalia s seat empty for the next 340 days, completely disobeying the Constitution and insulting the democratic process. Here are the signatures of the GOP senators that decided they will refuse to vote on Obama s Supreme Court nominee and wait until a new president is in office to replace Scalia:LETTER:  this Committee will not hold hearings on any Supreme Court nominee  until 1/20/17 pic.twitter.com/rMKGkDOn58  Mike DeBonis (@mikedebonis) February 23, 2016It s a major  F*ck you  to Obama and the majority of Americans, who have made it clear that they support the President putting forth a nominee.

 Chicago Police Dept. Points Out TWO Huge Flaws In Trump’s Chicago Violence Lies,"Trump s wild lies continue unabated as he continues to say that he s met with people that have never once spoken to him. This time, he s claiming he talked to the Chicago Police Department about the city s violence, and a  top officer  told him that he could solve the problem in just a week. The problem, according to Trump, is that they don t have the authority to do so.Trump appeared on Bill O Reilly s show, where he was asked about how to solve Chicago s violent crime problem. Trump spun a whopper of a lie answering that: How? By being very much tougher than they are right now. They re right now not tough. I could tell you this very long and quite boring story. But when I was in Chicago, I got to meet a couple of very top police. I said,  How do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge   to a specific person   do you think you could stop it?  He said,  Mr. Trump, I d be able to stop it in one week.  And I believed him 100 percent. Har de har har   Trump will say anything to convince people that he knows what he s talking about. There is no way to solve any city s violence problems in a single week. Of course, to avoid looking like the fool he is, he said that he didn t ask for this mysterious officer s strategy when O Reilly asked for it.That vagueness is one of the ways that Trump maintains credibility despite all his lies.CPD refuted his claim that he s spoken to them, and one of their spokespeople said: We ve discredited this claim months ago. No one in the senior command at CPD has ever met with Donald Trump or a member of his campaign  Beyond that, the best way to address crime is through a commitment to community policing and a commitment to stronger laws to keep illegal guns and repeat violent offenders off the street. Once all of this became common knowledge, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, tried to turn it around on the media by saying that Trump had never said he met with top brass. She claims that s what the media said, which is in keeping with the campaign s assertions that the media intentionally twists his words.CPD has disputed claims from Trump before. Back in March, when he canceled a rally due to violence and said that CPD told him to do so, they said that nobody had ever met with him, let alone told him to cancel his rally for safety reasons.Trump doesn t even know when he s lying because he does it so much. This is another example of that.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2016"
PC TYRANNY: University of Oregon Rules That Professors Have NO Free Speech,"21st Century Wire says By cow-towing to students  over-sensitivity to free speech and seemingly a prenatal requirement for  safe spaces  on campus   academics and university administrators are unknowingly (or knowingly) constructing communitarian unintellectual institutions of tyranny on campuses across America. The end result of this progress  should be obvious to anyone who has studied 20th century history   it is anarchy. If students are allowed to get professors suspended or fired over spurious allegations of  offense caused,  or rather, causing students to feel  uncomfortable    then the entire concept of the university as we once knew it   is finished. By dismissing talent in favor of adherence to an ever new and constantly updated  orthdoxy,  the only professors left to teach in this burgeoning environment of weaponized political correctness will most certainly be under-qualified, mediocre, young, and possibly radical or overly militant instructors.That will be the end of higher education   and as we can now see, it s heading in that direction  (Image Source: Niskan Center)Mark Tapson Truth RevoltWriting for the Washington Post, Eugene Volokh of The Volokh Conspiracy addresses a disturbing development at the University of Oregon, whose administration made clear to its faculty last week that if you say things about race, sexual orientation, sex, religion and so on that enough people find offensive, you could get suspended and possibly even fired. This can happen even to tenured faculty members or to anyone else.  Orthodoxy,  Volokh writes,  enforced on threat of institutional punishment, is what the University of Oregon is now about. This all began with a Halloween party hosted by tenured University of Oregon law school professor Nancy Shurtz attended by about a dozen students and about a dozen nonstudents:Shurtz had told the students that she would be  going as a popular book title ; she didn t tell the students up front what it was, but the book was the recent (and acclaimed)  Black Man in a White Coat,  a black doctor s  reflections on race and medicine  (according to the subtitle). Shurtz s  costume incorporated a white doctor s lab coat, a stethoscope, black makeup on her face and hands, and a black curly wig resembling an afro.  The university report states that Shurtz  was inspired by this book and by the author, that she greatly admires [the author] and wanted to honor him, and that she dressed as the book because she finds it reprehensible that there is a shortage of racial diversity, and particularly of black men, in higher education. [ ] And this perceived offensiveness yielded a huge uproar at the law school. According to the report, the uproar was partly students  immediate reaction and partly a result of the administration s and other faculty members  discussing the matter extensively at school, including in classes.[ ] So we have speech, at a professor s home, but at a party to which she had invited her students, which in turn leads to speech by various people at the law school. (There s no doubt that wearing an expressive costume is treated as equivalent to speech under First Amendment  symbolic expression  purposes.) Some of both kinds of speech are interpreted as expressing offensive messages related to race. What does the university do about this?The university suspended Shurtz.It then released a report concluding that Shurtz s speech constituted  harassment,  which violates university policy. The harassment policy, the university report notes, bans conduct that creates a  hostile environment  based on  age, race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, religion, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or the use of leave protected by state or federal law. Under the logic of the Oregon report, Volokh notes,  a faculty member could be disciplined for displaying the Mohammed cartoons, if it caused enough of a furor. Or a faculty member could be disciplined for suggesting that homosexuality may be immoral or dangerous. Or for stating that biological males who view themselves as female should be viewed as men, not as women. Or for suggesting that there are, on average, biological differences in temperament or talents between men and women.

DRAMATIC VIDEO RELEASED: Brave Soldier Tries Escaping North Korea Under Gunfire [Video],"The American-led UN Command just released very dramatic video showing a North Korean soldier trying to escape across the border into South Korea.

He then sprints across the border before hitting the ground in critical condition but alive.The four soldiers unloaded an estimated 40 rounds from multiple types of firearms.The defector a 24-year-old soldier surnamed Oh, according to CNN was taken to a South Korean hospital in critical condition from the gunshot wounds and lost nearly half of his blood. Oh s surgeon, Lee Cook-jong, said that he found four major wounds on the soldier, who received four pints of blood.The soldier underwent multiple surgeries to repair damage, and in doing so, surgeons found dozens of parasites including a 10.6-inch roundworm, possibly indicating improper nutrition in North Korea s military.

 Republican Governor Refuses Medicaid Expansion: ‘People Still Die If They Have Insurance’,"Is it utter contempt, or incredible stupidity? Actually, it s probably both. Republicans are well known for their utter contempt of every other person that exists who doesn t give them tons of money. The latest example of this phenomenon is just impossibly stupid as you will read below.Idaho s Republican governor, Butch Otter, said something so stupid that I think it means he s too stupid to be able to understand just how ridiculous it sounds. The statement came in response to the Republican-controlled state legislature not being able to figure out if it s a good idea to expand Medicaid. It would help 78,000 Idahoans to not be forced to make the choice between medical bill-induced bankruptcy or death. Somehow this is a difficult choice.Governor Otter, re-asserting his dominant position as the alpha-stupid person of the state s right-wing clown show, said this: I see plenty of people that die every day in hospitals and they have insurance. And they re in the hospital. But they still die. Source: Boise State Public RadioOtter then went on to contradict his own Republican Speaker of the State House. The governor said that there would be no special legislative sessions to address the severe coverage gap for the people of Idaho, implying that he doesn t feel its worth considering. The speaker, though, had promised there was a  firm commitment  by the Idaho House to do something about the severe lack of medical coverage for so many in the state. So, which is it going to be?Conflicting statements aside, what the governor said was just amazingly stupid. He literally is saying that it s pointless to help people afford to see a doctor because of the fact that some people who have seen a doctor at some point still die.Just what the hell can you possibly say to something like this?This is one of the reasons we can t get anything done in this country.

" Republicans Want A Trump/Gingrich Ticket, Think Six Wives Will Appeal To Women","Apparently, the fact that 70 percent of women view Donald Trump unfavorably is making Republicans think that what he needs is a running mate who also treats women like shit.A top Republican consultant thinks Trump and former disgraced Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich would make the perfect political pair because their six wives combined means they  understand women  better than anyone else. I think Newt is lobbying to be the vice president, and I think their people are paying a lot of attention to him,  Ed Rollins told the National Review on Monday.  It d be a ticket with six former wives, kind of like a Henry VIII thing. They certainly understand women. Wow. Just wow.Republicans are facing an unprecedented opposition from female voters and their solution to fix that is to double down on the whole  let s nominate someone who disrespects women  idea.Donald Trump is on wife number three. And given his history, you can bank on him eventually seeking wife number four when Melania is no longer  a 10  in his eyes.He cheated on his first wife with the woman who became his second wife and was quick to start a relationship with the third Mrs. Trump during the separation.And that relationship history is probably why Trump is so keen to count Gingrich as one of his top allies.Let s not forget that Newt Gingrich also cheated on his first wife with his second wife and callously asked for a divorce while she was recovering from cancer surgery in the hospital. Then he cheated on his second wife with the woman who would become his current wife. In 1993, Gingrich began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek and divorced his second wife after she refused to grant him the open marriage he wanted. Keep in mind, this hypocrisy unfolded as Gingrich and Republicans sought to impeach President Bill Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.And so, Trump has included Gingrich on his short list of vice-presidential candidates and some Republicans are thrilled because they think their six marriages make them experts when it comes to women and that they ll somehow be able to make women flock to their campaign.Frankly, it s insulting.If Republicans really think this is their best strategy to persuade women to vote for the GOP in November they truly never understood women at all. Just the idea that being like Henry VIII, who had two of his wives executed, would make them somehow more appealing to women demonstrates perfectly just how terribly Republicans have treated women. They literally think emulating a womanizing 16th century English king is the best way to deal with women in the 21st century. If anything can make MORE women hate Trump and the GOP, this is it.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",News,"May 23, 2016"

 ‘A Gimmick’: It Just Dawned On Republicans That Trump Is Full Of Sh*t About The Wall,"While on the campaign trail, reality show star Donald Trump vowed that he would build a wall on the U.S. southern border, and that Mexico would  pay for it.  Chants rang out from his supporters at each rally to  Build that wall!  but his promise is now crumbling before his fans  eyes. Firstly, it s an expensive endeavor, one that is expected to cost up to $38 billion. And Mexico will not pay for it. We will. Taxpayers will be footing the bill for his wall. Yet, the president-elect now says that it will be built, and Mexico will pay for it later. And now, even Republicans know that he s full of it.A number of Republicans interviewed by CNN suggested that Trump s claim amounted to wishful thinking, saying they believe the alleged billionaire would ultimately backtrack on one of his central campaign promises. I doubt that they re going to pay for it,  said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.  There s a lot he could do if he wanted to (force Mexico s hand). In all honesty, I don t think that s going to happen. Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, said,  I never thought that would happen. I thought it was a gimmick. Trump will face a backlash if he fails to keep his promise. I m for building a wall,  said Rep. Mo Brooks.  And I m for Donald Trump keeping his promise to the American people that Mexico pay for it.  The Alabama lawmaker added that that he would be  disappointed  if Trump failed to deliver.Oh, those crazy  fiscal conservatives. :House GOP sources tell CNN that Trump s transition team has urged Republican leaders to include funding for the wall in a spending package that must pass by April 28 in order to keep the government open. The price tag is uncertain, but some similar proposals have been projected to cost upwards of $10 billion. We re going to get reimbursed,  Trump told The New York Times.  But I don t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. Sure we will, Sport. Just like his contractors were reimbursed while still waiting for that check that will never happen.Mexico will not pay for the wall. Hillary Clinton will not be locked up. The swamp is being filled up with terrifying creatures. Trump supporters were played for suckers   and the rest of us will be paying for their hot mess with our tax dollars.Photo by Win McNamee via Getty Images ",News,"January 7, 2017"
McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

JUST IN: Pro-ISIS Terrorist Who Intended to Blow Up NYC Bus Terminal During Rush Hour Came To U.S. Through CHAIN MIGRATION Program Democrats Are Fighting For,"In September, President Donald Trump tweeted a new condition for a potential deal with Democrats on immigration. Trump warned that he would not budge on allowing the failed  chain migration  program to continue in the United States. CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  he wrote.CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 Business Insider attempted to paint a softer picture of the harsh realities (like terrorism) that chain migration brings with the unpopular program to the United States.Chain migration is a term almost exclusively used by immigration hardliners when referring to the family-reunification-based component of the US immigration system, through which US citizens or lawful permanent residents may sponsor close family members to join them in the US.Prominent anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA have frequently denounced chain migration, describing it as a process that admits  indefinite  numbers of unskilled immigrants based on family connections alone and that prompts foreigners to view US immigration as a  right or entitlement. Immigration proponents, however, describe family-based immigration as essential in helping new immigrants assimilate into US society. The American Immigration Council argues that newcomers who can bring family members with them when they immigrate to the US have stronger social and economic support that helps them  navigate the system. Trump s tweet about chain migration on Friday could signal a new bump in the road for any immigration deal with Democrats. The bipartisan Dream Act, recently reintroduced in Congress by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, includes a pathway to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, whose protections under the DACA program will be phased out over the next six months.FOX News reports  An attempted suicide bomber who set off a rush-hour explosion at the nation s busiest bus terminal is a Bangladeshi national living in Brooklyn who was inspired by ISIS, law enforcement officials said.The suspect in Monday morning s blast at Port Authority in midtown Manhattan was identified as Akayed Ullah, 27.

Is Conservative Firebrand Laura Ingraham Joining Fox News?,"Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News? The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup. Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And  The Five  will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show,  The Specialists,  which previously filled the five o clock slot. Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct. Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed.

WATCH: “NASTY” SAN JUAN MAYOR Continues To Bite The Hand That Feeds The People Who Elected Her,"San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz tore a book from the nasty Democrat women s playbook on Wednesday and wore a black t-shirt emblazoned with the word  nasty  during an interview with Univision s Jorge Ramos. In case anyone forgot, Hillary Clinton actually was called a  nasty woman  by then-candidate Trump during one of the presidential debates. Hillary and her liberal Hollywood friends turned Trump s remark about her into a fundraiser to support abortion. The t-shirt was in response to President Trump s tweet criticizing the politician where he referred to her actions as  nasty  and NOT the mayor. It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention. Does she really believe that constantly criticizing the President of the United States is going to help the people who are relying on her to speed up or improve the aid they re getting? Cruz told Ramos she wore the shirt because  it was one of the expressions that the president used to describe me. I was a  nasty mayor,  People reported. When it bothers somebody that you re asking for drinking water, medicine for the sick and food for the hungry, that person has much deeper problems than what we can discuss in an interview,  Cruz said.""What is truly 'nasty' is to turn your back on the Puerto Rican people"": mayor of San Juan pic.twitter.com/2GVgJNqmve  Al Punto Univision (@AlPunto) October 5, 2017 What really is nasty is showing your back to the Puerto Rican people,  Cruz added.The island was recently hit by powerful Hurricane Maria and has been working to restore power and clean water to the territory.Cruz criticized the Trump administration s hurricane response to the island.

Cruz argued that federal aid had been slow to reach Puerto Rico following Maria, which knocked out power to the entire island.In response, Trump tweeted on Saturday,  Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.

 ‘White Lives Matter’ Rally Breaks Out In Chaos As Neo-Nazi Attacks Protesters (VIDEO),"As many of us could have predicted would be the outcome, a  White Lives Matter  rally broke out in chaos and a brawl ensued.The rally was held in South Buffalo, New York on Saturday afternoon, organized by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. When the rally took place in Cazenovia Park, only one neo-Nazi official was among the other supporters  white supremacist Karl Hand. Hand, who is also the chief of the Racial Nationalist Party of America, revealed he d had little involvement in organizing the rally: I didn t organize it. I was just invited to speak. But that didn t stop him from p*ssing people off and spewing his racist views. One video of the event even shows a woman scolding Hand and telling him that nobody is going to take your sh*t in this day and age, you are sick people  the rest of the United States is going to trample you out. In protest of the event, over 300 activists came out, which outnumbered the White Lives Matter supporters tremendously. The protesters held signs that said,  Not Here,   Black Lives Matter  and,  We promote unity in Buffalo.  Bridget Marren, one of the protesters in attendance and a South Buffalo native, said: We live here. We don t want that hate spread here. But what the White Lives Matter rallygoers lacked in attendance numbers, they made up in offensiveness. The Buffalo Police had dozens of officers at the rally to help control the crowd, but they still couldn t stop another racist neo-Nazi wearing a green  White Pride  t-shirt from getting into a fight with counter-protesters. The situation had eventually escalated so much that his shirt was ripped off when he got into a scuffle.You can watch the rally devolve into chaos in the videos below:But really, what else could we expect from a White Lives Matter rally?Featured image is a screenshot",News,"July 31, 2016"
LEFTIST LEGAL EXPERT DERSHOWITZ Calls Out 9th Circuit For Playing Politics: ‘Not a solid decision’ [Video],"Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz was on MSNBC to make a statement on the 9th Circuit Opinion: He stated that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling against President Trump s immigration order is  not a solid decision.  And  looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. Look, this is not a solid decision. This is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. There are many, many flaws. He added,  I think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the Supreme Court. Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities. In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews. That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States. I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court. I think the standing arguments may fail in the Supreme Court.  ",left-news,"Feb 9, 2017"
BREAKING: Obama Nominates Liberal Merrick Garland For Supreme Court Justice,"Obama decides to nominate Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court even though the Senate announced they would wait until a new administration to confirm a nominee. This is an attempt to box in the Republicans in the Senate. This nominee is left on some things and right on others like criminal justice but has been supported in the past as a judge who  will articulate a broad progressive vision for the law . This should be interesting: To be clear, Garland s record does not suggest that he would join the Court s right flank if confirmed to the Supreme Court. He would likely vote much more often than not with the Supreme Court s liberals. Here s the skinny on left leaning Garland:Garland is unquestionably qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. A 19 year veteran of the DC Circuit   a court that is widely viewed as the second-most powerful in the nation   Garland graduated with high honors from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Justice William Brennan, and spent a few years as a partner in the multinational law firm Arnold and Porter. He also held senior positions in the Justice Department, including a leadership role in the department s criminal division and a stint as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General.At age 63, Garland is also the oldest person nominated to the Supreme Court since President Nixon named Justice Lewis Powell in 1971. Thus, if confirmed, Garland is unlikely to match   or even approach   Justice Scalia s nearly 30 years on the Supreme Court. Garland s relatively advanced age may help explain why Hatch floated the DC Circuit chief judge as his ideal Obama nominee. Another factor that almost certainly played a role is Garland s reputation for moderation. In 2003, for example, Garland joined an opinion holding that the federal judiciary lacks the authority  to assert habeas corpus jurisdiction at the behest of an alien held at a military base leased from another nation, a military base outside the sovereignty of the United States    an opinion that effectively prohibited Guantanamo Bay detainees from seeking relief in civilian courts. A little over a year later, the Supreme Court reversed this decision in Rasul v. Bush. Although, in fairness, it should be noted that legal experts disagree about whether the decision Garland joined was mandated by existing precedents. The former prosecutor also has a relatively conservative record on criminal justice. A 2010 examination of his decisions by SCOTUS Blog s Tom Goldstein determined that  Judge Garland rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants  appeals of their convictions.  Goldstein  identified only eight such published rulings,  in addition to seven where  he voted to reverse the defendant s sentence in whole or in part, or to permit the defendant to raise a argument relating to sentencing on remand,  during the 13 years Garland had then spent on the DC Circuit. To be clear, Garland s record does not suggest that he would join the Court s right flank if confirmed to the Supreme Court. He would likely vote much more often than not with the Supreme Court s liberals.Read more: Think Progress",Government News,"Mar 16, 2016"
ACTORS QUIT “FERGUSON” PLAY DAYS BEFORE OPENING Because They Want Media’s Bogus “Hands Up Don’t Shoot” Version To Replace Actual Court Transcripts," These are people who claim to love diversity, and they don t love diversity   they just want people to agree with them.     Ferguson playwright Phelim McAleerVeteran actor Philip Casnoff hadn t read the full script yet when he arrived for the first rehearsal of  Ferguson,  a play chronicling the shooting of Michael Brown by a Missouri police officer.Casnoff thought he knew what the play, set for a four-day staged reading starting Sunday at the Odyssey Theater, would be about: the wilderness of testimony the grand jury navigated while investigating the day Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot the unarmed 18-year-old. Casnoff presumed a variety of viewpoints, the fog of truth.Then he read the script, which tells the story that Brown didn t have his hands up and that he charged at Wilson.Now, in a case of art imitating life, the play is experiencing the kind of ill will and mistrust that erupted from the city it attempts to portray. Part of the 13-member cast is in revolt   Casnoff and four others have quit   as the playwright and actors are locked in a fundamental disagreement over how to tell the story of Brown s death.Though the grand jury declined to indict Wilson after some witnesses and physical evidence supported his account of events, the tone of the play shocked some actors. It felt like the purpose of the piece was to show,  Of course he was not indicted   here s why,'  Casnoff said. He said that after he learned who the play s author was, Casnoff, who describes himself as  very liberal, left-wing-leaning,  thought,  Whoa, this is not the place for me to be. Through testimony taken from grand jury transcripts, the play ends with a witness telling a prosecutor that Wilson was justified in killing Brown. The audience is then supposed to vote on whether Wilson should have been indicted.The cast members who quit questioned the motivations of the playwright, Phelim McAleer.McAleer, a conservative filmmaker and journalist from Ireland now living in Marina del Rey, said he s just interested in the truth. The truth is the truth. If it doesn t fit in with their beliefs, they need to change their beliefs,  said McAleer, who declined to say whether Wilson should have been indicted but said his research shows the hands-up claim is bogus.  All the people who testified that he had his hands up, it was pretty much demolished in grand jury testimony. If the rest of the decidedly more liberal cast resigns   some actors are leaning that way   McAleer said he ll find a new cast. He also hopes to put the show on YouTube and bring the production to Ferguson itself. There s got to be some actors in L.A. who aren t scared of controversy,  he said.During the  Ferguson  rehearsal, the performers balked after realizing the only witness in McAleer s play who says Brown had his hands up is immediately discredited by an FBI agent.(Although some witnesses told investigators that Brown had his hands up, a Department of Justice report said many of those witnesses  accounts were recanted, debunked or inconsistent with physical evidence.)McAleer s play also ends with a damning exchange between a witness and prosecutor. Do you feel like this could have ended up any other way?  the prosecutor asks. Yeah, it could have, if Michael Brown had just stopped running  toward Wilson, says the witness, who is identified as Witness 48 in the grand jury transcripts, but who is given a pseudonym in the play and cast with a young black actress.  It could have ended another way. The officer had no other choice. No other choice, in other words, but to shoot Brown.After those lines were read by actors Deborah Puette and Sydney A. Mason, a kind of awkward quiet fell over the cast members, whose bodies had been bent like question marks as they stared down at their scripts in a rehearsal space near Culver City.The cast questioned the balance of the 55-page script, and even debated the justification for the shooting. Why not shoot him in the leg?  asked one actress, Donzaleigh Abernathy, cast to play a witness, her voice booming through the small, windowless space. He didn t have time!  responded a younger actor, also playing a witness.Several members requested changes to the script that would include adding another account more sympathetic to Brown to balance out the final witness  dramatic testimony. McAleer has rejected those requests, spurring some of the actors  departures. He claims that he wrote this to try to get to the truth of it, but everybody s truth is totally subjective,  said Veralyn Jones, an African American cast member who resigned.  When you come to the matter of what really happened, nobody really knows for sure, because everybody has a different take on it.   It just didn t feel right to me. One of the script s most heated critics has been Abernathy, who is the daughter of civil rights movement leader Ralph David Abernathy, who was with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he died. Abernathy, who is black, has not decided to leave the cast yet   at least not before she has the chance to meet McAleer at a cast meeting scheduled for Thursday night. I want to hear what he has to say face to face. I actually want to know, on a moral level, how can you do something like this that you know will divide America?  Abernathy asked.  Does it make you feel good? Obviously he has a personal agenda. What is his personal agenda? McAleer was unapologetic, and waved away criticism. These are people who claim to love diversity, and they don t love diversity   they just want people to agree with them,  he said.So with or without his cast, McAleer said, the show will go on.Via: LA Times",politics,"Apr 23, 2015"
 Clinton Ties With Trump In The Very Republican State Of Georgia,"It s no secret has built a national coalition of minority voters. In the Democratic Primary, black and Hispanic voters came out and brought a sweep of the south for Clinton, thus edging her closer and closer to the nomination.It is this same minority population that might flip the southern state of Georgia in the November general election, and could tilt the electoral college in favor of Democrats for the first time since 1992. Before that, Democrats won in 1976 and 1980, when Jimmy Carter was president.A new poll from WSB 2 in Georgia shows a surprising result: Clinton and Trump are tied, 41 percent to 41 percent, with Trump winning whites and men and Clinton clinching women, African Americans, and Independents.Clinton is no fool. She knows perfectly well where she stands with Georgia. While appearing on ABC, the Democratic frontrunner pointed out that the state s demographics are growing in the Democrat s favor:In the last decade, Georgia s minority population has gone from 37%-44%. Eighty-one percent of the state s population growth has come from minorities. Blacks and Hispanics account for Georgia s population growth, and those two groups of voters are why the Clinton campaign seems to be gearing up to make a serious push to win Georgia.The only thing that could tip the scales in favor of Clinton is Independents. Although she leads Trump with them 36 percent to 28 percent, 38 percent remain undecided.If Clinton can tap into the Independent voters, and highlight just how crazy and destructive Donald Trump is, not only would Georgia turn blue, other southern sates could follow.And that s what Clinton is aiming to do:And I particularly want to support Democrats in states that have been voting against Democratic candidates for awhile now to rebuild the Democratic Party. We re going to try to make Georgia competitive, and we re going to fight hard in North Carolina and Virginia and Florida.Could there be a southern uprising in favor of Clinton? As the frontrunner looks towards the general election, stops in Ohio and Appalachia may also turn other red-leaning states blue.If Clinton keeps up her appeal to all (instead of just angry, white men), Democrats could have a great year. Georgia s latest poll is just one of more to come.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 8, 2016"

Is Obama Using The Refugee Resettlement Of Muslims To Give ISIS World Domination?,"Since Obama was sworn in as President hundreds of thousands of  refugees  have come to America most of them Muslim. We re also seeing thousands of people from all over the world cross our Southern border illegally. With the virtual invasion via illegals and refugees, is Obama trying to give America to ISIS? It is a question worth asking if you look at the facts: DHS has just announced that ISIS is infiltrating the Refugee Resettlement Program. No shocker there. And yet, not only does Obama refuse to shut it down, he s bringing more and more in. Treasonous much? He s also going after our guns and constitutional rights in an attempt to strip them from us just when we need them the most. ISIS PLANS GLOBAL DOMINATION: A document has just surfaced which outlines how ISIS organizes its territory and controls it. I am not surprised. I would have expected nothing less from the Caliphate. They are a conquering force after all, so it makes sense that they would be the ultimate, brutal community organizers.Before we get into that, the latest on ISIS is that Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour is dead in Afghanistan. He was mortally wounded in a shootout last Tuesday and succumbed to his wounds sometime within the next 48 hours. If true, this is a death blow to the Taliban in Afghanistan by ISIS and is very bad news. As horrific as the Taliban is, ISIS makes them look like amateurs.Experts say they can t figure out where ISIS is getting their funding. Are you kidding me? They are big business: drugs, oil and they are backed by various countries behind the scenes and other players in geopolitical manipulations. ISIS will spread through Afghanistan like a malignant cancer. Slaughter and terror will be widespread. ISIS is very organized in their conquest for the Caliphate and they will rule the country with an iron fist and a Quran.I don t believe the Taliban when they say Mansour is still alive. If he were alive, we would have seen him by now. Already, slick propaganda is surfacing from ISIS of their executions of their enemies. It is brutal and gory. I have heard reports of them making the Taliban kneel on explosives and then blowing them up. They also put mortars as necklaces around their necks and then detonate them. The training camps they are setting up all over the place are terrifying and many are flocking to ISIS to join in the fight for the Caliphate. They are the strong horse in the race for the Middle East. ISIS is going from town to town, province to province and slaughtering people and conquering in their wake. They rape women and children, execute infidels and crucify offenders. They take slaves and wealth as they go. It is very reminiscent of Genghis Kahn. People flee in abject terror when they hear that ISIS is approaching.Neither Russia or the United States could take the Taliban out. They live like goats in the mountains of Afghanistan. But ISIS is making short order of them and fast. The trick is to be more brutal and aggressive than your enemy and ISIS has that down to an art. ISIS settled in among the population in Afghanistan and then activated. That is exactly what they are doing in Europe. Things are about to get very, very dicey out there.Now, with this unearthed document, we see how they have global plans. ISIS is already throughout the Middle East and with the Hijrah migration, they are now planted in Europe. Just as they did in Afghanistan, they initially plant themselves within a population before rising up in cells and sweeping the country. They are beginning to do this in America too, thanks to Barack Obama s open borders and Refugee Resettlement Program.Read more: Noisy Room",Government News,"Dec 8, 2015"
" Seth MacFarlane Responds To Orlando Shooting, Smacks Down Gun Nuts (TWEETS)","The creator of Family Guy responded on Sunday to the Orlando mass shooting and humiliated a couple of gun nuts along the way.On Saturday, a gunman killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida. It is now the worst mass shooting in American history and has reignited the calls for gun safety regulations.And comedian Seth MacFarlane added his voice to those making such calls by calling for a ban on automatic weapons in a post on Twitter. These shootings are a regular occurrence,  MacFarlane wrote.  You don t get to be  shocked  anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons. These shootings are a regular occurrence. You don t get to be  shocked  anymore unless you take action to stop them. Ban automatic weapons.  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Of course, a couple gun nuts took issue with MacFarlane s call to action.One Twitter user claimed that MacFarlane s call to ban automatic weapons would be like banning planes after the 9/11 attacks. The voice of Peter Griffin responded that unlike guns, planes aren t designed to kill people. RT @JIMDETHOMAS: @SethMacFarlane should ve banned planes after 9/11. // A plane s primary function is not to kill. Get the difference?  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016A second gun nut posted the dubious conservative claim that if a single person had been carrying a gun that night less people would have been killed. MacFarlane responded with the fact that there hasn t been a single example of a  good guy with a gun  preventing a mass shooting in progress.RT @xNathan30x: one person carrying a concealed handgun in that club could have ended that horror. // Often stated, never once happened.  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016In the end, MacFarlane lamented that all the responses, presumably the negative ones, are enough to cause even him to be depressed. Man. Twitter responses to all this on my feed are enough to send the even cheeriest soul into a deep depression.  Seth MacFarlane (@SethMacFarlane) June 12, 2016Banning automatic weapons is not the only way to reduce gun violence. We need a better background check system and we need to ban people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy guns. Plus, we desperately need better mental healthcare in this country. But Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything that will upset their NRA masters, and that s why we can expect more mass shootings unless we send people to Congress who will take action to prevent gun violence instead of simply offering useless thoughts and prayers.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"June 13, 2016"
REFS WALK OFF IN PROTEST After High School Players Kneel During Anthem,"TWO PATRIOTS WALK:The officials, Ernie Lunardelli, 54, and his son, Anthony Lunardelli, 27, stood for the anthem and then abruptly left the field after seeing the players kneeling. Their spots on the five-person crew were filled by junior cadet officials at the game, Ernie Lunardelli said. DISRESPECTING OUR COUNTRY I m not in favor of anyone disrespecting our country, our flag, the armed forces,  Ernie Lunardelli told NJ Advance Media Saturday afternoon.  What they re protesting has nothing to do with the national anthem and I m against it, so I decided to protest for them kneeling and that s what I did. Ernie Lunardelli said weeks ago he informed the officials assigner for the Greater Middlesex Conference, Thomas Paulikas, that he would walk off the field if any players knelt for the anthem before his games.BEST COMMENT OF THE WEEK: Whoever is disrespecting that flag and the national anthem, that s who I have a problem with,  Lunardelli said.  That s my protest. I don t care if it s a baby, if it s an 80-year-old man, anybody. I don t care. Any race, color, I don t care who it is. It s not the way I was brought up and it pisses me off that people are doing that. PUNISHED FOR RESPECTING OUR COUNTRY:Lunardelli, meanwhile, said he and his son were unassigned from working Saturday s game between Spotswood and Raritan.After Lunardelli and his son left, they were replaced by two cadets who were already assigned to work on the chain crew for the game. Lunardelli alleged Saturday the game is not official because the cadets did not have proper certification or training. That game should not count now because they did not have the right personnel on the field,  Lunardelli said.  These kids weren t officially carded and trained, so they re putting the kids in jeopardy, I m not. Monroe athletic director Greg Beyer declined comment when reached by phone Saturday. State officials assigner Carmine Picardo also declined to discuss the situation, saying he  did not know what could happen  based on the protest by the Lunardellis.Colts Neck went on to defeat Monroe, 18-13.Read more: NJ.comALL IS NOT LOST:THIS NEW JERSEY HIGH SCHOOL HAS THE RIGHT IDEA:While some players choose to disrespect our national anthem, several New Jersey high school football programs are honoring those who protect and serve.St. Joseph High School held its second annual Military, Police and Fireman Appreciation Day in September:The event, which former St. Joseph head coach Casey Ransone initiated with tremendous success last season, includes a pregame ceremony and complementary tailgate for the honorees.What a great idea!Read more: MyCentralNJ.com",left-news,"Oct 29, 2017"
"BREAKING: Pope Met Privately With Enemy Of Left, Kim Davis","Is the Pope s defense of same sex marriage the straw the will break the camel s back for the godless left? Washington, DC   Media is buzzing about the Pope s comments in support of conscientious objection and whether he knows about the Rowan County, Kentucky, Clerk of Court who was jailed for six days for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The Pope met privately with Kim Davis and her husband, Joe, at the Vatican Embassy in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, September 24, which was the birthday of Kim s father. Pope Francis spoke with Kim and Joe Davis in English.During the meeting Pope Francis said,  Thank you for your courage.  Pope Francis also told Kim Davis to  Stay strong.  He held out his hands and asked Kim to pray for him. Kim held his hands and said,  I will. Please pray for me,  and the Pope said he would. The two embraced. The Pontiff presented Kim and Joe Davis each with a Rosary that he personally blessed. Kim s mother and father are Catholic, and Kim and Joe will present the Rosaries to her parents. Kim s mother was the elected Clerk of Court for Rowan County for 37 years until her retirement in 2014.Kim Davis said,  I was humbled to meet Pope Francis. Of all people, why me?  Davis continued,  I never thought I would meet the Pope. Who am I to have this rare opportunity? I am just a County Clerk who loves Jesus and desires with all my heart to serve him.  Kim said,  Pope Francis was kind, genuinely caring, and very personable. He even asked me to pray for him. Pope Francis thanked me for my courage and told me to  stay strong. The challenges we face in America regarding the sanctity of human life, marriage, and religious freedom are the same universal challenges Christians face around the world. Religious freedom is a human right that comes from God. These values are shared in common by people of faith, and the threats to religious freedom are universal. Kim Davis has become a symbol of this worldwide conflict between Christian faith and recent cultural challenges regarding marriage,  said Mat Staver, Founder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel.Speaking with reporters on board the Papal plane to Rome, Pope Francis told Terry Moran of ABC News that conscientious objection is a human right, even for government officials:  Conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right. It is a right. And if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector, he denies a right. Conscientious objection must enter into every juridical structure because it is a right, a human right. Otherwise we would end up in a situation where we select what is a right, saying  this right that has merit, this one does not.  It (conscientious objection) is a human right. It always moved me when I read, and I read it many times, when I read the  Chanson de Roland  when the people were all in line and before them was the baptismal font and they had to choose between the baptismal font or the sword. They had to choose. They weren t permitted conscientious objection. It is a right and if we want to make peace we have to respect all rights. The ABC News Chief Foreign Correspondent asked if that includes government officials as well, and the Pope reiterated that conscientious objection is a human right:  It is a human right and if a government official is a human person, he has that right,  Pope Francis affirmed.After the above statement of Pope Francis was published, some in the media wondered if the Pontiff knew of Kim Davis.  Not only did Pope Francis know of Kim Davis, he personally met with her to express his support,  concluded Staver.Via: Barbed Wire",left-news,"Sep 29, 2015"
“NO COINCIDENCE”: U.S. EXTRADITES ROMANIAN HACKER Of Clinton/Blumenthal E-mails," THE BIG QUESTION WITH THE EXTRADITION OF THE HACKER NAMED GUCCIFER: Will he only be used to demonstrate how easy it was to crack Max Blumethal s private account and thus how negligent Hillary was in handling classified material?WE REPORTED ON THE SMOKING GUN RELEASE OF GUCCIFER S INFO ON CLINTON/BLUMENTHAL EXCHANGES. The e-mails between Clinton and Blumenthal expose what self-centered lunatics they are. Unreal:Testimony from State Department Employee on Clinton s handling of classified information: The extradition of Romanian hacker  Guccifer  to the U.S. at a critical point in the FBI s criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton s email use is  not a coincidence,  according to an intelligence source close to the case.One of the notches on Guccifer s cyber-crime belt was allegedly accessing the email account of Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, one of Clinton s most prolific advice-givers when she was secretary of state. It was through that hack that Clinton s use of a personal account   clintonemail.com   first came to light.Former law enforcement and cyber security experts said the hacker, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, could   now that he s in the U.S.   help the FBI make the case that Clinton s email server was compromised by a third party, one that did not have the formal backing and resources of a foreign intelligence service such as that of Russia, China or Iran. Because of the proximity to Sidney Blumenthal and the activity involving Hillary s emails, [the timing] seems to be something beyond curious,  said Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI s Criminal Investigative Division from 2012-2014.On Tuesday, Lazar appeared in an Alexandria, Va., federal courtroom for his detention hearing, attended by Fox News. He faces a nine-count federal indictment on computer hacking charges and, according to both Romanian and U.S. officials, is expected to be in the country for 18 months.A spokesman for the FBI s Washington Field Office, which led the Guccifer investigation, had no comment on the extradition, the timing, and any potential intersection with the Clinton email probe.On or about March 31, Lazar was extradited 3,700 miles to Alexandria from a prison in Arad, Romania, where he has been serving a seven-year sentence for hacking crimes committed in his native country. His targets in Romania were prominent government officials and political figures whom he often taunted under the name of Micul Fum or  Little Smoke. Following his 2014 conviction, Lazar was effectively neutralized in prison and no longer a threat, which makes his transfer to the U.S. all the more noteworthy.The 44-year-old entered the Alexandria courtroom wearing a green jumpsuit, with the yellow word  PRISONER  stenciled on the back. Lazar appeared confident and relaxed during the four-minute appearance, telling the court he did not need the translator provided for the hearing.According to the 15-page federal indictment, Lazar  specialized in gaining unauthorized access to the online accounts of high-profile individuals  including Clinton ally Blumenthal, who appears to be identified as  Victim 5   a journalist and former presidential advisor who was the true owner of an AOL account with subaccounts known to the grand jury. The indictment went on to note that using his alias of Guccifer on Blumenthal s account,  Lazar attempted to conceal his identity by accessing the account from a proxy server located in Russia.

 Republicans’ Benghazi Witch Hunt Just Went Up In Flames Thanks To Their Own Lawyer,"Unless you re an idiot, you know that while the terrorist attacks in Benghazi were a tragedy, neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton were at fault for the attacks. Of course, Republicans have never exactly been the sharpest knives in the kitchen. For years, the Right has been waging a desperate war on Clinton, Obama, and sanity with their asinine Benghazi investigations. All across conservative media, we hear that Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, or both murdered four patriots with their bare hands while blaspheming God s name and murdering babies (or something; it s hard to understand what they are talking about at times).The Republican Benghazi  scandal  has been slowly going up in flames for quite some time now, but a letter from Trey Gowdy s former counsel has completely decimated any hope they have of getting anything useful out of the millions and millions of taxpayer dollars they wasted on this senseless exercise. Nevertheless, Republicans continue to claim that Obama and Clinton prevented the military from taking action that would have saved the lives of the Americans who died in the attacks. This is the drumbeat to which Republicans have goose-stepped as they attempted to railroad the Obama Administration in court   but as much as they try to deny it, reality is a thing. Even more unfortunately for Republicans, their own former counsel in the matter was very clear that no one did anything wrong.On May 16, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the voice of reason in this mess, sent a letter to Gowdy to remind him that his own attorney disputed many of the GOP s claims:Unfortunately, your letter failed to include any statements from your own former Republican Chief Counsel a retired three-star general with more than 33 years of service in the United States Army who repeatedly commended the military s actions on the night of the attacks during closed interviews with Defense Department officials.For example, on January 8, 2016, the Select Committee conducted a transcribed interview with former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. During that interview, your former Chief Counsel stated:I think you ordered exactly the right forces to move out and to head toward a position where they could reinforce what was occurring in Benghazi or in Tripoli or elsewhere in the region. And, sir, I don t disagree with the actions you took, the recommendations you made, and the decisions you directed.Gowdy s former counsel also acknowledged that it was impossible, given time and distances, for military forces to arrive fast enough to make a difference:Your former Chief Counsel acknowledged that it is clear from the time and distances involved that none of the military forces could have gotten to Benghazi in time to save lives.He stated:And, again, sir, I don t mean to suggest that anything could have been done differently to affect the outcome in Benghazi, and I think you would agree with that.But most importantly, there was nothing that could be done at all:In addition, on January 13, 2016, the Select Committee conducted a transcribed interview with the Defense Department s former Chief of Staff, Jeremy Bash. During that interview, your former Republican Chief Counsel stated:I would posit that from my perspective, having looked at all the materials over the last 18 months, we could not have affected the response to what occurred by 5: 15 in the morning on the 12th of September if Benghazi, Libya. So let me start with that positing or that stipulation.Your former Chief Counsel also stated:I don t see any way to influence what occurred there. But what I am worried about is we re caught by surprise On 9/11, we ve got nothing postured to respond in a timely manner and you can debate what s timely, what s untimely, but nothing could have affected what occurred in Benghazi. The conclusions of your former Republican Chief Counsel match almost exactly the findings from more than two years ago of the House Committee on Armed Services, which conducted its own investigation into the attacks in Benghazi,  Cummings wrote, noting that Rep. Buck McKeon, the Republican Chairman of the Committee who led the investigation at the time, was satisfied that  given where the troops were, how quickly the thing all happened and how quickly it dissipated, we probably couldn t have done more than we did. There you have it. Barack Obama killed no one. Hillary Clinton killed no one. If anything, Republicans are trying to distract from their own responsibility in the matter. ThinkProgress reported in 2012 that Republicans had cut funding for embassy security because defending Americans abroad was not a  priority :For fiscal 2013, the GOP-controlled House proposed spending $1.934 billion for the State Department s Worldwide Security Protection program   well below the $2.15 billion requested by the Obama administration. House Republicans cut the administration s request for embassy security funding by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal 2012 .[In 2011] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Republicans  proposed cuts to her department would be  detrimental to America s national security    a charge Republicans rejected.[GOP vice presidential nominee Paul] Ryan, [Rep. Darrell] Issa and other House Republicans voted for an amendment in 2009 to cut $1.2 billion from State operations, including funds for 300 more diplomatic security positions. Under Ryan s budget, non-defense discretionary spending, which includes State Department funding, would be slashed nearly 20 percent in 2014, which would translate to more than $400 million in additional cuts to embassy security.These cuts occurred, of course, not long before the deadly attacks the GOP is so desperate to pin on their favorite enemies.Go figure.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/Getty Images (Eric Thayer)",News,"May 16, 2016"

 Study Shows Democrats Are Better Drivers For This SHOCKING Reason (DETAILS),"You don t have to look beyond Washington to prove what we ve known for decades, Democrats are simply better people. Democratic policies actually help people while Republican policies help themselves and corporations.Beyond Washington, though, it s been proven that Democrats make better neighbors:Democrats are more likely to offer assistance to other members of their community: over the course of a year, they are more likely than Republicans to talk with someone who is severely depressed; help a friend or neighbor find a job; or help friends, neighbors, or family members with homework. I also noted a series of differences albeit not statistically significant ones showing that Democrats more frequently loan dishes or tools to their neighbors, help strangers carry their belongings, offer up their seat on a train or bus, allow strangers to cut ahead of them in line, and give food or money directly to someone in need.Democrats are also smarter and more rational:So for liberals to make a case for an idea or cause, they come armed with data, research studies, and experts. They are convinced of an idea if all the data checks out basically they assign meaning and value to ideas that fit within the scientific method, because that s their primary thinking style. Emotion doesn t play as big of a role in validation. Not to say that liberals are unfeeling, but just more likely to set emotion aside when judging an idea initially, and factor it in later. Checks out scientifically = valuable. Liberals can get just as emotionally attached to an idea, but it s usually not the primary trigger for acceptance of an idea.Conservatives would be less likely to assign value primarily using the scientific method. Remember, their thinking style leads primarily with emotion. In order for them to find an idea valuable, it has to be meaningful for them personally. It needs to trigger empathy. Meaning, they need some kind of emotional attachment to it, such as family, or a group of individuals they are close to in some way.None of that should be terribly surprising, especially if you ve ever encountered conservatives on Facebook, and we ve all encountered conservatives on Facebook. What is surprising, though, is this study, which says we re better drivers, or at least in blue states, there are a lot fewer traffic fatalities.In all, the 14 states with the highest fatality rates went into the red column, supporting Trump. In contrast, the 12 states with the lowest fatality rates were blues that favored Clinton. In these calculations, fatality rates were determined by counting the number of road deaths in 2015 per every 100,000 people.This isn t as weird as you might think. Republicans tend to thumb their noses at constraints to their freedoms. They can t drive 55. They also tend to live in less populated areas, whereas Democrats live in areas that have a lot of traffic. Nothing slows people down faster than 1000s of brake lights ahead of them. There s more though:Another likely factor behind high fatality rates in red rural states is that their residents tend to be poorer. As a result,  Their cars are probably in worse repair. There can be a missing light in the back, or the clutch goes out,  said sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, author of the 2016 book  Strangers In Their Own Land,  which explored views of conservatives in red state Louisiana.Hochschild also said  a kind of cowboy mentality, a kind of deregulatory, anything goes culture  exists in red states might lead to more reckless driving.They are also less likely to wear seat belts (that damn gubmint, telling people what to do).Really, though, this is just a metaphor Republicans in general. Republicans are reckless and don t give a crap about the safety of anyone who might get in their way. It s how the Republican Congress is run and it s how the roads in red states are run.Featured image via Wikimedia",News,"February 1, 2017"
DEAR RNC: An Everyday American Writes A Letter To Explain The Trump Phenomenon,"This letter was sent to 100% FED Up! by an anonymous author:It doesn t matter who you support for President in 2016. This letter will make you want to stand up and cheer for the 80 year old American who expresses what most of us are feeling right now. Enjoy RNC P.O. Box 96994 Washington DC 20090-6994Dear Representative,From the time I was able to vote I voted Republican. I am 80 years old, and have a great deal of respect and influence with hundreds of senior ball players who also network with thousands of others around the country.I received your questionnaire and request for money and strongly agree with every question, as I have since Obama was elected. Unfortunately the one question that was missing is  What have the Republicans done for the American people?  We gave you a majority in the House and Senate, yet you never listened to us. Now you want our money.You should be more concerned about our votes, not our money. You are the establishment, which means all you want is to save your jobs and line your pockets  Well guess what?  It s not going to happen  You shake in your boots when I tell you we re giving our support to TRUMP and he hasn t asked for a dime.You might think we are fools because you feel Trump is on a self destruction course, but you need to look beyond Washington and listen to the masses. Nobody has achieved what he has, especially in the liberal state of New York.You clearly don t understand why the Trump movement is so strong, so I d like to share with you an analogy to help explain the Trump phenomenon. By the way, it s not just the Republicans who feel ignored and disrespected, there are plenty of Democrats and Independents who also feel let down by the Washington elite. You seem to have  forgotten about  We The People  and who hired you to represent us.So here it is, the best analogy I could come up with. Here is the reason so many Americans have boarded the Trump Train, and why you re pleas to come back to the party who deserted us, is falling on deaf ears:You ve been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with raccoons. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoons have overtaken your basement. You want them gone immediately You call the city and four different exterminators, but nobody could handle the job. There is this one guy however, who guarantees you he will get rid of them, so you hire him. You don t care if the guy smells, you don t care if the guy swears, you don t care how many times he s been married, you don t care if he was friends with liberals, you don t care if he has plumber s crack you simply want those raccoons gone! You want your problem fixed! He s the guy. He s the best. Period. Here s why we want Trump: Yes he s a bit of an ass, yes he s an egomaniac, but we don t care. The country is a mess because politicians have become too self-serving. The Republican Party is two-faced & gutless. Illegal aliens have been allowed to invade our nation. We want it all fixed! We don t care that Trump is crude, we don t care that he insults people, we don t care that he had been friendly with Hillary, we don t care that he has changed positions, we don t care that he s been married three times, we don t care that he fights with Megan Kelly and Rosie O Donnell, we don t care that he doesn t know the name of some Muslim terrorist. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal aliens and bringing tens of thousands of Muslim refugees to America, while leaving Christians behind to be persecuted. We are becoming a nation of victims where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is part of a special group with special rights, to the point where we don t even recognize the country we were born and raised in;  AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED  and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We re sick of politicians. We re sick of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. We just want this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but he isn t beholden to lobbyist money and he doesn t have political correctness restraining him. All we know is that he has been very successful, he s an excellent negotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he s also not a politician. He s definitely not a cowardly politician. When he says he ll fix it, we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Oh yeah I forgot we don t care if the guy has bad hair either.  We just want those raccoons gone. Out of your house. NOW!",left-news,"Mar 2, 2016"

DAY 2 RESULTS Of Wisconsin Recount Are In…And Hillary’s Not Gonna Like It,"The Wisconsin Election Commission posts recount data on a spreadsheet every day. The latest spreadsheet totals as of 1:30 p.m. CST on December 3 show that the recount isn t changing much, although a smattering of errors have been found throughout the state. The candidates each lost and gained a smattering of votes in towns, cities, and villages that are reporting, so any losses were basically cancelled out.The Election Commission doesn t tally the returns, but, rather, just posts a raw spreadsheet of numbers. Heavy went through the spreadsheet and tallied the lost and gained votes for Trump and Clinton for each county so far, and then subtracted the two totals for a net gain or loss for day 2.Here s what the returns show so far:Day 2 totals Clinton gained 89 votes but lost 86 for a net gain of 3 votes. Trump gained 98 votes but lost 92 for a net gain of 6 votes.OVERALLClinton gained 3 votes  Trump gained 6 votes  Net Trump gain of 3 votes on Day 2Trump won Wisconsin by more than 22,000 votes.That means that Trump inched ahead by a grand total of 3 votes in a recount expected to cost more than $3.5 million. Green Party nominee Jill Stein raised more than $6 million to fund recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The latter two recounts are now bogged down in legal issues and challenges. On December 3, Stein dropped her request for a Pennsylvania recount, saying she couldn t afford the $1 million required, even though she raised $7 million overall for recounts. Clinton would have needed all three states   Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan   to flip in order to take the White House back from Trump, an exceedingly tall order.In Wisconsin, Trump supporters sued to stop the recount, alleging it was not being conducted uniformly (some counties use paper ballots and others use machines).

 WATCH: Joy Reid CRUSHES Trump Supporter For Saying She’s Not On America’s Side,"Picking a fight with Joy Reid on live television is not smart, so of course a Trump surrogate did exactly that and got his ass handed to him.During her show on Saturday morning, Trump supporter Carl Paladino actually claimed that the Republican nominee knows how to handle Russia and Vladamir Putin better than our military, State Department, and intelligence agencies. He also attacked Reid directly, calling her a politically correct progressive who is not on America s side.Reid began by playing footage of former CIA Director Michael Hayden slamming Trump s  erratic  behavior and suggesting that Trump could very well be a  unwitting agent  for Putin. Furthermore, Trump is unpredictable and dangerous, especially since he would have control of America s nuclear arsenal as president.Indeed, Trump has various business connections with Russian oligarchs who are aligned with the Russian president, who has directed Russian state media to support Trump s campaign. Trump also softened the GOP platform stance against Russia. Trump s ties with Russia are especially concerning to intelligence agents, who are worried about briefing Trump because whatever he is told could end up being passed along to Putin. You are pretty much fighting an armada of intelligence experts,  Reid told Paladino. In your mind,  Paladino told Reid.  No, not in my mind,  Reid replied.  Actually in my ears because we re listening to them speak. Then Paladino proceeded to embarrass himself by going on a rant about Reid. I think what s happened to you is that you ve been in a conditioned box, for a long time, of political correctness. Political correctness and a certain way of doing things. And when a guy comes on the scene who shows real leadership qualities, who can talk to the America people, and they can find faith in him and confidence in him that he s gonna do the right thing   when that man comes on the scene, you guys just don t know what to do. Clearly, Paladino must have missed a poll that shows 70 percent of Americans have a negative view of Trump, with 56 percent feeling this way strongly.That s probably what Reid was thinking about when she smiled as Paladino ranted. The progressives are gonna lose their influence and their power and their control of the American people s minds, and you re in a panic state right now,  he continued before Reid chimed in with sarcasm. Oh yeah, were panicking,  she said.After accusing Reid of  making crazy accusations,  Reid fired back with facts. I think if you look at the polling, most of the public is standing by the generals and intelligence professionals, at least as we stand now,  Reid said.Trump is currently being trounced by Hillary Clinton in the polls. Clinton is leading by 15 points nationwide in one poll.Paladino then implied that Reid is not on America s side.  I know which side you re on, mam,  he said.But Reid clobbered Paladino and Trump with a sharp retort.  Not on Vladimir Putin s side, and I like that stance. Here s the video via YouTube.As usual, Trump s people ignored the facts and stuck with personal attacks and they got burned.Featured image via creenshot",News,"August 7, 2016"
 Russian Lawyer At Trump Jr.’s Meeting Has Worked For Russian Spy Agency,"The whole world knows about the bombshell report of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and the former campaign manager for Donald Trump s 2016 presidential run, Paul Manafort, holding a secret meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Of course, despite how shady this is on its face, Team Trump s party line has been,  nothing to see here.  Well, it seems that there just might be something to see here, considering that Veselnitskaya actually once represented a Russian spy agency.Reuters reports that Veselnitskaya was involved in a bitter fight over elite, exclusive pieces of property in Moscow. Who was her client? The FSB, of course. Meaning, essentially, she was working for the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin. Supposedly, that connection ended in 2013 when Veselnitskaya won the case for the FSB. However, with the way Russia operates, once a Russian spy operative, always a Russian spy operative. Here is how Reuters describes the chain of events:Reuters could not find a record of when and by whom the lawsuit   which dates back to at least 2003   was first lodged. But appeal documents show that Rosimushchestvo, Russia s federal government property agency, was involved. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Veselnitskaya and her firm Kamerton Consulting represented  military unit 55002  in the property dispute, the documents show.Now, to play devil s advocate, it is very possible that Trump Jr. and the rest didn t know Veselnitskaya s history. That is possible, but certainly not probable, considering the fact that Trump Jr. himself has admitted that his family has been getting money from Russia to fund their business ventures for years. That makes it highly unlikely that the Trumps and those in their orbit weren t well aware of who this woman was, what her background was, and who she worked for.At the end of the day, this is a woman that never should have been allowed into this nation at all, and she definitely shouldn t have been anywhere an American presidential campaign. All of this is shady as hell, and hopefully Robert Mueller can get to the bottom of it while we still have a republic to save.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 21, 2017"
 Trump Campaign CEO Didn’t Want His Kids In School With A Bunch Of ‘Whiny’ Jews,"The court records from the divorce of Trump s new campaign CEO have proved to be a treasure trove of information about the man hired to save the Republican nominee s trainwreck of a campaign. The latest insight revealed in these documents is that Stephen Bannon has deeply anti-Semitic tendencies. Shocking, I know. (Insert eye roll here.)According to court documents, the former Breitbart bigwig was worried about sending his twin daughters to the Archer School for Girls because of the number of Jewish students who were enrolled. A statement signed by his ex-wife in 2007 said that Bannon was concerned about the impact Jewish classmates would have on his children. The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend,  read her statement. He said that he doesn t like the way they raise their kids to be  whiny brats  and that he didn t want the girls going to school with Jews. When they looked into at least one other private school they were considering sending their daughters to, his ex-wife said that Bannon asked about the number of Jewish students attending.Naturally, Bannon is denying these claims. Spokeswoman Alexandra Preate said that Bannon never made any of these statements and added that his girls did end up attending Archer. Mr. Bannon said he never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education,  Preate said.This is the second damning revelation to come from his divorce proceedings this week. Accusations of domestic abuse came to light on Thursday. According to court documents, his wife claimed that he was a sadistic wife-beater who had grabbed her  by the throat and arm  during a domestic dispute on New Year s Day in 1996. Police came and photographed her injuries, but Bannon was able to avoid consequences by scaring his victim into leaving town so she would miss the court date.Remember folks, Trump only hires the best people.Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM",News,"August 27, 2016"
 Betsy Devos Just Put A For-Profit Credit Card Exec In Charge Of Federal Student Aid Program,"On Tuesday, Education Secretary Betsy Devos announced that she will appoint A. Wayne Johnson as the as Chief Operating Officer of Federal Student Aid on Thursday. In the press release put out by the Education Department, Devos cited Johnson s academic and professional achievements as Johnson s skills he is bringing to the department.<FSA currently serves 42 million student loan borrowing clients and administers more than $1.4 trillion in current outstanding Federal Student Loan balances.Reuters reports on the story saying: In last year s election, Donald Trump and other Republicans campaigned on  getting government out of the business of student loans.  Democrats want to stay on the path forged by former President Barack Obama, who moved student lending from the banks to the federal government.DeVos has taken on higher-education finances since being confirmed in February. She recently began rewriting rules on for-profit college debt and decided to put one company in charge of servicing loans. Wayne is the right person to modernize FSA for the 21st Century,  said Secretary DeVos in a press release.  He actually wrote the book on student loan debt and will bring a unique combination of CEO-level operating skills and an in-depth understanding of the needs and issues associated with student loan borrowers and their families. Wayne has worked previously in executive positions at TSYS, First Data, and VISA. He is also the founder and former CEO of First Performance Corporation. Wayne s corporate background has attracted the ire of financial sector watch groups. Allied Progress, a left-leaning anti-Wall St watch group says that Wayne will implement  policies that increase the odds students will default on their loans. This announcement comes just one month after Obama-appointed FSA CEO, James Runcie, resigned from his position as Education Secretary. When he resigned Runcie cited he could not take  the risk  of working in a department ran by Devos. Runcie also claimed that he could not accept Devos  policies that were redirecting critical funds within the department. I cannot in good conscience continue to be accountable as Chief Operating Officer given the risk associated with the current environment at the [Education] Department,  reads the resignation memo Runcie put out in May.This move is a continuation of the corporatization of the federal government that has been seen under the Trump administration. Devos herself has no actual background in education. Yet, she is Education Secretary because she allowed Trump to use her family s arena multiple times, for free, during both his primary and presidential election. The Devos family is also deeply embedded in conservative politics, usually of the Christian fascist variety. They are major donors to the GOP s war chest as well, having given up to a commonly cited total of $200 million dollars to the Republican Party.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 21, 2017"

"EUROPE CRASHES AND BURNS, As EU Officials FINALLY Admit Secret About “Refugees” They’ve Known For A While","The Genie is out of the bottle. Europe will never be the same. It s rich history and the uniqueness of each country is gone.Even EU officials are now finally admitting that a lot   or, rather, most   of the people we have been calling  refugees  are not refugees. They are economic migrants with no more right to be called European citizens than anybody else in the world. Even Frans Timmermans, Vice President of the European Commission, made this point this week. In his accounting, at least 60pc of the people who are here are economic migrants who should not be here   are from North African states such as Morocco and Tunisia. As he told Dutch television:- These are people that you can assume have no reason to apply for refugee status. Swedish officials are coming to a similar conclusion, saying that as many as 80,000 of the mainly young men who have gone to Sweden as  refugees  in the past year alone are no such thing.Now there are the usual attempts to crowd-please from certain politicians and officials who are talking about how they might have to deport these people. But they won t, will they? Does anybody honestly believe that the Swedish authorities are currently preparing to deport 80,000 fake asylum seekers from their country?Or let us assume that the 60pc figure is correct for Germany and that 60pc of the people who have arrived in Germany in the past year alone should not be there. Given that it has taken in more than a million people in the last twelve months, is Germany now going to deport as many as three quarters of a million fake asylum seekers from its territory? Of course not. They will not even attempt it. Everybody in Europe knows that. And everybody following events and weighing up their chances from outside Europe knows that.Everybody on earth now knows that Europe s present leaders lack either the will or the means to enforce their own laws. So more people will come next year, and the year after that and the year after that. All in the knowledge that once you re in, you re in. If the facts were otherwise then Sweden, Germany and other countries across the continent would currently be preparing to ship hundreds of thousands of people out of Europe and back to their countries of origin. But they re not.And so the numbers coming in will increase, and the politicians will keep posing, and the European peoples will rightly get more and more enraged at the fact that their continent is being taken away from them. Eventually perhaps even the constant bogeyman warnings about the  far-right  will lose their capacity to scare. Not good times ahead, I d say.

 Anderson Cooper Just Smacked Kellyanne Conway Around For A Half Hour Straight (VIDEO),"Wednesday evening, Trump surrogate Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNN to do her favorite thing in the world: spew utter nonsense.Accusing CNN of peddling fake news and covering unsubstantiated claims about her lord and master and Russian hooker pee (unlike Buzzfeed, CNN withheld information that was not 100% definitively proven), Conway went on the attack   but Anderson Cooper just wasn t going to tolerate any of her bullshit. Cooper asked Conway if she would be willing to state  here and now  that the Trump camp s press secretary Sean Spicer had lied when he falsely claimed that CNN had also reported the  hooker pee  story. Our press secretary Sean Spicer was absolutely correct and so was our president-elect,  Conway said. Trump himself had refused a question from CNN earlier in the evening, childishly calling them  fake news. You can t say you re not reporting it if it s on your website!  Conway screeched at Cooper, who demanded to know what was inaccurate about CNN s report. Conway, of course, responded by attacking President Obama for allegedly failing to do enough to stop hacking. I know you like to pivot,  Cooper said as Conway melted down. That s actually real news! That actually happened!  Conway sputtered. I guess what you still have not answered,  Cooper said, trying get a word in edgewise as Trump s bleached moron continued babbling that if CNN links to the Buzzfeed report   which did happen and is news, contrary to her belief   they are reporting it 100% as fact, something Buzzfeed did not even do, as is evidenced by their multiple statements that not everything in the report CNN chose to withhold parts of is verified yet.Cooper asks again: What is inaccurate in our reporting? Because you said, you weren t in the briefing. You don t know if what we re reporting is true or not. You weren t in the briefing and I guess you haven t heard anything about what was in the briefing from anyone who was there How can you say it s not true? Conway spent the rest of the interview screaming that the media   especially CNN, is completely unfair to Trump because they won t ignore everything else that is going on to do fluff pieces about what is going to be in Trump s inaugural address and generally going the one thing she does best (looking like an imbecile). All the while, Cooper was clearly doing his best not to inform her that she needs to check her battery levels because she appears to be malfunctioning.Watching Cooper somehow make it through this interview without screaming a string of profanities at a person who is clearly too stupid to be around bubble wrap unsupervised   Anderson Cooper, you re a true hero.

TARGET STORES TO REMOVE GENDER LABELS FROM KIDS DEPARTMENTS,"The LGBT Mafia and PC Police doing what they do best shaming Americans and businesses into conformity. Does anyone have the courage or fortitude to fight back, or are we just going to allow these PC thugs to strip our children of the genders God clearly assigned to each of us? Target Corp. is removing gender labels from most of its children s departments after customers complained about signs designating certain toys for girls.The kids  bedding section will no longer feature boy and girl signage, and the toy department will be without labels and pink or blue paper on the shelves, Minneapolis-based Target said on its website Friday. Gender labels will remain in the kids  clothing section because of sizing and fit differences.Retailers have been moving away from gender stereotypes, and some startups have emerged to break down the divide in kids  clothing and toys. The signage that sparked the dispute at Target was for building sets, like GoldieBlox, that are targeted at girls.  As guests have pointed out, in some departments like toys, home or entertainment, suggesting products by gender is unnecessary,  Target said.  We heard you, and we agree. Right now, our teams are working across the store to identify areas where we can phase out gender-based signage to help strike a better balance. In June, Ohio mom Abi Bechtel called out Target s gender designations in its toy aisle. She posted a photo to Twitter that showed store signs for  Girls  Building Sets  next to regular  Building Sets.  The outcry was swift, with angry shoppers calling for change. It stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default, normal option and girls and women as the specialized option,  Bechtel told CNN at the time.Via: Bloomberg",politics,"Aug 8, 2015"
BRAZILE’S BOMBSHELL BOOK Exposes How The Media And Democrat Party Hid Hillary’s Serious Illness,"Silly, silly Donna Brazile. She s publishing a book detailing turmoil in the Democratic Party during the 2016 campaign, highlighted by her concern that Hillary Clinton was seriously ill and might need to be replaced by Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders.Was the Democrat Party setting up Joe Biden to replace Hillary when she accompanied him to his hometown in Scranton, PA? The media completely ignored Hillary s inability to walk or stand unassisted in front of, and inside Joe s childhood home, that was all caught on this incredible, but mostly hidden video. In the video below, Hillary can be seen using the arm of the homeowner for support while reaching for the railing next to the stairs to stabilize herself. She can be seen repeatedly grasping for the railing outside, and then later on, when Hillary s inside the home, she seems unable to stand on her own, as she grasps for the backs of chairs and the kitchen table.Watch:Earlier in the day, Vice President Joe Biden was forced to help the seriously ill Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton down from the podium where she spoke at a small rally.What s the big deal? There s no news here because all this was well-known and covered at the time by the big national newspapers and networks, right?Wrong. If Brazile were rehashing things we knew, there would be no book and no bombshell headlines now.Instead, she has thrown open a new and very big window on 2016   and exposed yet again the consequences of the political biases of the Democratic media.The missed stories are not merely the result of mistakes or sloppy reporting. Brazile s book is a revelation in that it shows that many left-leaning journalists didn t so much cover Clinton as cover up for her.Put it this way: How is it possible that the leader of the Democratic Party was talking to colleagues about trying to replace its nominee during the general election because of health concerns, and none of the thousands of journalists covering the campaign got wind of it?It s not possible   if the media had been playing it down the middle and holding both candidates to the same standard of scrutiny. But big media missed a big story because so much campaign  news  coverage was tilted toward defeating Donald Trump and electing Clinton.Anything that could possibly suggest Trump was unfit for the Oval Office   bingo, front page, top of the broadcast.On the other hand, anything that could hurt Clinton was downplayed or ignored. Nothing to see here, move along.The coverage of Clinton s health was a prime example of the tilt. Her coughing fits, especially a long one on Labor Day, and a history of falling were pointed out by the popular Drudge Report, some Republicans and smaller, conservative-leaning sites to suggest she was not being honest about her health.But her campaign always denied anything was wrong   allergies, the candidate, and her flacks insisted, caused the persistent coughs, and major news organizations mostly nodded their heads and stayed mum, accepting the official denials without skepticism.The dam cracked a bit on Labor Day, when an NBC reporter filed a 91-word, four-paragraph story that said Clinton had been unable to finish her speech in Ohio because of a coughing fit.The truth was dangerous, so the Praetorian Guard sprang to Clinton s defense. The NBC reporter, Andrew Rafferty, was mocked and insulted, first by the campaign, and then by journalists, including some MSNBC commentators who turned on their colleague as if he had violated a secret oath.CNN joined the Clinton amen chorus, and at the Washington Post, political writer Chris Cillizza denounced the topic of Clinton s health as  a totally ridiculous issue  and declared it a  sure-fire loser  for Trump. It s hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill,  insisted Cillizza, who is now at CNN.Five days later, Clinton was unable to walk on her own and collapsed at the 9/11 ceremony in Manhattan as she tried to get into a van. The campaign insisted she was just  dehydrated  until a short video of the incident aired, then admitted the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier.In other words, the claim of allergies was a big fat lie. That prompted Brazile to contemplate starting the process of replacing Clinton, writing in her book that the campaign also was  anemic  and had  the odor of failure.  She says she considered numerous tickets to replace Clinton and Sen. Tim Kane, and decided that Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) would be the best.It s not clear how long she deliberated or how many people she talked to, but Brazile writes that Biden called her on Sept. 12. In the end, she says, she made no move because she couldn t disappoint Clinton s supporters.For entire story: NYP",politics,"Nov 8, 2017"

"MEDIA OBSESSES OVER Ted Cruz’s Alleged Infidelities, While Ignoring HILLARY’S LESBIAN AFFAIRS Revealed By Same Publication","Why is there so much secrecy when it comes to the mainstream media and the alleged lesbian relationship between Hillary and her aide of 20 years, Huma Abedin? ABC News admits that the allegations against Ted Cruz have not been confirmed by them. But what the hell, why not do a story on it anyhow and see if they can make the sleazy image of a cheating Ted Cruz stick ABC News   At a news conference while campaigning in Wisconsin today, Ted Cruz denied a recently released National Enquirer report that claims  political operatives  are looking into rumors that Cruz had multiple marital infidelities.Cruz blamed the report on Donald Trump and his  henchmen  and gave Trump a new nickname of  Sleazy Donald. Let me be clear this National Enquirer story is garbage,  Cruz said today.  It is complete and utter lies. It is a tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen. Cruz has been in a war of words with Trump over tweets Trump had been sending. Trump tweeted Tuesday he would  spill the beans  about Cruz s wife without providing further information and retweeted Wednesday a split photo of Heidi and his wife Melania Trump, with the text:  No need to  spill the beans.  The images are worth a thousand words. The National Enquirer allegations have not been confirmed by ABC News.Meanwhile, we can t find any reports from the same outlets who eagerly reported on Ted Cruz s alleged affairs that also picked up the National Enquirer story about the lesbian affair between Hillary Clinton and her aide of 20 years, Huma Abedin:Hillary Clinton isn t just caught in a political scandal over her missing emails from her stint as secretary of state   she s also terrified of personal revelations about a secret lesbian lifestyle!Now a world-exclusive investigation by The National ENQUIRER reveals that some of the presidential candidate s famously  deleted  emails are packed full of lesbian references and her lovers  names. I don t think she s so concerned about emails referring to her as secretly gay,  said a Clinton insider.  That s been out for years   her real fear is that the names of some of her lovers would be made public! The ENQUIRER learned the list of Hillary s lesbian lovers includes a beauty in her early 30s who has often traveled with Hillary; a popular TV and movie star; the daughter of a top government official; and a stunning model who got a career boost after allegedly sleeping with Hillary. Hillary made the huge mistake of mixing public and private messages while using her personalized email server   before risking a massive scandal by refusing to make the documents public. That s clearly why she went to the extraordinary step of deleting everything,  the high-ranking source told The ENQUIRER.[quote_box_center]Ronald Kessler, who wrote  The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents,  writes in The Daily Mail that Abedin was at times dismissive of reasonable orders from agents and at other times treated them like her personal servants.While agents are not supposed to carry luggage, they will do so as a courtesy if they like a female protectee, such as Lynne Cheney or Rosalynn Carter.But with Abedin,  the agents were just like,  Hey, you re going to be like that? Well, you get your own luggage to the car. Oh, and by the way, you can carry the first lady s luggage to the car, too. She d have four bags, and we d stand there and watch her and say,  Oh, can we hold the door open for you?  . . .. . . There s not an agent in the service who wants to be in Hillary s detail,  a current agent says.  If agents get the nod to go to her detail, that s considered a form of punishment among the agents. She s hard to work around, she s known to snap at agents and yell at agents and dress them down to their faces, and they just have to be humble and say,  Yes ma am,  and walk away. [/quote_box_center]Hillary is particularly concerned about intimate emails to longtime aide Huma Abedin   who married U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner in a ceremony that many ridiculed as a political arrangement. Anthony later resigned over extramarital sexting scandals, after porn star Sydney Leathers said that she believed he was in an open marriage. I think a lot of the time when we were speaking, Huma was probably with Hillary,  she charged, at the time.One exchange between the women had Hillary mistakenly responding to political correspondence with an email that seemed to be about decorating.Added the insider:  That makes you wonder if any sensitive information was sent to her romantic partners! The scandal unraveled in March, when Hillary revealed she deleted over 30,000 emails, insisting the messages were just  things you typically find in inboxes.

WHY DID OBAMA APPROVE $418 Million Sale Of U.S. Weapons To Kenya On His Last Day In Office…And Why Was The Contract Awarded To A Firm Who Never Produced One Of These Planes?,"A group of lawmakers is planning to request a congressional investigation of a $418 million U.S. weapons sale to Kenya approved by the Obama administration on its last day in office. The sale, approved by the State Department and privately notified to Congress on January 19, would allow Kenya to buy 14 weaponized crop-duster-like planes   including two trainer planes and services, for missions against terrorist group al-Shabaab.The deal was publicly announced the Monday after Trump s inauguration.A handful of lawmakers, led by Rep. Ted Budd (R-NC), are questioning why the contract to produce the planes was awarded to major defense firm L3 Technologies   which has never produced such a plane   while a smaller, disabled veteran-owned company in North Carolina that already make those planes at a lower cost was not considered.The L3 contract would primarily benefit its Platform Integration Division in Waco, Texas. An L3 spokesman did not respond to a phone call asking for comment.Budd said the current deal is not a good one for the Kenyans either. He met with the Kenyan Deputy Chief of Mission last Monday, who was allegedly  flabbergasted  they were potentially paying almost $200 million more than necessary.

Steve Stockman s Twitter handle is @SteveWorks4You but apparently he works for himself. Stockman, who served who served two stints in the U.S. House of Representatives, spent part of Friday in federal court after being brought in on charges of violating federal election law during his last term in office. The former tea party Congressman was brought into court shackled and handcuffed, KPRC reports.Stockman is accused of conspiring to violate federal election laws during his last term in office   a felony that could send him to federal prison if he s convicted. Judge Stephen Smith set the bail at $25,000.Prosecutors alleged as Stockmen stood before the judge that the former tea party Congressman had conspired with two former employees to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to his personal use.The complaint states that in 2011 Stockman set up a non-profit called Life Without Limits in Las Vegas. After a single contributor donated $350,000 to the charity, Stockman then allegedly funneled back to himself through donations made by his employees.Stockman is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump s. In 2016 he tweeted the following:I served on thewhitewater investigation in the 90's. Anybody in the phone book would b better & more honest than a Clinton. @RealJamesWoods  Steve Stockman (@SteveWorks4You) May 7, 2016And today, Stockman was in handcuffs.KPRC reports:When Stockman was told he would need to have an attorney by 2 p.m Friday, he said  I ll have to hustle with that. Smith responded  Yeah, you will. These are serious charges. In 2013, it was revealed that Stockman s 2011 and 2012 income was listed as $350,000 in salary and fees from an entity called  Presidential Trust Marketing.  No one knows just what Presidential Trust Marketing is or does, though. The loud-mouthed, attention-seeking former Congressman, also an accountant, failed to make federally required disclosures about business affiliations that stretch from Texas to the British Virgin Islands. We don t know if that relates to the charges today, but it s odd that Stockman keeps mishandling the same amount of money: $350,000.Stockman left Congress after a failed primary challenge against Sen. John Cornyn in 2014 after serving two terms.Photo: Gage Skidmore via Flickr, allowable under Creative Commons license",News,"March 17, 2017"

 The Strange Reason Donald Trump’s Skin Has Gone From Normal To Orange,"Generally, it s considered rather unprofessional to comment on someone s looks rather than their actions or words, but it s hard not to notice one very strange and unusual occurrence. Throughout the decades, Donald Trump skin pallor has turned from the normal white guy shade of beige to a color which is best represented by a pumpkin.Now, the rings around his eyes pretty much prove that Trump either spends time in tanning beds or he is a fan of fake spray tans, either of which would involve tiny goggles. Well, according to a Mother Jones expose, it could be either, but that s not the news. The news is why Trump seems to be such a fan of fake tans and it gives you a glimpse into the type of cronyism we could expect if Trump were to become president.Trump is good friends with an Indiana businessman named Steve Hilbert. In 2006, Hilbert became the CEO of New Sunshine, a company that makes tanning beds, spray tanning booths, tanning lotions, and bronzers.Trump and Hilbert have a lot in common. They are the same age. They are both rich. They both change wives about as often as Trump supporters change underwear (sorry) and they both have hideous, garish taste in decorating. Hilbert, when he was an insurance CEO, was one of the country s highest paid and he even helicoptered to work   a whole two miles.The businessman reportedly met his sixth and current wife in the early 1990s, when she jumped topless out of a cake at a party for one of his stepsons. The cake story may be apocryphal, but Tomisue Hilbert, who is the same age as Melania, was indeed a 23-year-old topless dancer and a single mother when she married Steve.The Hilberts once lived in a three-story, 23,000 square-foot faux-French mansion dubbed Le Chateau Renaissance, which was located on a 33-acre compound outside Indianapolis that included a 15,000-square-foot  sports barn  with a full-size reproduction of the Indiana University basketball court. The mansion, once valued at $25 million, featured Trumpesque gold-plated bathroom fixtures and French crystal chandeliers. Hand-painted murals adorned a dome above the entryway, including one depicting a toga-clad Steve Hilbert as an ancient deity.The men had been friends for nearly 20 years when they entered into a business deal together. They bought the General Motors Building in Manhattan for $800 million. Hilbert put up far more money than Trump did ($200 million vs. $11 million plus there was a third partner) but somehow, Trump received a 50 percent interest in the building. He also put his name on the building.The two men, along with their wives du jour, also socialize together. They stay in each other s vacation homes. They attend each other s multiple weddings.After a disastrous departure from his company, Conseco, Hilbert started the tanning business. While Mother Jones doesn t know for sure that Trump uses his products, they do say this:This is also around the time that Trump started to turn orange. Did the Hilberts get Trump into tanning? Does he use New Sunshine spray tans or tanning bed bronzers? (Reviewers have suggested that turning orange a  rich shade of burnt orange,  in the words of one can be a distinct side effect of using such products.) The Trump campaign did not respond to questions about whether Trump used New Sunshine tanning products. Questions sent by email and FedEx to Hilbert s Indiana home went unanswered. It s clear, though, that Trump is familiar with New Sunshine s wares. He promoted the company s tanning products on The Celebrity Apprentice in two episodes.There s more to the story, which includes some pretty shady business deals, but at least we might now know why Trump is that awful shade of orange.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2016"
OBAMA’S OPEN BORDER POLICY COMES WITH SERIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY CONSEQUENCES: Iraqi Military Trainer Caught Crossing US-Mexico Border,"This is just one we caught crossing the border. What about the thousands we haven t caught or that we haven t heard about? Nothing to see here Breitbart Texas exclusively obtained leaked information on the Iraqi man who was apprehended while illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas on February 12, 2015.The Border Patrol agent responsible for interviewing the subject initially expressed concerns that the Iraqi was sent by Russia, largely due to the Iraqi man s history as a military trainer, his speaking several languages, including Russian, and his having lived in Crimea, according to one of the leaked documents. Breitbart Texas was provided with two documents by a federal agent who works under the umbrella of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The agent insisted on remaining anonymous.The Iraqi man is named Ahmed Adnan Taha, Al Khafaji. His date of birth is 6-25-84. He has one sister in the U.S., one in Turkey, three brothers in Turkey, one in Ukraine, one in New York State, and three brothers in Iraq, according to the leaked documents.The Iraqi told U.S. authorities that he spoke fluent Russian and lived in Crimea prior to the Russian invasion. He further stated that a Ukrainian paid $4,000 for him to get to the U.S., however, the Iraqi refused to identify the Ukrainian to U.S. authorities.The public statement given by Border Patrol at the time of the Iraqi s apprehension stated,  On Thursday, February 12, 2015, RGV Border Patrol Agents encountered an adult Middle Eastern male south of Pharr, Texas. The subject was taken into custody and transported to the Border Patrol station for further processing. The subject was setup for Expedited Removal back to his country of origin and transferred to the custody of ICE/ERO. Breitbart Texas recently asked the Border Patrol agency about the specifics in this report and their spokesman for the Rio Grande Valley Sector (RGV) responded,  All record checks were conducted, our federal partners did interview the subject with no derogatory information being found. It is significant to note that Border Patrol processing an individual does not mean that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actually deported the individual.Breitbart Texas provides images of both leaked documents below. The second document contains copy-and-pasted information from the official report, according to the federal agent who provided the information. The typos in the report were contained in the original and therefore included. Breitbart Texas redacted the TECS ID number.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Apr 7, 2015"
"BUSTED: The Oh So Objective ABC News Chief Anchor, George Stephanopoulous Made Huge Donation To Clinton Foundation","Just like Hillary Stephanopoulos claims it was an  honest mistake  not to disclose his donations to the corrupt Clinton slush fund ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos has given $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in recent years, charitable contributions that he did not publicly disclose while reporting on the Clintons or their non-profit organization, the On Media blog has learned.In both 2013 and 2014, Stephanopoulos made a $25,000 donation to the 501 nonprofit founded by former president Bill Clinton, the Foundation s records show. Stephanopoulos never disclosed this information to viewers, even when interviewing author Peter Schweizer last month about his book  Clinton Cash,  which alleges that donations to the Foundation may have influenced some of Hillary Clinton s actions as Secretary of State.In a statement to the On Media blog on Thursday, Stephanopoulos apologized and said that he should have disclosed the donations to ABC News and its viewers.Watch George discuss the problem with donations to the Clinton Foundation on the Daily Show with John Stewart, and how it might make people question if donations to the Foundation could be seen as  pernicious : I made charitable donations to the Foundation in support of the work they re doing on global AIDS prevention and deforestation, causes I care about deeply,  he said.  I thought that my contributions were a matter of public record. However, in hindsight, I should have taken the extra step of personally disclosing my donations to my employer and to the viewers on air during the recent news stories about the Foundation. I apologize. Stephanopoulos is the chief anchor and chief political correspondent for ABC News, as well as the co-anchor of ABC s  Good Morning America  and host of  This Week,  its Sunday morning public affairs program. Prior to joining ABC News, he served as communications director and senior advisor for policy and strategy to President Clinton. He also served as communications director on Bill Clinton s 1992 presidential campaign.In its own statement on Thursday, ABC News said it was standing behind its star anchor. As George has said, he made charitable donations to the Foundation to support a cause he cares about deeply and believed his contributions were a matter of public record,  the network s statement read.  He should have taken the extra step to notify us and our viewers during the recent news reports about the Foundation. He s admitted to an honest mistake and apologized for that omission. We stand behind him. ABC News later told the On Media blog that it would not take any punitive action against Stephanopoulos:  We accept his apology,  a spokesperson said.  It was an honest mistake. Sources with knowledge of Stephanopoulos  charitable giving said he gives to dozens of charities Stephanopoulosevery year and that the total sum of these annual contributions is in the millions of dollars. Those sources said that the Clinton Foundation contributions represent a very small percentage of the total.On the April 26 edition of  This Week,  Stephanopoulos interviewed Schweizer and challenged the author s assertions that Hillary Clinton may have committed a crime because there was a  troubling pattern  between donations to the Foundation and Clinton s actions as Secretary of State. We ve done investigative work here at ABC News, found no proof of any kind of direct action,  the host told Schweizer.  An independent government ethics expert, Bill Allison, of the Sunlight Foundation, wrote this. He said,  There s no smoking gun, no evidence that she changed the policy based on donations to the foundation.  No smoking gun. Later in the interview, Stephanopoulos said,  I still haven t heard any direct evidence and you just said you had no evidence that she intervened here.  He also noted that other news organizations that used Schweizer s research  haven t confirmed any evidence of any crime. Among the more notable revelations to come out of Schweizer s research is the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, a former Canadian mining company that was taken over by Russia in 2013 with U.S. government approval. Between 2009 to 2013, Uranium One s chairman donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.Hillary Clinton has said that there is  not an inherent conflict of interest  between the Foundation donations and her decisions at the State Department. Her campaign has consistently dismissed the accusations as partisan attacks.Via: Politico",politics,"May 14, 2015"

WHY IS OBAMA DISARMING COPS IN AMERICA At Same Time Terror Threat Is Being Raised?,"In the face of mounting threats of terrorism and civil unrest in U.S. cities, President Barack Obama is arbitrarily prohibiting local police and sheriff departments from obtaining military surplus equipment from the Defense Department as part of what many law enforcement officers are calling his war on police.Beginning on Monday, Obama visited a number of high-crime areas   especially those with large black populations   to explain the need for his unilateral action, according to news sources on Monday.President Obama s spokespeople said Monday that the administration will no longer give local cops some types of protective gear and vehicles while putting stricter controls on other weapons and equipment distributed to law enforcement. The details were released prior to Obama s visit to Camden, News Jersey, Monday afternoon to give a speech on how he will address police officers allegedly using racist tactics based on racist departmental policies.Obama and his supporters view police wearing protective riot gear and using armored vehicles as being overly-aggressive in neighborhoods that are predominately black and Hispanic. The President even accused some departments of issuing bayonets, which is demonstrably untrue, according to one police officer who claims she voted for Obama in 2008.  This President actually shows his dislike for local cops. I believe he wants to federalize policing and do away with local and state law enforcement. While the constitution prohibits that, when was the last time Obama cared about what the constitution says,  said Iris Aquino, a former police detective.During Obama s speech in Camden, New Jersey, a city reputed to have the highest violent crime rate in the United States, not once did he mention the police officers who were gunned down by blacks or whites within the last few months, noted a New York City police official who has been active fighting against the anti-cop Mayor Bill de Blasio.  That s because Obama like many liberal-left ideologues believe that police officers are the primary oppressors of minorities. The fact that Obama and the  racial-division industry    which includes the likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson   keep blacks in a state of poverty in order to use their anger and resentment for their own political interests appears to escape the notice of the news media, another group that doesn t care about dead cops,  he said.Originally police officers were led to believe that Obama would continue the Pentagon s military surplus program, however a panel of his sycophants warned that there is a propensity for misuse of equipment such as armored vehicles, high-powered firearms and camouflage. But not one example of police misusing an armored vehicle has been reported.  I have not heard of one incident in which police misused an armored vehicle. These are defensive vehicles used by cops to protect themselves from gunfire, Molotov cocktails, explosives and weapons of mass destruction,  said former law enforcement commander Jack McGowan.  High-powered firearms? The police use nothing that even resembles a  powerful  firearm. And camo clothing is clothing. No one gets hurt from a shirt s design pattern,  McGowan said.Besides cutting off the flow of equipment that would have gone to local law enforcement, the Obama government considering a recall of certain equipment that was already give to local police and sheriffs departments.  I ll highlight steps all cities can take to maintain trust between the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line, and the communities they re sworn to serve and protect,  Obama said in his weekly address out Saturday.Obama believes law enforcement is a necessary evil, claim his opponents.  He s never showed local cops any respect. He also doesn t trust any agency he doesn t directly control. This is an American leader who wants to federalize the law enforcement function and he has a lot supporters who trust big government over states rights,  political strategist Michael Baker.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani s Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he believes a  war on police,  exists in America, the anti-cop attitudes are being stoked up by Obama and his minions.  After 20 years of incredible crime reduction accomplished by thousands of dedicated police officers, the public has become complacent now that they are safer,  said Safir.  They have let the anti-police pundits and talking heads convince everyone from the president to the attorney general that police are racist and brutal. Via: Examiner",Government News,"May 20, 2015"
The Court Case Against the ‘Travel Ban’ Executive Order,"21st Century Wire says The legal battle is waging on over President Trump s Executive Order Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the US when on Saturday the Department of Justice requested a lift of the stay placed on enforcement of the Executive Order. The federal appeal court denied the DoJ s request, noting the the plaintiffs should first be given an opportunity to respond. Contrary to what many media outlets are saying, this was not a case of the courts saying that the order is  unconstitutional  as the ACLU and a number of Attorney Generals are claiming, but is standard practice in appeals cases.The Duran provides some further legal analysis on this developing case below  Alexander Mercouris The DuranThe legal moves and counter-moves in the court case concerning Donald Trump s  travel ban  Executive Order may appear complicated, but in reality they follow standard practice.  Since there are some misunderstandings in reporting them I will provide a brief explanation.The federal judge in Seattle on Friday did not rule that the Executive Order is unconstitutional or illegal.  Rather he ordered a temporary two week stay on the enforcement of the Executive Order until this question of its legality is decided in further argument before him in two weeks time.In doing so the judge acted fully within his powers, though as I understand it he took a different view from a different federal judge in Massachusetts who apparently refused to grant a similar stay when he was asked to do so at roughly the same time that the judge in Seattle was making his decision.The Department of Justice is appealing the stay.  It is doing so on the grounds that the Executive Order is fully legal and constitutional and needs to be brought back into force immediately in order to protect the US from potential terrorists, who might take advantage of the stay to enter the US during the two week period when it is in effect.On Saturday the Department of Justice asked the federal appeal court in San Francisco (which will hear the appeal) to lift the stay.  The federal appeal court however refused to do so, saying that the plaintiffs who applied for the stay should be given an opportunity to respond.  It gave the plaintiffs until Sunday (ie. today) to file their objections to the Department of Justice s application to lift the stay, with the Department of Justice instructed to file its counter-objections on Monday (ie. tomorrow).Contrary to some media claims, this is completely standard practice during appeals.  It would be very unusual for an appeal court to set aside a judge s order   even a temporary order   without a full hearing, and the Department of Justice will undoubtedly have known this when it applied to the appeal court to have the stay lifted on Saturday.The reason the Department of Justice made the application on Saturday is because it wants to emphasise to the appeal court the urgency of the situation.  This is important, not just because of the danger of terrorists entering the US during the period of the stay, but because unless the appeal court is convinced of the urgency of the situation it will simply say that the Department of Justice should wait until the hearing ordered by the federal judge in Seattle in two weeks time.In other words by insisting that the stay be lifted immediately the Department of Justice is providing reasons to the appeal court to take the case out of the federal judge s hands, so that it can decide the case itself.  That was the true purpose of the application on Saturday, and it succeeded.I expect the appeal court in San Francisco to decide the appeal this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday.As I am not an expert in US constitutional law I do not know what the outcome of the appeal will be.  I should say that it would be completely wrong to try to guess the outcome from the decision the appeal court took on Saturday.The appeal will be purely on the question of the rightness or otherwise of the stay.  If the appeal decision goes against the President it will be for the Department of Justice to put his case to the federal judge at the full hearing in two weeks time.  If that decision also goes against the President, he can appeal again to the federal appeal court in San Francisco, and beyond that to the Supreme Court.By contrast if the Department of Justice wins the appeal this week then I would expect the plaintiffs to drop the case in Seattle and try to go directly to the Supreme Court.  Since the appeal court would have effectively affirmed the legality of the Executive Order, there would be little point in the plaintiffs continuing to contest the Executive Order before the federal judge in Seattle Continue this report at The DuranREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"February 6, 2017"
 Black Chicago Teen Calls Cops 3 times For Help Before They Execute Him (VIDEO),"People always wonder why black people are so reluctant to call the police for help, but here is yet another example in a long line that demonstrates just why we are so wary of law enforcement, even when we are the victims.19-year-old Chicago resident Quintonio LeGrier called 911 three times in an emergency, only to have dispatchers hang up on him. When police arrived, as happens in so many of these cases, he was fatally shot by the very people charged with serving and protecting him. From The Root:According to ABC News, audio of the 19-year-old s 911 calls made Dec. 26 were released late Monday by Chicago s Independent Police Review Authority, which is investigating both LeGrier s death and the death of his neighbor Bettie Jones. Jones, 55, was also shot and killed by police after she opened their apartment building door to let police in.Earlier that day, LeGrier called 911 asking that a police officer be sent to his address. The first call was made at 4:18 a.m., and the last call was made three minutes later. There s an emergency, can you send an officer?  LeGrier can be heard saying on one of the calls.During one call, LeGrier didn t respond to the 911 operator s questions and the dispatcher hung up on the teen, ABC reports.However, instead of providing assistance, the cops came, after Quintonio s father, Antonio LeGrier, told a 911 operator, My son has freaked out. I need an officer. When the supposed  help  arrived, the child was shot dead. Police, of course, are covering their asses. The statement they released regarding the incident reads: Upon arrival, officers were confronted by a combative subject resulting in the discharging of the officer s weapon, fatally wounding two individuals. Quintonio LeGrier was not the only person the cops murdered that night. A woman named Bettie Jones, a 55-year-old mother with five children, was also executed.This is why black people do not trust the police. I don t care what kind of trouble I am in, they are the last people I d call for help   because said  help  just might cost me my life.Watch a video news report on the incident below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"January 27, 2016"

It also asks if they have had oral or anal sex and if they have performed such acts with up to six people.Whether or not they have carried a gun, smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol and how much also appear on the questionnaire, as well as whether they have taken drugs, such as OxyContin, Percocet, and Vicodin. It asks how often their guardian uses a seat belt, if the youngster has a sexually transmitted disease, and where they sleep.The group MassResistance says the survey is  psychologically distorting  and will lead the child to think he is  abnormal if he is not doing it all.  The group stated that  having children reveal personal issues about themselves and their family can have emotional consequences.  They also complain that  the survey results are used by radical groups from Planned Parenthood to LGBT groups to persuade politicians to give more taxpayer money [to] these groups. Though students fill out the survey anonymously, MassResistance warns that  they are administered by the teacher in the classroom and there is often pressure for all kids to participate. The test is given nationally and not without controversy. The Chicago Tribune reported two years ago that a Chicago teacher was reprimanded for telling students they had a  constitutional right  not to fill out the survey.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"May 6, 2015"
 WATCH: Fox News Host DEFENDS Slavery In Bizarre Rant,"Fox News  most popular prime time host, Bill O Reilly, responded to First Lady Michelle Obama s speech at the 2016 Democratic Convention and ended up defending the practice of slavery.Responding to Mrs. Obama s comment during her address that she lived in a White House  built by slaves,  O Reilly referred to himself as a  history teacher  and argued that the slaves who worked on the White House were  well fed  and  had decent lodgings provided by the government. O Reilly also said in his commentary,  Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House, but there were others working as well. In the day after Obama s speech, other conservatives amazingly criticized the First Lady, trying to play  gotcha  on her remarks   which were actually a positive statement about America, pointing out the progress from slavery to a black First Family.The fact-checking site Politifact even had to release a report in response to these conservative complaints, including some who said the building was not worked on by slaves. They rated the First Lady s speech as  True. Journalist Jesse J. Holland also discussed the role of slaves in building the White House in his 2016 book, The Invisibles: The Untold Story of African American Slaves in the White House. With the invention of steam shovels still several years away, these slaves dug for the clay on site with hand shovels, working day and night to get the raw material to the skilled brick makers and at the same time, opening up ground on the site for the space that would become the White House s foundation and cellar,  Holland wrote. The identity of these slaves and where they came from has been lost, he wrote.Obama s statement is  true,  Holland told PolitiFact.The Obamas have driven the conservative movement crazy. No matter what they are for, the right finds a way to support the opposite. Even the indefensible.Featured image via screen capture",News,"July 26, 2016"

 Dem Challenger To Paul Ryan Has Raised A Massive Amount Of Money In The Last 24 hours,"Randy Bryce, known as @IronStache on Twitter, launched a campaign to oust Paul Ryan from Wisconsin s 1st District. Bryce is a union ironworker who has been campaigning for all of one day, and he s already raised $100,000. That is a lot for a new face who s a Democrat living in Republican-land and running in a district that s gone to Paul Ryan every two years since 1999.Bryce isn t just a union ironworker in Republican-land, Wisconsin, though. He s an Army veteran who enlisted right after high school, and then worked his way up to being an ironworker through apprenticeship. His mother suffers from multiple sclerosis, his father is in an assisted living facility, and Randy himself is a cancer survivor. He s campaigning primarily on healthcare right now, and he says on his website: What Paul Ryan and the Republicans are doing to take health care away from millions of us, to make it cost more and cover less, and to allow the protections we ve gained to be stripped away   it s just unacceptable. Bryce has an uphill battle to fight. Ryan is very well-connected both in the 1st District and across America. However, Bryce will work to tie Ryan to Donald Trump as much as possible, working off Democrats  hopes that the Trump effect will help flip Congress next year.But it may not be that terrible a climg. Paul Ryan is already wildly unpopular around the country, with an approval rating below 30 percent. That could very well pull down his popularity in his own district. He s also starting to get a reputation for making every excuse in the book for Trump. Regarding obstruction of justice, Ryan lamely claimed that Trump is new and doesn t know what s appropriate and what s not when it comes to interacting with various agency heads, particularly those in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Ryan gave him a pass as though he s a little child navigating his way through the world for the first time.He s also confident that Trump will approve of the massively unpopular GOP healthcare bill whatever form that ends up taking and once again blasted the ACA while claiming that their bill is ever so much better.Ryan is almost inextricably linked to Trump right now, and as Trump s base shrinks, so will Ryan s. What Bryce is doing and clearly, what many are hoping he can do is taking advantage of the possibility that a hole will open up in the 1st District because of Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 21, 2017"
" Chuck Todd Goes Off On Trump, Says What Every American Is Thinking Right Now (VIDEO)","It s only been a few days since Donald Trump as been back from his second international tour, but America is already sick of him. Over the past week or so, Trump and his corrupt inner circle have been in the news nonstop for their unethical behavior revolving around Russia.If America is sick of reading about it, reporters must be sick of talking about it   and this was evident when Chuck Todd went off on Trump on Friday during MTP Daily. Todd did not hold back as unleashed an attack for several minutes, brutally mocking the Trump administration for the never-ending avalanche of bad news surrounding Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Blasting the White House for trying to hide parts of the story, Todd said: Their responses this week have proven to be incomplete at best and untrue at worst. Todd was referring to a breaking report by NBC news, in which an additional unknown person   former Soviet counterintelligence officer Ranit Akhmetshin, was found to also have been in attendance during the now infamous meeting with the Russian lawyer. To make his point even more powerful, Todd ran several clips from the past few days that blatantly showed White House officials lying and denying that they were hiding any information. It was a brilliant segment, and Todd perfectly showed America why Trump and his minions cannot be trusted. In conclusion, Todd said: Folks, this week has been a giant PR, political, and possibly legal disaster for this administration.

"YES, Obama CAN Appoint A Supreme Court Justice Before He Leaves…But Will He?","The President who has thumbed his nose at our US Constitution, and clearly has no respect for our rule of law, has the ability to appoint a Supreme Court Justice before he vacates the White House, but will he? In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times",left-news,"Jan 2, 2017"
CLASSLESS REP WILSON: Trump Will Claim “Somebody’s Trying to Kill Barron” and Resign,"Rep. Frederica Wilson spoke on Thursday at the annual Legislative Policy Conference organized by Al Sharpton s National Action Network (NAN) in DC. The NAN Twitter feed is full of delusional Democrats spewing far left policy: NAN Twitter. Wilson got the conference crowd all excited when she predicted that President Donald Trump will eventually resign from office to avoid impeachment by making up an excuse. She made the outrageous suggestion that President Trump would say that, somebody is trying to kill Barron The audio below is from the speech: We just have to, like the slogan says, stay woke; just stay woke, be careful, because I can see the wheels turning now we re marching toward impeachment, there s no question about it. If that happens, are we prepared? Because it s going to happen, A portion of her speech is on twitter.

And I think he is going to come up with an excuse like  somebody is trying to kill Barron, and so I m going to resign. Via: PJ Media",politics,"Nov 4, 2017"
 Alabama GOP Gov. Embroiled In Sex Scandal Allegations (NSFW AUDIO),"Another day, another GOP  family values  politician facing a potential sex scandal. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley (R- Of Course) has been accused of having an affair with a woman he describes as his  closest aide.  He has, however conceded that he did have conversations of a sexual nature with his Senior Political adviser, a woman by the name of Rebekah Mason. When news of the scandal broke via a leaked tape Bentley, of course, went into damage control mode and is pretending to be remorseful: Since that time I have apologized to members of my family, to Mrs. Mason and her family and I apologized then for any conversations and behavior then that was inappropriate. Today I want to apologize to the people of the state of Alabama and once again I want to apologize to my family. I am truly sorry and I accept full responsibility. Bentley then went on to re enforce the point that there was no  physical affair  with Mason: I want everyone to know though that I have never had a physical affair with Mrs. Mason. I can assure the people of Alabama I have never done anything illegal. I have never asked any member of my staff or any cabinet member to lie despite what the former ALEA secretary said today. Physical affair or not, that tape was certainly scandalous enough on its own. Here is just one part of that tape: When I m standing behind you, pull you in real close, put my hands on your breasts, put my hands under you .if we gonna do what we did the other day, we re gonna have to start locking the door.  (paraphrased)Here is audio of that tape:Well, that certainly sounds like it went beyond phone sex for sure, but of course there is no way to prove it. Another piece of the scandal is even worse, because it involves the firing of Alabama Law Enforcement Secretary Spencer Collier. Apparently, there was some kind of investigation into the possibility of criminal activity while Collier was in office. Collier, however, tells a different story. He seems to believe he was fired due to his warnings to Bentley regarding the sex scandal and other internal wrongdoing. From Al.com:In denying he has done anything wrong as the state s top cop, Collier on Tuesday and again on Wednesday charged that his agency had come across evidence of an affair between Bentley and Mason, an affair Collier said he warned Bentley that could lead to criminal charges if Bentley were found to have misused state resources in carrying out the relationship.Collier also said Bentley placed him on leave a month ago and then fired him Tuesday because he refused an order by Bentley to lie about why Collier was not to provide a sworn statement to the attorney general s office involving personalities in the criminal case against House Speaker Mike Hubbard.Here is video of Collier speaking on the whole debacle:If this is true, Bentley SHOULD be charged, and Collier should be given his job back. These GOP hypocrites need to ALL be voted out of office come November. They are unfit to serve decent people everywhere.Time to resign, Gov. Bentley. You are a disgrace to the office you hold.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 25, 2016"

MATTEL Features Boy In Girly Barbie Commercial…Doing Their Part To Help Letists Blur The Gender Lines [VIDEO],"Newsflash for Mattel, and any other company who is pandering to the Left this Christmas season: God did not create Gender-Neutral beings God made man and woman to be different for a reason Don t mess with God A boy is featured in the latest Barbie commercial for the first time ever. The commercial is receiving widespread praise for upending gender barriers. The ad displays Mattel s new line of Barbie dolls created as part of a partnership with the Italian fashion house Moschino. The dolls sport outfits of black mesh and leather, with edgy golden accessories to match.However, it is not the dolls  racy clothing that steals the show, but rather, the mohawked boy playing with the dolls.  Moschino Barbie is so fierce,  he exclaims to the camera with an exaggerated head roll. This single line is garnering the Barbie boy a huge fan base worldwide.The public now accepts homosexuality and same-sex  marriage.  But the fight is not over. The offensive to reshape society in even more radical ways pushes forward.An effort is gaining ground to create a world where not just  sexual orientation,  but sex itself, is a choice. Where boys can be girls and girls can be boys, or something in between. Where people are expected to ignore the biological reality of sex so that all people coexist androgynously, or according to whatever gender suits them at the moment. Where everyone pretends that gender confusion is normal, if not desirable, and anyone who doesn t play along can be punished and silenced.This demonstrates unprecedented contempt for reality and common sense, let alone morality.Think of the implications with respect to public bathrooms, sex-segregated activities, locker rooms, college student housing and countless other areas of human interaction.Does the idea of a boy who thinks he s a girl showering next to your daughter in P.E. class make you uncomfortable? Then you d better brace yourself. This cause is winning critical legal battles and it is starting with our youth.Earlier this month, the California Senate passed a bill saying that throughout K-12 education, a student is  permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, and use facilities [e.g. bathrooms, locker rooms] consistent with his or her gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil s records.   Gender identity  is the terminology these ultrasensitive, morally sophisticated lawmakers use to refer to the sex a person happens to identify with.Last month, a governing body in Colorado ruled that a 6-year-old boy who thinks he s a girl has the right to use the girl s bathroom at his elementary school. The Colorado Division of Civil Rights said that denying him that right  creates an environment rife with harassment  and is akin to racial segregation.See where this is going? The public majority already agrees that denying same-sex couples the right to  marry  is exactly like prohibiting interracial marriage. Now, denying someone access to a public bathroom on the basis of biology is just like excluding blacks from white-only facilities.These lawmakers and officials are determined to ensure that these children grow up in a world where sex confusion is welcomed, even encouraged.What about the girl who feels awkward about having a boy walk in while she s using the bathroom? Sorry. She is the one who needs to adjust her thinking not the boy.But there is something far more sinister going on here. Mattel is not just using the ad to connect with little boys who play with Barbie dolls; it is using the ad to smash gender roles.It s no secret that society is moving away from gender-based toys for children. Target is in the process of removing gender-based signs from their toy section, and Hasbro switched to a gender-neutral Easy-Bake Oven a few years ago.The Moschino Barbie commercial is just another step in society s pursuit to radically change social expectations. But is including a boy in a Barbie ad really  progress  and  common sense,  as one news source put it? Via: The Trumpet",left-news,"Nov 27, 2015"
 WATCH: CNN Panelist HUMILIATES ‘Snowflake’ Trump For Cowardly Backing Out Of Correspondent’s Dinner,"Donald Trump is so thin-skinned that he would rather sit in the White House and pout instead of attending the White House Correspondent s Dinner.It is a tradition for the president to attend the annual White House Correspondent s Dinner. It s a chance to spend time with reporters and journalists and enjoy the entertainment of a comedian. Stephen Colbert, Craig Ferguson, Jon Stewart, and Jay Leno are just a few of the big-name comedians who have headlined the event. And presidents get the opportunity to let off some steam by delivering jokes. President Obama was particularly skilled at self-deprecating humor while also making jokes about his critics.For example, President Obama once seriously burned Donald Trump with a joke in 2011 in reference to Trump s birtherism. Now, I know that he s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,  Obama said.  And that s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter   like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac? President Obama then joked about Trump s  leadership  on Celebrity Apprentice for firing Gary Busey after a cooking contest.  These are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, sir. Well handled,  Obama said. Meanwhile, Obama had just ordered the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, which makes his appearance at the Dinner even more impressive.But Trump has decided to be a big baby and is now the first president to ever skip the event. Ronald Reagan did not attend in 1981, but he had a good excuse since he had just been shot. But he still managed to deliver some remarks via phone.I will not be attending the White House Correspondents  Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017During a discussion on CNN on Saturday, New York Times TV critic Bill Carter took Trump to the woodshed for cowardly refusing to attend. Republicans always criticize the media,  Carter said.  This has reached a point where it s over the top, actually. Any story that s critical of him now becomes  fake. Indeed, Trump has declared war on the media because they refuse to be his cheerleading squad. And I think the fact that he s bowing out of this dinner, it has a little bit of the quality of  You can t fire me, I quit.  because a lot of people are dropping out of this dinner,  Carter continued.And it s true. Trump s attacks on the media have caused many news outlets to cancel parties and refuse to go to the dinner. Now that Trump isn t going, perhaps these outlets will now reverse their decision.But Carter wasn t done yet. Carter said that Trump knows he isn t going to get a good reception from the crowd at this event, particularly in light of his claim that the media is the  enemy of the American people. In other words, Trump is literally running away because he doesn t want to be criticized. He likes to have paid applauders,  he quipped.  The whole thing would have been fraught for him. And I know there s been a lot of criticism of Democrats for being  snowflakes,  but it s sort of snowflake-y to me, to back out of this. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump knows that he won t be a very welcome guest at the dinner event, but that doesn t mean he should tuck his tail between his legs and run away. If ever there was a chance for a mea culpa with the media, this is it. Trump could apologize to the media for his unfair and un-American attacks on them and try to build a better relationship with them. But he won t because he is a petulant child who would rather throw a temper tantrum instead of doing something that makes him look like a grown-up.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 26, 2017"

It s a short cul-de-sac that runs parallel to Old House Lane.At Tuesday s board meeting, Town Administrator Jill Shapiro said the police chief had received a request for security reasons.Town Supervisor Robert Greenstein said Friday he was not positive, but assumed the request came from the Secret Service.

 Gretchen Carlson Fired From Fox News For Refusing To Sleep With Sleazeball Roger Ailes: Lawsuit,"The offices at Fox News are in what amounts to civil war after longtime host Gretchen Carlson was abruptly and without reason fired   despite her having one of the top-rated shows on the network. Adding to the chaos, she then announced she would be filing a sexual harassment lawsuit against CEO Roger Ailes for what she claimed were demands that she sleep with him or lose her job.In a statement released to the press, Carlson s lawyer detailed the shocking allegations leveled at 76-year-old Ailes:Ms. Carlson, the former co-host of  Fox & Friends,  was terminated on June 23   the very day her latest contract expired, even though her current program,  The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson,  was the leading cable news show in its afternoon time slot.Her complaint alleges that the firing was the ultimate retaliation against her after she rebuffed Mr. Ailes  sexual advances and also tried to challenge what she felt was unequal treatment of her in the newsroom by some of her male colleagues.The statement also included an alleged exchange between Ailes and Gretchen that is said to have taken place last fall when she tried to complain about workplace discrimination. I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago and then you d be good and better and I d be good and better. Sometimes problems are easier to solve  that way.Other details are even more appalling.On Twitter Carlson wrote a brief note to fans, but did not mention the lawsuit directly.As you may have heard, I'm no longer with @FoxNews. I value your support and friendship so please stay in touch: https://t.co/R7JBTsvYSh  Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) July 6, 2016Fox News, of course, is known for rampant levels of misogyny both in front of and behind the camera. According to his own kids, Bill O Reilly, the network s figurehead, is a domestic abuser with an awful temper who has himself been the subject of sexual harassment lawsuits. The network aggressively promotes blonde women and is known to focus an inordinate amount of time on their bare legs. That directive comes directly from Ailes, who once reportedly called down to the control both absolutely furious that an errant laptop was blocking the shot of one of his hosts  legs while she was reading the news. Move that damn laptop, I can t see her legs! And once told former host Catherine Crier: Be more opinionated,  he told Crier in one meeting.  The guests are there as a foil for you.  He also disagreed with her dress.  He had admiration for her legs,  a senior executive said. In one meeting, Ailes barked,  Tell Catherine I did not spend x-number of dollars on a glass desk for her to wear pant suits. Carlson s description of Ailes as a mega sleazeball also jives with what other women have reported having experienced in meetings with the CEO.Shelley Ross, a former newspaper reporter turned television producer, experienced an interview in which Ailes posed romantically suggestive questions and made flirtatious comments about her appearance.  This is making me uncomfortable,  Ross recalled telling Ailes. She had worked with [John] Huddy at The Miami Herald and he had recommended her for the Tomorrow job. In a follow-up telephone interview, she told Ailes that she would never date a boss. Ailes s reaction was, according to Ross,  Don t you know I m single? It is unclear how Ailes will respond to this latest allegation. Clearly, he s had decades worth of practice in making women feel harassed and uncomfortable. Maybe it s time karma came knocking.Featured image via Alex Wong/Newsmakers/Getty and Fox News",News,"July 6, 2016"

He left it up to the poor villagers in Kenya to figure out how to get her body back to her home country.  He also reveals how Barack has never contributed a dime to help a family member in Kenya.  Ever since President Barack Obama was elected president, many have wondered who Obama really is and what he stands for. Undisclosed and unreported to the mainstream media, Joel Gilbert, who produced the film,  Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception,  has released an interview with Obama s brother Malik Obama, the Freedom Post reported on Friday. Gilbert conducted the 12-minute interview with Malik Obama on April 10, 2015 and was published on April 22, 2015.The interview shows clips of President Obama speaking of how his father grew up and herded goats and then Gilbert told Malik that Obama had deceived Americans when Obama stated that he would cut the deficit, support Israel, and that Obamacare is not a tax and how he felt about it. Malik responded to Gilbert and said,  Well, the way that he s turned and become a different person with the family is the same way that I see him behaving politically. He says one thing and then he does another. He s not been an honest man, as far as I m concerned, in who he is and what he says and how he treats people.  Gilbert then asked Malik on how he felt about being the oldest brother in the family, Malik responded with disappointment and said,  Disappointed  disappointed, used, used and also betrayed. In the beginning, I didn t think that he was a schemer. His real character, his real personality, the real him, is coming out now. Malik also spoke on how he and Obama s family back in Kenya feel no respect from Obama and was hurt and crushed that Obama would act that way to them.  I don t understand how somebody who claims to be a relative or a brother can behave the way that he s behaving, be so cold and ruthless, and just turn his back on the people,  Malik said.  He said were his family. WATCH INTERVIEW HERE:Joel Gilbert came to the front lines of Obama really is when his book and film was released. The film and book chronicles the life of President Obama, based in part on two years of research, interviews, newly unearthed footage and photos, and the writings of alleged real father of President Obama, Frank Marshall Davis as well as Obama himself. The film and book also chronicles Barack Obama s life journey in Socialism and Marxism, from the day he was born through his election to the Presidency.Via: The Examiner",left-news,"Apr 26, 2015"

The Existential Question Of Whom To Trust,"21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980 s and has been a featured guest on Patrick Henningsen LIVE at 1100KFNX.  In this report, Robert asks due to mainstream media experts who ve fallen to  careerism , whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts. (Image   Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressing the United Nations on Feb. 5. 2003)Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe looming threat of World War III, a potential extermination event for the human species, is made more likely because the world s public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts. Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors   meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.In other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals   caught up in the many accouterments of success   don t even seem to recognize how far they ve drifted from principled professionalism.A good example was Saturday night s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods   and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.FOILS FOR TRUMPIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.Breaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying:  A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom  and adding:  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp   with much, much better people.  The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump s choice to be with the common folk.Trump s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents  Association, who complained:  We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.  That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.Perhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media   particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times   that popularized the phrase  fake news  and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.THE BLACK LISTProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government   what you should expect from reporters   became conflated with  fake news.  The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.But the mainstream media stars didn t like it when Trump began throwing the  fake news  slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason s repudiation of the  fake news  label.Yet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.Perhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system   from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations   failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the  most trusted  U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as  truth. )Not only did the supposed American  gold standard  for assessing information   the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure   fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the  professionals  who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.PROFITING FROM FAILUREIndeed, many of the main culprits remain  respected  members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times  Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous  aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges  story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times   and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.The Washington Post s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post s readers that Iraq s secret possession of WMD was a  flat-fact,  is still the Post s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.Hiatt s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as  a blowhard  and trivializing the Bush administration s destruction of his wife s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson s Niger investigation.At the end of the Post s savaging of Wilson s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper s accessory role in destroying Plame s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit   and remains a  respected  Washington media figure to this day.CAREERIST LESSONThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you re horrifically wrong   even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis   your paycheck is almost surely safe.The same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.The Bush administration called that idea an  ill-considered initiative    after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.It now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but   in so doing   they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure. By dismissing me,  Bustani said,  an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.  He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him,  genuine multilateralism  would succumb to  unilateralism in a multilateral disguise Continue this report at Consortium News READ MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"May 1, 2017"
 Bernie Sanders Hits Back At The Media In The Most Brilliant Way,"On Wednesday, The Washington Post published a harsh editorial that ripped Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for his progressive politics.The article, entitled  Bernie Sanders  Fiction-filled Campaign, said that the Vermont senator was guilty of making  fantastical claims  and peddling  his own brand of fiction to a slice of the country that eagerly wants to buy it, insulting the millions of Americans that support the anti-establishment candidate. The vicious piece ends with,  It merely proves that many progressives like being told everything they want to hear. The piece predictably gathered tons of support and backlash alike. Alternet even noted that the Post was probably somewhat biased against Sanders because its owner, Jeff Bezos, is an arch-libertarian worth $53.2 billion and has a whole host of investments in private health care. But regardless of others  defense of Sanders, the Vermont senator himself had the most brutal message of all. On Thursday morning at a Bloomberg Politics event, Sanders was asked about the piece and he didn t hold back. He absolutely ripped the Post s Editorial Board: That s not a new argument. We ve been hearing that months and months, and that s in a sense what this campaign is about. People are telling us, whether it s the Washington Post editorial board or anybody else, our ideas are too ambitious   can t happen. Too bold   really? Well, here s something which is really bold. In the last 30 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and working families of this country. The middle class has become poorer and trillions of dollars have been transferred to the top one-tenth of 1 percent Where was The Washington Post to express concern that the middle class was shrinking? Where was The Washington Post talking about this radical transformation of America? And he was just getting started. When the discussion went to foreign policy, Sanders took another opportunity to slam the media source. Sanders unloaded on the Post s previous record with the Iraq War, which had already received tons of criticism. Sanders quipped, Check out where all the geniuses on the editorial page were with regard to the invasion of Iraq. In 2014, it was discovered that the media source had published more than 140 stories aggressively promoting to war months before the invasion. That was a powerful comment from Sanders, as he had nearly stood alone in Congress when he voted against the Iraq War.Featured image is a screenshot via Comedy Central",News,"January 29, 2016"
WATCH SWAMP MONSTER James Clapper Make False Claim That Trump is an “Intelligence Asset” for Putin [Video],"Watch some fake news from a swamp creature who should be in jail:Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper referred to President Donald Trump on Monday as an intelligence  asset  for Russian President Vladimir Putin. The term  asset  refers to people with countries or organizations being spied upon who serve as resources for outside spies.Clapper appeared on CNN to discuss Trump s national security strategy speech given Monday, where he referred to Russia as a rival but also said he wanted to form a partnership.The two leaders have also expressed recent gratitude to each other, with Putin calling and thanking Trump for sharing intelligence that helped foil a terror plot and Trump thanking Putin for his recent praise of the American economy.IS THIS GUY KIDDING:This is on the same day that we learn the following about the Obama administration:The Obama administration intentionally derailed investigations into the terrorist group Hezbollah s drug trafficking operation to secure the Iran nuclear deal, according to a new bombshell report.Politico spoke with several members of Project Cassandra, a joint effort between the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Pentagon that was founded in 2008 under the Bush administration to identify and prosecute a drug trafficking, money laundering, and smuggling operation run by the Iranian-backed militants.Over the next eight years, agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations, and informants to map Hezbollah s illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies.They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United States. They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to Africa. And with the help of some key cooperating witnesses, the agents traced the conspiracy, they believed, to the innermost circle of Hezbollah and its state sponsors in Iran.Read more: WFB",left-news,"Dec 18, 2017"

John McCain and The Cancer of Conflict,"Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week some devastating news befell John Sidney McCain III.On Wednesday, his staff announced that the US Senator had been diagnosed with a brain tumor called glioblastoma discovered during recent testing at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona.Since then warm wishes and tributes have been pouring in for the former Republican Presidential candidate. Both the US media and political establishment have closed ranks and are rallying around the Senator to help soften the blow.Putting previous feuds aside, President Donald Trump was magnanimous and cordial to the Arizona Senator, wishing him and his family the very best.  Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family,  said Trump.  Get well soon. Even former electoral rival President Barack Obama pitched in a little love for the 80 year old:John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John.  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) July 20, 2017Regarding McCain s diagnosis, we all can acknowledge the difficulties and risks involved with various cancer treatments, especially with brain cancer. Likewise, nearly everyone these days can attest to losing a friend, a loved one or family member to the disease.As with anyone suffering from this terrible condition, we wish the Senator well, along with a successful treatment and recovery.Still, McCain has a lot in his favor. Unlike most Americans, he will not have to worry about his medical care, and will be receiving the best cancer treatment money can buy, if not the best in the world, and with absolutely no expense spared. In this way, the Senator is extremely fortunate.And for those reasons, this is not an easy article to write. For fear of appearing too cruel in the face of his dramatic medical disclosure, one would be expected to suspend any political critique for now. Hence, the media has placed an unofficial moratorium on any negative coverage of McCain.That said, he is a special case.  As much as any political leader   he deserves to be panned, even under the present circumstances, because his geopolitical handiwork continues to cause havoc in certain corners of the world.Cancer Treatment in SyriaImmediately after McCain s major health announcement, the US mainstream media and Republicans began fretting over the prospect that his extended absence from the legislature might jeopardize his party s ability to pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare).With that in mind, maybe it s worth asking: how many innocent Syrians have been denied basic medical treatment, supplies and pharmaceuticals as a result of the harsh US-led regime economic sanctions imposed on Syria? This brutal campaign of collective punishment has been led by US Senator John McCain.Of course, the idea of sanctions as a form of economic warfare hardly registers in the West as being at all harmful to the population of Syria.  Sanctions? They re not against the people of Syria, only against Assad.   That s the general mainstream phantasm when it comes to sanctions, even though the official numbers show a vivid tale of devastation.One can only imagine how many among Syria s population of 20 million are no longer able to receive cancer treatment in Syria as a result of McCain s insistence on punitive sanctions. Before the conflict in Syria began in 2011, citizens were able to get free medical treatment including high-end state-of-the-art cancer treatment (consider that one simple aspect of this war, as men like John McCain still claim to be delivering  freedom  to the Syrian people by backing armed terrorist factions).Before the terrorist forces occupied the eastern part of the city, Aleppo was home to one of the Middle East s top cancer treatment centers, Al-Kindi Hospital. This is important because after McCain s secret trip to the Aleppo area in May 2013, the very same  rebels  he was cavorting with and supplying weapons to   the  Free Syrian Army  (under the command of Jabbat al Nusra aka al Qaeda in Syria) would later order the bombing on this cancer treatment hospital.Professor Tim Anderson explains the destruction of Al Kindi Hospital in December 2013, including the shameful spin applied after the fact by BBC and western mainstream media:In an Orwellian revision of events the BBC (21 December 2013) reported the destruction of Al-Kindi with the headline:  Syria rebels take back strategic hospital in Aleppo . The introduction claimed the  massive suicide lorry bomb  had managed  to seize back a strategic ruined hospital occupied by Assad loyalists.  Al-Kindi was said to have been  a disused building  and  according to an unconfirmed report, 35 rebels died in the attack . In fact, these  rebels  were a coalition of Free Syrian Army and Jabhat al Nusra, while the  Assad loyalists  were the staff and security guards of a large public hospital.Watch as McCain s  freedom fighters  in Syria drive a suicide truck bomb into the ground level of Al Kindi Cancer Treatment Center in Aleppo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCwWgTUpGpE . How many Syrian lives were needlessly cut short as a direct result of that bombing carried out by McCain s own Free Syrian Army? For the cost of McCain s treatment at the world-famous Mayo Clinic, who knows how many Syrians could have received desperately needed treatment at Al Kindi or other similarly crippled facilities in Syria? One hundred, or possibly one thousand?Add to this, how many have died or suffer permanent health afflictions as a direct result of US economic sanctions which have crippled Syria s own National Health Service? One hundred thousand, or maybe five hundred thousand? One million? One day, those figures will be recorded and we will have the answer.The other piece of US legislation currently on the table which Republicans are desperate to pass is the $1-trillion US infrastructure spending package. Juxtapose that scene next to the systematic destruction of Syria s infrastructure by US Coalition and IDF airstrikes and destruction by proxy militant forces on the ground. Estimates for the cost to Syria range from $180 billion to $275 million. If the conflict continues past 2020, then these numbers could easily double.In spite of all this, John McCain claims to have no regrets about the damage that he and his fellow war hawks have inflicted on Syria.The Cancer of ConflictAt the same time that political figures like Barrack Obama dutifully respect the official Washington line on John McCain as the consummate  Vietnam War hero , very few in the establishment would dare to criticize the powerful Arizona Senator for his central role in engineering instability and violent conflict in foreign countries.John McCain sneaks into Syria illegally in May 2013 to meet with known terrorists, promising them weapons and regime change by way US bombs would drop in the Fall of 2013.. Americans should be reminded that more than any other single US official, John McCain has been the driving force behind the training and arming of violent jihadist and terrorists fighting groups in Syria, and that those same terrorists have slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children in Syria and beyond   all sacrificed at the altar of a US-led geopolitical power play in the Middle East, and in the name of Israeli  security interests. Back in 2012, a delusional McCain, along with another dotty war enthusiast, Connecticut Senator Joe Liberman, insisted that the US needed to arm the  rebels  in Syria in order to  save lives.  Their statement read: The bloodshed must be stopped, and we should rule out no option that could help to save lives. We must consider, among other actions, providing opposition groups inside Syria, both political and military, with better means to organize their activities, to care for the wounded and find safe haven, to communicate securely, to defend themselves, and to fight back against Assad s forces. From the onset of hostilities in 2011, the bold-faced lie that McCain and partner Lindsey Graham have promulgated is that violent jihadists were nothing more than affable  moderate rebels.  That piece of Washington fiction has been widely discredited by now.Later on in 2015, McCain announced that the US should be supplying stinger missiles to the so-called  rebels  in Syria: We certainly did that in Afghanistan. After the Russians invaded Afghanistan, we provided them with surface-to-air capability. It d be nice to give people that we train and equip and send them to fight the ability to defend themselves. That s one of the fundamental principles of warfare as I understand it,  said McCain.Soon after that statement, thousands of US-made TOW Missiles were smuggled into Syria and used by terrorists groups under the command umbrella of Al Nusra.In her recent expos  for Trud Newspaper, Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva revealed the massive scale and scope of the illegal US-NATO weapons trafficking operation to arm thousands of terrorist fighters in Syria.Despite the overwhelming destruction in Syria and the abject failure of his policies, McCain has never given up on the policy of illegal weapons trafficking in Syria. Just this week, McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, openly protested against the Trump Administration s latest announcement to bring an end to the CIA s failed program of illegally arming and training  anti-Assad  terrorists in Syria. Rather than admitting what everyone else in the world seems to know already   that the US  train and equip  program has been a debacle   instead he feigns defiance, while demonstrating a breathtaking level of ignorance by accusing the White House of being part of a Russian conspiracy: If these reports are true, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin.   Making any concession to Russia, absent a broader strategy for Syria, is irresponsible and short-sighted. When promoting their latest war, McCain is normally part of a tandem act, accompanied by his geomancing interest, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who arguably views the world through an even more deranged, albeit binary comic book prism: Breaking Syria apart from Iran could be as important to containing a nuclear Iran as sanctions. If the Syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the Iranians, the world is a better place. Like a world view gleaned straight from Ian Fleming s Goldfinger.In his seminal 2008 interview with McCain heading to the GOP presidential nomination, The Atlantic magazine s Jeffrey Goldberg asked,  What do you think motivates Iran? .  to which McCain replied: Hatred. I don t try to divine people s motives. I look at their actions and what they say. I don t pretend to be an expert on the state of their emotions. I do know what their nation s stated purpose is, I do know they continue in the development of nuclear weapons, and I know that they continue to support terrorists who are bent on the destruction of the state of Israel. You ll have to ask someone who engages in this psycho stuff to talk about their emotions. McCain s views on Iraq were even more disturbing, essentially surmising that the invasion and occupation was a good thing, and that we shouldn t have left because  leaving Iraq gave rise to al Qaeda.  OK. Admittedly, it s a bit counter intuitive, but it works for neoconservatives.These statements by McCain and Graham are not admissions made by normal well-adjusted individuals, but rather by cold, dark hearted sociopaths who generally view the lives of Arabs (along with Slavs, Russians and others) as necessary cannon fodder in the pursuit of military industrial profits for a select cadr  of transnational corporate  defense  contractors   whose interests Senator John McCain represents in his home state of Arizona; Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and the list goes on, and on.The geopolitical hubris doesn t end there, as McCain still maintains   even after 6 years of absolute implosion of his own foreign policy agenda   that removing Syrian President Bashar al Assad from power is still a  key pillar  of the US strategy for Syria. The administration has yet to articulate its vision for Syria beyond the defeat of ISIL, let alone a comprehensive approach to the Middle East,  said McCain this week.The reality, of course, is that ISIL/ISIS could have been defeated already had the US-led  Coalition  and Israel not illegally intervened in Syria territory. Far from doing much to  defeat ISIS  since they have invaded Syrian airspace since 2014, the US has conveniently stretched-out the  ISIS problem  through the extension of its own self-styled international mandate which was originally intended to serve as a precursor to the eventual break-up of Syria into federal states and ethnic cantons. This might explain McCain s rush to enact regime change in Syria before lording over the eventual break-up of the sovereign nation-state.All Things RussianThe other country which McCain is determined break is Russia. Vladimir Putin is a murder and a KGB thug,  crowed McCain on CNN last year, as he protested against positive statements about Russia made by then candidate Trump.Suffice to say, he, along with the boards of Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, are all extremely happy about NATO pressing right up against the Russian border in eastern Europe.But 2013 was indeed a busy year for the Senator stirring up trouble internationally. As part of his opening gambit against Moscow, it was McCain who was the driving force behind the US-backed coup d etat in Ukraine in February 2014   which ultimately led to a bloody civil war which continues to this day in the Ukraine. Apparently, this was McCain s way of  stopping Putin. His is a very dodgy track record; whether it s NeoNazis, or Jihadi Terrorists, McCain seems always ready to do a deal with the devil, and that s what makes him particularly dangerous.Below we can see McCain helping to whip-up Nazi-linked, neofascist street mobs in Kiev helping to bring the ensuing junta into power. Some mainstream US pundits have claimed that this never happened, and that it s just a conspiracy theory invented by  Russian propagandists  to discredit McCain. Unfortunately for them   it is true, and here is the photo to prove it:Senator John McCain (AZ) shares the stage in Kiev with far-right, NeoNazi Right Sector strongman, Oleg Tyhanbock, ahead of violent street protests in Ukraine in December of 2013, in advance of the US-backed coup.. Looking back at his erratic and flippant behavior, attacking nearly anyone who even suggested d tente with Russia or that supplying lethal arms to militants in Syria was a bad idea, it s no surprise that cognizant onlookers have questioned whether or not McCain is in a normal frame of mind.Frankly speaking, how could any one in their right mind be so consistently on the wrong side of every issue? How could any politician s judgement be that poor? Unless there was something else going on below the surface The questions didn t stop there. McCain s performance during a recent Senate Intelligence Committee Hearing on  Russian Influence in US Elections  was an embarrassment. Onlookers were stunned when McCain lost the plot during the hearing when asking former FBI Director James Comey: Well, at least in the minds of this member, there s a whole lot of questions remaining about what went on, particularly considering the fact that as you mentioned, it s a  big deal  as to what went on during the campaign, so I m glad you concluded that part of the investigation, but I think that the American people have a whole lot of questions out there, particularly since you just emphasized the role that Russia played. And obviously she was a candidate for president at the time. So she was clearly involved in this whole situation where fake news, as you just described it, is a big deal took place. You re going to have to help me out here. In other words, we re complete, the investigation of anything former Secretary Clinton had to do with the campaign is over and we don t have to worry about it anymore?  to which Comey replied: With respect to   I m a little confused. With respect to Secretary Clinton, we investigated a criminal investigation with her use of a personal email server. McCain then finished digging his own hole by responding: So at the same time you made the announcement there would be no further charges brought against then-Secretary Clinton for any activities involved in the Russia involvement and our engagement and our election. I don t quite understand how you can be done with that but not done with the whole investigation of their attempt to affect the out of come our election. It was clear McCain had no idea what was going on. At that point any reasonable person would have concluded that John McCain had in fact lost his mind   and was no longer fit to serve in public office.  In fact, 21WIRE made this very same case back in 2013 after McCain was caught playing video poker on his iPhone during a Senate Committee where lawmakers were debating the very war of which he is a chief architect. Here is the photo:As stunning displays of ignorance go, the video poker incident was one of McCain s greatest ever, and certainly should have been a warning to everyone that this man had no business making military decisions, let alone litigating war and peace between nuclear superpowers like the United States and Russia.Perhaps an announcement is forthcoming, but it s surprising after being diagnosed with brain cancer at 80 years old   why McCain has not yet announced his resignation from office?It s fair to say that while this Senator is being treated in the world s leading medical facilities, thousands of innocents will have died needlessly because of US sanctions and support for terrorists   all in the name of defense, energy and ever vast corporate profits. Strange as that might sound to some, for those who consider themselves members of a ruling elite and its mandarin management class, that is perfectly acceptable quid pro quo in 2017.After World War II, the military industrial complex and the international arms trade has spread conflict like a disease across the planet, metastasizing in ways, in places, and on a scale which no one could have previously imagined before. Undoubtedly, over the last decade, John McCain has played a key role in spreading that anguish. For the people of Syria, Afghanistan and the Ukraine, that will be his legacy, not the chimerical image of a  maverick  Senator or the  war hero. Once again, we implore the Senator to do the right thing by the American people and for those innocents around the world who have suffered at the hands of an arms industry whose interests John McCain represents Please, just retire.*** READ MORE MCCAIN NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire John McCain FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"July 21, 2017"
PLANNED PARENTHOOD GIVES AWARD To Colorado Abortion Clinic For Killing More Babies Than Previous Year,"I wish I could say I was shocked, but the sad truth is pro-abortion voters are the major reason America has been crippled by Obama for 8 years, and potentially looking at a continuation of his radical policies with a Hillary presidency. To hell with our nation, the abortion industry must be kept alive, no matter the cost Maybe you ve seen those awards given to local businesses for having a certain number of accident free days or hitting certain regional or area sales quotas. here s an award that will take your breath away for a terribly and horrific reason.Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains gave its Aurua abortion clinic an award for increasing the number of babies killed in abortions. The award coincides with the abortion quotes the Planned Parenthood abortion business is implementing on all o its affiliates:From a blog post by Abby Johnson on the award:Ever since I left Planned Parenthood, I have been talking about the abortion quotas that are established inside abortion facilities. Many abortion supporters refused to believe it, citing that surely Planned Parenthood wants abortion to be safe, legal and RARE. If they want something to be RARE, they certainly wouldn t have quotas, right?We recently had a clinic worker leave the affiliate, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains. This affiliate runs the 2nd largest Planned Parenthood facility in the U.S. At this clinic in Denver, they give out various awards to their satellite clinics and post these awards on a bulletin board for everyone to see.When our former worker saw this award on public display, it really started to change her thinking about Planned Parenthood s motivation. This award was given to their Aurora clinic for  exceeding abortion visits first half of fiscal year 2012 compared to first half of fiscal year 2013. This means that the Aurora Planned Parenthood exceeded the abortion quota that was imposed on them. And THAT is award worthy according to Planned Parenthood.Via: LifeNews ",left-news,"Jul 2, 2016"
LOL! SARAH PALIN Has EPIC Response When MSNBC Reporter Asks If She’s Ever Been Sexually Assaulted,"MSNBC reporter Kasie Hunt began her segment on sexual harassment in Washington by telling the show s viewers,  Funnily enough, I caught up in the basement of the capitol today with Alaska Governor Sarah Palin today. Funnily enough?  Isn t this the same network who spent an excessive amount time criticizing Sarah Palin s grammar?Hunt asked Palin, who endorsed the embattled Roy Moore in the Alabama GOP primary race, to share her thoughts on sexual harassment with their viewers. Palin told Hunt, It s not a partisan issue, so when we see this happening today, I think that it leads to a lot of questions about what standards are going to be applied to whom. WFB  Hunt followed up by asking Palin whether she has ever experienced sexual harassment in the workplace as an  ambitious woman  in public life. I think a whole lot of people know that I m probably packing, and so I don t think there s a whole lot of people who would necessarily mess with me,  said Palin, a vocal advocate of the Second Amendment.  I don t mean to be lighthearted; this is a serious issue.

Al Franken (Minn.) was accused of groping and kissing KABC anchor Leeann Tweeden without her consent during a rehearsal for a skit for troops during a USO tour in the Middle East in 2006. The floodgates are really open right now,  Palin said.  That could lead to a lot of false accusations that really harm an innocent person.

 SNL Perfectly Skewers Trump And His Band Of Malicious Merry Morons (VIDEO),"With everything going on at Donald Trump rallies lately, it was only a matter of time before Saturday Night Live took notice and included it in one of their sketches.  However, they took it one step further and perfectly wove Dr. Ben Carson s endorsement of Trump into this past Saturday s cold open.Jay Pharoah appears as Carson and says: Donald and I are very different. We re like night and day. Ebony and orangey. But he backs The Donald nonetheless and leaves the stage only to moments later reappear with a  Trump steak  over one of his eyes. This is when Darrell Hammond as Trump says to the crowd: Guys, what did I say? Not this one. This is one of the good ones! Clearly insinuating that Carson was beat up because he was black and his supporters mistook him as one of the many protesters getting beat up recently at Trump rallies.The racism and violence coming out of the Trump campaign is utterly abhorrent. Trump himself is not only condoning it, but offering to pay legal fees, and encouraging it. Kudos to Saturday Night Live for this hilarious satirical spin. However, the reality of what s going on is no laughing matter at all. Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 13, 2016"
 Energy Department To Close Office Of International Climate And Technology,"In response to the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement earlier this month, the Energy Department is shutting down the Office of International Climate and Technology, a department that works with other countries to develop clean energy technology.An agency spokesman tried to justify the Energy Department shutting down the office by stating that the DOE is  looking for ways to consolidate the many duplicative programs that currently exist within DOE,  thus the Office of International Climate and Technology is getting the chop.The 11-person office has been in operation since 2010, operating as a means for the U.S. to work with international partners on energy sector technology in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The employees of the Office of International Climate and Technology also play a large part in the Clean Energy Ministerial, a conference for high-polluting nations to focus on making the energy sector greener.DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said there are numerous international offices within the Energy Department that could take on the work of the Office of International Climate and Technology, however, she failed to acknowledge whether one actually would. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has an International Affairs team, while the International Affairs Office has a renewables team,  Hynes said.  The Department is looking for ways to eliminate this kind of unnecessary duplication   just like any responsible American business would. The closing of this particular office is most likely a direct result of Trump s 2018 budget proposal, which slashes funding for both the DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency, particularly cuts for climate change initiatives and research efforts. Naturally, environmentalists are horrified by the news of the international office s closure. Willfully ignoring the climate crisis is recklessly and unnecessarily dangerous for families and communities across the country, and it s clear that Trump will stop at nothing to completely isolate the United States and irreparably damage our reputation with the rest of the world,  said John Coequyt, the global climate policy director at the Sierra Club. Ignorance is not diplomacy, and if Trump were acting like a leader, he would know that. Hynes responded by saying that the Trump administration is not bringing an end to its clean energy efforts, drawing particular attention to Energy Secretary Rick Perry s support for carbon capture storage and nuclear energy efforts at a recent Clean Energy Ministerial.Featured image via Kevin Frayer/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017"
 Facebook Employees Asked Mark Zuckerberg If They Have A ‘Responsibility’ To Stop Trump,"Earlier this week, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, long may he reign, praise be his name, holy is he, we bow down before him, subtly denounced racist, xenophobic hatemonger, Donald Trump, during a keynote speech at the company s annual F8 conference. While he never mentioned Trump by name, the tech god had plenty to say about Trump s nature. As I look around the world, I m starting to see people and nations turning inward, against the idea of a connected world and a global community,  Zuckerberg told the crowd. But then he targeted his verbal beatdown to Trump: I hear fearful voices talking about building walls  It takes courage to choose hope over fear. Instead of building walls we can help build bridges. Instead of dividing people we can connect people. We do it one person at a time, one connection at time. That s why I think the work we re doing together is more important than it has ever been before. Trump, and his moronic horde of jaded, hateful Teanuts, have all said these things, and worse. It takes courage to choose hope over fear,  Zuckerberg added.  People will always call you naive but it s this hope and optimism that s behind every important step forward. Zuckerberg s powerful words obviously struck a chord with employees, who voted to ask their CEO a very important question in a recent weekly Q+A: Do they have a moral obligation to stop Trump from rising to power? Gizmodo reports:Every week, Facebook employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask Zuckerberg in an upcoming Q&A session. A question from the March 4 poll was:  What responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017? A screenshot of the poll, given to Gizmodo, shows the question as the fifth most popular.It s not particularly surprising the question was asked, or that some Facebook employees are anti-Trump. The question and Zuckerberg s statements on Tuesday align with the consensus politics of Silicon Valley: pro-immigration, pro-trade, pro-expansion of the internet.This question could mean many things, depending on the level and nature of  help.  In the 2010 congressional elections, Facebook used its considerable influence to convince voters to show up at the polls. An estimated 340,000 extra people vote (unfortunately, not many of them were Democrats, who largely stayed home rather than perform their civic duty. Hint, hint, guys) thanks to an aggressive, one-day campaign that strong-armed users into getting off the couch to head to the polls. Could Facebook wage a similar war on Trump by utilizing a similar strategy to inform conservatives that he s the only man in recent history who chances being unfavorably compared to Hitler one day? Would such a thing be ethical, no matter the motivating reason?In 2014, the social media giant experimented with manipulating users  emotions. In a move that was widely decried by everyone the company removed either all positive or all negative posts from a good number of its users  news feeds in an effort to see how it would affect their emotions. Technically, we have all agreed to this sort of thing when we agreed to the data use policy, but no one was warned that they were part of the experiment, either. The result was as one would expect: more negative posts caused people to produce more negative posts. More positive led to more positive posts from users, and so on.Could the same be done with posts about Trump? Would showing people more negative Trump posts cause the overall sentiment   even among the most vapid who reside in Stupidville   toward Trump to shift? Could they use this method to influence voters? Once again, would it be ethical, even if it would accomplish something good? Gizmodo notes:What s exceedingly important about this question being raised and Zuckerberg s answer, if there is one is how Facebook now treats the powerful place it holds in the world. It s unprecedented. More than 1.04 billion people use Facebook. It s where we get our news, share our political views, and interact with politicians. It s also where those politicians are spending a greater share of their budgets.And Facebook has no legal responsibility to give an unfiltered view of what s happening on their network. Facebook can promote or block any material that it wants,  UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh told the publication.  Facebook has the same First Amendment right as the New York Times. They can completely block Trump if they want. They block him or promote him. Volokh says that the only way Facebook could legally overstep would be to collude with any candidate. If they were to choose to stamp out positive Trump posts, to create a blackout, they would have every legal right. If they were working with Sanders or Clinton, however, it would be a different issue: If Facebook was actively coordinating with the Sanders or Clinton campaign, and suppressing Donald Trump news, it would turn an independent expenditure (protected by the First Amendment) into a campaign contribution because it would be coordinated and that could be restricted.But if they re just saying,  We don t want Trump material on our site,  they have every right to do that. It s protected by the First Amendment. It is very clear that Facebook could take a number of actions to ensure that Trump stays as far from the White House as his fans are from reality. But, what if Zuckerberg decides the company does have a moral obligation? Unfortunately, given the secretive nature of the news feed (and their history of manipulating users), we likely won t know what, if anything, he would decide to do   at least not until after it has happened.Featured image via Getty Images",News,"April 15, 2016"
 Trump Admin. Tosses Out Another Obama Rule – His Sons Can Be Even Worse Douchebags Now,"President Donald Trump has overturned another Obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official has confirmed. Trump s sons, Don Jr., and Eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.Don Jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. That exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. It s unlikely the Trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.Nevertheless, a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife said,  Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. Despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in Africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Prior to European colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in Africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. That number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on Africa s savanna in a survey where Namibia did not release any figures and surveys in South Sudan and the Central African Republic were postponed due to armed conflict.Last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, Zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of President Trump. This new change would only apply to Zimbabwe and Zambia, but with Robert Mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of Zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.It makes you wonder why President Trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. Is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of Zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? Could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in Trump Tower?Or is it simply because Trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?Figures. pic.twitter.com/7LrFJeqaIY  Snarkar?ni  ?

 This Video Shows Trump Backing Racial Violence In A Shocking Way We Haven’t Seen Before,"Donald Trump moved a step closer to officially sanctioning racial violence being committed in his name by telling multiple media outlets that he would be  take a look at  paying the legal fees for John McGraw, who punched a black protester at a Trump rally in North Carolina.Appearing on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd, Trump accused the protester of being  very taunting  and being  very loud, very disruptive  and  sticking a certain finger up in the air  so he would  take a look at  paying the legal fees.While Todd is usually complacent with conservative Republicans on his show making bizarre allegations, even he appeared to be taken aback with Trump s show of solidarity, and asked if the leading Republican candidate was condoning the attack. Trump argued that he had not condoned the assault, despite doing just that, and said,  maybe [the attacker] doesn t like seeing what s happening to the country. The man who Trump says he has instructed his legal team into looking into helping was no benign protester. Multiple videos showed McGraw sucker punching the protester as he was being taken out of Trump s rally. In a video posted right after the incident, McGraw proudly said,  The next time we see him, we might have to kill him. McGraw was arrested and has been charged with assault, disorderly conduct and communicating threats. The police department is also investigating why McGraw was not arrested immediately on site by the police officers tasked with maintaining security at the Trump rally.Trump has repeatedly made up racial and ethnic scapegoats for his mostly white base of supporters to blame for society s ills and problems, feeding into a narrative pushed for decades by white supremacists and white power groups. He has blamed Latinos, black activists, and Muslims for problems like terrorism, drugs, unemployment and even the failure to say  Merry Christmas. It is an audience primed to explode into violence, and as Secretary Hillary Clinton said,  If you play with matches, you re going to start a fire you can t control. That s not leadership.

"STUDENTS THREATEN YALE PRESIDENT: Give Us $8 Million In Demands To “reduce the intolerable racism,” Or Else","Isn t there a legal term for those kinds of threats? Oh yeah it called Extortion:ex tor tion ik st rSH( )n/ noun the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats. synonyms: blackmail, shakedown; formalexaction  arrested on a charge of extortion  Unhappy with a series of small concessions from the administration, protesters at Yale University have released a new list of demands that include firing people they don t like and giving their favored programs a budget increase of at least $8 million a year.The new demands, released by a group calling itself Next Yale, were read aloud to Yale president Peter Salovey Thursday night by protesters who marched to his front door at midnight. The group says the demands are necessary to  reduce the intolerable racism that students of color experience on campus every day.  Salovey is given until Nov. 18 to respond.As evidence of Yale s hostile racial climate, the demands cite a widely debunked alleged exclusion of black women from a party hosted at Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity. There is substantial evidence this alleged segregation did not happen.Of the Yale student s demands, the most expensive is the third, which orders the school to increase the budget for Yale s four cultural centers (for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians) by two million dollars each, a total expense of $8 million. Along with this increase to their budgets, the students demand that the cultural centers hire five additional full-time employees each. Via: Daily Caller ",politics,"Nov 14, 2015"
TWO SENATORS SAY NO TO MOVING MUSLIM TERRORISTS FROM GUANTANAMO BAY TO THEIR STATES,"Yeah because everyone wants these guys living in their hometown Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria. The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed to lawmakers that it is studying both Forth Leavenworth and the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston as potential sites. These visits will also help refine our baseline standard for what a facility should look like to inform potential selection of other locations to evaluate in the future,  the Defense Department notification read.Transferring the remaining 116 detainees to the U.S. is being considered as an option for closing Guantanamo Bay. Moving the prisoners to other countries requires congressional notification and unanimous sign off by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Earlier this week the Pentagon said it would present Congress with a plan to shutter Guantanamo Bay when they return to Washington after Labor Day.

NC TAXPAYERS UNKNOWINGLY Fund Stunning COMMUNIST Guide At UNC: Why Students Are Told Not To Use “Christmas Vacation” Or “Golf Outings” Will Make Your Blood Boil,"Taxpayers need to start calling out the colleges and universities they re funding with their tax dollars. This kind of communist indoctrination, that is being widely accepted as the norm is NOT okay! The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a guide this week which instructs students that Christmas vacations and telling a woman  I love your shoes!  are  microagressions. The taxpayer-funded guide   entitled  Career corner: Understanding microaggressions    also identifies golf outings and the words  boyfriend  and  girlfriend  as microagressions.The UNC Chapel Hill guide, published on Thursday, covers a wide range of menacing microaggressions   which are everyday words that radical leftists have decided to be angry or frustrated about.Christmas vacations are a microagression, the public university pontificates, because  academic calendars and encouraged vacations  which  are organized around major religious observances  centralize  the Christian faith  and diminish  non-Christian spiritual rituals and observances. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a guide this week which instructs students that Christmas vacations and telling a woman  I love your shoes!  are  microagressions. The microagression of liking shoes occurs when someone says  I love your shoes!   to a woman in leadership during a Q & A after a speech.  So it s a very specific microagression. The problem, the University of North Carolina document declares, is that the shoe admirer values appearances  more than   intellectual contributions. Similarly, the public school pronounces, interrupting any woman who is speaking is a microagression.Golf outings are also a microagression, the University of North Carolina says, because suggesting a  staff retreat at the country club  or even just  a round of golf   assumes employees have the financial resources  to participate in the  fairly expensive and inaccessible sport. (As an aside, daily greens fees at the gorgeous UNC Finley Golf Club range from $30   for students   to $40 for professors and administrators.)The words  boyfriend  and  girlfriend    as well as  husband  and  wife    are microaggressions, the University of North Carolina admonishes, because these words set  the expectation that people do not identify as LGBTQ until they say otherwise or disclose their sexual orientation.  The correct terms are now  partner  and  spouse,  UNC Chapel Hill demands.In this same vein, bureaucratic forms only containing the options  male  and  female  are microagressions, the taxpayer-funded flagship school says. It s also a microagression to refer to men who dress up as women with the pronouns  he  or  him,  UNC Chapel Hill scolds.Still more microagressions cited by UNC Chapel Hill include complimenting a foreign-born person s English skills, saying  I get ADHD sometimes  and telling a person you don t judge them by the color of their skinThe two lady authors of the UNC Chapel Hill microagressions guide are Sharbari Dey, an assistant director of multicultural affairs, and Krista Prince, a dorm life coordinator.In order to counter the multitude of microagressions listed in their document, Dey and Prince advise students to respond by interrupting and aggressively asking,  What did you mean by that? UNC Chapel Hill is home to a  cultural competency workshop  which instructs that white people are privileged because they can buy Band-Aids  in  flesh  color and have them more or less match  their vaguely beige-hued skin. At least some students have apparently been required to participate in the workshop.Via: Daily Caller   h/t Campus Reform ",left-news,"Jun 26, 2016"
POLITICO DOWNGRADES AMERICA: Declares Germany’s “Open-Borders” Angela Merkel “Leader Of The Free World” In Anti-American Headline,"Here s what Politico s headline today looked like:Here s what the leftist anti-American rag Politico had to say about Angela Merkel s visit to the US to meet with our new President Donald Trump: This time the media hype surrounding a White House meeting is no wild exaggeration. When President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally get together on Friday, the leaders of the West s two most powerful countries are sure to come off more like an odd couple than two close allies chewing over plans for some joint enterprise. And for good reason. Merkel and Trump are not only polar opposites as people, but they share little in terms of international outlook.Their styles reflect their vastly different backgrounds. Merkel, Germany s first and only female chancellor, was raised by a pastor in communist East Germany, where she earned a doctorate in physical chemistry. Although she is the longest-serving and most powerful leader in Europe, she is unfailingly modest, competent and consensus-oriented. Trump s all-about-me mentality, Queens upbringing and brash, tabloid-and-reality-TV personality couldn t be more different. Could one even imagine the outrage if a piece like this was published about Barack Obama within his first 60 days in office?

The lunatics have taken over the insane asylum when respected business entities such as yourself ask guys that like to stick their tongues out what I think of Harvey Weinstein,  Simmons answered.  Okay, I m a powerful and attractive man, and what I m about to say is deadly serious,  he added.  Men are jackasses. From the time we re young we have testosterone. I m not validating it or defending it. As is always the case, however, it was when the cameras weren t rolling that things began to get creepy and also quite hypocritical. According to a knowledgeable Fox News source, Simmons arrived on the studio s fourteenth floor to do an interview with FoxNews.com s entertainment section to promote his book, but also chose to walk into a staff meeting uninvited, opened his shirt and shouted,  Hey chicks, sue me! He didn t stop there, though. The source claims he went on to tell pedophilia-related Michael Jackson jokes, hit two employees on the head with his book while making comparisons on their intelligence based on the sounds, and asked an African-American employee if he was Al Roker.  It was pretty severe,  the source said.Simmons  behavior was reported to a supervisor, who in turn passed the news on to Fox News human-resources executive Kevin Lord, who promptly banned Simmons from the building. He was also permanently barred from appearing on any Fox News or Fox Business Networkprogramming.It seems that Gene Simmons may have had a change of heart over the past week, as he has released the following statement: I have appeared frequently over the years on various Fox News and Fox Business programs and have a tremendous amount of respect for the talented women and men who work there. While I believe that what is being reported is highly exaggerated and misleading, I am sincerely sorry that I unintentionally offended members of the Fox team during my visit.

And I don t know if anybody explained to her we ve got to spend three nights a week in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? I waited until I was 48 and my kids were raised and at least adults before we took the opportunity to try. Well then. There are so many things wrong with that statement it s hard to choose where to begin. First, don t call her  gal.  It s insulting and cheapens your attack even more, if that s possible. Newt, Columbus isn t all that far; Mrs. Herold could easily make the commute if she wanted to. It s difficult to imagine a fragile little  gal  having the ability to oh, say drive a car, we know. Last, have you considered, Senator, that she may have a husband at home who doesn t believe it s the woman s job to take care of the kids 24/7?How old you are and your warped sense of how a modern family works is irrelevant, you insufferable douchebag.It gets worse. While talking polling numbers, Patton said: I want to tell her,  Hey Sweetie, I just got 27 percent of the pie in just my district, which is nine times what should have been done. Seriously?  Hey, Sweetie?  What is unfortunate is that his message will resonate with the sexists who populate his party. They don t like people who don t have penises representing them, because what could a woman possibly know about anything other than child-rearing and pleasing her husband? Patton is the perfect poster boy for the GOP.Herold responded with pure class and dignity in a statement: We realize the sacrifice that is involved in holding such a position. However, Tom Patton has crossed a line by trying to turn the fact that I am a mother of two children into a negative campaign issue. It s insulting for my opponent to suggest that motherhood is a liability. In fact, my experience as a mom is perhaps my greatest strength. Tom, only one man in my life is allowed to call me  sweetie.  From now on, I respectfully ask you to refer to me as Jen, Jennifer, Ms. Herold, or your opponent. Well said, Ms. Herold. Patton has since apologized, calling his words  poorly chosen.  What he doesn t seem to understand is that it isn t the words he chose that are disturbing, it s the way he thinks. It s the sexism and utter disrespect for Herold as a woman and a human being that make him so despicable.Too little too late, Senator. Hopefully you get your ass handed to you so you ll have no choice but to stumble off into the sunset and obscurity. Featured image via screen capture",News,"January 29, 2016"
TUCKER CALLS OUT College For Banning Whiteboards: “Why not ban pens?” [Video], ,politics,"Feb 24, 2017"
" Harry Reid Storms The Senate, UNLEASHES On GOP And It Was F*cking AWESOME (VIDEO)","On Thursday, while Republican leadership was meeting with Donald Trump, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid unleashed on the GOP for pandering to their atrocious nominee. The first thing Reid did when he spoke was to make sure that every American who watched his speech knows that the right-wing is  marching lock-step with Donald Trump  and their policies are perfectly aligned: So, McConnell has fully embraced Donald Trump. As he said last week when Trump secured the Republican nomination, I quote, I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters,  closed quote. While speaking with reporters earlier this week the Republican leader sounded enthusiastic about Trump s chances in the general election. I guess he should be giddy about a Trump presidency, Donald Trump is everything that the Republican leader and his party could ever want in a nomination. That is absolutely, 100 percent spot-on. We have been saying the same thing since the beginning. The Republican base is filled with racist, misogynistic, Islamaphobic xenophobes who hate everyone who isn t a straight, white, Christian male. After explaining how much the GOP loves Trump, he hit them about their Supreme Court obstruction. Then Senator Reid pointed out how much the GOP hates women: Let s talk about Trump and women. When they get together, they can talk about their policies about being anti-woman. Since Sen. McConnell has so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees with Trump s view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that the Republican Leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump s vulgar behavior towards women. Look at his New York Times story yesterday on his cavorting with Howard Stern and how they talked about women. After all, the Republican Party has spent years blocking every substantive bill for American women. Equal pay for equal work. The Senator has tried to undermine women s health at every turn. Trying to turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag, even though millions and millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. The minority leader went on to say that McConnell must also agree with Trump s views on immigrants; after all, the GOP has been saying the same thing about them for years. He hit Republicans for claiming they care about immigration control, but came within hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security. The senator said that he  can only assume  that Mitch McConnell and the leadership are okay with Trump s  shady business practices  and  ripping off  hardworking Americans.Reid slammed the GOP for Trump s bankruptcies, their climate change bullshit, their horrible fiscal policies, Trump wanting to default on America s debt and a number of other things. He spent more than eight minutes ripping Republican leadership and it was amazing. It was also terrifying. If Donald Trump is elected in November, this country is screwed. Our children will be left with a mess of epic proportions and our older kids will probably be sent to war. There is literally nothing good that could come with putting a member of the GOP in the White House. So, remember to vote blue, no matter who.Watch Reid rip the GOP apart:Featured image via video screenshot",News,"May 12, 2016"
UNITED AIRLINES KICKS TODDLER Out Of $969 Seat For Standby Passenger [VIDEO],"United Airlines should probably consider an extensive training program for their employees who are making such bad decisions, before the airline loses every last customer United Airlines requires children over the age of 2 to have their own tickets and occupy their own seats, but that didn t stop the airline from allowing a 27-month-old child from sitting in his mother s lap after they accidentally oversold his spot.Shirley Yamauchi says she and her son Taizo had boarded their flight from Houston to Boston on June 29   the final leg of an 18-hour flight from Hawaii   when a standy passenger approached and claimed Taizo was in his seat. I told him that I bought both of these tickets and he tells me that he got the ticket on standby. Then he proceeds to sit in the center,  Yamauchi told Hawaii News Now.Yamuachi says she tried to inform a flight attendant about Taizo s seat, but the woman claimed she couldn t do anything about it, seeing as the flight was full.Not wanting to cause a scene   or worse, instigate an incident like the one that befell the elderly United passenger who refused to give up his seat on in April   Yamuachi sat Taizo on her lap and kept her mouth shut until she reached Boston. I started remembering all those incidents with United on the news. The violence. Teeth getting knocked out. I m Asian. I m scared and I felt uncomfortable. I didn t want those things to happen to me,  she told Hawaii News Now.Watch:Upon reaching Boston, Yamauchi was told to call a United hotline to explain the situation. But when she finally got through and asked for a refund, she was told that United would need to cancel her return trip to Hawaii in order to do so, reports KITV.   Fox News",left-news,"Jul 6, 2017"
KELLOGG’S PULLS ADVERTISING From Breitbart News As Punishment For Conservative News Slant…#BoycottKelloggs,"Kellogg Co. is pulling its ads from the website Breitbart News, the right-wing news organization whose former chairman Steve Bannon was tapped as a top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump.Brands that advertise on Breitbart have drawn flak in recent weeks, with activists saying the website espouses racist and anti-Semitic views. A screen shot showing an advertisement for Kellogg s Frosted Mini Wheats was part of an online campaign to get marketers to abandon the site. We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company,  said Kris Charles, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which also makes Frosted Flakes and Special K cereal.  We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove our ads from that site. AppNexus Inc., one of the biggest digital advertising services, barred Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools earlier this month because it felt the publisher violated its hate-speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after Bannon was given the White House post. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, according to a spokesman for the company. Kellogg declined to name the third-party company that places its digital ads.Kellogg is the latest major brand to pull its online advertising from the news site. Other companies   including Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi   have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads, according to Digiday.The site had 19.2 million unique monthly U.S. visitors in October, up from 12.9 million a year ago, according to ComScore Inc. Breitbart doesn t rely on subscriptions, suggesting that advertising is a major source of revenue.Many marketers buy online advertising through third-party tech companies that distribute them widely across the internet, so they may not be aware of all the websites where they appear. But they also have the ability to control which websites display their ads. The creator of the Twitter account Sleeping Giants has been taking screen shots of ads appearing on Breitbart in an attempt to pressure those brands to take their ads down.Not all brands are shying away from advertising on Breitbart, though. After a screenshot showed a Nissan ad on the website, the automaker said in a statement that it  places ads in a variety of sites in order to reach as many consumers as possible. The placement of Nissan advertising is not intended to be a political commentary and there are no plans to change the advertising mix at this time,  the company said.

 WATCH: Fake Fox News Girls Question Conservatives With Hilarious Results (VIDEO),"Watching a good old-fashioned troll perpetrated against the most uninformed American voter, the right-winger, is always a hoot. This HULU production of an episode of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog takes attractive white women to the scene of rallies for candidates, telling ridiculous lie after ridiculous lie.Time and time again the conservative knuckleheads willing to hold a sign for a candidate like Carly Fiorina, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and more. With realistic looking microphones and presumably cameramen, they capture the beauty and simplicity of the wild American  patriot.  The way they see it they re some kind of dying breed coming together as a movement. The way we see it is a dangerous bunch of people who will believe anything you tell them rallying behind lunatics and narcissistic billionaires.Dangerous is the key word. Godwin saw Donald Trump coming. Godwin s law says all internet disputes eventually end at Nazi, and he who goes there first loses. What else can you possibly equate to Donald Trump s rise to power besides 1936? People are thrilled to be able to hate so openly. Millions of people. They want someone loud and aggressive who will  rebuild our military,  as Trump orders the best of the best of the best for our troops. If you re white, full of rage, rich, or just plain dumb, a Donald Trump presidency is a dream come true. It wouldn t take that idiot but a month to destroy our respect as a country and our economy.That makes people who support Donald Trump fair game. This bit of trickery goes quite a bit further, however, when one of the Fox girls gets a hold of Rick Santorum and asks him about Trump s plan to sterilize Puerto Ricans. Santorum is NOT in favor of sterilizing anyone at this time. The fact that he takes it seriously is comedy gold.

WATCH: GERALDO EMBARRASSES San Juan Mayor Who Said Trump’s “Killing” Puerto Ricans: “I Don’t See People Dying”,"Let s hope this angry leftist mayor doesn t prevent individual donors from contributing to help the people of San Juan who may not agree with her hateful attacks on our President, who is bending over backward to get the help to the victims of the hurricane.Is anyone else sick and tired of hearing this mayor whine about everything America is NOT doing for her? San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities. The woman even went so far as to say that U.S. armed forces need to  come in and distribute the aid. Via: MRCTV",politics,"Oct 4, 2017"

 WATCH: We Found Donald Trump’s Campaign Theme Song (VIDEO),"Way back in 1998, when Fox s MadTV was still on the air, an actress/singer named Nicole Sullivan performed a three-minute comedy sketch that so accurately predicts the Donald Trump campaign, we just had to write about it.For the sketch, Sullivan adopted the character of Darlene McBride, a huge-haired country music singer, who is promoting her upcoming  Take Back America  tour.As the video opens, Sullivan s character can be seen strumming her guitar, while belting out the words to her new song,  Take Back America. Take back America to 1955,  she sings.  Take back America to when god was still alive. As the music fades into the background, McBride is seen sitting at a mirrored dressing table, dressed in camo, an American flag displayed proudly on the shoulder of her military fatigues. Truer words were never spoken, or sung,  she says.She then introduces herself. Hi, I m Darlene McBride. You know I love this country, the way it used to be, simple-minded, with simple values, simple people. But then the big government, the Supreme Court and those bleeding heart liberals just couldn t leave well enough alone. And now look at it? A big, ugly melting pot just boilin  over on what used to be a nice, white stove. From there, McBride goes on to talk about her upcoming tour, where she says she ll  be coming to a city near you, to sing traditional songs with traditional values. She then provides the audience with a few samples tunes that you can hear during the tour.For starters, there s a little ditty called The Lord Loves the NRA. The lord loves the NRA, he told me so the other day. He spelled it out in bullets in the sky. He s sitting up in heaven with his AK 47. He s a rough-and-ready, macho kind of guy. Then there s the song called The Back of the Bus.Leading into that one she says  Excuse me Mr. Negro, but I ve got a question to ask you. She then breaks into the song, asking in the lyrics,  What s so bad about the back of the bus? Next up is a song called Nothing Would Be Finer. Nothing would be finer than to drop a bomb on Chiner in the morning. She also has a song about illegal immigration called Hey Senorita.To be fair, all of the songs in this sketch would work for any GOP candidate, not just Trump. The NRA lovin , republican-Jesus fearin  racists and warmongers that vote for them would likely never realize they were listening to a musical parody of themselves.Watch the MadTV video below, courtesy of Migrainemaker on YouTube.While the sketch might seem like it was written to mock today s Teapublican Trump supporters, it s actually 18 years old.It goes to show, no matter how much time passes, the republican party does not change. It s the same today as it was almost twenty years ago, and will most likely be twenty years from now.Featured image credit: video screen capture, MadTV via Migrainemaker on youtube",News,"January 16, 2016"
 Twitter Is Merciless With Rush Limbaugh’s Thoughts On The Cincinnati Zoo’s Gorilla Controversy,"The controversy surrounding the Cincinnati Zoo s decision to kill Harambe, a 17-year old gorilla, in order to save a child has made its way into the one or two existing brain cells of people like Rush Limbaugh. We all know Limbaugh is an idiot, but what he thinks about Harambe is so stupid it s astonishing, even for him.On his Tuesday show, he went off on a tangent when discussing Harambe, saying: A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Don t doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas. And they re looking for the missing link out there. The evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes. I ve always   if we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape, and how come he didn t become one of us? That s Limbaugh playing anti-science creationist right there. He never says he s a creationist, but it s pretty clear from this (and other shows) that he is. Only young-earth creationists totally reject evolution this way. Now all he has to do is agree out loud that either the Earth is young, or that man has been on the planet for billions of years (which is impossible), and he can come out as the Christian zealot he is.Twitter had a field day with this, as people are wont to do over there when someone takes the stupid farther than rational beings thought was possible:it s not everyday somebody shows their complete ignorance of basic science but dammit @rushlimbaugh you did it again.

"OBAMA LIES ABOUT Number Of Troops On Ground In Iraq…FLASHBACK, OBAMA 2009: [Video] “After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over.”","It was more important for Obama to keep a pledge to his leftist donors, than to secure the nation of Iraq before pulling out our troops. And then there s that one little detail rarely discussed in liberal circles, Obama wanted to leave troops behind but the Iraqi government threatened Our Pansy In Chief that they would not give our US troops immunity in their courts. Thus, the master negotiator put his tail between their legs and scooted out of Iraq, bringing our brave men and women in uniform with him Oct. 2011- The U.S. is leaving behind a  sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government. -Barack Huessein ObamaObama claimed it was a  moment of success. The U.S. military has around 5,000 service members in Iraq, officials said on Monday, far more than previously reported, as the Obama administration quietly expands ground operations against the Islamic State.The number of American forces in Iraq has come under increased scrutiny following the death over the weekend of a Marine staff sergeant, the second combat casualty in renewed U.S. operations in Iraq. He was killed when militants launched rockets at a small U.S. base around the city of Makhmour. The existence of the Marine detachment had not been known prior to Staff Sgt. Louis F. Cardin s death.Officials at the Pentagon have declined to specify how Marines are serving at the outpost in northern Iraq, which they described as a satellite base positioned to protect American trainers at a nearby, larger base. Their presence in Iraq highlights the use of forces from Navy ships already in the Middle East. Via: Washington PostObama, Oct. 21, 2011:In a brief appearance at the White House, Mr Obama said:  Today I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America s war in Iraq will be over. The remaining 40,000 US troops in Iraq, would, he said,  definitely be home for the holidays .He conspicuously declined to repeat the mistake of his predecessor George W Bush, who started the war in March 2003 and displayed a  Mission Accomplished  banner six weeks later, only for Iraq to descend into years of insurgency and sectarian violence that has claimed at least 100,000 civilian lives.Mr Obama however asserted that the  United States is moving forward from a position of strength . The last American soldier will cross the border out of Iraq with their head held high, proud of their service,  he said.The president stressed that he was meeting a withdrawal deadline reached earlier with the Iraqis, as well as keeping a pledge made as a candidate in 2008 to wind down the controversial war as fast as possible.But his statement masked the fact that his administration had wanted to keep a residual force of 4-5,000 beyond the end of the year in a training capacity that would also have acted as a prohibitive presence to neighboring Iran.Despite months of discussions however, it failed to win a continued guarantee of immunity for US troops from prosecution from the Iraqi government.

 North Carolina’s New Anti-Gay Law Just Killed HUNDREDS Of Jobs,"The full economic impact of the horrific new anti-gay law passed by North Carolina s bigoted legislature will not be known for quite some time, but we are already seeing numerous ways that the geniuses who place hatred over the needs and the good of the people are damaging their state.North Carolina s Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act,  something that came into existence as a response to the city of Charlotte s attempt to create a fair and equal environment for all citizens, including transgender individuals, by granting the LGBT community equal rights pertaining to public accommodations as the rest of the world enjoys, nullifies the Charlotte ordinance and bans localities from expanding protections for the LGBT community. It also requires everyone to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender at birth.This horrific and blatant attempt to deprive a segment of the population of equal rights has not only angered the public, but the Obama administration as well. At this moment, the Justice Department is in the process of determining if the law violates federal civil rights statutes. If it does, the state could lose billions (with a B) of dollars that would otherwise go to fixing highways, education, and housing funding.Cities and states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to North Carolina and production companies have left the state over the law, depriving the state of tax dollars and a boost to local economies where filming took place. Recently, Lionsgate Films canceled filming of a new Hulu show and moved production to Canada.In short, yes. On Tuesday, PayPal announced that it has withdrawn plans for a new blogal operations center in Charlotte   the city that attempted to be inclusive in the first place   that would have employed 400 people in skilled jobs. The new center was announced just weeks ago. In the short time since then, legislation has been abruptly enacted by the State of North Carolina that invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens and denies these members of our community equal rights under the law,  PayPal said in a statement.  Our decision is a clear and unambiguous one. But we do regret that we will not have the opportunity to be a part of the Charlotte community and to count as colleagues the skilled and talented people of the region. As a company that is committed to the principle that everyone deserves to live without fear of discrimination simply for being who they are, becoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable. The company says  the new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal s mission and culture,  leaving them unable to open a center in the state. PayPal is in the process of determining where the new location will be, and says it regrets not having the  opportunity to be part of the Charlotte community. They remain committed, however, to  working with the LGBT community in North Carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation, alongside all those who are committed to equality. PayPal is not the first to refuse to do business in North Carolina, nor will they be the last. This new law will ultimately be damaging to the state, and everyday people will be the ones who are hurt the most.Featured image via Getty/PhillyMag",News,"April 5, 2016"

The lower chamber opted to group the  must-pass  appropriations measures together due to leadership s lack of votes to pass an all-encompassing omnibus.Building the structure has been a top priority for the president, who placed a strong emphasis on the proposal during the course of the campaign.Democrats have met the border wall proposal with strong opposition, feeling that the project will be expensive and ineffective.Read more: Daily Caller",Government News,"Jul 27, 2017"
 Convicted Felon With A Gun Has Knee-Jerk Reaction That Kills His Own Daughter,"A man who shot and killed his own daughter as she came home from her first day of middle school has told authorities that she startled him, so he shot her. He then tried to get rid of his gun after taking her to a hospital, where she later died from her wounds.Timothy Batts originally told police that his daughter, Timea, came in and woke him up, saying she d been shot after getting off the school bus. After police found evidence that he d fired his gun inside his house, he admitted his lies to the police. He told them that he was his daughter s killer after a noise she made woke him up, and her yell startled him.In other words, he thought she was an intruder, and fired his gun before making sure he knew who was in his house. While there s every possibility that he thought it was someone coming after him, this kind of thing is a growing problem as we increasingly refuse to respect the danger that guns are.Worse, he s a convicted felon. Felons aren t supposed to be able to have guns, and yet, he had one. It s not clear how he came to own a gun, despite having previous convictions of felony drug possession and attempted criminal homicide, and yet, he had one. Why?His daughter s death was a mystery in the town of Hendersonville, Tenn., where people were shocked to learn of Timea s death   nobody could figure out what an 11-year old could possibly have done to get herself shot in the few feet there were between the bus stop and her house. Police were confused as to why there were so few clues other than her father s account of what happened.Later that evening, though, the case took a turn when police investigated Batts  house and found that Batts had fired his gun. He s now facing charges of reckless homicide, tampering with evidence, false reporting and felon in possession of a firearm. He s currently being held on a $1 million bond, and his cousin has actually started a Gofundme account in order to raise money for his bail.He could have obtained his gun legally or illegally, but the fact remains that his daughter would still be alive if he hadn t shot first and thought later.Featured image via screen capture",News,"August 10, 2016"
 Insane Trump Ally Claims He’s Victim Of Russian-Style Assassination Attempt (VIDEO),"Out of all the insane people who are part of Trump s posse, former campaign manager Roger Stone has to win the loony prize. Stone regularly immerses himself with full-on white supremacists. During the presidential campaign, Stone was so insane that he (was forced to) quit because of all the controversy surrounding him. Apparently, he didn t want to upstage the candidate s own controversies. Now he says he has been poisoned because he knows too much about Russia, only it s not Russia, he says, that s doing the poisoning.On Tuesday, Stone appeared on conspiracy nut Alex Jones  InfoWars claiming that he had been poisoned with polonium, which is Putin and the Russian s poison of choice. However, Stone is making the claim that it was Congress (or something) that poisoned him. I became extremely ill. This manifested itself in over 14 days of high fever, delirium, night sweats, I had lesions on my chest and my face,  Stone explained to Jones.  The general consensus is I was poisoned. I was poisoned with polonium or a substance that has the characteristics of polonium and this made me exceedingly ill.

" WATCH: Wife Of Trump’s Doc Goes Batsh*t CRAZY On CNN, Threatens To Call Cops","Dr. Harold Bornstein has been practicing medicine for decades, but it wasn t until Donald Trump released a special note   written by him   that he actually became known around the country. The note, which raved about Trump s health, was full of typos and unprofessional language, earning criticism from the medical community and the media.To try to clear a few things up, CNN tried to interview Bornstein outside his office, but that interview came to an abrupt spot when the eccentric doctor s wife intervened and went totally nuts. Before the interview was cut short, CNN s Drew Griffin had been asking Bornstein about his reaction to all the backlash the infamous Trump note has gotten, and tried to get some clarity on whether or not the doctor had actually written the note in five minutes, as previously suggested. Noting that many in the medical community were saying Bornstein was a lunatic, Griffin grilled Bornstein about the note, which read if elected, Mr. Trump will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. Really, it sounds like Trump wrote the note himself. Bornstein responded: Well, a lunatic doesn t have my credentials. The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years. Griffin pressed Bornstein about the unprofessional language when describing Trump s health as  astonishingly excellent    something that had raised a lot of red flags amongst analysts. Bornstein began to get uncomfortable and say he was  rushed for time  and  had people to see. CNN was allowed to continue the interview in the hallway to save Bornstein time (they weren t allowed inside because Bornstein said his wife would be furious if she caught him conducted the interview). It was only a few moments before Bornstein s wife found out what was happening, flipped out and threatened to call the police on the network.You can watch the scene unfold below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 2, 2016"
COLLEGE SOCIALIST GROUP Incites Children To Yell: “Kill Donald Trump!” [VIDEO],"The Knights for Socialism held an event where they allowed students to bash Pinatas with the faces of President Donald J. Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and presidential advisor Steve Bannon.East Orlando Post obtained exclusive footage from UCF College Republican Douglas Mactye, which includes disturbing content involving an elementary to middle school aged student yelling  Kill Trump.  The young children were being encouraged to hit the Pinatas by members of the Knights for Socialism for the duration. The  Killl Trump  segment can be seen during the ninth minute of the video:The footage also shows a bearded man wearing an  Antifa International  sweatshirt, presumably monitoring the event for the Knights for Socialism. Antifa has been responsible for violent Anti-Trump riots across the country that have resulted in millions of dollars in damage, vicious beatings of Trump supporters, and even shutting down Milo Yiannopoulos  campus talk at Berkeley.In an interview to campus based mainstream news source Knight News, Knights for Socialism president Dylan J. Tyer claimed the event was not negative at all and completely welcoming.  There s been no negativity by any means but definitely a lot of interest and a lot of good conversations with people.  However, Tyer is clearly seen in our exclusive footage yelling about  Beating Pete Sessions  face in,  among other violent profanities.Justin York, a UCF alumnus who once served as Chairman of the UCF College Republicans labeled the event as  extremely hypocritical  and a  red flag.   I think it is shocking that the university would permit a group of students to hang pinata-type effigies of President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be beaten and battered.Student takes a whack @realDonaldTrump pi ata pic.twitter.com/ckQocMgwHU  UCF Knight News (@UCFKnightNews) February 10, 2017 Video, captured by the East Orlando Post, documents a group of children showing up to the event and asking if they can hit the pi atas and if they can also kill Trump.Read more: DAILY CALLER",politics,"Feb 13, 2017"
 WATCH: Trump Just Told All The Anti-Gay Bigots And Mike Pence To Go F*ck Themselves,"A whole lot of evangelical Trump voters just discovered they got duped.By picking Mike Pence as his vice-president, Donald Trump sent a message to the LGBT community that their rights are in jeopardy of being rolled back.In fact, one of the reasons why so many conservative  Christians  tossed their alleged  morality  out the window to vote for him was precisely because they believed he would pass a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage or pack the courts with anti-gay bigots to strike down all the rulings in favor of marriage equality.But during his interview on 60 minutes with Leslie Stahl on Sunday night, Trump once again backed off another campaign promise. Do you support marriage equality?  Stahl asked Trump. It s irrelevant because it s already settled,  Trump replied.  It s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it s done. When Stahl pointed out that Trump s Supreme Court nominees could reverse Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that made same-sex marriage constitutional across the nation, Trump made it clear that he believes it s settled. These cases have gone to the Supreme Court,  Trump said.  They ve been settled. And I m fine with that.

It s also going to piss off all the evangelicals who voted for Trump with the expectation that he would be a puppet for their hateful agenda.Hopefully, Trump keeps his word, but he s already broken most of the promises he made to his supporters so it s hard to believe that he won t flip-flop again.

"Potential Shift: Trump Warns Israel, ‘New Settlements May Not Help Peace in Middle East’","21st Century Wire says Incredibly, Donald Trump may have just thrown an executive head fake to Bibi Netanyahu.Back in December 2015 during the GOP primary campaign,the Israeli Lobby started getting very interested in Trump after he appeared to blame Israel for not securing a lasting peace agreement with the Palestinians. You could hear a pin drop in the debate hall when Trump opined: I have a real question as to whether or not both sides want to make it,  Trump said, before explaining that his concerns predominantly reside with  one side in particular [Israel]. Months later, and only days before the Republican Party s National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, Trump abandoned any pretence of  neutrality  on the Israel-Palestine issue, insisting that he was now firmly committed  to supporting Israeli settlement expansion in the illegal occupied territories, as well as not recognizing a Palestinian State.At the time this was music to Netanyahu s ears, and even better for the US-based Israel Lobby who spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year to buy-off US Congressmen and Senators in for for Israel to get everything it wants and desires.And then this happened this week By Abby Phillip and Karen DeYoung Washington PostThe White House on Thursday gently warned Israel that new or expanded settlements in the West Bank  may not be helpful  in achieving a Middle East peace, while insisting it has no  official position on settlement activity. A statement issued by press secretary Sean Spicer said that although the administration does not believe settlements are  an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. The American desire for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians has remained unchanged for 50 years,  Spicer s statement said, a reference to President Trump s insistence that a return to the Middle East negotiating table is a goal he hopes to achieve.While the statement carefully parsed it words, it marked a step away from what some Trump officials   and the president s designated new ambassador to Israel   have said in favor of settlements. Trump s first foreign call as president was to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he has been sharply critical of former president Barack Obama, whom he characterized as weak on Israel.The apparent genesis of the statement was a story in Thursday s Jerusalem Post, which quoted an unnamed senior administration official telling Netanyahu s government to stop a spree of housing construction approved since Trump s inauguration, lest it interfere with Trump s plans to work toward a peace plan Continue this story at the Washington PostSEE ALSO: The Genealogy of Trump s U-Turn on PalestineREAD MORE ISRAEL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Israel FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"February 2, 2017"
 Donald Trump Is Time’s Person Of The Year — So Was Hitler… And Stalin… And Putin,"Donald Trump has been crowned 2016 Person of the Year by Time Magazine. He is no doubt over the moon with all of his  winning.  The rest of us were left looking at his orange face staring back from the cover and wondering WTF? However, when you look at past recipients of this award you begin to see that maybe this designation is fitting after all.Adolf Hitler started WWII and inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented level. He was responsible for the  death of tens of millions of people, including more than 20 million in the Soviet Union.  Hitler was the man behind concentration camps and gas chambers. And he was named Man of the Year by Time in 1938.Image via TimeJoseph Stalin  was the dictator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1929 to 1953. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was transformed from a peasant society into an industrial and military superpower. However, he ruled by terror, and millions of his own citizens died during his brutal reign.  He was named Time s Man of the Year twice, receiving the title in both 1939 and 1942.Image via TimeMore recently, in 2007, Vladimir Putin was Time s Person of the Year. This guy requires no history lesson. He is the president of Russia and was so anxious for Trump to win the presidency that he interfered in the U.S. election to ensure Hillary Clinton was defeated.Image via TimeWhen you look at it in that context, Trump being named this year s Person of the Year isn t so out of place. Indeed, Time has bestowed this award upon some of the most brutal dictators in recent history. With this understanding, Trump s face on the cover is all the more terrifying. Actually, it makes you wonder if maybe, just maybe, Time is trying to tell us something.Featured image via Twitter screen shot",News,"December 7, 2016"
 Republican Candidate Gets Caught Calling For Lynching President Obama,"A Minnesota Republican is desperately trying to convince voters that his years worth of racist, sexist, and anti-gay Facebook posts no longer reflect who he is.Nolan West is a former GOP aide who is now running for a seat in the Minnesota statehouse.But he apparently didn t think that his social media posts were fair game, so when the Minneapolis Star Tribune started writing a story about all of his offensive and hateful statements he rushed to scrub his account of everything going all the way back to 2008 when he called for lynching President Obama soon after he was first elected in 2008. IT S LYNCHING TIME,  West wrote.And it s not hard to see where West gets his hatred of the first African-American president from. West also posted praise of the Confederacy and expressed his utter disdain for Abraham Lincoln. As we all know, the Confederacy started a Civil War to keep slavery legal while Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and kept the Union together.According to the Star Tribune:On the day South Carolina removed the Confederate battle flag from its statehouse grounds in 2015, West reposted an advertisement for the flags on his Facebook page, continuing his history of publicly expressing admiration for the Confederacy and disdain for Lincoln.West is currently on House GOP staff while running for the north Metro suburban seat vacated by retiring Rep. Tim Sanders, R-Blaine.In 2011 West marked the day Confederate President Jefferson Davis resigned from the U.S. Senate, 150 years earlier. West also called Lincoln, a fellow Republican,  the single worst president this country has ever seen. In addition, the Star Tribune reports that West also posted offensive remarks about women and gay people.West, of course, offered what should be considered a fake apology and claimed he is not the same person that he has been for the last 8 years. I apologize for posting insensitive material,  West wrote in an email.  I ve taken those posts down because they do not reflect who I am or what I believe. And rather than drop out of the race in disgrace like he should, West is staying in the race, which, if Minnesota voters would like to know, is against his DFL opponent Susan Witt, who by all rights should win in a landslide so that District 37B is not represented by a racist Confederate sympathizer who clearly believes black people should still be enslaved and hanged at the end of a rope.Featured image via Twitter",News,"September 14, 2016"
 Trump Just Became First President In Modern History To Use Campaign Funds For Criminal Defense,"Donald Trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re-election campaign, having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term. But there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds: According to Reuters, he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the Russia scandal.Reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation, but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees. Federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters, but up until now, the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues.Trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters. One of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money. That helps to give Trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense. Furthermore, since the Russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected, Trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors  dollars on Russia.His campaign organization currently has nearly $12 million. When Reuters asked Trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid, he snapped,  That s none of your business. Trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the 2016 election cycle, and has been spending government money at some of those same properties, lining his pockets with public dollars. His campaign has paid one law firm Jones Day almost $4 million, some of which probably did go to help with the Russia probe. Jones Day has also responded to inquiries related to Russia, including sending documents to Congress on the campaign s behalf.Here s the sad thing: His donors, whether they know where their money is going or not, would probably cheer their chance to help Trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the Russia probe. They think they re helping him get re-elected in 2020, so they think they re helping him defeat the great deep-state witch hunt.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2017"
 New Poll Has Very Bad News For The NRA (DETAILS),"While it may not come as much of a surprise that the leadership at the National Rifle Association (NRA) has a different opinion on gun control than the average American, what is surprising is that same leadership holds a different opinion than the American gun owner. According to a new poll, at least 67 percent of gun owners in the United States believe that the organization has changed its mission from one promoting gun safety to one dominated by professional lobbyists. They say the NRA has been  overtaken by lobbyists and the interests of gun manufacturers and lost its original purpose and mission. The NRA of today looks very different from what it looked like before. In fact, for most of its history, it supported, and even wrote, gun control legislation. Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: the Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America, wrote,  Historically, the leadership of the NRA was more open-minded about gun control than someone familiar with the modern NRA might imagine. To understand the relationship the NRA has with gun control. It may help to look at who and why it was founded. After the Civil War, many people in the North believed that people in the South possessed superior skills in the area of using rifles. They blamed that for the length of the war. The national slogan for the NRA was,  Firearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.  Its main goal was to improve men s marksmanship, not ward off threats to the Second Amendment. The organization was founded in 1871.That effort didn t start until the 1970s. In 1934, the nation saw its first piece of gun control legislation signed into law. The National Firearms Act of 1934 was designed to  make it difficult for any not law abiding citizen to obtain a pistol or revolver.  It was authored, in part, by the NRA. They also helped write the Gun Control Act of 1938.When these bills were written and signed into law, Karl T. Frederick was president of the NRA. He said,  I have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons. I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses. For about a century, the NRA s motto remained the same. Then the 1960s happened. With the unrest of the assassinations and the rise of the Black Panthers, The Mulford Act was passed in California. It barred people from carrying loaded weapons around outside. While it was supported by the NRA, the backlash that it spurred also galvanized a new wave of gun support. About a decade after the act was signed into law, a group of gun rights supporters took over the NRA. They ousted the leadership and changed the motto to,  The Right Of The People To Keep And Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed. Since then, the NRA has opposed many measures that have had widespread support from the American public. In poll after poll, people say they want people who buy guns to pass background checks, they want to limit the capacity of rifles and they support common sense gun control legislation. Even Supreme Court Justice Anontin Scalia supported limiting some of this. In his Heller v. DC decision, Scalia wrote,  Nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. New data show more support for gun control from gun owners. While the NRA leadership says one thing, the average gun owner thinks another. A few years ago, Wayne LaPierre, NRA chief, said,  The only thing that can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun.  This is the response from gun owners to that new poll.For its part, the NRA is disputing the accuracy of the poll. Jennifer Baker, spokesperson for the NRA said,  The NRA s strength is derived from our five million members and the tens of millions of Second Amendment supporters who vote. The majority of Americans oppose gun control and they made their voices heard this past November. This was a poll paid for by a gun control group, so it s not surprising that the so called  results  further their agenda. Public Policy Polling conducted the poll between April 19 and 20. It included 661 people who own guns. The margin of error is four percentage points. Americans for Responsible Solutions commissioned the poll.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"April 25, 2017"
TRUMP HITS BACK After Cowgirl Congresswoman Trashes Him Over Words Said to Grieving Widow,"The left is going ballistic over supposed words said by President Trump to a grieving military widow.  President Trump made a call to Myeshia Wilson that s been turned into a political football by the left to make Trump out to be  crazy . Wilson s husband was killed in Niger while serving in our military so President Trump was making a sympathy call to Mrs. Wilson. Unfortunately, Wilson s family has been put in the middle of an effort to bash Trump.The media also wasted no time covering this story. They re doing their best to try and make Trump look as bad as possible Just another day in the life of the lefty media.Far left Congresswoman  Frederica Wilson jumped right in to trash Trump after the call. She s following the left s narrative by claiming Trump is a  sick man .  It s pretty funny that Wilson calls Trump crazy while wearing a glittery cowgirl hat 24/7.The  Resist  movement includes Wilson who refused to go to Trump s inauguration. Wilson also attacked the president in May when she said said he  needs psychological help and is desperate for attention.  Perhaps Cowgirl Wilson should look in the mirror .According to left leaning propaganda news NBC: He said,  But you know he must ve known what he signed up for,  the Democrat recounted Trump saying more than once during the call to express his sympathy. According to Wilson, the conversation lasted somewhere from three to five minutes. Everyone knows when you go to war you could possibly not come back alive but you don t remind a grieving widow of that,  Wilson said.  That s so insensitive. Trump  didn t even remember his name,  Wilson recalled Myeshia Johnson telling her after the call ended, the congresswoman told MSNBC s  Morning Joe  Wednesday. She hung up the phone and said,  He didn t even remember his name,  Wilson said.  That s the hurting part. The White House said Tuesday that the president had called the families of all four service members who were killed.  He offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their family s extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,  the White House said.Asked about Wilson s characterization of the call, a White House official said Tuesday night that  the president s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private. PETE HEGSETH POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS HOW FAR THE LEFT WILL GO TO TRASH TRUMP:Pete Hegseth said on  Fox & Friends  that this is another example of Trump s opponents taking every opportunity to twist or spin his words, even if it involves a fallen soldier. They want to question at every turn what he says he s committed to,  Hegseth said.  There s no one more committed, I believe, to our service members, to our veterans than this president. He said this shows how committed Democrats are to resisting Trump no matter what.TRUMP HITS BACK:Trump hit back at the claims saying he has proof of what was said on the call:Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017Wilson took no time in shooting back that Trump is a  sick man . She s clearly milking this for all it s worth. It s sick that this Democrat would use this call to a grieving widow to bash our president.",left-news,"Oct 18, 2017"
 First Trump-Pence Interview Gets Very Awkward When They’re Asked This Simple Question (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, conducted their first joint interview on Saturday. The interview was conducted by Lesley Stahl on CBS  60 Minutes. The full interview does not air until Sunday night. However, CBS released a teaser for the interview that shows that the two candidates are starting to look more like two students forced to work together on a science fair project than a presidential duo.In the preview, Stahl questions Pence about an essay he wrote where he said that he felt that negative campaigning was wrong: You said negative campaigning is wrong. And a  campaign ought to demonstrate the basic decency of the candidate.  With that in mind, what do you think about your running mate s campaign, and the tone and the negativity of it? I think this is a good man who s been talking about the issues the American people care about,  Pence said referring to Trump.Pence said that he wrote the essay  a long time ago.  He continued saying that  I said campaigns oughta be about something more important than just one candidate s election. And, and this campaign and Donald Trump s candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about. Stahl continued to press Pence on the issue of negative campaigning, and that s when Trump decided he needed to jump in to clarify that he is a huge fan of negative campaigning, but Pence does not think that way or share the belief that negative campaigning is great. We re different people,  Trump interrupted.  I understand that. I ll give you an example. Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton, that was just proven last week. Hillary Clinton   you better believe it. Hillary Clinton is a crook. Trump continued, only to reiterate that he does, in fact, think that calling people mean names is a great thing to do. I call her  Crooked Hillary.  She s Crooked Hillary,  he said.  He won t. I don t, I didn t ask him to do it, but I don t think he should do it because it s different for him.

" NY Gov. Cuomo Directly Threatens Businesses: ‘If You Boycott Israel, New York Will Boycott You’","In an unprecedented and unconstitutional move, New York s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has issued an executive order creating a blacklist of businesses in the state that are involved in the BDS movement against Israel. BDS stands for boycott, divest and sanction, and is a major way of protesting Israel s illegal actions in Palestine.The order actually tells state officials to compile a list of businesses involved in the BDS movement so Cuomo can order the State of New York to boycott them. As Baher Azmy, of the Center for Constitutional Rights, put it, this is 21st century McCarthyism, and it s vile.Speaking at the exclusive Harvard Club, Cuomo had the gall to say: If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you. If you divert revenues from Israel, New York will divert revenues from you. If you sanction Israel, New York will sanction you. Citizens United pretty much gave businesses First Amendment rights, and this violates those rights. Cuomo is using government power to coerce   even force   businesses into supporting Israel whether they want to or not. He called BDS an  economic attack on Israel  that must be stopped.While various states have bills in their legislatures that would likewise sanction businesses involved with the BDS movement, Cuomo s executive order gives him immediate power to take care of these businesses with a list that will be made public once it s finished. He even said that passing legislation can often be tedious, as though that s justification enough for issuing an order like this.Omar Barghouti, a founder of the BDS movement, said this isn t surprising and explained what Israel is busy doing: Having lost many battles for hearts and minds at the grass-roots level, Israel has adopted since 2014 a new strategy to criminalize support for B.D.S. from the top,  he said in an email, adding that such actions were meant to  shield Israel from accountability.' Israel will live by the sword for as long as it can; it will occupy all of the land for as long as it can, and it s afraid its time will draw to a close sooner rather than later if the U.S. officially condemns their actions in Palestine. As such, they re brainwashing us.Alphonso David, Cuomo s general counsel, said that this order specifies the BDS movement, but would target any boycott aimed at Israel. He also said it s meant to send a message about the BDS movement: Mr. David said in an interview that the executive action was meant to send a clear message that  the B.D.S. movement is deplorable.  He added that the governor s order was not meant to be interpreted as  opining on actions taken to empower Palestinians,  or meant to discourage debate over Israeli actions in the Middle East. Rather, it intends to stake a position on a movement that  the State of New York unequivocally rejects,  as the order puts it. The State of New York can reject whatever it wants.

" Trump Is FUMING Over Bad Charlottesville Press, Becomes A Terror In The White House (TWEET)","Once again, Donald Trump is having a completely disappointing, inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.Apparently, instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others, Trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak, pathetic response to the incident. According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling. In no mood for talk about moderation. Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. He never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. What happened in Charlottesville was an opportunity for Trump to emerge as a different president than most Americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. There is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.Featured image via Branden Camp  / Getty Images",News,"August 15, 2017"
TED CRUZ Demands We Put Immediate Halt On Plans To Bring Refugees With Terror Ties To America,"Thank God America has people like Ted Cruz in our Senate, who are unafraid speak out against the enemy, and fight for the safety and security of our nation. Now, if we could only get our  Commander in Chief  to accurately identify and confront the enemy America must stand with our allies against the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. This is an evil that does not discriminate between French, German or American, Christian, Muslim or Jew, soldier, football player, or concert goer. Their only goal is to murder those who do not submit to their vicious, totalitarian ideology. Our deepest condolences go out to our French allies, and I know the government of the United States stands by to offer any assistance necessary. We must now face the facts. Between the downing of the Russian jet over Egypt and this massive coordinated attack on Paris, we are seeing an unmistakable escalation of ISIS  ambitions and the scale of their terrorist attacks outside Syria and Iraq. Even as chaos rages in Paris, we need to take immediate, commonsense steps to preserve our own safety. We need to consult closely with our NATO allies who may be targeted for additional attacks. We need to immediately declare a halt to any plans to bring refugees that may have been infiltrated by ISIS to the United States. We need to redouble our efforts to prevent ISIS agents from penetrating our nation by other means. Such steps, however, are defensive reactions to an enemy that will continue to try to attack us until they succeed once again. We must immediately recognize that our enemy is not  violent extremism.  It is the radical Islamism that has declared jihad against the west. It will not be appeased by outreach or declarations of tolerance. It will not be deterred by targeted airstrikes with zero tolerance for civilian casualties, when the terrorists have such utter disregard for innocent life. We must make it crystal clear that affiliation with ISIS and related terrorist groups brings with it the undying enmity of America that it is, in effect, signing your own death warrant.

 Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO),"On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Heartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonHeartbroken Father Speaks Out After Cops Murder SonPosted by The Young Turks on Thursday, December 31, 2015Following the death of her son, Janet Cooksey, Quintonio LeGrier s mother, asked a very important question during a December 27th press conference.  Who are we supposed to call? As Cenk Uygur points out in the video above, calling police for help is the last thing we should do if a family member is dealing with an emotional or mental health issue. Communities must come up with their own solutions to provide safe intervention services for families, that do not involve police.It seems one solution might be to organize community task forces, which would be made up of people who are trained to provide crisis intervention and mental health services to families. Community task forces could provide families with an alternative to police involvement, saving lives and preventing mentally ill family members from becoming victims of an unjust  justice  system, in which the only options are generally incarceration or execution.As TYT points out, people who are experiencing a mental health crisis are more likely to be killed by police than any other segment of the population.It s simply not safe to call police for help in the United States. It time for communities to come together to create alternatives that protect children and families in crisis, rather than causing them irreparable harm.As Uygur asks in the video,  What if this were your kid and not a Black kid? Our society can not continue to look the other way while our police brutally murder other human beings. We cannot keep blaming the victims of these Gestapo-style executions, while excusing and defending the officers that kill in cold blood.Featured image via Facebook",News,"January 1, 2016"

A video has emerged showing the interview where Hillary told Amanpour that she believed the DACA kids should be sent back.During the exchange, Clinton had some tough words for the children of illegal immigrants, including waves of unaccompanied minors coming in 2014   telling Amanpour that the United States was a nation of laws and that they probably had to go.Watch at the 2:20 mark: The exchange went like this:AMANPOUR:  So, you re saying they should be sent back now? CLINTON:  Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families. And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we ve got to do more. I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security.But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn t mean the child gets to stay. So, we don t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey. Of course, Hillary is never one to keep her promises. As soon as she began campaigning, she began to change her tune on DACA: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back,  said Clinton.

That was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics. Period. Make no mistake, it was a house divided, but it seems that the White House achieved its chief objective   to stop the public relations hemorrhaging, for now at least.One unusual aspect of this Trump speech   reports suggest that the President actually spent the day of his first address to a joint session of Congress revising and rehearsing his speech.It seemed to have paid off.

 The GOP Congress Just Moved To Let Big Banks And The Super Rich Screw You Over,"The biggest threat to the oligarchy is for the  little guy  to have a voice, any type of voice. Republicans hate when poor people, especially minorities, vote, and now they want to restrict the way we can vote with our money.The bill, which would eliminate the banking regulations made law in 2010, as a response to the near collapse of the economy, in Dodd-Frank. As if that wasn t bad enough, there s an easter egg in the bill that would for all intents and purposes, silence small investors.Under current law, any investor, as long as they own about $2,000 in stocks, has the right to attend shareholder meetings and file proposals. In other words, any investor has a voice in how a company is run. Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R) chairs the House Financial Services Committee and his bill, which would replace Dodd-Frank, would also limit the number of people who have a voice to at most 100 people. Under his bill, only shareholders who own at least one percent of the company have any voice at all.That doesn t sound huge but think about it for a moment. Exxon is worth $392 billion. To have a voice at all, you would need to own almost $4 billion in stock. That means that if you aren t happy with Exxon s drilling practices, the company will tell you to screw yourself.If you think shareholders are generally already sympathetic to the direction of any given company, you d be wrong. There are many examples throughout history of shareholders forcing companies to do the right thing.Here s just one example:Appalled by a Bloomberg Markets Magazine cover story that linked American steel company Nucor Corp. to pig iron suppliers in Brazil who used slave labor, an investment firm with a stake in Nucor called for corrective action. Their mechanism: a shareholder resolution. The proposal appeared on Nucor s 2009 proxy statement prior to a yearly shareholder meeting   and 27 percent of the company s shareholders voted in favor it.Nucor stalled at first, but within a year, the steelmaker told the stakeholding company, Domini Social Investments LLC (now Domini Impact Investments) that it had begun requiring its manufacturers to sign an agreement with a group of nongovernmental organizations, including a pledge to break ties altogether with the suppliers using forced labor.Source: IB TimesShareholders have also been quite effective at forcing companies to be more environmentally friendly.Just who are these soon to be disenfranchised shareholders? Well, they can be anyone with a 401K or a pension. In other words, they can be you or me.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"April 24, 2017"
ARIZONA BIKERS ARE ABOUT To Become Violent “Dreamers” Worst Nightmare At Upcoming Phoenix Trump Rally," The Left has been itching for a fight the only problem is, they ve been itching for a fight against Trump supporters who re outnumbered so they can t fight back. They may be biting off a bit more than they can chew this time around A group of bikers said it plans to protect supporters from possible violence at a Donald Trump rally scheduled to be held in Phoenix on Saturday. We re going to stand between them and any protesters that come onto the property and hopefully protect them from any bodily harm, should it get to that point,  Cindy Perrin with Lions Guard Arizona said.The rally is expected to begin Saturday about 4 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the Arizona State Fairgrounds near 19th Avenue and McDowell Road.The protest will be held at nearby Encanto Park from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.Perrin said the biker group, made up mostly of retired police officers, such as herself, and veterans, will be wearing American flag bandanas so they are easy to identify. If they have any problems, they ll be able to locate us and ask us for help,  she said.Perrin said her group is not expecting things to take a violent turn outside of Trump s rally, unlike several events the presumptive Republican presidential nominee hosted in California. We re not expecting it to get to that point in Arizona,  she said.The bikers will not be the only group attempting to keep things calm on Saturday. Arizona Department of Public Safety Capt. Damon Cecil said his organization has reached out to groups both for and against Trump. Most of those groups   not all, but most of those groups   we have talked to their leadership and got assurances their protests were going to be peaceful,  he said.Protest organizers are also hoping things remain civil. My message to the folks that want to protest is: You know what? Why don t you pick up a clipboard, let s get some voter registrations and get some more families registered to vote who will vote against Trump come November,  Tony Navarette with Promise Arizona said.DREAM Act advocate Carmen Cornejo said protesters who act violently are doing nothing more than falling into line with Trump s rhetoric.

LOL! DONALD TRUMP JR. Has HILARIOUS Response To Dinesh D’Souza’s Tweet About Donna Brazile Fearing For Her Life For Crossing Hillary,"In her new book  Hacks , Donna Brazile expressed concern for her safety after DNC staffer s mysterious murder:I felt some responsibility for Seth Rich s death. I didn t bring him into the DNC, but I helped keep him there working on voting rights. With all I knew now about the Russians  hacking, I could not help but wonder if they had played some part in his unsolved murder.But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.Brazile was so concerned with Rich s death that she used her brief, only phone call from Hillary Clinton after the election loss to bring him up. She asked Clinton to use some of the millions of dollars the campaign had in order to set up a reward fund to find his murderer. But Hillary said she  really had to go. I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said. We re going to get to that. But she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list, and I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.Dinesh D Souza tweeted in response to the excerpts from Brazile s book about her fears about crossing Hillary:   When Donna Brazile feared for her life for crossing the Clintons you know you are dealing with an unscrupulous gang of thugs When Donna Brazile feared for her life for crossing the Clintons you know you are dealing with an unscrupulous gang of thugs pic.twitter.com/Ze2omu1ypG  Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) November 5, 2017Donald Trump Jr., whose epic tweets have become  must reads  for anyone who loves a good laugh, had this hilarious response about Brazile s fear of Hillary Clinton (think Vince Foster) to Dinesh D Sousa s tweet: I assume she was very fearful of involuntary suicide??? https://t.co/sMM45gnTUE  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 5, 2017",left-news,"Nov 8, 2017"

One of the most important things for voters to evaluate in any election is the full measure of a candidate s views, ideas, and temperament over time,  the website states. In making a choice for president, voters must also consider how various candidates present themselves to the public and to the world. There are few things more important in that regard than access to video or audio in the form of prior television or radio interviews or more candid video from events a candidate may have attended.

" Republicans Did This, And Now Britain Is Warning Its Citizens To Avoid America","Once again, states run by conservative Republicans have provoked international embarrassment for America. This time, it is because our British allies now have to warn their LGBT citizens about traveling to southern states that recently passed anti-LGBT laws.Britain has issued a new warning for LGBT travelers visiting parts of the United States: Be wary.In an update to its U.S. travel advisory, the British Foreign Office highlighted the anti-gay laws recently passed in North Carolina and Mississippi. The U.S. is an extremely diverse society and attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,  the advisory stated.  LGBT travelers may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi. Before traveling please read our general travel advice for the LGBT community. North Carolina and Missippi have lost revenue due to businesses (Paypal, Pepsi and many others) canceling plans to open facilities there and musicians like Bruce Springsteen and Pearl Jam deciding to cancel concert dates in those states   all because a minority of anti-LGBT bigots have decided to pass laws based on the myth of transgender bathroom predators.The so-called bathroom bills are laws correcting a problem that doesn t actually exist, in order to make conservative politicians look good to their base by attacking a group of Americans. It is what the right has devolved to and is part of their desperate attempts to keep so-called  values voters  perpetually on the edge and consistently voting for conservative Republican political candidates.In response to the British Foreign Office, the Human Rights campaign issued a statement noting,  It is both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation s staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks of traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi because of anti-LGBT laws passed by their elected officials. It s even more bizarre that the supposedly pro-business right would push these laws, since the states who pass them will suffer economically.

 Trump Gets DESTROYED By Chuck Todd After ‘Sleepy Eyes’ Twitter Attack (TWEETS),"Yesterday, 70-year-old Donald Trump resorted to acting like a 5-year-old again by attacking NBC News  Chuck Todd over Twitter.Unable to process emotions like a grown-up and handle the fact that not everyone will like or agree with him, Trump reignited his Twitter feud with Todd by calling him  Sleepy Eyes  after being upset about Todd s coverage of his rally in North Carolina. Trump also ended up calling Todd  disloyal  for criticizing him, and eventually saying that he didn t want to even talk about him (even though several of Trump s tweets are just about Todd). He tweeted: Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C. TwitterTrump followed this up with another tweet with the  Sleepy Eyes  insult: I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton.

According to Business Insider, Trump has called Chuck Todd  Sleepy Eyes  16 times over the last 4 years, and he clearly wanted to stir things up again. But Trump s Twitter attacks fell flat, as Todd proved that he knows just how to handle moronic internet bullies like Trump   ignore them. Todd responded on Twitter, and shut the whole thing down in one sentence:TwitterThis tweet went out about an hour after Todd s Meet The Press Daily panel discussed Trump s disastrous search for a running mate, noting that several of the business mogul s picks for VP were pulling out. Todd has been one of Trump s most outspoken critics in the media, having previously called him out on his hypocritical attacks against his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.TwitterTrump has previously moaned and whined about Meet The Press being  totally biased  and against  him, and that s how Todd and NBC know they re doing something right.

 Kellyanne Conway Embarrasses Herself During Capitol Hill Meeting And Then Runs Away,"Kellyanne Conway was sent to meet with congressional staffers on Capitol Hill. It didn t go well.Conway and Boris Epshteyn apparently spoke to 100 communications staffers representing Republican senators to tell them what roles they are playing in the government, especially since Conway repeatedly lies for Trump on television and clearly has a lot of power in the White House.During one line of questioning, Conway was asked about the 1.5 million Americans who have called the Congressional switchboard to voice their opposition to Donald Trump s Education nominee Betsy DeVos.Conway responded by saying that she only gives a damn about her own  Real Person Impact  meter and suggested that those 1.5 million Americans are not real human beings because they oppose Trump. She basically said the people jamming up the phones don t matter to this White House,  an attendee told Politico.  That this administration just cares about what matters to  real people. The disdain Conway and Trump have against dissenting Americans is absolutely disgraceful. She is literally saying that it doesn t matter what the American people think and that Republicans should just shove their agenda down ours throats.But Conway wasn t done humiliating herself on Capitol Hill.After ridiculing the concerns of Americans about DeVos, a staffer asked about her reaction to Saturday Night Live s skit featuring Melissa McCarthy as Sean Spicer. A staffer said that her  face turned to stone  and she abruptly ended the meeting and ran away like a coward. They definitely did not find it funny,  the source said.  And then they walked out. The White House later disputed the claim and proceeded to brag about how Conway received an ovation from the staffers, something that did NOT happen.Clearly, Trump and his team are still delusional and believe that everyone loves them and what they are doing when, in fact, the exact opposite is the truth.Seriously, Kellyanne Conway has no business working in the White House and she definitely has no business being interviewed by the media.

 Hillary’s Latest Challenge To Progressives Is One That Needs To Be Taken Very Seriously (VIDEO),"Appearing on Face the Nation this past Sunday, Hillary Clinton was posed a question by host John Dickerson surrounding voters and how many want what they want, even when it comes to their candidate of choice. Dickerson insinuated that Hillary may be trying to get Bernie Sanders out of the race. However, when it comes down to who is going to win the nomination, many voters are undoubtedly going to be disappointed, because their candidate was not the one chosen. Yet, those voters will still have a voice, a voice that needs to be heard, and a message that needs to be spread far and wide.Hillary s response was honest, clear, to the point, and one that needs to be heard by every progressive everywhere who doesn t want to see the nation fall into the hands of Donald Trump. She said: I m three million votes ahead of Senator Sanders, nearly 300 pledged delegates ahead of him. He has to make his own mind up.But I was very heartened to hear him say last week that he is going to work seven days a week to make sure Donald Trump doesn t become president. And I want to unify the party. I see a great role and opportunity for him and his supporters to be part of that unified party, to move into not just November to win the election against Donald Trump, but to then govern based on the progressive goals that he and I share.We both want to raise the minimum wage. We both understand you have got to rein in bad actors on Wall Street and in corporate America to make sure they don t wreck Main Street. We have a lot of the same goals. And I hope we can unify around them. And she s absolutely correct. While the means to achieve some of the goals are different, the goals, nonetheless, are pretty much the same. While Bernie wants to overhaul health care and education in one fell swoop, Hillary wants the same things, but done over time. It s all about unifying behind the message and making sure we get there somehow, because if Donald Trump is to become president, or we can t manage to turn Congress blue again, honestly, it won t really matter who is president. Everything that needs to get done would be virtually impossible (see also: President Barack Obama with Republican Congress).No matter who the Democratic candidate for president is, it s time to unite behind them with the common goal of progress for the greater good, not just the few on top.

Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway pretty much lost all her credibility when she claimed, in an interview with Chris Matthews, that there was a Bowling Green massacre which was somehow the fault of President Obama. There wasn t. I bet it s brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. Entire twitter feeds sprung up over Conway s made up massacre. Conway s defense was that she misspoke and that the media is just being mean to her..@KellyannePolls:  I misspoke one word. The corrections in the newspapers who are attacking me are 3 paragraphs long every day.  pic.twitter.com/lA0wLk1my8  Fox News (@FoxNews) February 5, 2017Except, this isn t the first time she talked about the Bowling Green massacre and she had even elaborated on it in an interview with, of all sources, Cosmopolitan.(I)n an interview with Cosmopolitan.com conducted by phone days earlier, on Sunday, Jan. 29, Conway used the same phrasing, claiming that President Barack Obama called for a temporary  ban on Iraqi refugees  after the  Bowling Green massacre.  (The quotes did not appear in either of two stories recently published on Cosmopolitan.com.) He did, it s a fact,  she said of Obama.  Why did he do that? He did that for exactly the same reasons. He did that because two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers  lives away. In other words, Cosmo did the job that Chris Matthews failed to do.What Conway was referring to is the fact that there were two Iraqi men, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan, who were refugees and did become radicalized (in the United States, not in Iraq), but were arrested before carrying anything out.While Conway tried to tie the massacre that wasn t to Obama s non-existent travel ban, the facts show that Obama handled the situation very well. They administered a toughing vetting process for Iraqi refugees for six months. There was no ban, and as Cosmo has shown, there was no misstatement on Conway s part.Read more:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"February 6, 2017"
OUCH! NEW BOOK Takes Readers Inside Hillary’s Nasty Campaign: Self-Righteous Hillary Was ‘so mad she couldn’t think straight’…Attacked Her Aides…Focused Too Much On Black Voters…Bill Gave Aides An “Ass-Chewing”,"The failed Presidential candidate attacked her aides with a  potent mix of exhaustion and exasperation  after the embarrassing loss to her rival Bernie Sanders in March last year.Clinton s top staff said she was  visibly, unflinchingly p***ed off at us  and blamed them for making her look  vulnerable .During another tirade Bill Clinton took over and gave aides an  a** chewing  on the phone and told them to  do their d**n jobs .The details of the rows show the tensions at the top of Clinton s presidential campaign, tensions that she did her best to keep quiet during the election.They are revealed in  Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton s Doomed Campaign , which is out next week and delivers the scathing verdict that her campaign was  living in denial .The book says that neither Clinton nor her husband  could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations .  Daily MailAn extract of the book was published by The Hill which said it showed that Clinton s campaign was  plagued by bickering : We Got An Ass-Chewing Hillary was so mad she couldn t think straight. She was supposed to be focused on the prep session for that night s Univision debate in Miami, but a potent mix of exhaustion and exasperation bubbled up inside.She d been humiliated in the Michigan primary the night before, a loss that not only robbed her of a prime opportunity to put Bernie Sandersdown for good but also exposed several of her weaknesses. How could she have been left so vulnerable? She knew   or at least she thought she did. The blame belonged to her campaign team, she believed, for failing to hone her message, energize important constituencies and take care of business in getting voters to the polls. And now, Jake Sullivan, her de facto chief strategist, was giving her lip about the last answer she d delivered in the prep session. That s not very good,  Sullivan corrected. Really?  Hillary snapped back.The room fell silent. Why don t you do it? The comment was pointed and sarcastic, but she meant it. So for the next 30 minutes, there he was, pretending to be Hillary while she critiqued his performance.Every time the Yale lawyer and former high school debate champ opened his mouth, Hillary cut him off.  That isn t very good,  she d say.  You can do better.  Then she d hammer him with a Bernie line.It wasn t just Sullivan in her crosshairs. She let everyone on her team have it that day.  We haven t made our case,  she fumed.  We haven t framed the choice. We haven t done the politics. She was visibly, unflinchingly pissed off at us as a group,  said one aide who was in the room for the humiliating scene.  And she let us know she felt that way. Hillary had been up into the wee hours the night before, agitating over her loss. This is because we made poor choices about where we traveled, she thought. She emailed Robby Mook to tell him she believed she d spent too much time in the cities of Detroit and Flint and not enough in the working-class white suburbs around them. Sensing just how angry she was, Mook responded by putting together a morning conference call so that Hillary could vent. But that didn t settle her; if anything, it left her more perplexed and angry, as her debate-prep team witnessed firsthand.Her aides took the browbeating   one of several she delivered in person and on the phone that day   in silence. They had a lot of their own thoughts on what went wrong, some of which echoed Hillary s assessment: her message was off for Michigan, and she had refused to go hard against trade; Mook had pinched pennies and failed to put organizers on the ground; the polling and analytics were a touch too rosy, meaning the campaign didn t know Bernie was ahead; she had set up an ambiguous decisionmaking structure on the campaign; and she d focused too heavily on black and brown voters at the expense of competing for the whites who had formed her base in 2008. The list went on and on.The underlying truth   the one that many didn t want to admit to themselves   was the person ultimately responsible for these decisions, the one whose name was on the ticket, hadn t corrected these problems, all of which had been brought to her attention before primary day. She d stuck with the plan, and it had cost her.Months earlier, Hillary Clinton turned her fury on her consultants and campaign aides, blaming them for a failure to focus the media on her platform.In her ear the whole time, spurring her on to cast blame on others and never admit to anything, was her husband. Neither Clinton could accept the simple fact that Hillary had hamstrung her own campaign and dealt the most serious blow to her own presidential aspirations.That state of denial would become more obvious than ever to her top aides and consultants during one conference call in the thick of the public discussion of her server. Joel Benenson, Mandy Grunwald, Jim Margolis, John Anzalone, John Podesta, Mook, Huma Abedin and Dan Schwerin were among the small coterie who huddled in Abedin s mostly bare corner office overlooking the East River at the campaign s Brooklyn headquarters. Hillary and Bill, who rarely visited, joined them by phone.Hillary s severe, controlled voice crackled through the line first. It carried the sound of a disappointed teacher or mother delivering a lecture before a whipping. That back end was left to Bill, who lashed out with abandon. Eyes cast downward, stomachs turning   both from the scare tactics and from their own revulsion at being chastised for Hillary s failures   Hillary s talented and accomplished team of professionals and loyalists simply took it. There was no arguing with Bill Clinton.You haven t buried this thing, the ruddy-cheeked former president rasped. You haven t figured out how to get Hillary s core message to the voters. This has been dragging on for months, he thundered, and nothing you ve done has made a damn bit of difference. Voters want to hear about Hillary s plans for the economy, and you re not making that happen. Now, do your damn jobs. We got an ass-chewing,  one of the participants recalled months later.Hillary came back on the line to close the lecture. It was hard to tell what was worse   getting hollered at by Bill or getting scolded by the stern and self-righteous Hillary. Neither was pleasant. You heard him, she admonished.  Get it straight.

[Video] MONTEL WILLIAMS BROUGHT TO TEARS OVER TREATMENT OF US MARINE JAILED IN IRAN #FreeAmirNow," Find out how many are going to sign up to go to war when we keep doing this to those who protect us.              Montel WilliamsMontel Williams got emotions during his appearance on Greta Van Susteren s  On The Record,  when discussing U.S. Marine veteran, Amir Hekmati who has been held in an Iranian prison for more than three years.Amir Hekmati, 31, has been jailed in the most dangerous Iranian prison for more than 1,300 days. The Iranian-American was born in Arizona but held dual citizenship when he flew to Iran to visit his dying grandmother.Hekmati was arrested and charged with spying for the United States government. He was sentenced to death, but that sentence was reversed. Hekmati was then convicted of a lesser charge and sentenced to 10 years in prison.Williams told Greta Van Susteren that the jailed Marine has been whipped and even made addicted to drugs just so that he could be tortured with withdrawal.Hekmati recently renounced his Iranian citizenship in an effort to be freed. It has become very clear to me that those responsible view Iranian-Americans not as citizens or even human beings, but as bargaining chips and tools for propaganda,  Hekmati said.  Considering how little value the Ministry of Intelligence places on my Iranian citizenship and passport, I, too, place little value on them and inform you, effective immediately, that I formally renounce my Iranian citizenship and passport.  Williams said that it s an  abomination  that Americans don t know that a U.S. Marine who served in Iraq is now imprisoned in Iran. The State Department has not been speaking to Hekmati s family, Williams said.Williams had a request tonight for Fox News viewers. Please, hashtag #FreeAmirNow, start blasting this tonight so that by tomorrow morning when these [Iran nuclear weapon] discussions get ready to come to an end, we don t leave another Marine behind,  Williams said.Via: FOX News",Government News,"Apr 10, 2015"
"BREAKING: OBAMA’S “Director Of Diversity” Donates Hundreds Of Thousands Of Tax Payer Dollars To Open Borders, Other Radical Groups","Of course anyone on Obama s  Team Fundamental Transformation of America  is exempt from any of the  consequences the rest of America would have to face for the same unlawful actions To meet the Obama administration s goal of  implementing a robust diversity strategy  at the Department of Defense (DOD), the agency s director of diversity violated government rules by distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to controversial leftist groups. Adding insult to injury, a  consulting  firm gets nearly half a million dollars from the DOD to help distribute the money to groups even those that don t qualify that support the Pentagon s  diversity strategy and program objectives. Among the recipients is the notorious open borders group League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Minority Access Inc., a Maryland-based nonprofit committed to decreasing disparities and reducing incidences of environmental injustices, and the renowned National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Others include the Society of American Indian Government Employees and the Asian American Government Executive Network. In all, the Pentagon s Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODME) gave these and other groups north of $300,000, according to a DOD Inspector General report released this month. These are considered  affinity  groups involved with networking or professional associations that are often race, ethnic background or gender based, according to the report.The high-ranking official who violated DOD and government rules by doling out the cash to unqualified  non-federal entities  (NFE) is Clarence Johnson, the DOD s Director of Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity. In 2010 Johnson, a veteran Pentagon official, was assigned to assist the Army in implementing a robust diversity strategy. The position came with a hefty budget to support diversity outreach functions and Johnson launched a cash giveaway, filling the coffers of groups that should not have received public funds. In its report the DOD watchdog concludes that Johnson  improperly co-sponsored NFEs that he had selected.  Auditors found that Johnson spent $301,000 on NFE sponsorships and recommend  corrective action.  The money flowed through a company called New Concepts Management Solutions (NCMS) that was evidently handpicked by Johnson. In 2012, the Office of Diversity Management hired a consulting firm called Deloitte for $480,554 to handle the diversity outreach allocations.Here s a brief breakdown of how some of the money was divided. The Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute Conference got $25,000, the Society of American Indian Government Employees got $12,000 for a training conference and a conglomerate called Latina Style Outreach received $20,000. LULAC and the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Corporation (HENAAC) received $25,000 each. It appears that Johnson knew well that he was violating agency rules when he headed the diversity crusade because the report reveals that the DOD Office of Special Counsel has consistently said that the agency should not  sponsor  non-federal entities like the ones Johnson gave money to. In addition to money, Johnson provided these various groups with logistical manpower compliments of Uncle Sam.It s unlikely that Johnson will face any repercussions for his transgressions or, at most, a weak slap on the hand. He certainly appears confident in testimony to investigators probing his violations.  My job is to grow, or focus on growing, the presence of minorities and women  in government jobs with higher pay scales, Johnson told investigators. He added that the mission of his office is diversity outreach, which involves informing the diverse audience. This is why he seeks affinity groups that have a  national reach  and influence.President Obama has made it his mission to culturally transform government by teaching federal workers about diversity, race and gender, healthcare disparities and cultural competencies. The effort has affected practically every major agency, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS), among others. It s been a costly initiative for taxpayers. A few months ago a Judicial Watch investigation found that the Obama administration has paid a Chicago-based firm millions of dollars to strengthen the federal workplace with its brand of diversity consulting. This includes two recent DHS contracts for $24,000 and $10,000 and one for $8,500 from the Department of Energy (DOE). Via: Judicial Watch",Government News,"Feb 4, 2016"

 ‘No Real Logic’: French Translators Having A VERY Hard Time With Trump’s Limited Vocabulary,"Reality show star turned president Donald Trump has a limited vocabulary. French translators have noticed that, too, and say they are having a tough time translating Trump s speeches into the language of Moli re. Trump is not a great orator, which is something we ve all be subjected to. Words like,  sad!  are used in his tweets as if that s a complete sentence. Trump said  bigly  when he really meant  big league.  Or maybe he didn t mean  big league.  We ll never really know. After Trump gives a speech, his supporters inevitably jump in to explain to the rest of us what he really meant.Translator B reng re Viennot told the LA Review of Books, you have to be able to get into someone s mind  to translate the speaker but  when he (Trump) speaks he seems not to know quite where he s going. He seems to hang onto a word in the question, or to a word that pops into his mind, repeating it over and over again,  said Viennot.  He shapes his thought around it and, sometimes, succeeds in giving part of an answer   often the same answer: namely, that he won the election. Trump seems to go from point A (the question) to point B (himself, most of the time) with no real logic,  she continued.  It s as if he had thematic clouds in his head that he would pick from with no need of a logical thread to link them. Trump s vocabulary is limited, his syntax is broken; he repeats the same phrases over and over, forcing the translator to follow suit,  she said.She continued to say that  reading Trump in French, which is a very structured and logical language, reveals the poor quality of his language and, consequently, of his thought. As the Independent notes, Trump once referred to  swatches of land,  when he really he meant  swathes of land. Bigly swatches of land.Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.",News,"January 24, 2017"
 GOP Implodes As Trump Launches Nasty Public Fight Against Top Republican (TWEETS),"Donald Trump is continuing to dig himself into an even deeper hole in regards to the horrific racist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia.After Trump has been blasted for his weak response by pretty much every politician   including Republicans   he s taking his critics on. At 6:19 this morning, Trump decided to go after one of the only Republicans who had the guts to call him out directly by name on Charlottesville   South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.In a pair of tweets, Trump trashed Graham for holding him accountable and asking him to condemn white supremacy and neo-Nazis in a more powerful way. Of course, Trump s attack was nothing but petty, making sure that Graham and America remember that Trump beat him in the 2015-2016 presidential primaries. Trump wrote: Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can t forget his election trouncing. The people of South Carolina will remember! Graham has been more critical than most Republicans when it comes to Trump s defense of racists and his neo-Nazi fan base. On Sunday, Graham trashed Trump on Fox News when he said: These groups seem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House. I don t know why they believe that, but they don t see me as a friend in the Senate, and I would urge the president to dissuade these groups that he s their friend. Graham had also released a statement on Twitter in which he correctly accused Trump of  dividing America,  and his response to Trump s tweets this morning was just as good.

BREAKING: ACLJ Files Lawsuit Against Obama’s Corrupt Attorney General For Secret Bill Clinton Meeting On Plane During Hillary Investigation [VIDEO],"Are the most criminal, brazen and crooked group of people to ever act as  public servants  in our government watching their house of cards fall? I told you about the Obama Justice Department s incompetence and corruption when, over four months ago, I called for Attorney General Loretta Lynch s resignation.Remember when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the husband of the former Secretary of State met on a plane on the tarmac:I told you about General Lynch s decision to hold a secret meeting on her airplane with former President Bill Clinton   just days before the FBI interviewed his wife, the former Secretary of State, as part of a criminal investigation; and just days before General Lynch announced the former Secretary of State would not be indicted. Here s what I said in June:Misconduct. Dishonesty. Impropriety. No matter what word you choose, Attorney General Lynch s secret meeting with former President Bill Clinton was flat-out wrong. She s clearly disqualified from participating in the investigations into former Secretary of State Clinton s private email server.And she must resign.I m leading our senior litigation team preparing to file legal demands and ethics complaints. If the DOJ doesn t respond and she doesn t resign, we ll be back in federal court. As promised, we took action. We sent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the Obama Justice Department and the FBI, demanding answers on how such a careless and perhaps intentionally underhanded meeting was allowed to happen.The FBI acknowledged our FOIA requests, and even granted our request for expedited processing by determining that we had shown our requests concerned  [a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government s integrity which affect public confidence.  The Justice Department remained silent.Then, last week s earth-shattering news hit that the FBI   a component of the Justice Department   was reopening the underlying criminal investigation.And early this week, the FBI advised the ACLJ Government Accountability Project that  [n]o records responsive to your request were located.  Hard to believe. What may be even harder to believe, though, is the fact that the Department of Justice completely ignored our lawful requests for records. Or maybe that s just par for the course.So today, we re forcing their hand. We re taking the Obama Administration to federal court. Again. We re filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, to ensure true justice. If the corruption and flippant disregard for the law won t stop, neither will our Government Accountability Project, and neither will our lawsuits.As we explained in our Complaint, we re demanding records like this:Any and all records containing the names of any DOJ official, staff or employee who participated in any discussion regarding the meeting between General Lynch and Bill Clinton that occurred on Monday, June 27, 2016, at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.Any and all records, communications or briefings prepared, sent, received or reviewed by General Lynch or any other DOJ official, staff or employee, at any time, containing any discussion of or in any way regarding the meeting between General Lynch and Bill Clinton that occurred on Monday, June 27, 2016, at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona.Any and all records of any communication or briefing received by General Lynch, any DOJ official, staff or employee from Bill Clinton or his staff regarding the meeting between General Lynch and Bill Clinton that occurred on Monday, June 27, 2016, at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona, regardless of whether the communication or briefing was received before, during, or after the meeting.For entire story: ACLJ ",politics,"Nov 2, 2016"

While speaking to ABC s Jonathan Karl, Nancy confused the presidency of Donald Trump with George W. Bush for the second time since President Trump s inauguration.During two public appearances in March 2017, Nancy confused Iran with Iraq, pronounced words strangely, and claimed Republicans are offering a  Mini Me  or  Mickey Mouse  budget. Ends her very strange press conference by saying,  I don t know. But there s no  there there .  We re beginning to wonder if Nancy is still  there ?Is Nancy so flustered and panicked by Trump s presidency and her diminished role in Congress that she is no longer able to speak in public?

 Republican Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Eliminate The Department Of Education Entirely,"Republicans are apparently hell-bent on destroying public education any way they can. The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in a 51-50 vote on Tuesday. And as if that weren t enough, a GOP representative introduced a bill to do away with the Department of Education entirely.Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie introduced the one-page bill, which states that the Department of Education would terminate on Dec. 31, 2018. Now, to be honest, I could understand if this were a panicked, knee-jerk reaction to DeVos  confirmation. Kind of a  smoosh it before it lays eggs  response. It wouldn t make it a good idea, but it would be understandable. Sadly, that doesn t appear to be the case at all.Massie wants to eliminate the agency, which has been in place since 1980, because he just doesn t think the federal government should be in charge of education. Instead, he thinks the issue would best be left to states and local municipalities. (Insert eye roll here.) Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students,  Massie said in a statement.Massie isn t alone on this one, as seven other Republicans have also signed onto his bill: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and Ra l Labrador (Idaho).The bill was introduced shortly after Vice President Mike Pence cast his tie-breaking to confirm DeVos. All Democrats voted against her and two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), broke ranks with their party and opposed her confirmation as well. Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep this blithering idiot from being confirmed as education secretary.Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep this blithering idiot from being confirmed as education secretary.

Bush, will headline a Planned Parenthood fundraiser next week in Texas, according to a report from the Texas Tribune.Bush is expected to be the keynote speaker at the Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas s annual Fort Worth fundraising luncheon.President Bush pushed for anti-abortion policies during his time in the White House, but his wife Laura Bush has supported legal abortion in the past.The announcement comes amid the continuing debate over federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides a variety of reproductive health services to women, including abortions.Barbara Bush is the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps and called Planned Parenthood an  exceptional organization  last year in an interview with the New York Times. Bush also attended an event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Paris.   The Hill",politics,"Feb 25, 2017"
WATCH: CNN Reporter Gets SKEWERED For MOCKING Polio Survivor Mitch McConnell After Trump Helps Him Up Stairs,"The CNN  journalist  who posted the video of President Trump helping polio survivor Mitch McConnell up the stairs, following their remarks to the press, will likely backfire, as most Americans will notice the gentle way that President Trump discreetly held Mitch McConnell s arm, as he helped him to navigate the stairs. For most Americans, this video will solidify what they already believe about him, that he is a generous and kind man and not the monster the media would like their followers to believe that he is. CNN political reporter Daniella Diaz sent a tweet on Monday pointing out that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell locked hands while walking up stairs at the White House following their Rose Garden press conference. Diaz seemed to be mocking the Republican duo   but while followers quickly pointed out that the Kentucky senator is a polio survivor, the tweet remains on her feed nearly 24 hours later. That hand-lock between Trump and McConnell, though,  Diaz wrote with video of the incident.That hand-lock between Trump and McConnell, though. https://t.co/xFClDYCmdQ  Daniella Diaz (@DaniellaMicaela) October 16, 2017A CNN colleague called out Diaz, quoting her tweet and explaining the situation.

" Jimmy Kimmel ‘Mansplained’ To Hillary How She’s Supposed To Behave, And It’s Priceless (VIDEO)","As much as the media pundits want to pretend like they re treating Hillary Clinton like everyone else running for president, the truth is, they re not. She s still criticized on what she wears, how often she smiles, and even on the tone of her voice in how she delivers her message.While the men on the campaign trail can sometimes wear some very unflattering suits or not look their finest, no one utters a word. As the men shout they re called passionate and enthusiastic, whereas Hillary is called hostile, shrill or angry. And as much as even some liberals don t want to admit there s a double-standard, there is, and it s not hard to see if you actually take the time to notice.Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night, Kimmel put together a sketch with the former Secretary of State to perfectly simulate what s been happening to Hillary throughout her campaign.Kimmel begins by asking Hillary: I m going to help you win this election no problem. Are you familiar with mansplaining? And Hillary plays it off as though she has no idea what he s talking about, so Kimmel proceeds to  mansplain  pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth. He also makes sure to stick in jabs about what she should wear and how often she should smile and/or appear serious.This is pretty much the most spot-on take on what s been happening to Hillary not only throughout this election cycle, but throughout her entire career.Absolutely perfect.

" Under The GOP’s Health Care Bill, Premiums Could Rise By Up To 850% For Low-Income Older Americans","If you are a low-income earner and over 64 years of age, just be warned: You will be paying more than half of your annual income on health insurance in the individual market under the Republican Party s new health care bill set to replace Obamacare, the American Health Care Act.The Congressional Budget Office found that the revised bill does, in fact, bring down overall premiums in the individual market at a rate of between four to twenty percent by 2026 when compared to the current law. The variation in percentage differs state-by-state, depending on whether the state accepts regulatory waivers under the American Health Care Act, which would allow insurers to offer much skimpier health plans at lower premiums. What this means is that states that allow the waivers would have far lower premiums, but the individual would be covered for a lot less, as well, whereas states that don t have the waivers would have a higher rate, but more comprehensive coverage.Premiums would also differ greatly depending on age and income and it looks pretty grim for individuals in an older age bracket who are on a fixed income.Using an annual income of $26,500 as an example, an individual aged 21 years old may have an advantage with the new scheme. Currently, under the Affordable Care Act, that individual pays an average of $1,700 per year on insurance premiums. This amount would drop to just $1,250 under the American Health Care Act if their state accepts regulatory waivers, although they would be covered for less. In a state that doesn t accept waivers, the average premiums for a 21-year-old would actually increase by around $50 per annum to about $1,750 per year.However, a 64-year-old on an annual income of $26,500 is currently still spending that average amount of $1,700 per annum on premiums under Obamacare, but things look pretty bleak under the American Health Care Act. Under the new Republican bill, roughly 60 percent of their income will go toward insurance premiums if they live in a state that doesn t accept waivers, forking out around $16,500 a year. It s still not a whole lot better in other states, where they would be paying $13,600, still more than half of their wages.If, however, that 64-year-old is making at least $68,200 per year, they look to be better off in certain situations under the Republican Party s new scheme, one whose tax credit is based on age, not income. An annual income of $68,200 is too high to receive a tax credit under Obamacare so the individual would be expected to pay $15,300 in insurance premiums, whereas under Trump s American Health Care Act, their premium would drop to $13,600 in a state that accepts regulatory waivers, but would actually increase to $16,100 in a state that doesn t.The reason for this is not just the age-factor, but also because the tax credit under the American Health Care Act starts phasing out at $75,000. Individuals on a yearly income of $75,000 or more will receive fewer, if any, subsidies under the new Republican bill and can expect to pay more in premiums than they would under the Affordable Care Act.This is all achieved in a variety of ways. First, Obamacare s income-based tax credits, which gave more to low-income earners, will be abolished and replaced with a tax-credit based on age for those with an annual salary below $75,000, one that gives older people slightly more. Also, the American Health Care Act adjusts a rule that Obamacare had in place to protect older people from higher premiums. This rule takes into consideration that the elderly are generally in worse health than the young so insurers are only allowed to charge an older person about three times what they would charge a younger person. Under the new Republican bill, insurers would be able to charge an older person five times what they would charge a younger person, 66 percent more than they could under Obamacare.As a result, the Republican bill will, in theory, bring insurance premiums down in general, but at the expense of older and poorer Americans. Nobody knew health care would be so complicated.Featured image via Bill Clark-Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 26, 2017"
‘Empty Barrels Make the Most Noise’ – General John Kelly Just Ripped Democrat Who Said He’s a ‘Disgrace to the Uniform’,"Fox News received an email from General John Kelly last night in response to a personal shot taken at him by a member of Congress This is not just any member of Congress it s the bitter open borders Democrat Luis Gutierrez. This Chicago Democrat is all for opening the flood gates for illegals Last week, you may remember that Democrat Luis Gutierrez, in slamming President Trump s decision on DACA, went after Kelly in particular and said the following:General Kelly, when he was the head of Homeland Security, lied straight to the faces of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about preventing the mass deportation of DREAMers. Now as Chief of Staff, this former general is executing the plan to take away their lifeline and taking steps to criminalize young people who live and work here legally. General Kelly is a hypocrite who is a disgrace to the uniform he used to wear. He has no honor and should be drummed out of the White House along with the white supremacists and those enabling the President s actions by  just following orders. Gutierrez received a lot of criticism but Gutierrez is standing by his criticism. He told The Washington Examiner last week,  He s a politician. He works for Donald Trump and now supports Donald Trump s xenophobic, racist policies, and he s carrying them out as his chief of staff. I m not talking about him as a general; I m talking about him as a politician. What Gutierrez forgets is that Obama in 2012 said this about DACA: Now, let s be clear   this is not amnesty, this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure   Congress needs to act. There is still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments. GENERAL KELLY STRIKES BACK:Fox News reports today that Kelly reacted to Gutierrez s remarks thusly:In an email to Fox News late Sunday, Kelly responded by saying Congress did  nothing  to help so-called Dreamers when they had the chance. As far as the congressman and other irresponsible members of congress are concerned, they have the luxury of saying what they want as they do nothing and have almost no responsibility,  Kelly said.  They can call people liars but it would be inappropriate for me to say the same thing back at them. As my blessed mother used to say  empty barrels make the most noise. He concluded,  The congressman has a right to his opinion. Kelly also said in the letter,  Every DOJ and DHS lawyer says DACA is unconstitutional. Every other legal scholar   right and left   says the same thing. Trump didn t end DACA, the law did. That said, I worked and succeeded to give the congress another six months to do something. I am not confident. Read more: FOX News ",politics,"Sep 11, 2017"
 Franklin Graham’s Daughter: 9/11 Happened Because God Is Mad At Trans People (AUDIO),"Religious bigots continue their hateful rhetoric against transgender people at alarming rates, and now Anne Graham Lotz, daughter of hateful evangelical pastor Franklin Graham and sister to the equally hateful Billy Graham, has jumped into the fray as well. Her statements are especially outrageous; in fact, she has said that the reason the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil happened is because God is  upset that transgender people exist.Lotz appeared on a right-wing hate radio show run by Steve Deace to express her horrible opinions. She said to Deace: What I see in the nation of America right now, just the chaos on every level.There is silliness, there is craziness, there s the most illogical rulings. The one in North Carolina on HB2, which is to protect our children in bathrooms and locker rooms, has become something where the justice department is suing us for something that s just common sense.To me it s evidence that God has backed away. Here is a bit of audio of these statements, via Right Wing Watch:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/263809966  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. This nutty woman then went on to pretty much directly blame the advancement of transgender rights in the United States for terrorism. Lotz said: In our nation, one of the things we pray for is that some of this craziness would settle down  [but] our nation seems to be shaking its fist in God s face, we re abandoning God as a nation.What happens then is God abandons us and backs away, he he takes his favour and blessing away from us.[If we repent] I think he would begin to reveal the plots of terrorists before they are carried out, even the weather patterns he can control and protect us from violent storms.I think that s why God allows bad things to happen. I think that d why he would allow 9/11 to happen, or the dreadful attack in San Bernardino. To show us we need him. Here is more audio:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/263809967  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]So, in other words, this nutty woman actually believes that giving human being rights is the reason for terrorism. This rhetoric is beyond dangerous, especially considering how misunderstood transgender people are. This is straight up hate speech, and it should not be tolerated. It s people like this who are responsible for the huge uptick in violence against vulnerable groups of people.This woman does not deserve a platform for her hate.

JUST IN: “Pit Bull” Attorney For Special Counsel Robert Mueller Attended Hillary’s Election Night Party,"Is there a single person left on Robert Mueller s  Trump-Russian collusion  team who isn t in bed with Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton?An attorney for special counsel Robert Mueller attended Hillary Clinton s election night party in New York City, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.Andrew Weissmann s attendance at the party is one of many signs pointing to a troubling bias from the attorney.

JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO: “Trump Leak Was A Clinton Setup” [Video], ,politics,"Oct 9, 2016"
Shocking Report: Mind Blowing Cost of Illegals Is Highest Ever…Numbers Released Show Huge Burden To States [Video],"EVERY American taxpayer should be outraged at the numbers in the report below. Open borders under 8 years of Obama is costing American taxpayers a tremendous amount more than ever before! Don t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR: Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE S THOMAS HOMAN S TESTIMONY FROM 2014: Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion. State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled  The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,  is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets. Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,  said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein.  President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,  said Stein.  Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,  he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don t come close to offsetting the costs. What s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table. The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,  said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",left-news,"Sep 27, 2017"
" Donald Trump Just Threw 60 YEARS Of Inaugural Tradition Out The Window, And Something’s Fishy","Donald Trump has decided to throw out 60 years  worth of tradition for his inauguration by replacing the man who s done the announcing for presidential inaugurations since Eisenhower s in 1957, Charlie Brotman. That might not seem like a big deal, but given that his voice is so familiar for this, it s hard to understand why they would make such a move.And it s not like it s a relief for Brotman; he s heartbroken about it. He had already started preparing for his role in the ceremonies, saying he was told he wouldn t be involved in an email.  At first I was destroyed,  he said, according to D.C. s ABC affiliate, WJLA.  I ve been doing this for 60 years. That s eleven inaugurations for which he s worked. At 89, he might be old, but he s still healthy and apparently still perfectly able to do this, given that he was already preparing.The Presidential Inauguration Committee issued a statement that said: Since 1957, millions of Americans and countless entertainers have come to recognize Charlie Brotman as the voice of the inaugural parade. The Presidential Inaugural Committee will be proud to honor Charlie as Announcer Chairman Emeritus on January 20th. We are thrilled for Steve Ray to be introducing a new generation of Americans to the grand traditions of the inaugural parade. That s not the same as having him actually do it, and he s weighing whether to even accept that, or the VIP seat he s been offered. This is something that would be more appropriate had Brotman said he was retiring, or was otherwise unable to do it again.Steve Ray is a freelance announcer who has done a lot of work, including promotional spots for the Washington Nationals, but one fishy point about this is that he helped with for Trump s campaign.Trump has been working hard to grant favors to people who worked on his campaign, giving many of them high positions within his transition team. Did he tell the inauguration committee to find someone who had worked for him? Did he tell them that he knew Ray and that Ray should do the announcing?Brotman believes it s more likely ageism at work: Maybe they re afraid I might drop dead at the mic. Right now, nobody s really explaining this decision. Regardless, unlike Trump, who s petty and childish as all fuck and would scream about betrayal on Twitter while wishing for his replacement to fall flat on their face, Brotman wishes Ray no ill-will. In fact, he s flat said that he wants Ray to  do spectacular,  and that he wishes Ray luck in this.Featured image by Ethan Miller via Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017"
BOOM! LIBS GO NUTS After BETSY DEVOS Announces “Due Process” Barack Obama Stripped From College Students In Sexual Assault Cases Will Be Restored [VIDEO],"President Trump s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos spoke today at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Students, families, school administrators are generally not lawyers, and they re not judges. We shouldn t force them to be so for justice to be served.The era of rule by letter is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. Watch:Liberals immediately attempted to twist the facts in this decision to uphold the law by allowing every American the right to due process, into  Trump adminstration supports rape on college campuses.  Liberals are so used to a president and an administration who flagrantly disregards the law, they can t even comprehend why due process is one of our most sacred rights.Twitter user, Makada does a great job of explaining to the leftsits who are criticizing DeVos and Presdient Trump that men should be entitled to the same rights as women, and that it is NOT okay to determine that they are guilty of sexual assault without a fair trial in a court of law:Leftists are tweeting #StopBetsy because she wants men to be innocent until proven guilty.

" Trump Breaks ANOTHER Huge Campaign Promise, Stabs Followers In The Back Yet Again","During his campaign, Donald Trump routinely called Hillary Clinton  crooked  and at one point he told supporters his Democratic opponent  should be in prison.  Trump s supporters responded by chanting  Lock her up!  at each of his rallies.No matter how many times she was absolved after countless investigation, conservatives were sure Clinton was corrupt and they were certain Trump would hold her accountable. As it happens, Trump will not follow through with that campaign promise.Trump aide Kellyanne Conway tried to spin Trump s sudden flip-flop on MSNBC s  Morning Joe : I think when the President-elect, who s also the head of your party, tells you before he s even inaugurated that he doesn t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone, and content  to other Republicans, former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Tuesday. If Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that s a good thing to do,  Conway continued, adding that Clinton  still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don t find her to be honest or trustworthy. Well, that s a lie. Votes are still being counted but as of right now, Clinton leads in the popular vote by 1.7 million.

Trump said in October as the crowd began another  lock her up  chant. If I win, we re going to appoint a special prosecutor,  Trump said.  Because we cannot allow this to happen in our country. This isn t the first campaign promise Trump has broken and he s not even in office yet. The president-elect is not really going to fully repeal Obamacare.

[VIDEO] HOLLYWOOD ACTOR Scott Baio FED UP With Obama: “He’s a Muslim or a Muslim sympathizer”,"I don t think there are too many people who would disagree with that sentiment, given Obama s obvious desire to make Americans believe Islam has nothing to do with Islamic terror.  In the wake of yet another attack on American soil by a radicalized Muslin gunman, actor Scott Baio questioned whether President Barack Obama wants to  eliminate the United States as it was created. Appearing on Fox Business, the former  Happy Days  star was asked if the president is reluctant to say  Islamic terror. He s absolutely reluctant,  Baio replied.  I can t tell, Lester, if he s dumb, he s a Muslim or he s a Muslim sympathizer. And I don t think he s dumb. WATCH here:Baio, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, was asked to explain Obama s actions. I have no idea,  the actor replied.  Like I said, either he s a sympathizer, a Muslim sympathizer or he s a Muslim to allow this to keep happening. He insisted that Trump is the only person who wants to do something about these attacks by Islamic extremists.Borrowing from Obama s 2008 promise of  fundamentally transforming the United States of America,  Baio speculated on what may be the  end game  for liberals like Obama and Hillary Clinton. Is it to totally eliminate the United States as it was created and founded and the way it is now?  he asked.The actor went on to say he is  baffled  by the inaction from Obama and Clinton, saying  the only time they get angry is at Republicans.

 Hillary Clinton Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker Rudely Heckling Her At Town Hall Event (VIDEO),"A Republican lawmaker in New Hampshire showed up to one of Hillary Clinton s town hall events in the state on Sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle Mrs. Clinton. Bad idea. Not only did it not work out as planned, but the former Secretary of State called out the state representative in front of everyone. You are very rude, and I m not ever going to call on you. Thank you. The comment earned Mrs. Clinton an enormous round of applause, as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at Hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person. It s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well. Perhaps there s a better way to get your message across?So, what exactly was Katherine Prudhomme O Brien, the GOP state representative from Rockingham, trying to say? She followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that Hillary didn t want to talk about Bill Clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago. Really? That s what was so important? I asked her how in the world she can say that Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Wiley are lying when she has no idea who Juanita Broderick is. She told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is. How can she access that they are lying, which she told someone last month? Expect for more below-the-belt tactics like these now that Bill Clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on Monday. Republicans are looking for any and every chance to use Bill s past indiscretions against Hillary. It s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics, yet somehow they still get the most attention.With that said, Bernie Sanders, unlike Republicans, doesn t intend on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual past anytime soon: No, I think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton s sex life.

 WATCH: Hillary RUINS Trump Right Outside His Bankrupt Casino (VIDEO/TWEETS),"Things are not looking good for Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton is making sure things will only get worse.Just a day after being cleared by the FBI s investigation into her emails, the former Secretary of State headed to Atlantic City, New Jersey to trash Trump s  shameful  business record   right outside of one of Trump s own failed casinos! Standing in front of the bankrupt and shuttered Trump Plaza Casino, Clinton exposed Trump s lies and mocked him in a brilliant, scathing speech.Speaking to a crowd of about 500 people, Clinton pointed out how Trump s involvement in New Jersey had caused  multiple bankruptcies, stiffing contractors and spurring hundreds of job losses.  Warning voters that Trump would do exactly what he did in Atlantic City to America if he won the election, she said: Remember what he promised:  I m going to do for the country what I did for my business.  We should believe him and make sure he never has the chance to bankrupt America the way he bankrupted his businesses. Clinton s speech was only 30 minutes long, but it was all she needed to take Trump and his scammy business endeavors down. Making a perfect example out of Trump Plaza, Clinton joked: Donald Trump once predicted it was the biggest hit yet. Now it s abandoned. Now ask yourself, according to the Donald, isn t he supposed to be some sort of amazing businessman? What in the world happened here? She was especially passionate because this topic hit home for the presumptive Democratic candidate, whose father was a small business owner. She said,  This is personal for me  as she cited an example of how Trump left small business owners with unpaid bills: The people he is trying to convince to vote for him now are the same people he s been exploiting for years: Working people, small business people, trying to support their families. He got rich and got out. And he thinks that s something to be proud of. He didn t just take advantage of investors, he took advantage of working people as well. Here are some highlights from her speech, which show just how brutal Clinton was:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterClinton also made sure to trash one of Trump s biggest supporters, former presidential candidate and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, for being away campaigning with Trump instead of looking after his state. Clinton said:Clinton s main message to Americans was that when Trump is left in charge of anything,  people get hurt and Donald gets paid.

LOL! Democrats To Sue Over “Unprecedented Environmental Catastrophe” Trump Wall Poses To Birds…Ignores Actual Bird Blenders Pushed By Democrats [VIDEO],"A conservation group and Democrat Congressman have filed a lawsuit to demanding an environmental study is performed before   construction of Trump s wall on the border between the US and Mexico. Biologist Jeff Corwin paid a visit to MSNBC to breathlessly warn viewers about the dangers of the wall President Trump plans to build on the Texas-Mexico border national security purposes. He warned viewers of the  unprecedented environmental catastrophic  consequences Trump s wall on wildlife. The MSNBC host responds to his highly dramatic warning by asking drama queen Jeff Crowin,  At the risk of sounding ignorant or foolish the birds specifically Wouldn t they be able to fly over that wall?'   HILARIOUS!Not surprisingly, there was no mention of wind turbines in Texas during the interview.Watch:Meanwhile in America, Democrats remain silent about the bird holocaust caused by wind turbines every year. An estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds are killed every year in N. America by these green energy bird blenders.Instead of worrying about Trump s wall  killing birds  how about addressing these wind turbines in oil-rich Texas that liberal federally-funded NPR promoted while using a picture of turbines on top of a huge wall of dirt? NPR  Another record was set for wind power generation this week, according to the group that manages much of the state s power. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas(ERCOT) says Wednesday evening, wind power generation on the grid reached10,296 megawatts (MW), or enough to power 5 million Texas homes during times of regular demand. That beat the previous record of actual generation by 600 megawatts, roughly the equivalent of a medium-sized fossil fuel power plant.Here s the real danger to birds in America that few Democrats are willing to address:In 2010 David Newstead, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service field biologist, visited the Gulf shoreline of Laguna Madre, Texas, to survey skimmers, terns, and egrets. But it was a flock of 15 American White Pelicans that caught his eye, flying toward the nearby Pe ascal wind farm. As he watched, a pelican at the flock s tail end was swiped by a massive turbine blade and  literally  erased  from the air, Newstead wrote afterwards. This in itself isn t surprising wind turbines are notorious bird killers but this specific farm was supposedly equipped with radar that could detect approaching birds and halt the blades. The radar had failed to do its job.Watch as what appears as this bird that appears to be an eagle, is killed as it s chopped by a blade on this powerful wind turbine:Wind turbines kill an estimated 140,000 to 328,000 birds each year in North America, making it the most threatening form of green energy. And yet, it s also one of the most rapidly expanding energy industries: more than 49,000 individual wind turbines now exist across 39 states.  Audubon",left-news,"Apr 17, 2017"
 Jennifer Lawrence Has Two VERY Choice Words For Trump If She Ever Meets Him (NSFW VIDEO),"Whether you love him or hate him, most of us probably have a clue what we d like to say to Donald Trump if we were to ever come into contact with him, and actress Jennifer Lawrence is no exception.While discussing Trump on The Graham Norton Show, a show that airs in the U.K. and doesn t have the strict regulations against language that the United States does, Lawrence let everyone in on a scenario that she tried to make happen.When asked if she had ever met Trump, Lawrence explained that she hadn t, but he was at the same concert she was attending.

" Trump Goes ‘Home’ To Trump Tower After Racism Condemnation, IMMEDIATELY Retweets Alt-Right Leader","It sure didn t take long for Donald Trump to clear up any confusion about exactly who he was referring to when he made his weak statement against racism on Monday. Trump finished his golf vacation, despite the murder of a young woman by an alt-right activist in Charlottesville on Saturday. The statement he issued that day caused many to wonder just who he was referring to when he referenced violence  on many sides.  Then, after serious pressure from not just the public, but even Congressional Republicans, he issued another statement Monday afternoon: Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to all that we hold dear as Americans. Glaringly absent from Trump s condemnation was one major contributor to the racist movement in America. Perhaps two, if you see it as two different groups: White nationalists and the alt-right. Largely, the alt-right describes themselves with the term  nationalists,  so for the sake of this article, it s just them.Richard Spencer, a leading member of the alt-right, made headlines himself Monday by declaring that he knew Trump wasn t talking about  them.  Also, Andrew Anglin, the founder of the internet s pre-eminent Nazi website, The Daily Stormer, knew on Saturday that Trump wouldn t be criticizing white nationalists: People saying he cucked are shills and kikes. He did the opposite of cuck. He refused to even mention anything to do with us. When reporters were screaming at him about White Nationalism he just walked out of the room. When Trump got back  home  to Trump Tower Monday night, it took him no time at all to prove them right. First, he made a big show of how much he loves the White House (after being caught calling it a dump), then his very first retweet   his most common type of tweet   was from another prominent alt-right leader, Jack Posobiec.Feels good to be home after seven months, but the White House is very special, there is no place like it  and the U.S. is really my home!

 WATCH: This Priceless Video HILARIOUSLY Exposes Trump And His Doctor For What They Really Are,"Trust Funny Or Die to come up with something like this. They ve released a video starring Brent Spiner, a.k.a Dr. Okun from Independence Day, and Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and he (ahem) takes on a new role here to lampoon the hell out of both Trump and his quack of a doctor.Spiner actually introduces himself as Dr. Bornstein, and immediately launches into what he knows about Trump: I m making this video because there s something they don t want you to know. Trump s not from here! And I don t mean not from America, I mean not from this planet, okay?When I wrote that ridiculously glowing letter in five minutes, I thought you d see through it for the obvious farce that it was! Indeed, that letter has been the subject of controversy for Trump, seeing as how Bornstein used language that doctors generally don t use in it. He said that Trump s lab results were  astonishingly excellent,  for one thing. He also declared Trump the healthiest person ever to run for president, which is something he can t possibly know.Spiner hilariously touches on all of that, too, in his role as the infamous Dr. Bornstein. He then goes back into discussing Trump s alien anatomy: I did a chest exam, and to be honest, I was not expecting to find a heart, and guess what? I didn t! What  Bornstein  did find in place of a heart is even funnier than Trump s obvious lack of one. From there, it just spirals.

 Hillary Was Right: Trump Rant On Muslims Shows Up On New Terror Recruitment Video,"After Hillary Clinton made the argument that Donald Trump s hateful rants against Muslims were fueling Islamic terrorism recruitment during a recent debate, Republicans and the Fox News crowd last their minds accusing her of lying.  Where were these videos?  They demanded. A reporter just found one.While ISIS s campaign of terror in the Middle East gets most of the headlines, an equally horrific group is operating out of Africa. Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaeda, has been responsible for a number of massacres, terror attacks, and other human rights atrocities, primarily in Somalia and Kenya. Recently, the group s numbers and influence has dwindled after sustained opposition from a coalition of African governments. They are clearly desperate   so they are reportedly turning to the powerful recruitment tool known as Donald Trump.Harun Maruf, a journalist working with Voice of America, has been closely following Al-Shabab and its recruitment strategies. On January 1, he came across a new video that features   you guessed it   Trump s recent call for a  total Muslim ban. BREAKING: Al-Shabab issued a new video propaganda video targeting African Americans and US Muslims. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016BREAKING: Donald Trump's recent speech calling for ""total Muslim ban"" is on Al-Shabab recruitment video. #Somalia  Harun Maruf (@HarunMaruf) January 1, 2016The video itself features an English speaking narrator telling young Muslims that America is a racist nation. A clip of what appears to be an ISIS spokesman explains that Jim Crow laws targeting African Americans have morphed into religious discrimination, then cuts to Donald Trump calling for a  total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. 3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui  Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016It s easy to see why Trump s hateful remarks would be attractive to terrorist recruiters. For years, terrorism experts have warned that radical extremists rely on propaganda and fear-mongering about the West to get desperate people to join up with violent causes. The idea is to paint America as hostile to Muslims and therefore a natural  enemy  to Muslims around the world. If America hates Muslims, then lashing out against it is a natural conclusion, or so the thinking goes.Trump, with all of his small minded bigotry, is a boon for this propaganda. After all, just playing a clip of him spouting off hatred is enough to prove to many that Americans do hate Muslims. Nobody knows that better than the terrorists themselves.While Republicans took potshots at Hillary over her calling this spade a spade, her comments hold up remarkably well under scrutiny. Even before she set off a firestorm of conservative outrage during her debate appearance, she was unflinchingly calling out Republican Islamophobia. On December 8, she went so far as to release a statement warning all Republican candidates, not just Trump, to stop the hate.This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the fight against radical jihadists a fight we absolutely have to win, against a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone suggest that they re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jihadists are telling people that the United States hates Muslims and there s Donald Trump on TV screaming about how he s going to keep all Muslims out. He s strengthening the terrorists  argument.A desperate, losing terror group like Al-Shabab is staking their future on Trump. That should say it all.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 1, 2016"
 Two U.S. Marines Under Investigation For Threatening Attack On Gay Bars,"Two U.S. Marines are reportedly under investigation following a potential threat against the LGBTQ community posted on social media.According to the Marine Corps Times an active duty Marine posted an image to Facebook which shows a uniformed corporal holding a rifle in a menacing manner. The message  Coming to a gay bar near you,  appears on the image.Here s the image, courtesy of the Marine Corps Times.In the comments section the person who posted the photo wrote  Too soon? The image was posted to a closed Facebook group for West Coast-based male Marines, called Camp MENdleton Resale. The group has more than 25,000 members.According to Michael Moss, founder of the Facebook group where the image was posted, the photo was immediately removed from the group and reported to authorities.  We do not tolerate hate speech,  Moss said in a Facebook post.The California-based 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF) is investigating the man who posted the photo to the group page, as well as a second Marine who apparently uploaded the image to Facebook.First Lt. Thomas Gray, a spokesman for I MEF, told the Marine Corps Times that the man in the photo has been identified and is part of the on-going investigation. Gray declined to provide more information about the individual, saying: We cannot discuss details of an ongoing investigation, but I can tell you the command is taking this incident seriously. The MEF released a public statement regarding the investigation, which reads: The Marine Corps does not tolerate discrimination based on sexual orientation, race, gender or religion. This type of behavior and mindset will not be allowed, and it is not consistent with the core values of honor, courage and commitment that are demonstrated by the vast majority of Marines on a daily basis. Officials said they will take  appropriate action,  against the individuals involved.The threatening post came on the heels of the Pulse Orlando mass shooting. While some have implied that the post was meant to be a joke, there s nothing even remotely funny about gun violence or threats of terror against the LGBTQ community.Featured image via Marine Corp Times via Facebook",News,"June 17, 2016"

 WOW: Trump Jr. Just Offered To Ship Black People Out Of The Country And Pay For It (VIDEO),"You know what might make the recent scandal surrounding Donald Trump s support from white supremacists just a bit worse? Things might get bad if his son offered to pay to ship black people out of the United States. In fact, such a move would be so monumentally stupid that  Oh! It happened, didn t it?On  Fox and Friends,  Donald Trump Jr. and brother Eric Trump showed up to discuss the  Super Tuesday  primaries and, of course, the  attacks  against The Donald for minor issues like wanting to shove all Muslims into concentration camps and ban them from entering the United States, as well as his support from white supremacist groups.Recently, Trump responded to an endorsement from former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke by adamantly refusing to denounce Duke   or any White Power Rangers who have stepped up to declare that he is the best thing to happen to this country since slavery. Trump, who regularly retweets white supremacists and their propaganda, is immensely popular among white nationalist groups, who actively use him as a recruitment tool and even call voters to encourage them to support the man they view as the new Fuhrer. You know, it s sad to see,  Eric Trump said of the attacks on his father, which he considers trivial in light of how awesome his racist father is.  We love our father. He s an amazing guy   he would do such an unbelievable job for this country. He s an amazing businessman, he s an amazing negotiator. He s funding himself, right? But when Fox News played the Trump brothers clips of numerous African-Americans, including Whoopi Goldberg and Al Sharpton, saying they will leave the United States if Trump was elected, Trump Jr. decided that the best way to help his father mitigate the damage done by his white supremacist friends would be to offer to pay:Eric Trump said that criticism from African-Americans might be his father s  greatest endorsement ever.  Trump Jr. added that criticism from minority groups is a positive as far as Trump is concerned, especially considering his base: Those are endorsements for Trump. That s the thing   when you have the establishment people in the debates, and they stack the debates with a thousand people that are all booing, those are votes for us. Because the people in the audience watching at home are like,  Wait a minute   he s saying what I m thinking.  I love that. That s as good an endorsement as we could possibly get. Sadly, he s right   any criticism from African-Americans, Muslims, Hispanics, women, non-Christians, and other groups Trump considers Untermensch is almost certain to be viewed as a positive by his racist, cenophobic, Christofascist, hateful supporters.Watch Trump Jr. offer to send black people out of the country below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"February 29, 2016"

"LIBERAL Lansing, MI Mayor Forced To REMOVE “Sanctuary City” Status After MI Residents Hammer Him For Arrogant Announcement On Tucker Carlson [VIDEO]","Watch his appearance on Tucker Carlson where he announced that Lansing, MI would be designated a  sanctuary city  here:The city council in Lansing, Mich. voted Wednesday to rescind its decision to deem itself a  sanctuary  city for illegal immigrants after concerns from the businesses that the status would draw unwelcome attention to the city.The term  sanctuary city  generally refers to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. Under Lansing city policy, police don t ask for people s immigration status, except as required by U.S. or Michigan law or a court order.Council members voted 5-2 to reverse last week s 6-0 vote to give the city  sanctuary  status. Immigration advocates in the crowd called called council members  spineless  and said  you re all losing your seats. The dispute comes as several cities are battling President Donald Trump s promised crackdown on places that block cooperation between their police departments and U.S. immigration authorities. The Trump administration has warned that sanctuary cities could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities.After last week s vote, council members received a letter from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging them to remove references to  sanctuary city  from its resolution. Lansing is a diverse community, rich with history and culture. It s what makes our city a welcoming destination to live, work and thrive,  the business groups  letter says.  Recent actions of City Council, whether intended or not, have placed an unnecessary target on the City of Lansing while jeopardizing millions of dollars in federal funding that impacts the city budget. The term  sanctuary  in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting   so distracting in my opinion that s it s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,  said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.  It s basically a  don t ask  policy, which was outlined by the mayor s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. That was already the policy in Lansing before last week s vote, but Lansing called itself a  welcoming city,  rather than a  sanctuary city.  Neither the welcoming city resolution nor the sanctuary city resolution called for Lansing to prohibit workers from providing information on a person s immigration status with U.S. immigration officials   a ban that s at the heart of some urban sanctuary cities disagreements with the Trump administration.The issue also has touched off debate in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature, which is considering banning local governments from enacting or enforcing rules that limit communication and cooperation with federal officials concerning people s immigration status. Similar legislation died in the last session.   FOX News",left-news,"Apr 13, 2017"
CROOKED HARRY REID Threatens FBI Director James Comey In Letter…Last Paragraph Of Letter Says It All,"Scumbag Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) lays bare how Democrats handle anyone who opposes them in his arrogant, threatening  letter to FBI Director James Comey. Funny, I don t remember Comey getting a public admonishment from Harry Reid when he essentially let Hillary off the hook. Hillary should ve been taken away in handcuffs, but she walked right back onto the campaign trail without missing a beat. Where was Harry s outrage then? Why wasn t he  reminding  Comey who put him in his powerful position several months ago? The crooked Democrats house of cards is falling and its almost funny (almost) how they re blaming the Russians, Donald J. Trump and now James Comey for their inability to keep their crookedness hidden from the public. The top Democrat in the Senate on Sunday accused FBI director James Comey of violating federal law by showing favoritism to  one political party over another  by publicly stating that he had been made aware of new evidence in the Clinton email investigation. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,  Senator Minority Leader Harry Reid s (D-Nevada) letter to Comey reads. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,  Reid said.The Democrat also accuses Comey of suppressing negative information related to the Republican presidential candidate   Donald Trump. In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government,  the letter reads. The public has a right to know this information   And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information,  he said, referring to the  explosive  ties he accuses Trump having with Russia.Reid goes on to accuse Comey of  tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo  by writing his letter to Congress informing the lawmakers of new evidence in the Clinton investigation. You rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,  he wrote.- NYPHere is the last paragraph of Reid s letter to Comey. In a typical Chicago-like thug tactic, Harry Reid reminds Comey how he got to be the director of the FBI and how he owed Reid more for sticking his wretched old neck out for him:Here is Reid s letter in its entirety to James Comey:",politics,"Oct 30, 2016"
" Newt Gingrich Just SLAMMED Romney, Dubya And His Daddy For Being Hypocrites And Babies (VIDEO)","The actors and actresses of Fox News have received their marching orders and the run to November will officially be the propaganda machine for Donald Trump. That s how it seems, at least, as hosts align themselves with people like Newt Gingrich, and other hard-core party liners who will vote for whomever has an (R) next to their name. Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want, he turned his attention to the two former presidents, George W. and George H.W. Bush. Both of those historical failures have decided that they refuse to support Donald Trump, and nor will they attend the convention to initiate the Fourth Reich. Little brother Jeb has also chimed in that he ll be on the sidelines as well, as though he had a choice. Jeb was Trump s first real target. When it worked and Jeb dropped out, pundits everywhere were shocked. Then one by one they fell. All of the party elite; all of the establishment favorites.The money from the Koch brothers never appeared, because as evil as they are, they aren t stupid. Donald Trump ran the most effective underdog campaign in history by loaning himself money and going out and getting free press.

The uneducated bigots crawled out of the woodwork to demand the country be great again and (insert required amount of rhetoric and lies).As the stupidity gained steam and made its way towards a downhill run to Cleveland, the party began to fracture.

Hollywood Suffers Meltdown Over Trump’s Withdraw from Paris Climate Deal,"Hollywood is having kittens over US President Trump s recent snub of the Paris Climate Agreement. Especially upset are the elite cadre of multi-millionaire celebrities, along with various and sundry billionaires like Elon Musk, who still believe the earth is heating up because of anthropogenic global warming, aka man-made Co2. Already, the EU has rejected Donald Trump s offer to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, opting instead to bypass Washington DC by working with US CEOs, city mayors and state governors   to implement the climate accords.What Hollywood, Elon Musk, Bernie Sanders and the rest, will not tell you   is that the earth is already entering a global cooling phase which could lead to a mini ice age. Unlike trace warming over a 500 year period, a cooling phase can radical alter the viability of normal life in the Northern Hemisphere, including frosts that will lead to the failure of large parts of the agriculture sector which can lead to severe food shortages   which can make food scarce and much more expensive.More on this report from Lifezette  .Leonardo DiCaprio on his private yacht, incredibly worried about global warming.Todd Barnes LifezettePresident Trump s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord has sparked widespread hysteria in juice bars and luxury spas across Hollywood.As a candidate, Trump vowed to  cancel  the Paris climate deal   slamming what he called draconian climate rules. The Paris accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States,  the president told a gathering Thursday in the Rose Garden.House Speaker Paul Ryan praised the president s decision and thanked him for  withdrawing from this bad deal. The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America,  Ryan said.  Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification, it would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest. But some of Hollywood s most esteemed scientists fear the president s decision will put the nation on a slippery slope to the hothouse   an apocalyptic future with melting igloos and polar bears unable to put their Coca-Colas on ice. If this is true he will have the death of whole nations on his hands,  warned scientist-actor Mark Ruffalo.  People will be looking to the USA for retribution for what they loose [sic].

" Trump Goes On Psychotic Mexico Rant During News Conference, Mexico Responds PERFECTLY (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s refusal to accept the fact that Mexico is not paying for his ridiculous, ineffective border wall is pretty much the definition of psychotic. Mexico has struck down Trump s claims that it will foot the bill for the wall numerous times, but Trump continues to state the opposite   and he continued to do so on Monday during a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.When OANN s Trey Yingst asked Trump if he was still going to try and force Mexico to pay for the wall, Trump said: Yes, it will. One way or the other, Mexico s gonna pay for the wall. That s right. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall. Showing just how ineffective and flawed his plan was, Trump had to add the disclaimer that the U.S. will likely pay for the wall at first, to be later reimbursed (which probably won t happen). Trump said: We need the wall, it s imperative. We may fund it through the United States, but ultimately Mexico will pay for the wall. You can watch Trump completely disconnect from reality and facts below:Trump made these comments just hours after the Mexican government put out a strong statement about how it WOULD NOT pay for the border wall. Mexico s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: As the Mexican government has always stated, our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on U.S. territory along the Mexican border. To make this even more embarrassing for Trump, former Mexican President Vicente Fox, a well-known critic of Trump and his wall, posted this on Twitter:.@realDonaldTrump how many times do we have to tell you?

 Even Trump’s New Campaign Manager Demanded He Release His Taxes (VIDEO),"The problem with running for President in the 21st Century is that nearly everyone has a Google page or 1,000 about them, and often, video to back it up. That s the case with Kellyanne Conway, who was named Donald Trump s new campaign manager in his second attempt to shake things up.In April, Conway appeared on CNN, where host Don Lemon asked her about an  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz. Conway, who wasn t working for Trump, or apparently even supporting Trump, at the time, thought the alliance was fine, but Trump s refusal to release his taxes wasn t.Then head of a super-PAC supporting Trump rival Ted Cruz, Conway was asked in an April 25 CNN interview if the  alliance  between John Kasich and Ted Cruz was fair.  Of course it s fair game,  she said.  Oh absolutely. It s completely transparent. Donald Trump s tax returns aren t, and I would like to see those be transparent.

JUST IN: TRUMP Will Remove “Climate Change” From List Of National Security Threats,"Thank goodness we finally have a President who refuses to dump our taxpayer funds into climate scam that our former President actually identified as a national security threat According to The Federalist, The Trump administration will reverse course from previous Obama administration policy, eliminating climate change from a list of national security threats. The National Security Strategy to be released on Monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection, according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft. Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,  a draft of the National Security Strategy slated to be released on Monday said.  U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests. Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. During his successful campaign, Trump mocked Obama s placement of climate change in the context of national security. Here s a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in late 2015:So Obama s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia s a problem, China s a problem. We ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That s a problem.We ve got a lot of problems. We ve got a lot of problems. That s right, we don t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don t win anymore. We re going to win a lot   if I get elected, we re going to win a lot. (Applause)We re going to win so much   we re going to win a lot. We re going to win a lot. We re going to win so much you re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You re going to say oh no, not again. I m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never. (Applause)But think of it. So Obama s talking about all of this with the global warming and the   a lot of it s a hoax, it s a hoax. I mean, it s a money-making industry, OK? It s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That s my global   I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don t have to destroy our businesses, we don t have to destroy our  And by the way, China isn t abiding by anything. They re buying all of our coal; we can t use coal anymore essentially. They re buying our coal and they re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it s so big out there   we re here, they re there, it s like they re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.The draft of the National Security Strategy makes this approach policy, emphasizing national security and economic growth over climate change.President Obama made climate change, and the burdensome regulations that accompany its focus, a primary focus of his administration, including in his National Security Strategy released in 2015.  [W]e are working toward an ambitious new global climate change agreement to shape standards for prevention, preparedness, and response over the next decade,  that report said.Watch Barack Obama explain how  climate change  is national security threat: By contrast, President Trump s National Security Strategy will focus on conventional and immediate national security risks. The draft says, in part:North Korea seeks the capability to kill millions of Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruction. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al Qaeda are determined to attack the United States and radicalize Americans with their hateful ideology. States and non-state actors undermine social order with drug and human trafficking networks, which drive violent crimes and cause thousands of American deaths each year . Strengthening control over our borders and immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S. security and public safety. These actors adapt quickly to outpace our defenses.As for climate change, the draft report says  The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while growing its economy. This achievement, which can serve as model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains  not from onerous regulation.

" Trump Explodes In Rage At Debate Results, Indicates He WON’T Accept An Election Loss (DETAILS)","We all know that Donald Trump s skin is very thin. He is also a narcissist the likes of which the world has never seen on the word leadership stage. Therefore, the thought of losing the 2016 presidential election has likely not really occurred to him in any real sense. However, his disastrous debate performance, combined with a huge tilt away from his favor in the polls following a week of chaos that was completely his own doing means that a loss in November is looking more and more likely. The Donald just cannot take that, though, so he has a new solution in the event of his losing the electon: he just won t accept the result.At the debate, in which Trump seemed to run out of gas and eventually melt down completely, he still nonetheless said he would accept the results should he lose to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, now that it seems that a loss might be something that is looming, Trump is going back on his loss. According to the New York Times, Trump s assessment is thus:Mr. Trump, aiming to unnerve Mrs. Clinton, even indicated that he was rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would  absolutely  support her if she won in November, saying:  We re going to have to see. We re going to see what happens. We re going to have to see. So, in other words, Trump is sending a dog whistle fog horn to his most ardent, hateful, aggressive, and uneducated supporters that says just what they already believe: if he doesn t win, it was rigged. This is beyond dangerous, considering that we can never plant the seeds of doubt in the integrity of our electoral system and process. While we all know that things like Voter ID laws and false accusations of voter intimidation most definitely are aimed at disenfranchising minority voters because they largely tend to vote left, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that anything more nefarious is going on regarding election rigging.Trump s inability to accept that no one   not even him   wins all the time is downright dangerous. It cannot be stressed enough that we must trust the result of this election, and every election, no matter how unsatisfied we might be with the outcome. That means that if folks like me wake up on November 9th to headlines of President Trump, I must accept it, and if I cannot tolerate it, I must move to another country.Trump s supporters must do the same. They have shown themselves to be violent, paranoid, hateful, and ignorant, though, so it will be no surprise if they refuse to accept any outcome of the 2016 presidential election beyond the one they desire. This is simply further proof that Donald Trump s candidacy is dangerous. I shudder to think what will happen if he is actually elected president.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016"

Disturbing Uncovered Emails From Huma Abedin Bring Hillary’s Mental Health Into Question: “Often confused”,"How quickly the Democrats have forgotten about that little  incident  that landed Hillary in the hospital, following the death of the 4 Americans that she likely caused in Benghazi After reviewing more than 35 pages of email from top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Judicial Watch observes that Abedin advised a State Department staffer that it was  very important  to review phone calls with Clinton because she was  often confused. Judicial Watch notes that Abedin emailed State Department Clinton aide and companion Monica Hanley from her  Huma@clintonemail.com  to alert her about the need to go over phone calls with Clinton.Additionally, Abedin s emails reveal  repeated security breaches, with the Secretary s schedule and movements being sent and received through Abedin s non-governmental and unsecured Clinton server account,  states Judicial Watch.On January 26, 2013, Abedin had the following email exchange with Hanley:Abedin: Have you been going over her calls with her? So she knows singh is at 8? [India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh] Hanley: She was in bed for a nap by the time I heard that she had an 8am call. Will go over with her Abedin: Very imp to do that. She s often confused. The emails also provide specific details of Clinton s last day in office on January 31, 2013. Exact times and locations of all her appointments during the day are given. Huma Abedin s description of Hillary Clinton as  easily confused  tells you all you need to know why it took a federal lawsuit to get these government emails from Clinton s illegal email server,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  These emails also show that Hillary Clinton s and Huma Abedin s decision to use the Clinton email server to conduct government business was dangerous and risky.

Bachmann, a former Minnesota Republican congresswoman, bowed out of the 2012 GOP primary race after reports surfaced that she was wrestling with debilitating migraine headaches   including one that kept her offstage during part of a televised debate. A Clinton friend told Klein that the Democrats  current leading light might even be suffering from multiple sclerosis.Clinton herself released a letter on July 28 from a doctor who gave her a clean bill of health.Dr. Lisa Bardack of Mount Kisco, N.Y. wrote that Clinton, 67, has completely recovered from a December 2012 concussion that left her seeing double for two months.While treating that condition, doctors diagnosed a blood clot in her sinuses, requiring long-term daily doses of the blood-thinning medication Coumadin.Bardack added that Clinton had been diagnosed with blood clots previously, in both 1998 and 2009. But Klein s book goes far beyond talk of ordinary medical conditions. For the first time I ve known her, she s showing self-doubt about her strength and vitality,  a friend of Hillary told him, according to Radar Online.She also reportedly suffers from severe insomnia, which has  sapped her energy just when she needed it most for the campaign.

 WAPO: Trump Planning To Go Around Senate To Replace Sessions With A Loyal Stooge,"Donald Trump is very busy right now trying to get rid of his Attorney General, one Jeff Sessions. This is pretty extraordinary, since Sessions endorsed Trump while the rest of the elected Republican establishment was still treating Trump s candidacy with a mix of comedy and horror. Now, however, times have changed. Trump wants Sessions gone, due his firm (and possibly true) belief that Sessions  decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.As Mueller digs further into Trump World   including into Trump s finances, which Trump himself has said is some kind of red line   Trump is looking for a way to rid himself of the threat of what Mueller might find. With Sessions recused, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the one who would have the authority to fire Robert Mueller. Rosenstein has gone on the record under oath as saying that he will do no such thing without just cause. The solution to all of this for Trump? Get rid of Sessions and Rosenstein, and appoint an Attorney General who will be a staunch and unwavering Trump loyalist.It has been speculated that Trump is considering that former New York Mayor and fervent Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani might be just the man to do this. However, there is just one problem with that: Giuliani likely wouldn t pass the Senate confirmation process in this climate. In order to appear non-partisan, even Senate Republicans would insist on a nominee who is not an obvious Trump stalwart. Plus, Rudy Giuliani already admitted on the air that he literally tried to help Trump find a way to ban Muslims from the nation without doing so explicitly so as to pass Constitutional muster. Then there was the time during the campaign when Giuliani seemed to know what would be in a batch of hacked anti-Hillary Clinton emails that were leaked shortly after his statements. So, yeah, big confirmation problems there.So, what s Trump to do? Well, that s easy. Go around the Senate completely and install any Attorney General he wants, by appointing someone during the recess that the Senate always takes in late summer. Problem solved. According to the Washington Post, Team Trump is considering doing just that, when it comes to weighing options to get a pro-Trump Attorney General. From WaPo:Another scenario is that Trump could make a recess appointment, said University of Texas School of Law professor Steve Vladeck. Under that plan, Trump could choose an attorney general during the August recess who would serve until the end of the next Senate session, which could be early January. That person would have the same authority as someone who is confirmed by the Senate, Vladeck said.Now obviously such a move would be nothing short of the height of corruption, and politically explosive for Congressional Republicans, especially if they don t warn him against doing this. We all know that Trump and the people in the White House don t care how something like that looks. They want Robert Mueller and his Russia investigation gone at all costs, and if it means looking guilty as hell to do it, so be it. Anyone who has paid attention knows that Rudy Giuliani would have absolutely no issue following a Trump order to fire Robert Mueller. He d relish the task, in fact, because that would put him in the highest regard in Trump World   perhaps permanently.Republicans, if this shit goes down like this, it s on your heads. It would literally spin us into a full-fledged Constitutional crisis. If Trump moves to fire Mueller, you need to impeach him.

WATCH: JOEL OSTEEN FACES WRATH OF ANGRY CHRISTIANS After He Gives Reason For Locking Church Doors To Devastated Houston Flood Victims,"The popular evangelical preacher and inspirational speaker may have permanently damaged his brand with what many consider a very lame answer to the question about why his church locked out the neediest people in his community, who were devastated by the floods in Houston and surrounding areas, while he remained high and dry in his $10 million mansion Showing off a toothy grin and posing in front of stacks of donated food and diapers, televangelist Joel Osteen showed not a shred of remorse as he appeared on the Today show on Wednesday.Proudly, he declared that the doors of his 17,000 seat Texas megachurch had  always been open  to the people of Houston who have been rendered homeless by Hurricane Harvey and its devastating floods.It came after shocked Texans arrived at his Lakewood church on Sunday to find it free of flood water on the ground level despite a Facebook post issued at the height of the city s panic which claimed it was  inaccessible due to flooding .Osteen, still shirking responsibility for the decision, then said that the church chose not to open up to the needy because the city had not officially asked him to.

 Scooby Doo’s ‘Mystery Machine’ Involved In Crazy 100 MPH Getaway,"File this one under: WTF?!A woman driving a van painted to match  The Mystery Machine  van from the Scooby Doo cartoon decided that solving crimes was for squares and led the police on a high-speed chase in California (NOT Florida as we would normally expect). I imagine bystanders saw the well-done replica (it even has funky hubcaps) flash by with cop cars in pursuit and wondered if someone was making a movie.Redding.com reports:Shasta County Probation Department officials contacted the Redding Police Department about a subject violating their probation sometime around 12:50 p.m. Sunday. The woman was identified as Sharon Kay Turman, 51, of Redding, Sgt. Ron Icely said in a news release.Officers spotted Turman in a 1994 Chrysler Town and Country minivan at California Shasta streets, but she fled south in the vehicle when officers tried to pull her over, said Icely.Amazingly, the 22-year-old minivan got up to speeds of 100 miles per hour during the pursuit. Even more amazingly, despite having zero concern for the safety of anyone else on the road, Turman managed not to kill anyone, although she did blow through an intersection and almost hit four cars in the process.The police called off their pursuit, presumably to allow Turman to stop fleeing in a blind panic and to avoid a fatal car accident. Instead, they followed her with a helicopter:The CHP helicopter kept surveillance of Turman s vehicle as she continued west toward Highway 36, where she was spotted abandoning the vehicle in northwestern Tehama County. Her whereabouts were unknown Sunday afternoon, police said, but her vehicle was later found and impounded.It s not clear what crime Turman was on probation for but if the police were willing to let her escape rather than risk a fatal accident, it s very likely it wasn t a violent offense.But if you live in or near northwestern Tehama County, keep a look out for empty boxes of Scooby Snacks and this woman:Sharon Kay TurmanTurman is wanted by the Redding police and Shasta County probation.

" Trump Demands Queen Of Britain Pick Him Up In Gold-Plated Carriage, Organize Parade During Visit","Trump ran on  fiscal responsibility,  but has since made it clear that it doesn t apply to him.In yet another intentional embarrassment, details have leaked regarding Trump s demands for his upcoming state visit to England. They are petty and childish, and have infuriated much of England.Trump is said to have asked the Queen of England to pick him up in a gold-plated horse-drawn carriage and be given a parade as he makes his way to Buckingham Palace for an official visit.Donald Trump waving from the Queen s royal carriage is not a scenario many would have foreseen a year ago, but it has become a very real prospect, forcing security services to plan an unprecedented lockdown.The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.This may be another petty attempt by Trump to appear  better  than his predecessor, President Obama. The former president had repeatedly told the English government that it was not expected to drive him around in a gold chariot, citing cost and security.Trump, who views appearances as everything, has a different perspective. Who would have thought?Their living room Trump tower. Gold leaf walls-that's normal pic.twitter.com/uZqPKRXg4Q  Debra Kamin (@ubucky) July 30, 2016For the English government, Trump s request is said to be a financial, security and logistical nightmare. The Times again:One source said that Mr Trump s decision to opt for the carriage, rather than the bullet and bomb-proof car that was used by his predecessor presented a range of fresh headaches.The source said:  The vehicle which carries the president of the United States is a spectacular vehicle. It is designed to withstand a massive attack like a low-level rocket grenade. If he s in that vehicle he is incredibly well protected and on top of that it can travel at enormous speed. If he is in a golden coach being dragged up the Mall by a couple of horses, the risk factor is dramatically increased. The result is that London will go into lockdown mode not seen since the Olympics. The crushing financial burden will, of course, be footed by the English taxpayer. Trump, who makes his Secret Service detail rent their own golf courses when he plays golf at his own course, is not expected to chip in any money.Trump s expectations to be treated as nobility is a further insult to the British people, 1.8 million of whom recently signed a petition asking that Trump be banned from the country entirely. At several times, Parliament has debated whether to forbid Trump from entering England due to his history of racism and sexism. During the fiesty debate, two British PMs got into a heated exchange which culminated in this epic zinger:Carmichael:  Having offered a state visit [to Trump] this time, what will we offer the next time we want to get a favorable response? Salmond:  The crown jewels.

BRUCE JENNER CASHING IN BIG TIME WITH NEW IDENTITY: “I’m the new ‘normal'” [VIDEO],"Timing is everything, and no one knows how to seize the moment better than members of the Kardashian family. The progressive left is determined to bully Americans into submission when it comes to accepting the LGBT lifestyle as mainstream. After spending years in the reality TV business, Bruce Jenner just happens to know a thing or two about marketing himself and has a chosen much kinder and more palatable approach. And now, in true Kardashian style, it s time to sit back and cash in and his contribution to the decay of our society big time.Watch new promo for Bruce s new show  I am Cait  here: How many people go through life and just waste their entire life because they never deal with themselves, with who they are?  Jenner says at the start of the 60-second spot. According to a press release, the eight-part, one-hour series I Am Cait will tell the story of Jenner as he lives his  new normal. Living for the first time as the person he feels he was born to be, the docuseries will also explore what Bruce s transition means for the people in his life and how those relationships are affected, while offering a better understanding of many of life s challenges,  E! said in the statement.The promo follows Jenner as he applies makeup in a mirror and drives  out into the world. It s so bright out there, look at that,  Jenner says from the backseat of a car.  Isn t it great that maybe someday you ll be normal? Just blend into society? You are normal,  a woman interjects. Put it this way: I m the new normal,  Jenner replies.Bruce Jenner, who appeared for the first time as a transgender woman on an infamous Vanity Fair magazine cover earlier this week, could parlay his transition into a half-billion dollar fortune within a decade, experts predict.Jenner s net worth is already estimated to be $100 million. But experts familiar with the earning potential of media figures told the New York Daily News that the former gold medal Olympian and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star could be worth as much as $500 million in the next five to ten years. She could become the wealthiest of them all,  VH1 s The Gossip Table host Rob Shuter told the paper, referring to the rest of the Kardashian family.  If Bruce Jenner made $100 million in 65 years, if all the stars align, she could be worth over $500 million in the next five to 10 years. Caitlyn is going to be a pioneer. Jenner is set to star in an eight-part, one-hour reality television series called I Am Cait, airing this summer on E! And he was already earning between $20,000-$40,000 in speaking fees prior to his transition, according to fee tracking website BigSpeak.com. But that figure could shoot up sharply in the wake of Jenner s transformation and subsequent magazine cover. A book deal could hit seven figures,  Brian Balthazar, editor of culture website Pop Goes the Week, told the Daily News.  Speeches could garner six figures each. There is no denying the transgender movement s recent ascendancy in the national culture. In addition to Jenner s record-breaking magazine cover and upcoming reality show, popular television shows like Amazon s Transparent have catapulted the issue to the forefront of American consciousness, and some companies are already jumping on the chance to get involved.Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jun 4, 2015"
WILL OBAMA REGIME Be Held Accountable For Dirty Tactics They Used To Take Down MICHAEL FLYNN?,"While we re on the subject of lying to the FBI, when will Hillary Clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our Secretary of State?  Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn admitted Friday to making false statements to the FBI, entering the first guilty plea in Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators.A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.As part of the deal, Flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top Trump transition officials.Though the individuals are not named, court documents show Flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the Trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including Russia over a United Nations vote   discussions tied to one of Flynn s false statements.The documents also say Flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in December to ask what to communicate to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. That official and Flynn discussed how they didn t want Russia to  escalate the situation,  something Flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call.According to the plea deal, Flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly  with the probe, with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, becomes the first Trump ex-White House official charged in the special counsel probe.His tenure at the White House was brief   he was fired for similar conduct, pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the Russians   and Flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for Turkey and other issues. The fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation Friday that Flynn was cooperating and offering information to Mueller s team.As for the past discussions between Flynn and transition officials, it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to. But a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of Trump transition activities told Fox News that then-President-Elect Trump directed Flynn during that period to contact the Russians   while also directing him and his team to contact 12 other countries. The transition team felt that the Obama White House had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum,  the former official told Fox News.In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn. NBC News tweeted Cobb s statement:Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.

Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) December 1, 2017Watch Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton and ACLJ President Jay Sekulow lay out the case against Barack Obama officials and the felonies they committed when they leaked and improperly disseminate classified information and unmask members of the Trump transition team. Jay Sekulow explains to Sean Hannity, that,  The concern is the intelligence apparatus in the United States has rules, that they have to follow, like every other agency, and it appears that in the waning days, or maybe the last year of the former administration, they viewed those laws as advisory opinions and not law. When the unmasking allegations first surfaced, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) had plenty to say about the unmasking of Michael Flynn.On March 19, 2017, George Stephanopolis asked Senator Rand Paul about his thoughts on the unmasking of Michael Flynn. Senator Paul suggested that the person responsible for unmasking General Flynn should be in jail. Paul went on to say that you cannot allow this unmasking to take place,  or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed. Here s an excerpt from their conversation published by Politico:STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, sir, you re also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. WE see the president standing by that claim about President Obama. It s caused a rift now with British intelligence over the weekend. How big a problem is this for the president s credibility? How does he fix it?PAUL: I think that we know one thing for sure, that the Obama administration did spy on Flynn. Now, whether it was direct or indirect, somebody was reading and taking   a transcript of his phone calls and then they released it.It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to The New York Times.There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie detector tests. And I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well.But we need to get to the bottom of who is releasing these highly classified conversations. And if the president was surveilled, he probably wasn t the target. I don t know that he was or wasn t. But if he was, they probably targeted someone in a foreign government, but then they listened to the conversation with Americans.STEPHANOPOULOS; You don t believe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of President Trump?PAUL: Well, what happens is it s different than that. We target foreigners all the time, but they talk to Americans. They talk to the president. They talk to the national security advisers. And they re supposed to be masked.But there was something alarming the other day. General Hayden admitted that people all the way down to some of the lowest analysts can unmask who the American is. So, someone unmasked General Flynn and they re a low-level analyst, we need to be looking at their computer and find out if they unmasked that conversation and if they spoke with The New York Times you have got to put those people in jail, because you cannot allow this to happen, or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed.This is a huge, huge problem, bigger than anything else that s being discussed is the fact that private conversations from the intelligence community s perspective are being leaked to the press. That s not like a leak that says, oh, the president watches TV in his bathrobe, this is important to national security, you can t let it happen.Rand Paul was asked again about the unmasking of Michael Flynn on MSNBC s Morning Joe show. Paul told the leftist hosts backdoor searches are illegal and that they could be politicized. Paul said that Susan Rice should be placed under subpoena and she should be asked:  Did you talk to the President about this and did President Obama know about this?    Paul went on to say that the Susan Rice  unmasking  was a witch hunt started by the Obama administration because of sour grapes on the way  out the door.

BOOM! CUSTOMS AGENTS IGNORE Obama Appointed Judge’s Court Order…ENFORCE Trump’s Travel Ban,"On Friday, a federal judge in New York issued an emergency stay temporarily halting the removal of individuals detained after President Trump issued an order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.The move appears to mark the first successful legal challenge to the Trump administration and affects those who have arrived in the U.S. with previously approved refugee applications or were in transit with valid visas. Similar rulings were later issued in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state.U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly ruled in favor of a habeas corpus petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of two Iraqi men who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday after Trump signed his order.Donnelly, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed to her judgeship in 2015, ruled in the Eastern District of New York that  there is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject  to Trump s order.   The Hill The ACLU is getting  multiple reports  that federal customs agents are siding with President Trump   and willfully ignoring a Brooklyn federal judge s demand that travelers from seven Muslim countries not be deported from the nation s airports. The court s order could not be clearer  they need to comply with the order,  Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU s Immigrants Rights project, told The Post late Saturday. It s enough to be a serious concern,  Jadwat said of the reports.Jadwat and other ACLU lawyers had earlier Saturday night won an emergency stay of Trump s deportation order from Brooklyn Federal Judge Ann Donnelly. -NYPMUSLIMS Chant  Allah  And Protest With Call To Prayer Inside Dallas Airport [Video] ",politics,"Jan 30, 2017"

Bernard Sanders told CNN Thursday that President Trump s plan to prioritize job creation over climate change regulations is  stupid and dangerous.  The commander in chief signed an  Energy Independence  executive order Tuesday as a means of rolling back former President Barack Obama s Clean Power Plan. Mr. Trump said his policies will cause  wealth to pour into our communities,  although Mr. Sanders frames it as a recipe for environmental disaster.

While Trump and his friends think climate change is a hoax, what the scientists are telling us it is real, it is caused by human activity. It is already causing devastating problems.

WATCH: FORMER TRUMP GIRLFRIEND Sets The Record Straight After NYT’s TWISTS Her Remarks To Make Trump Appear Disrespectful To Women,"It s interesting how much vitriol some women harbor for successful men who date beautiful women, as though it s somehow evil  and mysoginist to date beautiful women. If Trump only dated unattractive women would that somehow make him a better candidate? One of the women quoted in a New York Times article headlined  Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private  is pushing back Monday and saying that she was taken out of context and Trump never made her feel uncomfortable.The piece   which was published Saturday   begins with the line  Donald J. Trump had barely met Rowanne Brewer Lane when he asked her to change out of her clothes. It then continues with a scene illustrated by Brewer Lane about a 1990 pool party at Trump s Florida beach club. He suddenly took me by the hand, and he started to show me around the mansion. He asked me if I had a swimsuit with me. I said no. I hadn t intended to swim. He took me into a room and opened drawers and asked me to put on a swimsuit. But Brewer Lane disputed the way she is portrayed Monday in an interview with Fox & Friends. The New York Times told us several times that they would make sure my story that I was telling came across, they promised several times that they would do it accurately, they told me several times and my manager several times that it would not be a hit piece and that my story would come across the way that I was telling it and honestly and it absolutely was not,  Brewer Lane said.  They did take quotes from what I said and they put a negative connotation on it. They spun it to where it appeared negative. I did not have a negative experience with Donald Trump. Brewer Lane dated Trump and said that the presumptive Republican nominee  never made me feel like I was being demeaned in any way, he never offended me in any way. WATCH HERE:  Obviously they feel like they need to do something to make him look bad or go along with their article,  Brewer Lane said. Why do you think the left   the mainstream media   is so obsessed with just creating this headline about how Donald Trump treats women?  host Ainsley Earhardt asked. I don t know.

“NEVER-TRUMP” BUSTED! Former Jeb Bush Staffer ADMITS To Planting Roy Moore Story In Washington Post,"Just another member of the swamp who s about to be sucked down the drain In 2015, leftist rag Politico called it a  Big hire  when Jeb Bush landed Tim Miller as his top communications aide.Jeb Bush plans to name Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising PAC, as his top communications aide, Republican sources told POLITICO on Friday.Miller initially will be a senior adviser to Bush s Right to Rise PAC, and is expected to become communications director if Bush launches his campaign. Kristy Campbell, who has been the PAC s chief spokesperson, likely will be national press secretary of the campaign, or have some senior communications adviser role.Now, thanks to Big League Politics, every member of the GOP can see the type of traitors to the Republican Party Jeb Bush hired to work on his campaign.A Friday Big League Politics report claims Tim Miller, a Republican operative prominent in the  Never Trump  movement, helped pitch the Washington Post story in which the first allegations of sexual misconduct nearly 40 years ago were made against Alabama GOP senatorial nominee Roy Moore.The report contains screenshots of what are alleged to be text messages between Miller and conservative publisher Charles C. Johnson of GotNews.com. The texts show Miller insulting Judge Moore s fitness for office and bragging about how  Beth  is  good to work with.  He is implied to be referring to Beth Reinhard, one of the two authors of the original Washington Post story.Reinhard, before joining the Washington Post, worked at the Wall Street Journal during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries as the embedded reporter covering the Bush campaign. She, therefore, likely had regular interaction with Miller since at least 2015.Miller, who served as Jeb Bush s communications director in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, categorically denies any involvement in the Washington Post story. He told Breitbart News:I had no involvement in pitching the Washington Post story or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore. Moore allies have tried to pitch this to 10+ outlets, conservative and mainstream, who have all rejected the story after examining the facts because there is no truth to it.Big League Politics Editor-in-Chief Patrick Howley makes his case as follows:These text messages reveal a few things: the Republican Establishment s relationship with the Post s anti-Moore coverage, the cunning of writer Charles Johnson in trapping Miller, and former Bush staffer Miller s cluelessness about how to conduct himself in the world of political subterfuge. Miller denied to BLP that he was involved in the Washington Post story  or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore,  but the text messages below leave no doubt as to his involvement [sic][.]During and after the 2016 primaries, Miller was one of the leading voices against eventual GOP nominee Donald Trump. He played a role in the decidedly unsuccessful attempt by Never Trumpers to disregard the will of Republican voters and deny Trump the nomination through the use of convention rules.Miller remains an outspoken critic of Trump and consistently opposes Republicans of the pro-Trump or populist-nationalist bent. He has frequently appeared on cable news programs as an anti-trump Republican voice and now is one of far-left Salon.com s 25 favorite  conservatives. Miller has aggressively campaigned for Judge Moore s liberal Democratic opponent Doug Jones. on Twitter, announcing last month that he had donated money to Jones:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well.

The Jerusalem Decision: From Creative Chaos to Effective Turmoil," Dr Can Erimtan 21st Century WireDid Donald J. Trump have any idea about the impact his words would have across the world?!? Did he have any idea that the whole wide world, including the United Nations, would turn against him?On Wednesday, 6 December 2017, in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room the President of the United States proceeded to make history, or, proceeded to leave his personal mark on the flow of world events as his words set a whole chain of global events in motion: I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. In his preamble to this potentially explosive and arguably rather disconcerting statement, Trump explained that  [i]n 1995, [under Bill Clinton s watch, that is] Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city   and so importantly   is Israel s capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.  In this way, the 45th U.S. President showed himself to have been cut from a completely different cloth indeed, as he uttered words that neither Bill Clinton, nor George W. Bush or, more importantly perhaps, Barack Obama had dared speak.Yes, Trump openly came out and made plain the deep love that dare not speak its name   in spite of the vehemently pro-Israel stance taken by the U.S. ever since the time of President Eisenhower (1953-61) and particularly, ever since the Six Day War (5-10 June 1967), in spite of the ceaseless activities of AIPAC and J Street, no previous incumbent had dared bestow a bona fide U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem as a physical token of the deep and ardent bonds between the New World and the Promised Land. Only, Donald J. Trump had the gall to  deliver,  doing what Clinton had promised yet none of his successors had been able to realise . . . until now, that is.In true Aristotelian fashion Trump took the potentiality that was Jerusalem (known as Al Quds or the Sacred City in the Muslim world) and turned it into an actuality by means of pledging full ambassadorial honours for the ancient city. Following these presidential words, outspoken Israeli voices did not take long to heap praise on the White House. Mark Regev, the erstwhile spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem (2004-7) and frequent Israeli apologist appearing on various mainstream media, and currently even active as Israeli Ambassador in London (since 2015) blurted out that he  think[s] this was a just move and a good move for peace. His boss, Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu (fourth premiership, 2015 present) was equally forthcoming, talking to the press on the same day the U.S. President made his performance in the Diplomatic Reception Room:  Thank you President Trump for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  The PM in the next instance also echoed his ambassador s words, declaring that  [t]here is no peace that doesn t include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The idea that Jerusalem should be at the heart of the Jewish people s  land and nation namely has its roots in the Bible, in 2 Chronicles 6:5-6, to be precise:  Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built so that my Name might be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel. But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel,  as worded in the New International Version. And Bibi knows that too.Bibi even took his words of praise abroad. First to Paris, where he met with President Emmanuel Macron, who had urged his U.S. counterpart to preserve the city s status quo prior to Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room performance (10 December 2017). Bibi disagreed volubly with the Frenchman, characterising as  absurd  anyone not willing to recognise the  millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem.  Next, even proceeding to refer to God s word that had elevated Jerusalem to its lofty position as site for his temple:  [y]ou can read it in a very fine book   it s called the Bible.  The following day he went to Brussels, where he attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (11 December 2017). The Israeli PM told the gathered EU FM as well as the assembled press corps that Trump s Jerusalem declaration  makes peace possible because recognizing reality is the substance of peace, the foundation of peace. The Invention of the Jewish People and the Position of Jerusalem in IslamThe state of Israel, as a Jewish nation state implanted on Middle Eastern soil in 1948, employs nationalist myth and religious tradition as credible arguments justifying its mere existence. The Israeli journalist and author Daniel Gavron, for example, states that  most Israelis [regard it as] axiomatic that the celebrations for the 3,000th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by King David [in 1995] mark[ed] a real and tangible event,  even though he himself doubts its authenticity. In other words, the Jewish people, as a shorthand for the Israeli citzenry, have apparently already been following the political and ideological leanings currently exhorted by Bibi for quite a while. But, as I explained at length some time ago, the mere mention of the term  nation  or even just  people  is a problematic issue in its own right   the point that I am trying to get across is that  nations  or  people  cannot be perceived as  natural  or even  organic  phenomena, but rather as contrived and constructed social units consisting of individuals who willingly become part of a larger  artificial  whole through the manipulation and management of larger forces and structures   leaders of men and their organisations. It has been nearly ten years now that the historian Schlomo Sand published his groundbreaking text The Invention of the Jewish People, which attempted to popularise the theoretical constructs of writers and thinkers like Benedict Anderson and Ernst Gellner, amongst others, but, as seems blatantly apparent from looking at Bibi s recent proclamations, his message has clearly failed to penetrate the academic bubble, in spite of having topped Israeli bestseller list  for nineteen weeks. With regard to the city of Jerusalem, on the other hand, archeological evidence appears to prove conclusivedly that the  site has been continuously occupied for some 5,000 years,  signalling the urban centre s pre-Jewish roots. But the notion that King David conquered the place to establish the one true god s temple seems rather shaky. Gavron explains that the  biblical account of the capture of the city is the only one we have, and in the opinion of most modern scholars, the Bible is not an entirely reliable historical document.  Still, archeological excavations carried out in the summer of 1993 appear to have produced evidence that a certain David indeed founded a dynastic live in the 10th century BCE   namely, a small  triangular piece of basalt rock . . . subsequently identified as part of a victory pillar erected by the king of Syria and later smashed by an Israelite ruler  carrying an Aramaic inscription talking about a  Beit David ( House  or  Dynasty of David ). But the Jewish  conquest  of Jerusalem did not mark the end of the city s story of military takeover and/or occupation: remaining in ancient times, the Assyrian King Sennacherib laid siege to the city in the year 701 BCE, whereas the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar captured the city in the seventh year of his reign (598 BCE), but of greater importance is the sack and destruction of the city and its temple at the hands of Titus, son of the Roman Emperor Vespasian (70 CE), in response to the Jews  Great Revolt against Rome that had sprung up in 66 CE. The ultimate outcome of Rome s harsh response was the  Diaspora,  as explained by the American rabbi, lecturer, and author Joseph Telushkin, who estimates that  as many as one million Jews died  as a result, while carrying in its wake the  almost two-thousand-year span of Jewish homelessness and exile.  With the majority of Jews apparently dispersed from the land and city, Jerusalem was eventually conquered by the Caliph Umar (reign 634-44) in the year 638, an event which seems to have taken place following a  peaceful siege, no blood was shed,  in the words of Zia H Shah, a New York-based physician and the Chief Editor of the Muslim Times. The addition of Jerusalem to the Dar al-Islam (or, the abode of Islam) was important. Though the city s name does not appear specifically in the Quran (containing only a reference to  al-Masjid al- Aqsa  or the  Furthest Mosque,  17:1), it is the locus of the Prophet s miraculous Night Journey (or Mi raj). The story, as related in various prophetic traditions (or hadith), tells how the figure of the Prophet travelled from  Makkah to the Furthest Mosque (in Jerusalem), from whence he ascended Heaven, so that Allah might  show him of Our signs. As a result, the Masjid al- Aqsa, arguably built by the Caliph Umar though no historical records exist to this effect, is regarded as the third most sacred mosque in Islam, following the Masjid Al-Haram in Makkah, and Al Masjid An-Nabawi in Madinah.A Pseudo-Ottoman Gambit: Diverting Attention for a PurposeAs a result, Donald Trump s Diplomatic Reception Room stunt far supersedes the thorny Palestinian issue, the life-and-death matter of peace in the Middle East, or even the real estate division between East and West Jerusalem. The English-language pan-Arab television channel Al Jazeera English matter-of-factly point out on its website that  [v]iolence, protests and arrests have followed US President Donald Trump s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All across the globe Muslims have taken to the street to voice their disapproval of Trump s latest attempt to act like a real president, a president unlike any of his predecessors:  [r]allies against Trump s decision also took place in the Indian city of Mumbai, the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and the Japanese capital, Tokyo.  But also in Turkey   where President Recept Tayyip Erdo an (aka the Prez)  has been at pains for years to appear as a rightful heir to the Ottoman sultans of old   after all, Sultan Selim I (1512-20) took hold of the city of Jerusalem in 1517, remaining part of the Ottoman fold till the onset of the British Mandate (1917-48). On Thursday and Friday, (7-8 December 2017),  spontaneous  meetings took place throughout the whole of the country, from Istanbul over Bursa, Ankara, and Mersin, to Hatay, Gaziantep, Tatvan, Adana, Van, and Kahramanmara . More importantly, the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held a meeting in Istanbul on 13 December 2017, and the Prez employed this platform to portray himself as the ultimate champion of Islam, defying not just the United States of America and Israel, but also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nominal Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. As I have written quite some time ago, the Prez is more than determined to challenge his erstwhile friend and ally King Salman and see himself as the rightful Calip of the world of Islam, in true pseudo-Ottoman fashion.The OIC meeting dutifully released its  Istanbul Declaration on  Freedom for Al Quds' : [a]ppreciating the Republic of Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting the Extraordinary Islamic Summit regarding this important cause of Ummah, especially the call for this Extraordinary Summit made by His Excellency Recep Tayyip Erdo an (image, left), President of the Republic of Turkey . . . We reject and condemn the US Administration s unlawful statement regarding the status of Al Quds . . . Just like the fact that Israel s decision to annex Al Quds and its actions and practices therewith are never accepted, we declare that this statement is identically null and void from the point of view of conscience, justice and history. We invite all members of the UN, the EU and the international community to remain committed to the status of Al Quds and all related UN Resolutions. Rather than accomplishing anything much at all, the extraordinary OIC meeting primarily served to heighten Tayyip  Erdo an s prestige, at home as well as abroad. As such, a cynic would say that Trump s timing was impeccable, as 17/25 December marks the anniversary of the scandal variously known as #AKPgate that erupted in 2013, and that presently was very much on people s minds in Turkey given that the Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab (or R za Sarraf, in Turkish) was appearing in court in New York. The court case investigates breaches of the sanctions placed upon Iran and many Turks eagerly followed the proceedings on Twitter. One Istanbul-based writer Kareem Shaheen described the accusations as follows:  [i]n a case that has strained relations between Turkey and the US, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, described a sprawling money laundering network that allowed Iran access to international markets from 2010 to 2015 in violation of sanctions over its nuclear programme. He told jurors in New York on Thursday [30 November 2017] that [Tayyip] Erdo an, who was prime minister of Turkey at the time, had personally authorised a transaction on behalf of Iran. Zarrab said he had [also] bribed the then Turkish economy minister Zafer  a layan and the former head of the state-owned Halkbank. As a result, given that the Zarrab case all but exacerbated the dire Turco-American relationship, Trump s Jerusalem declaration must have come as a welcome bolt from the blue for Erdogan. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel s capital finally absolved the Erdogan from any attempts to salvage the cross-Atlantic relationship, and instead emboldened him to announce publicly that the Republic of Turkey is now the rightful heir to the Ottoman Empire and the only hope left for Muslims across the world, Muslims that have been victimised by years and years of oppressive U.S. foreign policy. And, putting a cherry on top of the proverbial cake of discontent, Erdo an announced on Thursday, 17 December 2017, that he would establish a Turkish Embassy in Jerusalem, representing Ankara in Palestine, to be clear. Speaking to an audience of faithful followers in the city of Karaman, the Prez declared  God willing, the day is close when officially, with God s permission, we will open our embassy there,  in Jerusalem.All the while, the Palestinian people continue to suffer and Israel employs any and every pretext available to stage military assaults on the Gaza strip and crack down on Palestinian protesters But, Trump has done his deed, leaving his indelible mark on the Middle East, while the Prez, in turn, can now rightfully claim that he alone is able to represent the Muslim world on the international arena.*** 21WIRE special contributor Dr. Can Erimtan is an independent scholar who was living in Istanbul for some time, with a wide interest in the politics, history and culture of the Balkans and the Greater Middle East.

 Megyn Kelly Called Trump A ‘Predator’; What Newt Gingrich Said Next Was DISGUSTING (VIDEO),"It s Fox News, but that doesn t mean that everyone is blindly following Donald Trump. Anchor Megyn Kelly fell off the Trump train right about the time of the first Republican presidential debate of the season, after which Trump accused Kelly of having  blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,  all because she dared ask about Trump s history of sexism.It s been more than a year since that debate, and in that time, Trump the sexist has come front and center, especially after Trump was caught on a hot mic, saying that he likes to grab women  by the pussy,  and to confirm Trump s own words, nearly a dozen women are now accusing the self-described billionaire of sexual misconduct.Kelly, when interviewing Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, suggested that Trump is a  sexual predator.  At that point, the interview went off the rails. Gingrich became very angry and said to Kelly,Kelly responded in the best way possible,  I m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and what we are getting in the oval office. Every woman knows that when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  he s not saying it in a way that means she d be welcome in Trump s locker room   not at all. When a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  especially in an argumentative context, he s calling her a whore. While that statement might not have the same bite in 2016 that it might have had when Gingrich was young, the intent is there. Gingrich is trying to discredit Kelly in the exact same way that Trump is trying to discredit his alleged victims. A woman liking sex is still used as a defense in rape trials. While men grabbing pussy, or talking about grabbing pussy, is just boys being boys. Women talking about sex is taboo and any woman who dares talk about sex deserve whatever they have coming to them.Believe it or not, that exchange was the most rational part. In the now familiar Trump tactic of  I know you are but what am I,  Gingrich went on to call Bill Clinton a  sexual predator.  He even tried subtly bullying Kelly into  say(ing) the words,  Bill Clinton sexual predator.' Kelly went on to say that on her show, they ve covered the Bill Clinton story and that she s interviewed Kathleen Willey, who has accused Clinton of rape (an accusation for which a grand jury found insufficient evidence).Here s the video:Gingrich has a grudge against Clinton, to be sure. If you recall, the former Speaker of the House was one of architects of the Clinton impeachment, which only served to boost Clinton s popularity while it seriously hurt Congress s.Ironically, Gingrich and the other two Speakers who presided during the impeachment investigation and trials, were all sexual predators. Dennis Hastert molested boys while a wrestling coach in Illinois and Bob Livingston had a string of affairs. Gingrich was cheating on his second wife. Before that, though, Gingrich earned the title of sexual predator, at least that s what he s accused of:One former aide describes approaching a car with Gingrich s daughters in hand, only to find the candidate with a woman, her head buried in his lap. The aide quickly turned and led the girls away. Another former friend maintains that Gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town. On one occasion, he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative, and instead tried to seduce her. In certain circles in the mid-1970s, Gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies  man.Source: SalonOh, and he also served his first wife her divorce papers while she was recovering from cancer surgery. Yes, he and Trump are a perfect match.",News,"October 26, 2016"
 KKK Leader Brags That White Supremacists Have Taken Over The Republican Party (AUDIO),"White supremacists are celebrating Donald Trump s rise to the top of the Republican Party and KKK leader David Duke bragged about it on the radio.Speaking with Don Advo this week about Trump s decision to hire Breitbart boss Stephen K. Bannon to be his campaign CEO, Duke, who is a racist former KKK Grand Wizard, roared his approval of the choice as both Advo and Duke cheered that white supremacists had taken over the GOP, although he lamented that there were still  boll weevils in the cotton.  You know, because cotton is white and boll weevils are black or brown insects. So, something astonishing has happened. We appear to have taken over the Republican Party,  Advo declared to the delight of his Stormfront fans. Well, rank and file, but a lot of those boll weevils are still in those cotton balls, and, uh, the Republican Party may be a European-American populated party, but like a ball of cotton, you can have boll weevils in there that are going to rot it out from the inside,  Duke replied.Here s the audio via Daily Motion. duke alt right by DailyPoliticsDuke has been emboldened so much by Trump s successful seizure of the Republican Party crown that he is now running for the US Senate in Louisiana.Should he win, Republicans would have a unapologetic racist as part of their Senate caucus and would be a strong ally of Donald Trump should he win the presidency. A racist in the White House and a racist in the Senate is probably not exactly what Republicans were planning but that s what they got. And that s because Republicans created the atmosphere that allowed racists like Trump and Duke to rise.White supremacists love Donald Trump, and Duke has supported the Republican nominee throughout his campaign run.Not only does Trump and Duke need to be defeated, the Republican Party needs to be taken back from the racists who took it over. Because right now, Abraham Lincoln is spinning in his grave about what the GOP has become.

UN AMBASSADOR SAMANTHA POWER Unmasked Hundreds of Trump Associates During 2016 Election [Video],"Adam Kredo of WFB asks the question we all want the answer to:  The fact that this information subsequently leaked to the press, I think raises even more questions about why a U.N ambassador over in Turtle Bay needs to unmask.  Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

Neither of these people understand how the Constitution works as supreme law of the land.Davis still seems to believe that the laws of  the Bible  reign supreme over her actions serving the public.She said: I was obeying my law I had couples bring in the whole Supreme Court ruling and I said,  You know, I really don t need to see this because that s not a law, that s a ruling  [and they d say]  Well, why won t you do this?  And so then I go to the Bible and I d tell them, [and they d respond,]  Don t be reading me the Bible.  Well, you asked why I couldn t issue you a marriage license and I m explaining to you, I m showing you why I cannot. They didn t want to hear that though. They wanted to shove that paper down my throat and make me eat it for my dinner. Actually, Kim, the Bible has nothing to do with your job and serving the public. If you re to serve the public as your job requires you to do, you are to abide by the law, including federal law, which in this case is the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution offering equal protections to all citizens, not just the ones that fit your standard under your religion. If you don t want to do your job, might I suggest you resign. You are free to worship as you choose on your own time, but when it comes to restricting others equal protections, you are disobeying the Constitution which was made clear by the Supreme Court. They re not writing new laws to tell you what to do, they are upholding the ones written upon our nation s founding.

 Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"

PAMELA GELLAR’S FREE SPEECH EVENT HELPS ROOT OUT ANOTHER “off-the-charts dangerous” AMERICAN MUSLIM TERRORIST WITH BIG PLANS…,"Like moths to a lamp bam!The terror suspect who allegedly helped orchestrate the shootout at an anti-Islam event in Texas had aspirations to join Islamic State and attack the Super Bowl, authorities say.Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, 43, was described as  off-the-charts dangerous  by officials as they outlined the evidence against him. He was arrested last week on charges related to the shootout at a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest, which led to the deaths of two roommates from Phoenix, Arizona.An indictment filed in federal court in Phoenix says Kareem hosted the gunmen in his home from January and also provided the guns they used in the May 3 shooting in Garland.At a hearing in federal court, FBI special agent Dina McCarthy described how a witness and a confidential informant reportedly learned about Kareem s interest in the Islamic State, including watching the terror group s videos with Texas shooters Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi.McCarthy said a 2012 investigation into Kareem determined he had a terrorism training document on his computer.She claimed he wanted to attack the Super Bowl when it was in Arizona this year   but she provided no specifics about how serious he was.The magistrate denied bail for Kareem, who is charged with conspiracy, making false statements and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a felony. This is an individual who is apt to incite violence,  prosecutor Kristen Brook said.  This defendant, based on all these facts, is dangerous   he is off-the-charts dangerous. Defense lawyer Daniel Maynard called it a trumped-up case based largely on an unreliable confidential informant charged with kidnapping and sex trafficking. This is your typical jailhouse snitch,  Maynard said   adding that there was no proof Kareem purchased any of the guns used in the Texas shooting.Via: UK Daily Mail",Government News,"Jun 17, 2015"
WHY IS OBAMA DISARMING COPS IN AMERICA At Same Time Terror Threat Is Being Raised?,"In the face of mounting threats of terrorism and civil unrest in U.S. cities, President Barack Obama is arbitrarily prohibiting local police and sheriff departments from obtaining military surplus equipment from the Defense Department as part of what many law enforcement officers are calling his war on police.Beginning on Monday, Obama visited a number of high-crime areas   especially those with large black populations   to explain the need for his unilateral action, according to news sources on Monday.President Obama s spokespeople said Monday that the administration will no longer give local cops some types of protective gear and vehicles while putting stricter controls on other weapons and equipment distributed to law enforcement. The details were released prior to Obama s visit to Camden, News Jersey, Monday afternoon to give a speech on how he will address police officers allegedly using racist tactics based on racist departmental policies.Obama and his supporters view police wearing protective riot gear and using armored vehicles as being overly-aggressive in neighborhoods that are predominately black and Hispanic. The President even accused some departments of issuing bayonets, which is demonstrably untrue, according to one police officer who claims she voted for Obama in 2008.  This President actually shows his dislike for local cops. I believe he wants to federalize policing and do away with local and state law enforcement. While the constitution prohibits that, when was the last time Obama cared about what the constitution says,  said Iris Aquino, a former police detective.During Obama s speech in Camden, New Jersey, a city reputed to have the highest violent crime rate in the United States, not once did he mention the police officers who were gunned down by blacks or whites within the last few months, noted a New York City police official who has been active fighting against the anti-cop Mayor Bill de Blasio.  That s because Obama like many liberal-left ideologues believe that police officers are the primary oppressors of minorities. The fact that Obama and the  racial-division industry    which includes the likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson   keep blacks in a state of poverty in order to use their anger and resentment for their own political interests appears to escape the notice of the news media, another group that doesn t care about dead cops,  he said.Originally police officers were led to believe that Obama would continue the Pentagon s military surplus program, however a panel of his sycophants warned that there is a propensity for misuse of equipment such as armored vehicles, high-powered firearms and camouflage. But not one example of police misusing an armored vehicle has been reported.  I have not heard of one incident in which police misused an armored vehicle. These are defensive vehicles used by cops to protect themselves from gunfire, Molotov cocktails, explosives and weapons of mass destruction,  said former law enforcement commander Jack McGowan.  High-powered firearms? The police use nothing that even resembles a  powerful  firearm. And camo clothing is clothing. No one gets hurt from a shirt s design pattern,  McGowan said.Besides cutting off the flow of equipment that would have gone to local law enforcement, the Obama government considering a recall of certain equipment that was already give to local police and sheriffs departments.  I ll highlight steps all cities can take to maintain trust between the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line, and the communities they re sworn to serve and protect,  Obama said in his weekly address out Saturday.Obama believes law enforcement is a necessary evil, claim his opponents.  He s never showed local cops any respect. He also doesn t trust any agency he doesn t directly control. This is an American leader who wants to federalize the law enforcement function and he has a lot supporters who trust big government over states rights,  political strategist Michael Baker.Former New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani s Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he believes a  war on police,  exists in America, the anti-cop attitudes are being stoked up by Obama and his minions.  After 20 years of incredible crime reduction accomplished by thousands of dedicated police officers, the public has become complacent now that they are safer,  said Safir.  They have let the anti-police pundits and talking heads convince everyone from the president to the attorney general that police are racist and brutal. Via: Examiner",left-news,"May 20, 2015"
NC TEACHER SIGNS UP FIRST GRADERS For Black Lives Matter Protest With No Consent," This so-called movement is out of control and it s not even clear what the end game is here.

A Durham, North Carolina teacher signed up six year-olds for a Black Lives Matter protest without their parents  consent.Central Park School for Children in Durham, North Carolina has enrolled grade-school students in a  Black Lives March and Rally  scheduled for March 17, 2016. The teachers can opt-in or opt-out their classes, but parents have not been given a choice.Stef Bernal-Martinez, a teacher of 6-year-old children, signed up all the children in her class for a  Black Lives March and Rally  to take place during the school day, at the city s downtown Central Park and Farmer s Market. Ms. Bernal-Martinez describes herself as a  Radical Queer Progressive Educator  and  white-passing Xicana. The event, like the Black Lives Matter movement itself, is less a spontaneous protest movement than a divide-and-conquer campaign by elite leftists. Two out of three African-Americans prefer the hrase  All Lives Matter  to  Black Lives Matter  according to a national August, 2015 Rasmussen poll. The grade school is predominantly Caucasian, but run by radical leftists. Naturally the school didn t send the parents consent forms.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Mar 17, 2016"

" Trump Project Under Federal Investigation, Possibly Violates Labor Laws","Donald Trump s project that is supposedly converting the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C. is the subject of a Labor Department investigation. It is being alleged that workers on the site are being paid less than what is mandated under federal law.The Labor Department confirmed to POLITICO that it s looking into allegations of wage-rule violations by the Craftsmen Group, a Trump Organization subcontractor that restores windows. And workers on the site, including one Craftsmen Group employee, told POLITICO that they and others aren t receiving pay rates mandated by law. Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims.Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House. Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.  When it s completed,  he said,  it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. Trump s contract with the federal government for the site is actually structured so that Trump is actually leasing it from the government. That means wages on the site are set by federal law, which requires all workers   union or not   on the site to be paid the  prevailing wage  set in the area by labor unions.A sign at the Trump site pointed out that glaziers, the workers installing shower doors, should be paid between $24.30 to $27.64 an hour. But their paystubs show them earning way less   between $13 to $16 an hour   almost half of what the law requires.Trump has been slammed recently for repeatedly underpaying contractors who have done work on his properties, and in some instances not paying them at all for the work they ve done for him and his companies. Trump claimed that he was completely justified in stiffing workers.Featured image via Flickr",News,"June 22, 2016"

 Fox News Host Makes Herself A Total Laughingstock In Attempted Dig At NASA (TWEETS),"Fox News host Greta Van Susteren saw an opportunity to use NASA to take a jab at  big government  that is equal parts confused and stupid. It did not go well.NASA recently released some incredibly stunning photographs of Pluto, captured by the New Horizons spacecraft during its once in a lifetime flyby of the (dwarf) planet in 2015. The tiny spacecraft took close to ten years to arrive to Pluto and now heads out even deeper into what is called the Kuiper Belt, a collection of  ancient icy mini-worlds  at the far reaches of what we would consider our solar system.Only the technical feat and stunning photographs weren t good enough for Van Susteren. She was upset that NASA took so long, and seized the opportunity to rail against NASA using American tax dollars while not delivering its photos into Greta s inbox faster than the speed of light.Why did they wait until NOW to release these? pics taken in 2015 and we pay their salaries in tax dollars https://t.co/hhXxrfsWEr  Greta Van Susteren (@greta) June 1, 2016It s clear that Van Susteren didn t bother to read the article she linked to, or she may have found her answer. It wasn t a vast government cover-up to hide images of Pluto from the taxpayers. It was the fact that Pluto is really, really far away and the data takes a very long time to trickle in.Though the encounter took place more than 10 months ago, New Horizons is still beaming flyby data home, and likely won t be done doing so until this coming fall, mission team members have said.Van Susteren s goal seemed to be to slam the Obama administration for cutting NASA s budget, a critique that is both laughably off-base and not the issue. As one Twitter user patiently explained to Van Susteren, demanding a low power spacecraft to send high-resolution images back faster is like getting 9 women pregnant in the hopes of making a baby in a month. That s not how any of this works. (In any case, the New Horizons spacecraft launched in 2006, three years before Obama sent Fox News into a rage frenzy about  responsible  government.)There s no question that NASA has been hamstrung by its dwindling budget, but its financial woes have nothing to do with Obama. Republicans in Congress, eager to kill anything that even smells like it could support climate change, have repeatedly tried to dismantle the space agency s budget over allegations that the data it collects is biased against climate deniers. This death by attrition has meant the shuttering of the manned space shuttle program, as well as cutbacks in cutting-edge research. Instead, Republicans have told NASA to focus more on space   a vague directive if there ever was one   and not on Earth. And like any good hostage taker, to show they were serious, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology (a misnomer considering how anti-science the committee is) went ahead and slashed an additional $320 million.Van Susteren s network has, of course, acted as the Republican Party s cheerleader through all of this. Routinely, Fox News will feature thinly veiled hit pieces on science and research in order to  prove  that spending government money on such endeavors is a waste. Much better, they argue, to waste that money on fighting a losing legal battle for the right to discriminate against transgender children. Or on fighter jets that don t work.However at this rate, getting a person like Greta Van Susteren to see the hypocrisy in her jabs at NASA and Obama might take longer than a trip to Pluto and back.Featured image via Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016"
 WATCH: Sean Spicer Just Defended Michael Flynn While Attacking Sally Yates,"Following Sally Yates  testimony yesterday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday accused the former acting Attorney General of being a  political opponent of the president  because she informed the White House three times that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied about his contacts with Russia. Spicer was asked why it took Trump 18 days to fire Flynn after it was revealed by Yates that he had been  compromised  and was vulnerable to being blackmailed by Russia.Spicer said that Flynn was not fired immediately because of  an element of due process  after the White House  was informed of [Yates] giving us a heads up. Somebody came over, gave us a heads up, told us there were materials,  Spicer said.  Ultimately, the president made a decision that was the right one. So, I think the process worked. According to Spicer, Trump defended Flynn after learning that he lied because he is  somebody who served our country honorably in uniform for over 30 years. The president does not want to smear a good man,  Spicer continued.  Let s look at how this came down. Someone who is not exactly a supporter of the president s agenda who a couple of days after this conversation took place refused to uphold a lawful order of the president who was not exactly excited about President Trump by taking office or his agenda. Just because someone gives you a heads up doesn t mean you jump the gun and go take action,  Spicer added.  What if we just dismissed someone because a political opponent of the president had made an utterance, you would argue that it s pretty irrational. Watch:Spicer also said that Yates was a  strong supporter of Clinton,  however, he said that without offering proof of such.  It was widely rumored,  Spicer said.Watch:lol, reporter asked Spicer why he claimed Yates was  strong supporter of Hillary Clinton,  Spicer OF COURSE says  it was rumored  pic.twitter.com/UgWmZ1Rol6  Tommy Christopher (@tommyxtopher) May 9, 2017Spicer called Sally Yates, who has served under Republican and Democratic Presidents, and served in the Justice Department for nearly three decades with an unblemished record,  a political opponent.

 These Secret Koch Bros. Memos Expose Propaganda Plans,"Secret memos have been unearthed that show the inner workings of a propaganda campaign being waged in order to keep the multi-million dollar influence of dark money groups funded by people like the Koch Brothers a secret.In the documents obtained by the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica, instructions have been disseminated by the State Policy Network to tell right-wing politicians how to fight against campaign finance laws, and how to push back on laws that fight other political corruption.The State Policy Network, which on its website calls pro-regulation activists  enemies of debate,  distributed its documents at a conference held last fall in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The material includes a map of cities and states considering measures to  force disclosure of charitable giving  and a set of  questions that help people see the consequences of public disclosure.  Among them:  Do you think the government should be able to take down names and addresses of Americans and who they donate to? Do you think people should be targeted for expressing their opinions? The organization also urges its supporters to choose the right phrases to color the debate, shunning terms such as  activist,   anonymous  or  dark money  in favor of  private giving,   censor  and  silencing dissent.  Under the header  Framing the Issue,  a man is pictured with tape over his mouth.In a perversion of the phrase  free speech,  the memos argue that bills dealing with corruption or ethics should be examined in order to campaign against them with the claim that they are censoring free speech.The goal here is to keep in place a world where right-wing billionaires like the Koch Brothers, who bankroll organizations like the State Policy Network along with other conservative sugar daddies, set the policy and the direction of America.The continued use of  dark money  to influence local and national elections without identifying the people behind it is a long-term aim of the right. By contrast, progressive activists have argued that if someone is putting millions or billions of dollars into political campaigns, often with the hopes that the politicians they ve helped to elect will return the favor with laws tilted in favor of the super-rich, we should know who they are.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 8, 2016"
HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: ‘Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians!’ [Video],"Sean Hannity was on fire with his opening comments on the Clinton-Uranium One deal bombshell last night. He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium. IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE CLINTON-URANIUM ONE BOMBSHELL:Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters.

Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",Government News,"Oct 18, 2017"
NEW AUDIO RELEASED Moments After Muslim SOMALI-IMMIGRANT Cop Shot and Killed 40-Yr Old ‘Bride-to-Be”,"Somali immigrant and Minnesota police officer Mohamed Noor shot and killed a 40 yr. old Australian woman when they arrived at her home to respond to a call she made about a potential sexual assault near her home. Officer Noor has only been a police officer for 2 years, and although he is celebrated by the local mayor for being a Somali immigrant, he is no stranger to controversy. He currently has two open complaints that have filed against him and one that has been dismissed without any disciplinary action from the Minnesota Police Department.Many are struggling to understand why the 40-year old Australian citizen Justine Dramond, who was set to be married to a US citizen, was shot in her pajamas after calling to report a crime near her home.Zach Damond, would-step,son of Justine was interviewed a woman who identifies herself as  Bethany  and then shamelessly went on to plug the Women s March of Minnesota  before asking Zach about his deceased mother. Zach, who is understandably emotional about the murder of father s fianc , tells  Bethany  that  America sucks  and  F*ck the police.  Zach clarified his statement saying, Some of you are good, but like I m just done. I m so done. This has to stop. This has to stop. That was my mom. Watch:Dramond, born Justine Ruszczyk but took her fiance s last name ahead of their nuptuals, called police Saturday night to report a possible sexual assault behind her home.She was in her pajamas when the police cruiser, driven by Harrity, arrived at the scene.The officers were speaking with Dramond when Noor fired across Harrity, hitting the 40-year-old woman in the abdomen.

 White Supremacist Chases Down Black Teen And Kills Him In Oregon,"Just remember that white supremacists support Donald Trump and the Republican Party.Because if they take power in November, racists like this guy will think they have free license to kill black people at will.Earlier this month, Russell Courtier and his girlfriend Colleen Hunt stopped at a convenience store near Portland, Oregon and started a fight with 19-year-old Larnell Bruce, a young black man.Courtier has repeatedly run afoul of the law, but keeps being let out of his cage. While in prison, he became the leader of the European Kindred, a white supremacist group. Courtier had just been paroled for attacking a woman with a knife in 2013.Anyway, Courtier slammed Bruce s head into the glass window as Hunt cheered. To defend himself, Bruce pulled a knife and Courtier retreated to his Jeep. The fight should have ended there, but Courtier wanted blood, so he violated a series of traffic laws in an effort to run Bruce over.By the time police arrived it was too late. Bruce was severely injured and Courtier and his girlfriend had fled the scene. Bruce died days later at the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.Both Courtier and Hunt were later arrested and now they have been indicted for murder and will likely face charges for committing a hate crime.Frankly, this is one of those cases where law enforcement and our judicial system failed the public simply because Courtier is white. He has four felony convictions and seven misdemeanors on his record, yet he was still unleashed upon society. On the flip side, African-Americans are being shot by police in the streets for doing nothing criminal whatsoever. If Courtier were black, he d either be dead before he ever saw the inside of a courtroom or he would be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole. He certainly would not have received as many chances for freedom as he has squandered.But Courtier is white, and now the Oregon judiciary has blood on their hands.What may be even scarier is the fact that white supremacists like Courtier are big fans of Donald Trump because they believe he ll make America white again and bring their racist cause into the mainstream.These are people who cheer for the killing of black people and are just waiting for the day when they can do so with impunity.If you want a glimpse of what Donald Trump s America would look like, the murder of Larnell Bruce by a white supremacist in the middle of an open street should tell you everything you need to know.Featured image via Multnomah County Sheriff s Office",News,"September 1, 2016"
‘Journalistic Malpractice’: CNN Slammed for ‘Biased’ Coverage in Favour of Hillary,"21st Century Wire says This definitely needed to be said.Host of popular internet news shows The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, has slammed the mainstream media for  journalistic malpractice  after they fraudulently announced that Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic nominee prior to the result of the California primary.Here at 21WIRE, we informed our readers last week that such big politik dirty tricks would be played.Uygur appeared on CNN saying: Brian, you guys, and I mean all of the establishment press, totally tilted the playing field here from day one by counting those superdelegates, Superdelegates do switch their votes all the time, they switched it in 2008. Hillary Clinton had a 100-superdelegate lead which completely vanished in 2008, But if you count them in the official tally, when you know they can, and often do switch their votes, and have not voted yet, that is simply incorrect, that s not journalism. From day one, which was absolutely incorrect, it was in fact journalistic malpractice which indicates an establishment bias.

 This Poll Shows EXACTLY How Much Americans Detest Trump,"At this point in Trump s disastrous presidency, it s pretty clear that the only one that thinks he s doing a great job is the underserving POTUS himself. Even his own supporters have lost faith in him and are turning away at record speed. Despite his rapidly plummeting approval rating, Trump still thinks he s the greatest thing to happen to America   or at least, he ll continue to think that until he sees this:According to MSNBC s Kyle Griffin, Americans are so turned off by Trump that they don t even want to get anywhere near a product he touches. Apparently, asking for Trump s support is so toxic that it is basically suicide for businesses. That s quite strange for a reality television star who brags about how good of a businessman he is.Already, we saw Trump make endorsements on his Twitter feed. It turns out, those inappropriate  shoutouts  did way more harm than good. NBC News reported: When Donald Trump won the Oval Office, critics worried he would use his elevated stature to enhance his personal power to pick winners and losers by endorsing products. But new consumer survey data from Simmons Research suggest the Trump presidency may be having the opposite effect on the Trump brand. According to the new data, 78% of Americans would not use and might even boycott any product that Trump endorses. Even amongst Republicans, support is low   only 31% of GOPers said they would be more likely to use a product if Trump endorsed it. Simmons scientist Steven Millman explained this phenomenon: A strong association between Trump and a brand is likely to be damaging to the brand, unless its consumers are strong conservative. This actually makes perfect sense. Trump has singlehandedly destroyed his own Trump brand by creating one of the most hateful, controversial presidential campaigns America had ever seen. His hotels are going down in flames, and so are his other self-branded companies. Even his daughter, Ivanka, is facing business struggles thanks to her father s horrible performance. So it only seems pretty natural that the association with Trump s disgraced name would have the same effect on other businesses.It s official: most of America hates Trump, and we want him to know it.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2017"
15 YR OLDS IN THIS STATE CAN NOW GET STATE FUNDED SEX-CHANGE OPERATION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT…But Need Consent To Use Tanning Bed,"The left has officially taken parenting out of our hands via legislation and handed it over to our government The list of things 15-year-olds are not legally allowed to do in Oregon is long: Drive, smoke, donate blood, get a tattoo   even go to a tanning bed.But, under a first-in-the-nation policy quietly enacted in January that many parents are only now finding out about, 15-year-olds are now allowed to get a sex-change operation. Many residents are stunned to learn they can do it without parental notification   and the state will even pay for it through its Medicaid program, the Oregon Health Plan. It is trespassing on the hearts, the minds, the bodies of our children,  said Lori Porter of Parents  Rights in Education.  They re our children. And for a decision, a life-altering decision like that to be done unbeknownst to a parent or guardian, it s mindboggling. In a statement, Oregon Health Authority spokeswoman Susan Wickstrom explained it this way:  Age of medical consent varies by state. Oregon law   which applies to both Medicaid and non-Medicaid Oregonians   states that the age of medical consent is 15. While 15 is the medical age of consent in the state, the decision to cover sex-change operations specifically was made by the Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC).Members are appointed by the governor and paid by the state of Oregon. With no public debate, HERC changed its policy to include cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and gender-reassignment surgery as covered treatments for people with gender dysphoria, formally known as gender identity disorder.HERC officials refused repeated requests by Fox News for an interview and even gave Fox News inaccurate information about the medical director s work schedule.Oregon Health Authority officials directed Fox News to their website. It shows transgender policy was discussed at four meetings in 2014. It was passed without any opposition or even discussion about teenagers  new access to undergoing a sex change.Gender dysphoria is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder in which a person identifies as the sex opposite of his or her birth. It is rare, affecting one out of every 20,000 males and one out of every 50,000 females.According to a 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,  most children with gender dysphoria will not remain gender dysphoric after puberty. Dr. Paul McHugh, who led the Johns Hopkins Psychiatry Department and still practices, said Oregon s policy amounts to child abuse.  We have a very radical and even mutilating treatment being offered to children without any evidence that the long-term outcome of this would be good,  McHugh said.Dr. Jack Drescher, a member of the APA who worked on the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group, says treatment for gender dysphoria has received a lot more attention in recent years. He said this year New York changed its policy to cover cross-sex hormone drugs and sex-reassignment surgery for Medicaid recipients who are at least 18 years old. He thinks Oregon is offering the treatment too early. Children age 15 may not fully understand all the consequences of the procedures they are undergoing,  he said.Jenn Burleton disagrees. She underwent a sex-reassignment surgery and started the Portland non-profit group TransActive. She said requiring parental consent would lead to more suffering and teen suicide attempts. Parents may not be supportive,  Burleton said.  They may not be in an environment where they feel the parent will affirm their identity, this may have been going on for years. The science is unsettled. A 2010 Murad study concluded  very low quality evidence suggests sex reassignment   improves gender dysphoria and overall quality of life.  The authors admitted the evidence was  sparse and inconclusive. Lisa Maloney, a parent and Scappoose, Ore., School Board member, is outraged. To know that taxpayers are now on the hook for that, that a child can do that without their parent s knowledge or information or consent, parents have absolutely no say, that s appalling,  Maloney said.The Oregon Health Authority could not say how many Medicaid recipients have been treated for gender dysphoria since the new policy took effect in January. Oregon has 935,000 people enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan. HERC assumes between 14 and 112 of them may be gender dysphoric. It estimates the total cost of adding cross-sex hormone therapy, puberty-suppressing drugs and sex reassignment surgeries to the coverage will be no more than $150,000 per year.But HERC also believes the state will save money due to fewer suicide attempts. It estimates there will be one less suicide attempt per year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the average cost per suicide attempt in the U.S. is $7,234.But Dr. McHugh says a sex-change operation, especially for young people with gender dysphoria, is never appropriate. We can help them if we begin to explore with them and their families what they re fearing about development, what they re fearing about being a young boy, a young adolescent appropriate to themselves.

TWO BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICERS CHARGED In Brutal Beating Of 16 Yr Old Caught On VIDEO…Why Al Sharpton And Black Lives Matter Terrorists Won’t Care,"This story will fade quickly to back page news in the mainstream media. Two black officers supposedly physically abused a 16 year old black boy. Yawn   If these police officers were white you d be seeing this story ad nauseum until those officers lives were threatened, they lost their jobs and were behind bars. Black Lives Matter terrorists and Obama s Race War Czar, Al Sharpton wouldn t be satisfied until a city was burned to the ground, the entire police force was called out for being  racists  and someone (preferably a white person) in the police department was fired for not preventing this from happening. AP  Two officers who police Baltimore s public schools walked out of jail Wednesday pending trial for assault and misconduct after their violent confrontation with a student was recorded by another teenager.Both have checkered records, prompting parents and authorities alike to question whether enough is being done to prevent violent people from being hired to keep schoolchildren peaceful and safe.Here s the assault caught on tape:https://youtu.be/zZPX_bzka40Police said Wednesday that Saverna Bias allegedly told her fellow officer, Anthony Spence, to use force against the teen.According to a witness, she said,  You need to smack him because he s got too much mouth,  police said. The video shows Spence shouting profanities as he repeatedly slaps and kicks the boy, telling him to leave the school and go home.Spence was not trying to arrest the 10th grader, neither was he acting in reasonable self-defense, city police said.In the cellphone video, Spence is heard shouting while he repeatedly slaps the 16-year-old student and kicks him at REACH Partnership School, while Bias looks on.Spence s attorney Mike Davey told the Baltimore Sun on Thursday that his client believed the 16-year-old and his friend was trespassing on school grounds. Both said they were students at REACH, but Davey said they were not wearing uniforms and could not provide the principal s name when questioned.The 16-year-old was later confirmed as a student at REACH, his attorney told the newspaper.  BuzzfeedAt a packed school board meeting Tuesday night, some parents and principals implored officials to keep officers in the schools for everyone s safety. Students and their advocates countered that having armed police with insufficient oversight in schools can be damaging and dangerous.Tim Martin, an administrator at the New Hope Academy, said he understands the frustration, but believes most officers show enough patience to  therapeutically de-escalate students in crisis and help school personnel maintain a safe school environment. Spence, 44, and Bias, 53, turned themselves in Tuesday night and were released on bond on charges of second-degree assault and misconduct in office. Spence also is charged with second-degree child abuse. Both officers have been suspended, and Spence is being denied pay, since he faces a felony.Baltimore School Police Chief Marshall Goodwin, whose department is separate from the city s police force, also went on leave, for  personal reasons,  as the video began circulating a day after the March 1 confrontation. A week later, as city police and prosecutors continue investigating, Baltimore City Schools CEO Gregory Thornton has refused to explain his absence.",left-news,"Mar 9, 2016"

WATCH Black Chicago Residents Blame Obama For Crime And Joblessness: “He needs to resign”,"Barack wants the Black Community to blame Whites and cops. These Black Chicago residents aren t buying it. They re putting the blame squarely on Barack Hussein Obama and Rahm Emanuel. He s probably the the worst President ever elected. Have the same love for these (black) young people as you ve got for the ones across the border. These residents of Chicago understand that Obama has done nothing to help raise them out of a state of dependency. They want jobs. They want self-esteem. They want to raise their families and earn a paycheck. Obama and the Democrats want to keep them down. And when the joblessness is so out of control, and the youth living in these impoverished neighborhoods get out of control, the cops are called in. Obama and Eric Holder have managed to turn the same cops who are coming into these neighborhoods and risking their lives into Public Enemy #1. Obama has these residents living in a perpetual hell-hole with no way out. No wonder they re so damn angry. Someone needs to get the message out to these communities that the Democrat party has no interest in helping them to break this cycle. The Black community needs jobs.

 Conservatives Are CRYING After Meryl Streep DESTROYS Trump In Golden Globes Speech (VIDEO),"Republicans are in for a long four years if they think progressives like Meryl Streep are going to stay silent. Moments after giving her impassioned speech against Donald Trump (in which she never mentioned his name), conservative Twitter erupted in outrage.And boy is it pathetic.Take Tomi Lahren, the new blonde mouthpiece for the right-wing:These Hollywood elites wouldn t know average, every day hard-working Americans if we bit them in the ass. #GoldenGlobes  Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017In Tomi s mind, Meryl Streep   who used her platform to advance free speech and a free press   doesn t know about hardworking, averag America. But Donald Trump, a guy who was born a millionaire, attended a private military school, and lives in a gold-plated penthouse, does.Tomi seemed to miss the part where Meryl Streep named a plethora of celebrities in the room and paid tribute to their humble backgrounds   the backgrounds they had before they made it big. Isn t that what conservatives claim to fight for? One s ability to rise from the bottom to the top through hard work?I guess it only counts if you re, say, Scott Baio or Ted Nugent.Lahren then went off on a Twitter tangent accusing Hollywood liberals of being  snowflakes  even though Lahren was the one who was triggered by Streep s  insults. Then there s Meghan McCain, another blonde mouthpiece:This Meryl Streep speech is why Trump won. And if people in Hollywood don t start recognizing why and how   you will help him get re-elected  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) January 9, 2017Again, this conservative seems to miss the point: Streep advocated for respect, free speech and a free press. So is McCain   who s a member of the press   insinuating that that the tenets that Streep is fighting for is what got Trump elected? Because if that s so (which it isn t), McCain missed the entire point of the speech (hint: she did).Perhaps Meghan would have felt differently if Streep brought up how Trump mocked her dad for being a POW.And, in all honesty, if Streep s speech was that traumatic that it drives right-wingers to the polls, they are way more fragile than the  snowflakes  Tomi Lahren decries.Democrats get called  baby killers  all the time by the right yet we move on and actually get stuff done, not complain on Twitter.Radio host Tim Young had this to say:Sorry Meryl Streep fans, there s nothing brave about a privileged millionaire white woman pandering to you and a room of her liberal friends  Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) January 9, 2017Sorry, Tim, there s nothing admirable or acceptable about a billionaire orange man mocking  disabled person to pander to poorly-educated voters.Conservatives are mad that a Hollywood entertainer called a fellow Hollywood entertainer. They can t slam Streep for being a member of Hollywood without looking like a bunch of hypocritical fools.Tonight exposed the right as the overly PC, overly sensitive hypocrites we always knew them to be.Simply put, conservatives were triggered. Someone dared to call out and challenge their dear leader, and they don t know how to react. Perhaps these commentators are in need of a safe space?

The Great Con: Has Political Correctness Marginalized the Working Class?," Charles Hugh Smith Of Two MindsSo when the protected class of well-paid institutional  progressives  speak darkly of  reversing 40 years of social progress,  what they re really saying is we re terrified that the bottom 95% might be waking up to our Great Con of identity politics and political correctness.To understand the Great Con of political correctness, we must first grasp the decline of the working class (self-described as  the middle class ), i.e. those who must sell their labor to earn their livelihood.Labor s share of the national economy has been declining for 46 years:So where has the wealth that s been generated ended up? In the hands of the .1%:And where did the wages gains end up? In the top 5% technocrat/ managerial class:And what is the technocrat/ managerial class response to this staggering decline in wealth and wages suffered by the bottom 95%? Political correctness.Let s look at political correctness and identity politics through the lens of class warfare and class consciousness. Those enjoying enormous gains in wealth and income have a problem: they must fragment and distract the bottom 95% who have lost income and wealth to the top 5%, lest the bottom 95% realize:1. We have lost the undeclared economic war2. We have more in common economically with others in the bottom 95% than we do with our neofeudal technocrat/ managerial overlords.This unifying class consciousness would threaten the wealth, power and perquisites of the neofeudal technocrat/ managerial class, so they had to undermine an economic awareness of class.They found the perfect weapon in identity politics and political correctness. What better way to fragment the working class than to carve it into cultural subclasses that could be manipulated into declaring war on each other?What better way to mask the collapse of working class political agency than to distract the bottom 95% with fake-Progressive double-speak about  empowerment,   safe spaces  and  micro-aggression ?The heart of the Great Con of identity politics and political correctness is a tragic irony: the more wealth, income and power that slip through the fingers of the bottom 95%, the more their overlords rely on social  empowerment, as if a  safe space  on campus is a substitute for real political and economic agency.That s the Great Con of political correctness: using worthless speech acts about empowerment to distract the working class from its disempowerment in the real world. No amount of  safe space  and happy talk about empowerment can replace meaningful opportunities for economic security and advancement precisely what is abundant for the protected technocrat/ managerial class and scarce for the unprotected 95% that s been sold down the river.The propaganda beauty of class-consciousness-destroying political correctness is its deceptive claim of  progressive. If you set out to design the perfect tool to enforced neofeudalism (the political and economic dominance of the protected few at the expense of the exploited many), you d choose an Orwellian fake-Progressive agenda of cultural fragmentation and conflict that undermines any class consciousness of shared economic disempowerment.This is why the protected technocrat/ managerial class is freaking out about Trump s victory: the inchoate sense that the few have profited at the expense of the many is an expression of an emergent class consciousness that has the potential to threaten the neofeudal dominance of the New Nobility and its self-serving technocrat/ managerial class.So when the protected class of well-paid institutional  progressives  speak darkly of  reversing 40 years of social progress,  what they re really saying is we re terrified that the bottom 95% might be waking up to our Great Con of identity politics and political correctness.Check out Charles Hugh Smith s new book is #8 on Kindle short reads under politics and social science: Why Our Status Quo Failed and Is Beyond Reform ($3.95 Kindle ebook, $8.95 print edition) For more, please visit the book s website.READ MORE PC NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire PC Files",US_News,"November 21, 2016"
"WOW! “‘HALEY’S’ COMET” Just COLLIDED With Hypocritical, Anti-Israel, Terror-Nation Supporting U.N.…And The Results Were Spectacular! [VIDEO]","Trump s new UN Ambassador Nikki Haley just held her first press conference following the UN Security Council s monthly meeting on Middle East issues, and this was NO ordinary press conference. After watching this video, it s easy to see why President Trump chose her to represent the US in hopes of redefining our support for democracy in the Middle East, while identifying nations who support terrorism. Here s an excerpt of her speech to the press:   The Security Council just finished its regular monthly meeting on Middle East issues. It s the first meeting like that that I ve attended, and I have to say it was a bit strange. The Security Council is supposed to discuss how to maintain international peace and security. But in our meeting on the Middle East, the discussion was not about Hezbollah s illegal build up of rockets in Lebanon. It was not about the money and weapons Iran supplies to terrorists. It was not about how we defeat ISIS.  It was not about how we hold Bashar Assad accountable for the slaughter of hundreds and thousands of civilians. No, instead the meeting focused on criticizing Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. I am new around here, but I understand that s how the council has operated month after month for decades. I am here to say the United States will not turn a blind eye to this anymore. I am here to underscore the iron-clad support of the United States for Israel. A star is born is our reaction to the first press briefing by President Trump s new ambassador at the United Nations. The ex-governor of South Carolina was ridiculed by the Left when the president first sent her nomination up to the Hill, owing to her alleged lack of foreign policy chops. She certainly rang the wake up gong for that crowd this morning, after emerging from her first Security Council monthly meeting devoted to the Middle East. Tough as nails but with a smile and a layer of Southern charm.The ambassador had just come from the regular monthly Security Council on Middle East issues. She said it was her first such meeting, and  it was a bit strange.  The Security Council, she said, is supposed to discuss how to maintain international peace and security. But the meeting, she said, was not about Hezbollah s illegal buildup of rockets in Lebanon, it was not about the money and weapons Iran provides to terrorists, it was not how we defeat ISIS, it was not how we hold Beshar al-Assad accountable for the slaughter of thousands of civilians. No,  she said,  instead the meeting focused on criticizing Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. I am new around here, but I understand that s how the Council has operated month after month for decades. I am here to say the United States will not turn a blind eye to this anymore. I am here to underscore to the ironclad support of the United States for Israel. I am here to emphasize that the United States is determined to stand up to the U.N. s anti-Israel bias. The ambassador made clear that the Trump administration will not support the kind of resolution from which the Obama administration s ambassador   Samantha Power   shamefully abstained, though Mrs. Haley was too polite to name the humiliated Ms. Power.  The outrageously biased resolutions from the Security Council and the General Assembly only make peace harder to attain by discouraging one of the parties from going to the negotiating table. Incredibly,  Mrs. Haley said,  the U.N. department of political affairs has an entire division devoted entirely to Palestinian affairs. Imagine that. There is no division devoted to illegal missile launches form North Korea. There is no division devoted to the world s number one state sponsor of terror, Iran. The prejudiced approach to Israeli-Palestinian issues does the peace process no favors, and it bears no relationship to the reality of the world around us. The double standards are breathtaking. The ambassador warned that it is  the U.N. s anti-Israel bias that is long overdue for change,  and said America will not hesitate to speak out in defense of its friend in Israel. All this was going on while the press was questioning President Trump on what he was going to do about anti-Semitism. If his ambassador to the world body is any example, the answer is plenty. She has the principles of a Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the grit of a John Bolton, and the star power of a Jeane Kirkpatrick, and in her first press briefing she certainly made her point.

 Conservative Commentator Uses Nancy Reagan’s Death To Launch Racist Attack On Michelle Obama (TWEETS),"When news of the death of former First Lady Nancy Reagan came through on Sunday, the majority of liberals and conservatives put aside their differences to send condolences to the family and reflect on her contribution to the nation. But for one conservative commentator, it was the perfect opportunity to attack First Lady Michelle Obama.Conservative blogger and trollumnist Debbie Schlussel struck out on Twitter on Sunday with this pathetic assault on the First Lady.Nancy Reagan brought style & glamour back to the White House & Then Michelle Hussein Obama Took It Away. RIP #tcot #gop #NancyReagan  Debbie Schlussel (@DebbieSchlussel) March 6, 2016Schlussel is a what one might refer to as an ultra-Zionist, a hardliner on Israel who sees no issue with the collective imprisonment and punishment of non-Jews in Israel-Palestine in order to create Jewish Supremacist Apartheid state. To argue on behalf of human rights, democracy and pluralism of race and faith in Israel, is to Schlussel, an anti-Semitic attack.As an example of just how far Schlussel is willing to go to pursue that agenda, check out her response to the murder of American hostage Kayla Mueller by ISIS last year. In a blog post entitled Dead ISIS Hostage Was Jew-Hating, Anti-Israel Bitch,   she wrote that Mueller was:a Jew-hating, anti-Israel piece of crap So, it s poetic justice that Mueller spent her last months as a hostage of the Islamic terrorists with whom she thought she had some sort of kinship and sisterhood. And that she died in their hands.She concludes her piece with the sentence:Buh-bye, Kayla. Have fun with your 72 Yasser Arafats.What evidence was there that Mueller was  jew-hating ? The aid worker s list of previous humanitarian efforts included escorting Palestinian children to school in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, to protect them from violent Jewish-Israeli settlers. The video below is an example of the sort of violence from which the school children need protecting.  Schlussel s attacks on the First Lady and the President are based not on the fact that they are black, but on the presumption that they are Muslim, and that by virtue of being Muslim, they are evil, anti-Semitic and dangerous.Unfortunately for Schlussel, Twitter users were not up for drinking her particular brand of Kool Aid. One person summed it up quite neatly @DebbieSchlussel I bet Mrs. Reagan is spitting on your head from Heaven.

" Trump, Fox News Push ‘World War’ After Attack In Nice, France (VIDEO)","Fox News Channel host Bill O Reilly and Republican presidential nominee believe that the horrific attack in Nice, France means it s time to push a  world war. Dozens were killed when a tractor trailer truck plowed into a crowd watching Bastille Day fireworks. The attacker then stepped out his car and was shot and killed by authorities. President Obama said,  I condemn in the strongest terms what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians. Appearing on The O Reilly Factor while details about the attack were still coming in, host Bill O Reilly said to Trump that if the attack is proven to be a terrorist event  I believe it s a world war now, we re in a world war scenario. It s no longer just isolated ISIS attacks. Do you agree with that? Trump told him,  I certainly do,  adding,  it s out of control. Trump then went on to attack President Obama saying,  we have a president that doesn t want to call it what it is.  Trump then called for  strong  and  smart leadership  or else the problem is  going to get worse. In contrast to Trump and O Reilly and their  world war  rhetoric, Hillary Clinton appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper and stressed that  this is a horrific attack  and that instead of the O Reilly/Trump push for a wide war,  we are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent. Trump has regularly argued that Muslims are somehow responsible for all terrorism. Trump has argued, without evidence, that Muslim communities are slow to report terroristic activities to the authorities. In reality, Muslims have often done so   including in the case of the Orlando night club shooter.Trump has also argued that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States if he were elected president, and has also said he would consider a registry of Muslims that many said sounded similar to Nazi registries of Jewish people.Featured image via YouTube",News,"July 14, 2016"

 REPORT: Trump Still Seething Like A Child Because Bannon Gets More Attention Than He Does (DETAILS),"We all remember how, in February, TIME Magazine ran a cover with the face of Stephen K. Bannon, Trump s chief strategist, on it instead of the face of Trump himself. Of course, Trump s massive ego doesn t allow one iota of attention to go to anyone else, so this definitely got under his skin. However, that was a long time ago, and one would think that Trump is over that little irritation, right? Wrong. New reporting suggests that here we are in April, months after TIME ran the Bannon cover, and Trump is still irritated over it.The Hill reports that a New York Times cover says the following of how Trump feels about the Bannon cover, and his employees in general getting more attention than he does: Mr. Trump remains annoyed by a February cover of Time magazine labeling Mr. Bannon  The Great Manipulator,  telling one visitor this month,  That doesn t just happen    a favored Trump expression for anger at subordinates who tend to their interests ahead of his. It probably doesn t help that this particular issue of TIME definitely added fuel to the fire on the  President Bannon  meme, which suggests that it is really Steve Bannon who is pulling the strings in the West Wing, and that Trump is just a puppet. This may have been true at the time; however, Bannon s power and influence in the West Wing has been greatly diminished as of late. He may even be on his way out of the White House altogether. Here is the cover that has gotten under Trump s oh so thin skin:TIME s new cover: How Steve Bannon became the second most powerful man in the world https://t.co/EJpO6Qqg9K pic.twitter.com/BdpY4Hw9Xb  TIME (@TIME) February 2, 2017If Trump is indeed still seething about the Bannon cover and the  President Bannon  narrative, indeed this is good for the country, as petty as it is.

 BREAKING: Trump Kicks Reince Priebus Out Of White House (TWEET),"Donald Trump s White House has been going through a lot of insane changes lately, and it is certainly looking like a sign of an inevitable implosion.It was just a few days ago that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned over Trump s hiring of Anthony Scaramucci as his new Communications Director. Now, another key player in Trump s administration is out thanks to  the Mooch    White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Trump announced this shocking change in staff over Twitter, remarking that retired four-star general and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kennedy would be taking Priebus  place:We might have seen this coming   yesterday, Scaramucci told the New Yorker that Priebus was a  f*cking paranoid schizophrenic  and made several other vulgar comments about the former Republican National Committee president.While this story is still developing, these rapid changes in staff show an administration that is clearly in trouble and struggling to keep its head above water as it self-destructs. Trump s staff is being turned over at an unprecedented rate, and the amount of in-fighting between even the top staffers is like nothing we ve ever seen before. But what else can you expect when you appoint the most vile, corrupt individuals to help you run a country?If the leaks coming from the White House weren t concerning enough, the recent changes in staff serve as a telling sign that things are falling apart on a daily basis and Trump is desperate to save his failing presidency. Already, Trump s new Communication Director Anthony Scaramucci has become one of the most hated, abrasive characters in Trump s administration and is causing trouble with other staffers. We can only imagine what this administration will look like in the weeks to come   and it s probably safe to say that recovery will be impossible.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"July 28, 2017"
 Guatemalan President Can’t Keep A Straight Face As He Mocks Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has been called out by yet another foreign leader for his ridiculous plan to build the Great Wall of  Murica. During a Facebook Live interview by The New York Times en Espa ol, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales, a former television comedian, openly mocked the Republican s wall.Trump rose to the top in the Republican primary race by promising his supporters that he was going to erect a huge wall to keep Latino immigrants out of the country. Although he has said that he is going to force Mexico (hahaha) to pay for this monstrosity, he has also promised that he is going to have it built really  inexpensively.  In order to do that, he is going to need the cheap labor he rails against in all of his speeches, and that is what President Morales offered him: To the gentleman who wants to build a wall, I offer cheap labor. We have high quality labor, and we ll gladly build. Tell us the dimensions, and we know how to do it. The president could hardly keep a straight face when he offered to help  the gentleman.  But he quickly turned serious when he started discussing real immigration policy with the reporter, saying: We believe   although I have no reason to involve myself in U.S. migratory policy   we believe that it is necessary to think about migratory reform where many people who are there in an irregular manner will be regularized,  he said. Morales added that legalizing undocumented immigrants in the United States would benefit the country because they would  contribute more and pay more taxes. He is absolutely right, it would greatly benefit America if we would reform immigration. We have millions of undocumented immigrants living in this country who are contributing to society, but would love to contribute even more   unfortunately, they are unable to do so unless they are legalized.Republicans like Donald Trump do not consider that, though, not because they believe it is false, but because it is easier to keep their voting base energized if they have someone to hate. Right-wing,  poorly educated  voters need a scapegoat to blame all of their problems on and immigrants are perfect for that. Meanwhile, the GOP continues to fan the flames to keep their dumbass base in a constant state fear which sends them back to the polls to vote for the right s candidates. It doesn t matter how much the GOP is victimizing their voters by cutting funding for many of the programs that keep food on their tables, as long as they have  others  to pick on, they are happy.So, Trump will continue to push this Great Wall of  Murica fantasy, his supporters will lap up his rhetoric and world leaders will continue to point their fingers and laugh at us. This is another reason why it is so important to vote BLUE in November.Watch the interview below (be warned, it s in Spanish):Featured image via video screenshot",News,"April 19, 2016"

An employment dispute between Comey and the President?

Sununu:  If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified. Sununu:  What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President. Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.

 Intel Committee Member: ‘Innocent People Don’t Ask For Immunity’ (VIDEO),"Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.  What we have here is a pattern of deceit with Michael Flynn. It s not forgetfulness,  the congressman replied.You can watch the entire interview below, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 30, 2017"
" House GOP Holds Zika Bill Hostage, Proposes Plan To Slash Birth Control Funding","Pregnant women throughout the America s are threatened by the Zika virus, but House Republicans couldn t care less and are still holding the bill that would fight the epidemic hostage. The GOP released their latest funding proposal on Wednesday and the plan proposes cuts to the federal grant that helps low-income women access birth control and other family planning services.The Title X Family Planning program, which was established more than 45 years ago, provides reproductive healthcare services to 4.1 million patients each year, preventing approximately 1 million unplanned pregnancies. So naturally, conservatives are hell bent on eliminating Title X.The Huffington Post reports:  The House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting the program in its draft Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies funding bill for fiscal year 2017. This is the fifth time Republicans have attempted to scrap Title X. Under the GOP proposal, $108 million would be cut from programs that focus on preventing teen pregnancies.The funding bill does allocate $390 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the Zika virus, but women s health advocates warn that the middle of a Zika outbreak is not the time to cut funding for contraception. Zika can be transmitted both through mosquitos and sexually. Women who become infected with the virus while pregnant can have babies born with severe birth defects, including microcephaly. Babies born with microcephaly have malformed brains and abnormally small heads, and they face a lifetime of challenges.Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, said that cutting funding smack dab in the middle of the Zika outbreak would be  particularly foolish. It is particularly foolish to target Title X at a time when the nation is at the precipice of a public health emergency resulting from the Zika virus. For the House to propose defunding the very provider network that is being called upon to address and control the risk to women who may be seeking to prevent pregnancy is absurd.Republicans in Congress have such a dislike for Title X because some of its funding goes to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions among its range of services. None of that money pays for abortions, however, and federal law already prevents these grants from being used to fund abortions.According to a statement released by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the goal of the funding bill is to reduc[e] discretionary spending by more than half a billion dollars, all the while prioritizing funding where it is needed the most. It follows the responsible lead of the legislation before it   investing in proven, effective programs, rolling back over regulation and overreach by the Administration that kills American jobs, and cutting spending to save hard earned taxpayer dollars.Last month, the House passed a funding proposal for Zika that also limits access to contraception. This completely ignores the request by the CDC for money to distribute birth control and condoms in areas stricken by Zika.Dana Singiser, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, called the bill  shameful. Politicians who want to eliminate these vital services are working against a solution, and are part of the problem. Today s budget bill is shameful and exposes the Republican leadership s targeted agenda against family planning providers like Planned Parenthood, despite their absolutely critical role in limiting the damaging effects of Zika virus and continuing to provide access to reproductive health services for those most in need.Since last year, 24 states have tried to defund Planned Parenthood. Many of the states that are expected to be hardest hit by Zika as temperatures rise and mosquitos flourish are also states where  lawmakers have slashed family planning services, chipped away at safe and legal abortion and declined to expand Medicaid coverage.

" Arizona GOP Poised To Ban Social Justice Classes, Events, And Lectures In Public Schools","Another day, another assault on the First Amendment from the  freedom-loving  Republican Party.In Arizona, a state facing an unprecedented teacher shortage, the Republican-led State House has introduced a bill to ban social justice courses, lectures and events from public schools, including state universities.HB 2120, introduced by Reps. Bob Thorpe and Mark Finchem, seeks to:15-112. Prohibited courses, classes, events and activities; enforcement; exceptions   A.  A school district or charter school in this state shall not include in its program of instruction any courses, or classes, EVENTS OR ACTIVITIES that include DO any of the following:And if the schools don t comply with the law (intentionally or unintentionally)? They lose 10 percent of their already depleted funds:B.   If the state board of education or the superintendent of public instruction determines that the school district or charter school has failed to comply with subsection A OF THIS SECTION within sixty days after a notice has been issued pursuant to this subsection, the state board of education or the superintendent of public instruction may direct the department of education to withhold up to ten per cent PERCENT of the monthly apportionment of state aid that would otherwise be due the school district or charter school.In other words: don t teach anything that helps build up tolerance and acceptance of any repressed minority group or you will be punished with the money your districts so desperately need.When it comes to the state university system (institutions of higher learning), the legislation almost mirrors that for public k-12 schooling:A UNIVERSITY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SHALL NOT INCLUDE IN ITS PROGRAM OF INSTRUCTION ANY COURSES, CLASSES, EVENTS OR ACTIVITIES THAT DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:Like K-12 institutions, state colleges and universities would be stripped of 10 percent of their state funding if found to be intentionally or unintentionally in violation.The problem with this law is clear: it s too broadly written, it stifles education, and it deprives students of their ability to learn about different ideologies and current events in today s America. On the surface, it sounds good   no public school should be able to promote violence, resentment or hatred towards the United States government or any group of people. However, once we start telling people they can t advocate for the social justice of anyone, no matter who it is being oppressed, we become complacent with discrimination and oppression of peoples all across the globe.Does this mean professors wouldn t be able to lecture or promote the human rights of those living in Israeli-Palestinian territory? Does it mean they cannot promote the  never forget  mantra of Nazi Germany atrocities because it s promoting  social justice  for Jews, Poles, the disabled, Gay and Romani people?The list   and the subsequent debate   could go on and on.This Orwellian, revisionist history is dangerous and it s un-American. It stifles freedom of speech   even speech we may not agree with   and shields students from different opinions and outlooks on life. Students paying thousands of dollars to attend a state university should not have their right to speak and learn freely striped of them by their government.The snowflake Republicans are at it again, and this time they re the ones who need a safe space from the big, bad social justice warriors.Featured image via KTAR News",News,"January 14, 2017"
FRIGHTENING POWER OF THE PRESS: You Won’t Believe What 41% Of Americans Are Calling Orlando Terror Attack,"Remember when the press used to actually report the news? Today they are nothing more than a mouthpiece for the Obama administration and Democrat party. There isn t a radical agenda this  President  and his regime want pushed that s off limits for today s mainstream media. So you have an Islamic terrorist who even in 2001 as a teenager was cheering the 9/11 attack. He cased different targets, including Disney World (happy, but not a  gay  target) and prepared for the attack apparently for quite some time. He listened to Anwar al Awlaki videos, and has connection to radicals like American suicide Moner Abu Salha. He makes comments to coworkers about his connections to terrorists that spark them to call the FBI. During the attack, he calls media, says he s doing it because of ISIS, tells the victims that s why he s doing it, tells the police that s why he s doing it. He also tells victims he s doing it because the  US bombing of my country'[Afghanistan, he was born in NY but apparently self-identified as Afghan]. ISIS claims the attack and calls him a  soldier of the caliphate .The police never say it s Islamic terrorism, and they immediately said the morning after,  there are leanings in that direction . They have reported the connections to radicals and are still looking at all the connections now.But it s  domestic gun violence  to these people?Check out the poll below:Why?

 Senate Democrats Introduce Bill To Fight Back Against Trump’s Corruption – Trump LIVID,"If Donald Trump thinks he can use the presidency to make business deals for himself and his family, Senate Democrats are prepared to defend the sanctity of the office.Over the course of the campaign and after the election, Trump has insisted that his many conflicts of interest surrounding his business empire do not matter. But the Constitution says that officeholders in the United States government may not receive presents, emoluments, or titles from foreign states.Article I, section 9 states,No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.And since Trump s business receives money from foreign nations, he would be violating the Constitution on the first day of his administration. And it s even worse when one considers that Trump s businesses have ties to businesses backed by foreign governments such as in the Philippines, and that foreign governments could blackmail Trump by threatening his profits or his foreign business partners. Trump could also use the presidency to extract business deals from nations in exchange for American support or aid, even if helping certain nations goes against the best interests of our country.In short, Trump should be forced to put his company in a blind trust or sell it altogether to avoid these problems and put these conflicts of interest to rest.That s why Senate Democrats plan to introduce a bill to do just that. Our President-elect has significantly greater risk of business and financial conflicts of interest than any other president, yet has so far refused to follow the precedent set by previous presidents. To this day, President-elect Trump has refused to address his conflicts of interest,  Senator Chris Coons said.Coons, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Cardin, Dick Durbin, and Jeff Merkley have all endorsed the legislation and pointed out that presidents have divested their financial interests to avoid violating the Constitution for decades. If Trump is allowed to be president and keep his business decades of precedent would be wiped out, paving the way for anyone to use the presidency for personal profit. The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what s best for the country   not using his office to do what s best for himself and his businesses,  Elizabeth Warren said.  The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests and place them in a blind trust. This has been the standard for previous presidents, and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same. Republicans, of course, will probably refuse to bring the bill to a vote on the Senate floor, and if they do they ll be helping Trump violate the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Senate Democrat s are preparing for a war and they should be. After all, Republicans have established precedent for obstructing and attacking a president over the last eight years and turnabout is fair play. Anything less than fighting Trump s agenda every second of every day over the next four years is unacceptable.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"December 15, 2016"

 HEROIC Muslim Student Helps Track Down Man Who VIOLENTLY Assaulted Jewish Woman (DETAILS),"The situation that 17-year old Ahmed Khalifa saw was disgusting. He was on board a Brooklyn subway train, listening to his headphones like many teens do, when he looked up and saw a man deck a woman who s an Orthodox Jew. She was just reading a book on the train, and he went up and slapped her so hard that he shattered her glasses and knocked her unconscious. Khalifa says he could almost feel it: It was a very hard slap, I almost could feel the slap. He was 6-foot-6, and a very big, big guy. He could have decided not to get involved. After all, he s Muslim and she s Jewish, and we all know Muslims are evil jihadists who especially hate Jewish people. He s a teenaged boy and the woman s attacker was huge. He could have stuck his head back in his headphones and minded his own business except he decided that catching the guy was his business. So, as Rayvon Jones ran, Khalifa held the train s doors open and yelled to the conductor to stay at the station and call for help.And then he took off after Jones, while also calling the cops. Khalifa later said, on camera: I felt bad for her because she was innocent, like innocent, she did nothing wrong. He did lose Jones briefly, but another Orthodox Jew asked him what happened, and then offered to help Khalifa find Jones. When they found Jones at a bus stop, they called what s known as the Shomrim, or the Jewish safety patrol. Jones climbed on a bus and pulled his hoodie over his head, prompting Khalifa to shout: Get out you coward! Why are you trying to hide! When the police got there and pulled Jones off the bus, he got aggressive and kept screaming he was going to kill everyone. He was taken into custody and charged with assault, and one of the Shomrim drivers took Khalifa home. The woman was taken to the hospital in stable condition.Khalifa sees everyone as people. People asked him why he would help a Jewish woman when he s Muslim, and it s his nature to treat everyone the same way. Obviously, when someone needs help, he helps, regardless of who it is.  Us vs. them  doesn t seem to have touched him the way it s touched so many others. People, especially fearful, bigoted conservatives, could learn a lesson or two from this teenager.Khalifa, while he doesn t see himself as a hero, is a hero.

SWEDISH CITIZENS Get DISTURBING News About Likely Punishment For ASYLUM SEEKERS Who Live-Streamed RAPE Of Swedish Girl On Facebook,"When will government officials who allowed this nightmare to grow like a cancer in Sweden be held accountable? Breitbart  Two asylum seekers who are on trial for raping a Swedish girl and streaming the ordeal live on Facebook will not face deportation back to their home countries.The asylum seekers directly involved in the rape, aged 18 and 21, will not face deportation after the prosecution withdrew their previous claim.From 24 Uppsala: On Tuesday, ending the trial of the three men suspected of involvement in the rape that has been broadcast live in a closed group on Facebook.A 25-year old man is on suspicion of failure to disclose rape, and two men, a 21-year-old and a 18 year old, on probable cause suspected of rape.The three accused men sat sunken in their chairs, and the hearing began with a number of charges against two men, one admitted all seven points including the possession and consumption of drugs and driving without a license and DUI.The most remarkable thing was that the prosecutor Magnus Berggren denied his and prosecutors Pontus Melanders earlier demands for the expulsion of two of the men (18 year old and 21 year old) who were not born in Sweden. Only yesterday, he told me that nothing has changed regarding the claim.Mr. Wallin, who represents the 21-year-old Afghan national, said he and his 18-year-old co-defendant arrived in Sweden when they were under the age of 15. The third defendant in the case, a 25-year-old Iranian immigrant with Swedish citizenship, is also being tried as he is accused of filming the incident and not reporting it to the police. He also faces a charge of defamation as he broadcast the rape on Facebook. However, due to him holding Swedish citizenship, he cannot be deported. Prosecutor Pontus Melander said he was confident he would achieve a guilty verdict.  We have an incredibly good evidence in the form of film material, but it is always up to the district court,  he said.Melander said the likely punishment for the two involved in the attack would be three years in prison, while the 25-year-old who filmed it could receive a one-year sentence. The prosecution argued the sentence for slander should be at least one year due to the fact the video was spread widely on social media and the victim would have to live with it for the rest of her life.

 WATCH: President Obama Just Landed In Cuba And The GOP Is Going Crazy,"President Obama, accompanied by First Lady Michelle along with his two daughters, just landed in Cuba and he is looking to thaw political differences between the two countries that has spanned decades. Obama, who has made reaching out to Cuba one of the main objectives of his presidency, earned the ire of the Republican party which has preferred divisive politics rather than open dialogue and understanding between the two countries. Florida senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio was upset after Obama had announced the visit. He said: Rather than achieving several long-standing U.S. goals and national security interests, you have methodically squandered this opportunity, legitimizing the Castro regime and enriching it in the process. A presidential visit to Cuba absent of any concessions from its government is a dangerous idea, and I urge you to reconsider. With that lack of innovative thinking, one can see why Rubio was trounced in his home state of Florida by Donald Trump. Then there s Ted Cruz, whose father is a Cuban American. The creepy Cruz also disagreed to the visit. He said: He has alienated and abandoned our friends and allies. You know, one of the first things he did when he became president was send the bust of Winston Churchill back to the United Kingdom. That was shameful. Despite Republican resistance, the president and dozens of U.S. lawmakers and business leaders joined him in Cuba for the visit. Air Force One touched down at Havana s airport on Sunday after a three-hour flight from Washington. While deep differences persist, Obama s approach in thinking outside of the box on Cuba will bring fruitful economic and political ties for both countries in the future.Instead of embracing the president s ingenuity, the Republicans will always be Republicans.Here s the video:",News,"March 20, 2016"

CAFE OWNER REACTS IN AWESOME WAY After Town Told Her To Remove “God Bless America” Banner From Front Of Restaurant,"Bravo! This woman is example of true courage. More Americans need to take a stand against anyone who attempts to silence their First Amendment right Whenever folks in Penfield, New York get a hankering for pancakes for lunch   they head over to the 5 Mile Caf .The family-owned restaurant is known in those parts for serving breakfast any time of the day (order their homemade corned beef hash).They are also known for their patriotism. We are very patriotic here at the caf    all year round  not just this time of year,  owner Jennifer Aquino told me.  We have American flags and patriotic things around the caf . So Jennifer decided to ask the town for a permit so she could post a  God Bless America  banner on the front of her restaurant. She wanted to display the banner from Memorial Day through Independence Day.There was just one significant problem.Penfield has a strict banner allotment policy. Businesses are only allowed to post banners for a total of three weeks out of the year. And Jennifer had used up her allotment. At one point we had banners all over the town and the town just looked trashy and our residents said enough s enough,  town supervisor Tony LaFountain told WHEC.Jennifer s request was denied.Instead of posting the banner outside the restaurant, she posted it inside. And that was that   until the Orlando terrorist attack. I decided on my way to work that I was going to put it up regardless of the town telling me I couldn t,  she said.  So I put it up. A bit later that day she received an email from the town telling her to remove the banner. They warned her that she could face a possible fine for violating the ordinance. I didn t take it down,  Jennifer told me.  And I was willing to pay the fine. The [message on the banner] means a lot to me   especially during this time in our country with all that s going on with terrorism,  she said.  I just can t believe that I can t have this banner up and be supported by the town board. The fact that I m being asked to take it down is wrong,  she said.  It s against my First Amendment rights. People need to open up their eyes. If we start letting them tell us we can t do this   it s going to get worse. Jennifer tells me she never imagined there would be a day like this in America. I have lots of veterans in my family,  she said.  I have a cousin who fought in Desert Storm so that we could have the freedom to hang a banner that says,  God bless America. And yet we live in a nation where you can be punished for simply being patriotic.Via: FOX News ",politics,"Jul 2, 2016"
 Trump Demands Apology From The Media And Gets Told To Go F*ck Himself,"Donald Trump, the pathetic man who has yet to apologize for all the hateful and divisive things he said throughout his campaign, is demanding an apology from the media.Seriously.Trump has been lashing out at the media and the intelligence community all weekend over a dossier revealing that he paid prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow, and also reveals that his campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.He whined about the media during his first press conference in six months, resorting to calling CNN and Buzzfeed  fake news  for running the story.Now Trump is crowing because legendary reporter Bob Woodward, who shall now be known as a sell-out, agreed with him that the dossier should never have been reported on, which would have hidden information from the American people. His demand for an apology was written in all caps, even though he has failed to apologize for any of the insults and offensive statements he said during his campaign.Thank you to Bob Woodward who said,  That is a garbage document it never should have been presented Trump s right to be upset (angry)  Donald J.

COMMANDER IN CHIEF APPROVED RACISM? U.S. Military Makes SHOCKING Disciplinary Decision For 16 Black West Point Cadets,"Do we even need to ask how 16 white West Point cadets posing in uniform, with a white power fist before graduation would have been resolved? Never mind the media circus it would have created Sixteen black West Point cadets who posed with raised fists for a pre-graduation picture that sparked debates on race and proper behavior in uniform won t be punished for the gesture, the U.S. Military Academy said Tuesday.The decision, less than two weeks before the 16 female seniors are poised to graduate, found they didn t violate any U.S. Department of Defense rules limiting political activity.An internal inquiry  found that the cadets did not pre-plan or set out to make a political statement,  West Point s superintendent, Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen Jr., said in a letter to the student body.But, he said, they showed  a lapse of awareness in how symbols and gestures can be misinterpreted and cause division  and they will get some instruction on that.The fists-up image, which circulated online, led some observers to question whether the women were expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests over police killings of unarmed black men.But the inquiry found the picture, one of multiple photos the women made in keeping with an informal campus tradition, captured a spur-of-the-moment gesture intended to demonstrate unity and pride in graduating, Caslen wrote. Groups of cadets often take Old Corps pictures in traditional dress uniforms to echo historical portraits.A raised fist has symbolized political resistance for generations, from Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison in 1990 to Democratic Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on the presidential campaign trail this year. It was used by black power advocates in the 1960s, including by two American sprinters during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games, and more recently by activists for the Black Lives Matter movement.Some observers suggested the women were improperly identifying with the movement while in uniform.Defenders said the women were simply celebrating their forthcoming graduation, something closer in spirit to a team lifting helmets to celebrate a win or Beyonce raising her fist at this year s Super Bowl halftime show.

 President Obama Came Out Of Retirement Today To Slam Republicans On Healthcare,"After two months of an administration that gives literal meaning to the term  bully pulpit,  it becomes easy to forget what a real president sounds like how a real president discusses disagreements. On Thursday, though, we received a brief reminder as President Obama took a break from his retirement to talk about health care and not once did he use the words  fake news  or even  sad. Today is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, a law, that despite Republicans  claims otherwise, took months and months to draft, debate and eventually pass. Obama, as well as anyone, knows that the law isn t perfect, but he does recognize some very basic facts, which boil down to we re much better with it than without it. Obama said it better in a statement on Thursday. So the reality is clear: America is stronger because of the Affordable Care Act,  Obama said.He s right. The uninsured rate has been cut almost in half since the law s inception and it goes down every year.Republicans want to change that and Obama didn t let that go. In his very diplomatic style that we so desperately miss, the President urged Republicans to pass a bill that would improve upon the Affordable Care Act, not make it worse. So if Republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it, and if they re prepared to work with Democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals   that s something we all should welcome,  he said.  But we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans. That should always be our priority.  Only, as we know, Republicans don t give a crap about making the law better, unless by better, you mean giving rich people a huge tax cut while leaving older poor people much, much poorer.Fortunately, the fate of this bill, which will go up for a vote on the anniversary of Obama s signature healthcare law, is uncertain to say the least. At this point, it s far more likely to fail than to pass.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News,"March 23, 2017"
 BOMBSHELL Report Just Dropped Showing Gorsuch Is A Fraud,"Apparently, original ideas are a liability in the Donald Trump administration. Nearly as many Trumpsters have been accused of plagiarism as weeks he s held in office. Okay, that s a slight exaggeration, but Neil Gorsuch, the man who s about to be rammed into a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, appears to have plagiarized some of his writing.We should have known when Trump s own wife Melania plagiarized part of her Republican National Convention speech from Michelle Obama.Once in office, Trump picked Monica Crowley to head the National Security Council. You got it, she plagiarized her Ph.D. dissertation and the book she published in 2012.Crowley was forced to drop out of contention, but Betsy DeVos is Trump s education secretary and in a move that would get a child kicked out of school, she plagiarized part of the questionnaire she filled out to get the job. Now, it appears, Trump s pick for the Supreme Court is also guilty of plagiarism.Politico obtained several documents that showed several passages of Gorsuch s 2006 book,  The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,  were nearly identical to a 1984 article in the Indiana Law Journal. There were also several other incidents.In the most striking example, Gorsuch, in his book, appears to duplicate sentences from an Indiana Law Journal article written by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma without attributing her. Instead, he uses the same sources that Kuzma used: A 1982 Indiana court ruling that was later sealed, a well-known pediatrics textbook,  Rudolph s Pediatrics,  and a 1983 article in the Bloomington Sunday Herald.Politico reports on documents showing that SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch plagiarized the work of others. Behold: https://t.co/XQnCmd62Ia pic.twitter.com/ooc2TkG2bA  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) April 5, 2017There s more. Read the Politico article for all the instances.The White House is calling the accusations false: This false attack has been strongly refuted by highly-regarded academic experts, including those who reviewed, professionally examined, and edited Judge Gorsuch s scholarly writings, and even the author of the main piece cited in the false attack,  said White House spokesman Steven Cheung.  There is only one explanation for this baseless, last-second smear of Judge Gorsuch: those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well-qualified and mainstream nominee to the Supreme Court. Experts disagree with the White House: Each of the individual incidents constitutes a violation of academic ethics. I ve never seen a college plagiarism code that this would not be in violation of,  said Rebecca Moore Howard, a Syracuse University professor who has written extensively on the issue.Not that it should make much of a difference.

 ‘Loving’ Christians Make Plans To Harass Thousands Of People At DC Rally,"A group of about 1,000 Christians planned to attend next week s Reason Rally in Washington, D.C., so they could hand out literature and about $25,000 in Subway gift cards. The purpose was to show the atheists that would be there some so-called  Christian love.  However, the D.C. police have put a stop to that, saying they would have to get a separate permit, and stay on the other side of the National Mall, because such a gathering constitutes a protest.Organizer Ray Comfort told Christian NewsWire the following: In what is so often a cruel world, we tried to show a little kindness and it didn t work. So it now looks like we will be eating Subway sandwiches for the next 40 years. Oh, no. What to do, what to do? Comfort will still be allowed to film the event, because his film crew is too small to need a permit. Since the Reason Rally is free and open to the public, Comfort is now encouraging Christians to go as individuals, and not as a group, so they can still proselytize to the atheists there. That s their M.O.   force their religion down the throats of anyone who doesn t believe in any way possible.While Comfort can understand the perspective of the police they re trying to maintain peace there s a solid chance that there will be Christians there who don t get it at all, and only see their so-called  mission from God,  to convert these heathens. For instance, Eric Hovind, writing on Creation Today, said: On June 4, 2016 we will be gathering in Washington, D.C. to share the love of Christ with a group of people who practice the religion of Selfianity. That s right, they self identify as  Atheists  in order to become worshipers of themselves. Oh, please. Hovind is one of those that thinks atheists (and other non-Christians) are the root of what s wrong with the world. He won t be the only one there to think that way, either.Hovind calls his blog post  REASON hits the Reason Rally 2016,  in a lame attempt to demonstrate that Christianity is the only reason there is. He s one of those that will probably end up hounding the atheists that attend.There is one good thing to come out of this. Some readers of The Friendly Atheist were able to convince Ray Comfort to give those Subway gift cards to the homeless. That there is true Christian love   helping the downtrodden. They need to spend more time doing that, and less time trying to convert people to their religion and taking over the country.Featured image by Brambmanu.

WIKILEAKS EXPOSES Clinton Campaign In Cahoots With Corrupt DOJ On Email Scandal,"An official within Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign appeared to have discussions with sources inside the Department of Justice (DOJ) about ongoing open records lawsuits regarding the former secretary of State s emails, according to an email released on Tuesday.In an email from May 2015, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said that  DOJ folks  had  inform[ed]  him about an upcoming status conference in one of the lawsuits regarding Clinton s private email setup. The information about an upcoming court event would have been public knowledge and open for all to attend. And it s unclear whether the people Fallon spoke to at the Justice Department were officials who regularly communicate with the public. However, the fact that Fallon   a former spokesman with the Department of Justice   remained in contact with anyone from the department is likely to renew allegations that the Obama administration maintained an especially cozy relationship with the former secretary of State s presidential campaign.On Tuesday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said the connection was  unbelievable .The email  shows a level of collusion which calls into question the entire investigation into her private server,  Trump spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement on Tuesday. The Department of Justice must release all communications with the Clinton campaign and her allies as soon as possible in order to definitively prove their investigation was completely above board.

America’s ‘Hottest’ Conservative Joins Fox News Team,"Tomi Lahren recently told The Hollywood Reporter that news networks need to hire more conservatives as commentators:  It seems as though the only diversity some networks won t embrace is diversity of opinion Well, FOX News just hired Lahren as a contributor. Is Fox news trying to win back some conservatives who have turned them off?

She gained a following via Facebook and is unconventional in her rise to news notoriety. LAHREN JOINS FOX: It seems as though the only diversity some networks won t embrace is diversity of opinion,  said Lahren, who had been suggested as a potential fit for a CNN contributor role in the wake of Jeffrey Lord s and Kayleigh McEnany s departures.CNN, as it turns out, wasn t in the cards, but Lahren was able to snag a contributor role on Fox News, where she will discuss the news on the network s opinion shows and work on  an FNC digital product currently in development. I am blessed and honored to join the Fox News team,  Lahren said in a statement on her Facebook page.

She s also hosted shows for two conservative networks, Glenn Beck s The Blaze and One America News Network.Via: Hollywood Reporter ",politics,"Aug 30, 2017"
 The Very Scary Reason Trump’s Evangelicals Don’t Care About Cuts To Programs For Those In Need,"As our current administration continues to prove that it has no actual concern for the working class, it s hard to image why Trump is supported by anyone other than the rich. The White House s current budget proposals put support for the poor, sick, and elderly on the chopping block in favor of tax breaks for the wealthy. Besides being economically unjust, wouldn t these slashes in services be against the Christian obligation to charity? Why do evangelicals stand strong in their support for Trump?The fact that Trump is a seemingly odd choice for political leadership among evangelicals has been debated since he first announced his bid to run. The prevailing explanation for their support is that evangelicals merely tolerate Trump because they care about fighting abortion/LGBTQ and therefore the preservation of their religious freedom.But why the support for tax cuts over the assistance for those in need? According to an article by Religion Dispatches, it s about more than just toleration. The huge budget cuts are part of the religious right keeping up their understanding of a  biblical worldview  and are an important part of its agenda.According to  sphere sovereignty    a theory of how the Bible rules every aspect of life   God has given authority to men in government, but this authority has very limited roles. This view holds that man s role in civil government only allows for property protection and criminal punishment. According to this view, it is the families job to help the poor, with some secondary help from the church. If tax money is used to help the poor it is seen as  tyrannically exceeding  the biblical authority of the government and is considered stealing.This arcane position is held and popularized in some mainstream evangelical circles and articulated by radio host David Barton. It s also taught in Christian school curricula and promoted in books and conferences.This view is the basis for many new administration policies, and the reason many of Trump s appointees are trying to shut down the agencies they are in charge of. Even the Department of Education is being led by a person who strongly believes that it s the families responsibility to educate children and that civil government should stay out of it.Trump himself probably doesn t hold these theoretical views, but Mike Pence sure does, and he s already making sure the  biblical worldview  is the basis for Trump s policies.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 11, 2017"

One could even argue that the Republicans in Congress ARE protecting Trump, considering that they won t do anything about him.Many regularly go on television and refuse to criticize Trump regarding Russia or anything else. This is true even when the evidence that he obstructed justice, colluded with the Russians, is self-dealing from the Oval Office, or committing any number of other crimes is nothing short of damning. That s to say nothing of his clear and dangerous incompetence, and his daily disgracing of the office we all hold so dear as a nation.If for no other reason than what Rep.

YOUR BLOOD WILL BOIL When You See Why College Students Were Forced To Stand Guard Over Thousands Of U.S. FLAGS Meant To Honor 9-11 Victims On Their Liberal Campus,"This is how coddled kids who have never had to deal with losing an innocent family member, friend or co-worker at the hands of evil Islamic terrorists behaves At Occidental College on Saturday, vandals trashed 2,977 U.S. flags planted in the quad to memorialize those who died on Sept. 11.The students who planted the small American flags found them uprooted and thrown in campus garbage cans. Every last flag. Some were even snapped in half.Not only that, dozens of makeshift fliers accompanied the vandalism. Taped to benches and other surfaces, most of the fliers stated  R.I.P.  to 9/11 victims as well as to 1.45 million Iraqis who died  during the U.S. invasion for something they didn t do. Sophomore Alan Bliss, a math and economics major who helped lead the effort to plant the flags, told The College Fix in a telephone interview Sunday that when he and a friend came across the destroyed memorial, three students confronted him and said they found the display  triggering.  He said the students also accused him of white privilege and ignorance.Occidental is a small liberal-arts college in Los Angeles known as far-left. President Barack Obama attended for two years before transferring to Columbia. So when the right or even moderates try to do something on campus there is extreme push back,  Bliss said of his school, adding conservatives are a  silent majority  there and some students are even scared of speaking up against progressives for fear of retribution.As for the display, Bliss said it was installed Saturday afternoon by his conservative student club, which is affiliated with the College Republican National Committee and Young Americans for Freedom, the latter of which helped sponsor the  Never Forget  memorial project.Later that night Bliss said he learned bandits had uprooted and tossed the flags. When Bliss and his friend arrived at the scene, it was 12:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The three students who told Bliss the display is triggering denied involvement in the vandalism, he said.Campus safety was called and officers took statements from Bliss as well as the other three students.Meanwhile, Bliss added, as word spread on social media that the  Never Forget  memorial was razed, students left their dorm rooms in the middle of the night to help replant the flags. As students came home from parties, they chipped in, too. They were just like,  I am not Republican, I am not conservative, but this is a terrible act,  Bliss said.  They stayed there late into the night, 2 a.m., planting flags. It was pretty amazing, it was pretty touching. A Facebook post from the club offers more details on the long evening:  Later that morning, a few of us stood guard at the memorial. Four Occidental students came up and snapped a few flags right in our faces. When we confronted them, those cowards got away as fast as they possibly could. When Bliss (pictured) and his friends returned to the display after breakfast Sunday morning, he said he found another 100 flags trashed. And again, Bliss and his peers replanted.Bliss, 20, co-founder and president of the club, which he alanblisslaunched in the spring of 2016, said he plans to fight back.

FLASHBACK [VIDEO]: Libertarian Gary Johnson Discusses Solutions To Syrian Conflict…TODAY On MSNBC: Gives EMBARRASSING Answer To Basic Question About Syrian War,"Libertarian Presidential candidate Gary Johnson was asked by MSNBC host Mike Barnacle,  What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo? To the horror of viewers and hosts on the MSNBC panel, Gary Johnson responded,  What is Aleppo? Watch the Libertarian presidential candidate 7% of Americans say they plan to vote for in November:Gary Johnson was interviewed by Joe Rogan on CSPAN about his thoughts on the Syrian conflict. Watch him fudge his way through a discussion about a country where he doesn t even know the name of the city at the epicenter of that conflict: GARY JOHNSON: I think we bear a responsibility for the refugee crisis and we should be taking on our fair share. What is the mathematics of having disrupted 11 million Syrians, half the population? When it comes to the U.S., I think we can deal with this effectively. Should it be carte blanche? No, but we can have a system in place to accept refugees right off the bat. Other refugees might be questionable, backgrounds or whatever. We ve directed enough of our resources on the military side to deal with the refugee side of it humanely and in a way that reflects what America is all about.JOE ROGAN: When I ve talked to military operatives though, they believe a proactive attack, or proactive action, is much more likely to stop ISIS or any-GARY JOHNSON: Well and that, that s been our tact to date. And I m gonna say that, without exception, that every one of those military interventions have had an unintended consequence of at best. You know, we, we, we go, we re, we always deal with atrocity. There atrocities going on. We go in to deal with that atrocity, and at the end of the day, the new dictator, the new despot that we put into place to replace the bad despot, at the end of the day, is just as bad or in many cases worse. We cut off the head of the hydra, and lo and behold, there are more heads.ROGAN: So how does one stop that? I mean, have you ever tried to come up with some sort of a solution or look at some sort of a long-term plan that would somehow or another calm the world, or at least, allow the United States to make peace?JOHNSON: One of the reasons that I m seeking to become President of the United States is I think I d do a really good job of presiding over, over all the intelligence that we do have regarding all of this. I don t want, I don t want to present myself as having the answers, as much as, you know what, give me, give me the intel, let me be part of this discussion, and um, but I m gonna enter in to this discussion, as a real skeptic, um, on what we ve done to this point, and a real skeptic on what appears to be what we re gonna do in the future regarding all this. Isn t there a more effective way of dealing with this?I wouldn t be seeking this job if um, if I didn t think I could make a difference in it. And I, I do not want to misstate. I don t, I don t wanna play cards. Obama draws lines in the sand. I m not gonna draw lines in the sand. If you draw any lines in the sand, you d better be prepared to back up what you said with action. And that s also been an issue with Obama.ROGAN: What was your take when Obama went on television, and was talking about how we needed to invade Syria? And Syria was a huge issue, and the American public was up in arms, both the right and the left. People were like,  What are you talking about? This is craziness.  And then the administration backed off. I mean, was it, in my opinion, it was one of the first [ ] it was one of the first examples of the United States, sort of collectively, the will of the people, like being openly expressed, that the idea of erring Syria was outrageous. Nobody wanted to do it. They didn t make any sense to people, this gas attack. How was this anymore horrible than a lot of shit that s been going on over the world all the time? What is, what is it about Syria that all of a sudden we have to go invade Syria? One more intervention in another country, and the administration backed off?JOHNSON: Great example. People are fed up with this, and in fact, you know, 22 million people in Syria, and 11 million of them have been displaced. Don t we, don t we have a share in, share in that consequence?ROGAN: What was the motivation? What s the motivation for the United States to want to invade there in the first place?JOHNSON: Well, wasn t it the, McCain going over there, beating his chess, and uh, along with Lindsey Graham, and uh, and let s go over there and support the good guys? Well, the good guys are the minority, and the good guys, at the end of the day, are um  Look, this is  somehow we re gonna determine the outcomes of, in other countries? I am, I mean, that s just, it s preposterous. That uh, as individuals we can do that.The funny thing about Gary Johnson is that he pretends to have a strong grasp on foreign policy as it relates to Syria in the video below, but when asked how the US became involved in the conflict, the best answer he can give is to blame it on John McCain and Lindsey Graham? How did this guy ever even make it onto the ballot? And even more frightening, is how he managed to convince 7% of Americans he s a legitimate candidate Watch:  ",left-news,"Sep 8, 2016"

BLACK MAN CLAIMS He Was KICKED OUT Of Swanky LA Gym Because He Supports President Trump…WATCH Jesse Peterson Tell His Incredible Story,"Equinox Los Angeles, one of the swankiest gyms in America, where celebrities like Chloe Kardashian, Mickey Rourke, Renee Zellweger and Sean Combs have been seen exiting is apparently okay with accepting their exorbitant fees from gym members, as long as they don t support our current President, Donald J. Trump.On their Facebook page, Equinox makes no secret about the fact that transgenders are welcome at their DC location: Members pay $200 to $300 initiation fees and $160 to $250 monthly rates. They rave about the gym s amenities, which include classes taught by former Olympians and spa treatments.Equinox gym makes it pretty clear however, in one of their Facebook posts that they tolerate all people of all beliefs. They actually tell Facebook users that if they have  narrow minds  that they  need not apply . Hmmm .so asking a member to leave because he supports our president isn t  narrow minded? Watch the video below, as one of the sweetest conservative voices in social media, Jesse Lee Peterson tells his story of how he was treated by Equinox Gym in Los Angeles. (The video cuts off part of Jesse s head, but his story is definitely worth listening to.) Conservatives and specifically, conservative Trump supporters are under attack by leftist bullies everywhere. We need to stand strong and stick together. There has never been a more important time to stand your ground and be unafraid of who you are. We cannot allow the Left to bully us into submission.

 Trump’s Deplorables Just Got Flat-Out MONSTROUS With Sexual Assault Victims On Twitter (TWEETS),"One of Twitter s top trending hashtags is full of women who ve been harassed and assaulted, and they re explaining why women don t report such incidents with their personal stories. There are many, many moving accounts under #WhyWomenDontReport, but there are also the misogynistic jerkwads who are intentionally hurting victims all over again.Trump s deplorables are busy reinforcing their image as the bottom-feeders of deplorability. They re calling Trump s victims liars, and they re calling women who report sexual assault liars, gold-diggers, and worse. In short, they re doing every single thing they can to shame women who have been harassed and outright attacked. Some are even using #NextFakeTrumpVictim as a rebuttal to #WhyWomenDontReport.They are disgusting, and they are monsters.

Many fear that nobody will believe them. They fear the accusation will be turned back on them and destroy their reputations and lives. They can t stomach the idea of having to answer explicit questions about their bodies and their sexuality in order to prove they were actually attacked.It s because there are police who tell women to deal with it, and sometimes don t even file the report. It s because women are asked what they were wearing, whether they were drinking and flirting, why they were wherever they were, why they let themselves be alone with their attackers, and so forth. It s because people say that sexual assault is just sex that the victim regrets later on.No, people don t believe us. Yes, people shame us to hell and back. Yes, we re accused of ruining the lives of the men who hurt us so badly. Why don t women report sexual assault and harassment? Because we can t.Featured image by Ralph Freso via Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2016"
 Ivanka Trump FINALLY Has Something To Say About ‘Pu**ygate’,"Everybody under the sun has had something to say about Trump s boasts of sexual assault in the bombshell  pu**ygate  tape and the avalanche of accusations against him that followed. Everyone that is, except his oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.In the Access Hollywood tapes from 2005, Trump brags that he  just starts kissing  random women if he finds them attractive and can even  grab em by the pu**y  because he is  a star.  People have come out of the woodwork to weigh in on Trump s sexually predatory boasts, but until now, Ivanka has kept her silence.On Monday, Ivanka issued a statement regarding her father s disgusting comments to Fast Company. My father s comments were clearly inappropriate and offensive, and I m glad that he acknowledged this fact with an immediate apology to my family and the American people. And that s all she has to say about that. He said he s sorry, so no harm, no foul. For the record, she said nothing in the statement about her father telling Howard Stern that it was okay to refer to her as a  piece of ass. But as short as her statement was, she did go further than her brother by calling dear old dad s remarks  offensive.  Eric Trump defended his father s comments as just being  locker room talk  and the inevitable result of two  alpha personalities  having a conversation.In a separate interview with Fast Company, Ivanka said that she is able to  shrug off  all the negative reports about her father, even the long list of women accusing Trump of sexual assault. The greatest comfort I have is the fact that I know my father. Most of the people who write about him don t. I do,  she explained.  So that gives me an ability to shrug off the things that I read about him that are wrong.

WOW! LIBERAL Fox News Host Geraldo Rivera SLAMS Hypocrisy of Left For Ignoring Sexual Assault Allegations Against Bill Clinton,"Liberal FOX News host, Geraldo Rivera, took to Twitter to express his disgust over the hypocritical left and their selective outrage over sex harassment allegations based on the political party of the accused.Geraldo Rivera asked the left a very good question,  Why are so many who profess to be outraged &amp; repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton? so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ? Why are so many who profess to be outraged & repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton ?  so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ?  Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) November 10, 2017While the media shark-tank surrounded Trump, hoping to prove the ALLEGED sexual harassment charges (Not surprisingly, after Trump won the election, all of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct have gone into hiding)  against him  were real, they refused to even consider the confessions of multiple women against Bill Clinton and his enabling wife during the campaign. The real difference, of course, is that the women accusing Bill Clinton of sexual assault, have been screaming from the rooftops for decades about the sexual abuse they endured by the former governor of Arkansas.Rivera brought up another great point in his tweet as it relates to the fake Trump-Russian dossier story that the left has been apoplectic about since the news broke in the liberal media several months ago. It appears, however, that the left has already forgotten the reason Bill Clinton was impeached after lying to a federal grand jury about having sexual encounters with a 19-year old intern in the Oval Office while serving as our nation s President.Meanwhile, it s also curious how many RINO s in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said that without any investigation or opportunity to prove that any of the allegations of sexual misconduct against 3 minors are untrue, that Republican candidate for US Senate, Judge Roy Moore (AL), should step down. Does anyone remember telling Hillary to  step down  because there should never be a geriatric pervert allowed to roam the halls of the White House putting visitors and the staff in potential danger of sexual assault? For that matter, does anyone remember telling Bill Clinton to  step down  when he was accused of sexual assault over and over again while he was running for the office of the President of the United States? The answer is  no , there was no such call for either Clinton to  step down  and give up their political ambitions.This isn t the first time Fox News host Geraldo Rivera, who is a self-described liberal, has spoken out against the hypocrisy of the left. In February 2017, Rivera resigned from a voluntary position at Yale University after the school decided to change the name of a residential college that honors a slavery supporter.Rivera said Sunday on Twitter that he resigned as an associate fellow of Calhoun College. He said the position was an honor  but intolerant insistence on political correctness is lame. ",left-news,"Nov 10, 2017"
