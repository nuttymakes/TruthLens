Trump Makes Triumphant Crowd Entrance at Inaugural Eve MAGA Rally,"President-elect Donald Trump made a triumphant entrance through the crowd at his Make America Great Again rally less than 24 hours before he is once again sworn in as president. Lee Greenwood delivered a live rendition of his iconic song, “God Bless the USA,” as Trump emerged from the crowd dozens of rows above the floor of the Capital One Arena, less than a mile from the White House. “I’m thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, and true American patriots on the eve of taking back our country; that’s what we’re going to do: take back our country,” Trump told supporters. “Tomorrow, at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride, bringing it all back,” Trump added, to cheers. He then pledged to dismantle the D.C. political establishment: Once and for all, we’re going to end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment in Washington, a failed administration. We’re not going to take it anymore. We’re going to stop the invasion of our borders. We’re going to reclaim our wealth. We’re going to unlock the liquid gold that’s right under our feet… We’re going to bring back law and order to our cities. We’re going to restore patriotism to our schools, get radical left woke ideologies the hell out of our military and out of our government, and we are going to make America great again. Due to frigid forecasts, the inauguration has been moved indoors, and an indoor parade will be held at Capital One Arena.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T00:26:46+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2025/01/19/trump-makes-triumphant-crowd-entrance-at-inaugural-eve-maga-rally/
Supporters Gather for Trump's Inauguration Eve 'Victory Rally',"WASHINGTON, DC — Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump gathered from across the country on Sunday to attend the 45th and soon-to-be 47th president’s Inauguration Eve “victory rally” at Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, braving cold weather and long lines. Brenda Mantooth, 84, of Missouri, told Breitbart News that she is looking forward “to seeing this country brought back up — not only to where it was morally, spiritually, innovatively — but go beyond that.” Sending a message to Trump, Mantooth added, “Stay true to yourself, you listen and let the lord guide you.” “I’m looking for Trump to bring morale up,” Terrence Fowler of Georgia said. “I spoke to a lot of people about the morale of the country. It’s been down for four years. It’s definitely time for us to get our morale up.” Trump is “bringing structure back to the country, and that’s what I’m excited about,” Fowler continued, adding that he is looking forward to seeing the soon-to-be 47th president address the “border crisis, housing market,” and getting “our economy back up and going.” “It’s exciting to see,” Fowler said. “I’m expecting a lot of great things. A lot of his appointments with the cabinet have been great. The two most important ones [being] Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr.” Chuck Boggs of Tennessee told Breitbart News his top concern is immigration, which he is looking forward to seeing Trump address in his upcoming second presidential term. “Secure the borders and get rid of inflation,” Mary Macionski of Michigan said of the changes she would like to see. As Breitbart News reported , Trump’s inauguration committee announced the 45th and soon-to-be 47th president would host a mass rally for supporters in Washington, DC, on Sunday, the day before he is set to be inaugurated for a second term.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T00:08:14+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/supporters-gather-for-trumps-inauguration-eve-victory-rally/
Biden Grants Posthumous Pardon to Black Nationalist Marcus Garvey,"In his final full day in office, President Joe Biden has given a posthumous pardon to black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Referring to the pan-Africanist and racial separatist as a “renowned civil rights and human rights leader,” Biden said his 1923 conviction and subsequent five-year sentence was an “injustice.” Born in 1887 in Saint Ann’s Bay, Jamaica, Garvey moved to the U.S. in 1916 before forming the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which aimed to “establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa.” In 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud after advertising the sale of stocks in a boat for his shipping company, Black Star Line, which the business did not yet own. After being found guilty and sentenced to serve five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey’s sentence in 1927, and deported him back to Jamaica. Biden’s Sunday statement from the White House on Garvey’s posthumous pardon is as follows: Marcus Mosiah Garvey (1887-1940) was a renowned civil rights and human rights leader who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927. Notably, Mr. Garvey created the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as “the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement.” Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction. The outgoing president has set a new record for giving out the most individual pardons and commutations, announcing on Friday that he was commuting sentences for almost 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders. Biden also notably pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing a 17-year sentence after being convicted of tax and gun charges.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:42:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/law-and-order/2025/01/19/biden-grants-posthumous-pardon-to-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey/
Trump to Swear In with Personal Bible and Lincoln Bible During Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump will swear into office with two Bibles — one given to him by his mother, and one that President Abraham Lincoln used in his own inaugural ceremony in 1861. The incoming president’s personal Bible was gifted to him by his mother in 1955 to “mark his Sunday Church Primary School graduation at First Presbyterian Church, in Jamaica, New York,” a press release from Trump’s inaugural committee obtained by Fox News states . Trump’s Bible is a 1953 revised standard version, the outlet reported. He will also be sworn in with the historic Lincoln Bible, which was used by former President Barack Obama at both of his inaugurations and Trump at his first inauguration. “It has only been used three times since, by President Obama at each of his inaugurations and by President Trump at his first inauguration in 2017,” the Trump inaugural committee stated. “The burgundy velvet-bound book is part of the collections of the Library of Congress.”",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:23:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/trump-swear-in-with-personal-bible-and-lincoln-bible-during-inauguration/
Poll: Most Americans One-Word Summary of Biden's Legacy Is 'Nothing',"Americans who participated in a recent poll appear to view President Joe Biden’s (D) time in the White House as a big nothingburger. A poll conducted for the Daily Mail by J.L. Partners with some 1,009 registered voters asked how they would describe 82-year-old Biden’s time in office, the Mail reported Sunday: When the results are arranged in a word cloud, the most common answer sticks out at the center. The next most popular answers are economy, inflation, and infrastructure, in a more encouraging nod to one of his landmark pieces of legislation. Yet the same word, ‘nothing’ stands out when the responses are split by political persuasion. … When voters were asked whether they can remember a single Biden achievement, more than half say they cannot. Some 37 percent say they ‘strongly’ agree with the statement that they cannot name a single one. Social media users were quick to share their thoughts on the Mail ‘s report, one person writing , “Worst President Ever. Good riddance.” “Destroying the economy and enriching his family off of the American taxpayers,” someone else commented , while another user replied ,”Hes wrecked our country and gotten dirty rich while doing it.” Meanwhile, a recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that “border and immigration handling” was named as Biden’s biggest failure, per Breitbart News. “The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels ‘like a morgue’ and ‘glum’ as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in,” the article said. It is also important to note that Americas have been suffering under the grip of inflation during the Biden-Harris presidency. “U.S. consumer prices climbed at a faster rate in December, capping off the inflation-plagued Biden administration’s final year and suggesting that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring down inflation may have run out of steam,” Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. In addition, Biden’s health and ability to serve has also been questioned. In December, CBS News reporter Jan Crawford claimed that Biden’s “obvious cognitive decline” was the most underreported story in 2024, per Breitbart News.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:51:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-one-word-summary-president-joe-bidens-legacy-nothing/
Exclusive: Sen. Tim Scott Highlights 'American Renewal' Under Trump,"Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) released a video highlighting how the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump signifies the “American Renewal.” In the video , Scott speaks about how it is “time for an American Renewal” of the United States’ security, economy, education, and “national spirit.” Scott adds that only Trump could make the vision of American renewal a reality, and that the “Great American Renewal starts today.” “What is victory? When you defy the odds and get back up. When you show the world the strength of America,” Scott says in his video. “When your resilience sends a message. A message so powerful — it roars. It is time for an American Renewal. Renewal of our security, economy, energy, education, and our national spirit”: “We’re not just the Grand Old Party of the past,” Scott added. “We’re the Great Opportunity Party of America’s future. There’s only one person who can make that vision a reality, Donald Trump. The Great American Renewal starts today.” The video from Scott comes a day before Trump is set to be inaugurated. As Breitbart News previously reported , Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors and will be held in the Capitol rotunda “due to forecasted freezing temperatures.” A recent CBS News poll , conducted January 15-17, found that 60 percent of Americans were optimistic about the next four years under Trump while 40 percent were pessimistic. When asked about how things were in the U.S. today, six percent said “very well,” 29 percent said things were “somewhat well,” 39 percent said things were going “somewhat badly,” and 26 percent said things were going “very badly.” Roughly 2,174 adults in America were surveyed in the poll.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:22:51+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/exclusive-tim-scott-releases-video-highlighting-american-renewal-ahead-trump-inauguration/
TikTok Restores Services After Trump Says He Will Delay Ban,"TikTok restored services in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump clarified that he would issue an executive order delaying a ban on the app. In a post on X, TikTok issued a statement revealing that “in agreement” with their service providers, they were “in the process of restoring service.” “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,” TikTok said. “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.” “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,” TikTok continued. “We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” The statement from TikTok comes after Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he was calling for companies to not allow TikTok to remain dark. Trump also clarified that his executive order would “confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark” before the order. “I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” Trump said. “The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.” Trump added that he “would like the United States” to have a 50 percent “ownership position in a joint venture,” explaining that, by doing so, “we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to” remain up. “Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok,” Trump added. “With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars — maybe trillions.” On Saturday evening, American users on TikTok were greeted with a message informing them that TikTok was unavailable in the United States, due to a “law banning TikTok” being enacted. As Breitbart News has previously reported , in December, the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to either sell the app or risk being banned in the U.S. ByteDance had until January 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban, unless a 90-day extension was granted by the president.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T21:38:51+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-restores-services-in-u-s-after-trump-says-he-will-issue-executive-order-delaying-ban/
"Jon Voight, Matt Boyle, James O'Keefe Tribute Andrew Breitbart","WASHINGTON, DC – Award recipients, ranging from actor Jon Voight to Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle, praised Andrew Breitbart during the Patriot Awards on Saturday, underscoring the immeasurable scope of his legacy. After winning one of just a handful of Patriot Awards, which recognize individual contributions to the MAGA movement, Voight gave a nod to Breitbart in his remarks. He recalled meeting Breitbart at a small gathering of conservatives in Hollywood years ago. WATCH — Actor Jon Voight Remembers Andrew Breitbart at Patriot Awards: “I Loved Him”: “I saw Andrew Breitbart, and I’m sitting there next to Gary Sinise and I’m saying, ‘Gary, this guy’s got it. He’s amazing,'” Voight recalled. Voight reminisced about his conversation with Breitbart after the event. “I said, ‘Andrew, you’re a special guy.’ I said, you know, ‘What are you going to do with that energy?’ And I was saying to him that, you know, ‘I say a few things, I’m not as open as some people, but I say a few things — I’m not afraid to get in the game a little bit,'” Voight recalled. “And he said to me, ‘Jon, I can’t wait. I can’t wait to get into their faces.'” “I said, ‘Oh, this guy’s dangerous,'” he added, drawing laughs. “And then I saw what he did with that energy. He did confront everything. He said these most wonderful things.” As one Voight pointed to Breitbart’s famous standoff with Occupy protesters, telling them to “behave” themselves and to “stop raping people!” “He got up in front of them, and they would shout him down and try to shout him down, and the press was there, right? So he knew what to do with the press,” Voight said. “He stood up and stood in front of these people, he went right to them, and he said, ‘Stop raping! Stop raping!’ He said it like 15 times, and that was it. That was the way the message got across to people that these people were perverse people, you see, bad people, criminals.” “And anyway, he had this great imagination, and I loved him, and I spoke to him the day before he passed,” Voight added. “And he was he was attacked, you know, just like in the way our president was attacked, Rudy Giuliani was attacked, and all that, but he stood up. He was so beautiful, such a beautiful person.” Boyle also paid homage to Breitbart after being presented with his award. “Andrew Breitbart always used to talk about how culture is upstream from politics and you have to win the culture war. Well, let me make it clear: the Presidential Inaugural Committee just announced that Nelly is performing at one of the inaugural balls on Monday night. Last night, we had Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Soulja Boy performing — not my cup of tea, but whatever. The point is — Rascal Flatts are performing at another one, Carrie Underwood is singing at the inauguration — we’ve won the culture war, guys,” Boyle said, to applause. “I will say, Andrew Breitbart would be so proud of where we are as a movement today; he was a really good friend of mine, and we have a very, very bright future ahead of us,” he said to close out his remarks. “So here in the heart of the establishment media’s power, if you will, in Washington, DC, at the National Press Club, we declare: The establishment media, you are dead, and we’re going to win this thing.” James O’Keefe, founder of O’Keefe Media Group, also honored Breitbart when he accepted his Patriot Award. “So I’ll keep this pretty short, but you know I appreciate this honor and Andrew Breitbart, there’s so much to say, but way back when, because I’ve been doing this since I was in college, he used to say ‘We are the media now’ right? ‘ We are the media,’” O’Keefe said after noting OMG broke a story last week leading to the firing of a Pentagon official. “This week, you know, in an extraordinary series of events, the Pentagon fired this guy for, you know, he’s an adviser to the Joint Chiefs; he’s in meetings inside the Situation Room inside the Pentagon, and in an extraordinary series of events, not one single member of the DC press corps reported on it,” O’Keefe added. “So I think Andrew used to say this in so many words, but it’s not that the legacy media is just merely not reporting news– n ow they’re in the news suppression business. And stop complaining about the media. Understand that now you, me, we are the media.” The tributes come as the 13th anniversary of Breitbart’s passing, March 1, 2025, approaches. The Patriot Awards, which are 18-inch bronze statues of Trump, resemble a larger-than-life two-story bronze statue of Trump, which Breitbart News first reported of in November as it neared completion. “PATRIOT Founder Ashley Sansalone was responsible for the idea to create the statue and manages the construction and logistics of the project,” event host Dustin Stockton told Breitbart News. “Without Ash, none of this could have happened.” Stockton is a former Breitbart News reporter.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T21:20:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/jon-voight-matt-boyle-james-okeefe-tribute-andrew-breitbart-patriot-awards/
Poll: Most Americans Have Poor View of President Biden's Time in Office,"Citizens are not looking favorably on President Joe Biden’s (D) time in office as President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration approaches. According to CBS News polling, “When Americans look back now on Biden’s presidency, 37% approve of the job he has done over the last four years. That is just below any approval mark he received while in office,” the outlet reported Sunday. When Biden took office four years ago, most Americans felt optimistic about the job he would do. However, following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that left many service members dead, his approval rating took a dive and continued to drop as Americans suffered in the grip of inflation, and “it never recovered,” the article stated. Social media users shared their thoughts on the CBS News report, one person writing , “And you did everything possible to cover for him. You’re a joke.” “Over the past four years you told us he was fit for office, reducing our debt, and bringing illegal workers across the border to help America. You have earn ‘old media’ tag which you will never shed. What you paid to play has earned you a walk in the media shadows,” another user commented . Meanwhile, some members of the Democrat party are distancing themselves from claims that Biden was fit to serve, Breitbart News reported January 7. “After Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July following a poor debate performance, Democrats claimed he was fit to serve,” the outlet said. “Now two weeks before Biden leaves office, a handful of Democrats are starting to trash the president and warn of accountability.” A recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that “border and immigration handling” were named as Biden’s biggest failure as president, per Breitbart News. The news of Biden’s decline in favorability comes as Trump prepares for his inauguration on Monday in Washington, DC, AFP reported Saturday. Per the CBS News report, “This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,174 U.S. adults interviewed between January 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is ±2.5 points.”",Breitbart,2025-01-19T20:49:40+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-have-negative-view-outgoing-president-joe-bidens-time-office/
"Actor, CNN Show Host Michael Ian Black Wants to 'Fu**ing Impeach' Trump Before He's Sworn In","Well, that didn’t take long. Donald Trump has yet to take the oath of office at his second inauguration and Hollywood celebrities are already clamoring to run him out of office. Trump surprised fans and foes alike over the weekend when he announced the release of $TRUMP, his very own cryptocurrency. The meme coin’s value is already surging as a feverish flood of buying sent its market capitalization through the roof on Saturday to several billion dollars. That’s good news right? Not if you ask left-wing comedian Michael Ian Black. “Fucking impeach him,” Black wrote in a Bluesky screed. Fucking impeach him. [image or embed] — Michael Ian Black ( @michaelianblack.bsky.social ) January 18, 2025 at 3:21 PM If you didn’t already know, Black wasn’t rooting for Trump during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he was among the few people who thought Kamala Harris “kick Trump’s withered old ass” during their one and only debate. Black, a co-captain on the CNN quiz show Have I Got News for You , was last seen on these pages embarrassing himself on the aforementioned CNN program for making false claims about a diplomatic success story Trump explained during the aforementioned debate. Black spent Trump’s first term in office obsessing over nearly ever thing the president-elect did or said. He wrote an anti-Trump children’s book and even advised reporters tell Trump to “fuck off.” Black is already reeling again, so we can probably expect more of the same sad shrieks.

"Michael Rapaport Celebrates the Demise of 'Dirty, Biased, Damn Near Soft Porn Dumphole' TikTok","Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport celebrated the shuttering of Chinese-owned social media outlet TikTok, which went dark on Sunday in the wake of a ban put in place by an act of Congress. TikTok went dark on Sunday in compliance with the ban put in place by Congress and upheld on Friday by the U.S. Supreme court. Consequently, the site told users that it was shutting down in compliance on Sunday but also noted they were hoping to work with Donald Trump to resolve the issue. For Rapaport, TikTok’s seeming demise was all good news. The Prison Break actor jumped to his account to celebrate TikTok’s closure on Sunday, and called the Chinese-affiliated site a “dumphole.” “Say what you want about Elon & Zuckerberg at least we know where to find them,” he said in his caption. “TikTok, au revoir,” he said emphatically in his video. “You did it to yourself, TikTokers,” he added. “You can say what you want about Elon Musk, you can say what you want about [Mark] Zuckerberg,” he continued, “at least we have a face,” he said of X and Facebook’s owners. “At least we have people to complain to, we can tweet at them, we can DM them, we can put our face on wax and scream and yell at them, we don’t know who the fuck has been running this platform [TikTok]. This platform is dirty. This platform is biased. It’s damn near soft porn on here.” “I’ve seen some crazy shit on TikTok. You did it to yourselves, TikTok, you did it to yourself TikTokers!” he exclaimed. “Say what you want about Facebook, Instagram, X, Whatsapp, Snapchat, at least we know who’s running the joint,” he explained. “We don’t know what the fuck and who the fuck is doing what at TikTok. And the vile, antisemitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, soft porn, tits and ass, every fucking five seconds the weirdos, the creeps, the creep cock-suckers — bye bye TikTok, you did it to yourself, if this is signing off, farewell. You know where to find me, I’m on Instagram and X and Facebook.” “See ya later assholes,” he concluded with a beaming grin. Rapaport’s glee may have been a bit premature, though, because only hours after shutting down, TikTok began restorting service after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push out an executive order in the social media outlet’s favor after he is inaugurated.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T19:27:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/19/michael-rapaport-celebrates-the-demise-of-dirty-biased-damn-near-soft-porn-dumphole-tiktok/
German Ambassador Warns Trump Will Undermine 'Constitutional Order',"Germany’s ambassador to the United States reportedly warned that Donald Trump’s incoming administration will undermine “basic democratic principles” and seek a “redefinition of the constitutional order.” While European leaders have been relatively muted in their response to the re-election of Donald Trump, particularly compared to the hysterical reaction to his victory in 2016, the panic has apparently merely been confined to backrooms rather than in public. According to Reuters, a confidential document briefing Berlin on the incoming administration signed by Ambassador to the U.S. Andreas Michaelis warned that the incoming administration would seek “maximum disruption” and usher in “a redefinition of the constitutional order – maximum concentration of power with the president at the expense of Congress and the federal states.” “Basic democratic principles and checks and balances will be largely undermined, the legislature, law enforcement and media will be robbed of their independence and misused as a political arm, Big Tech will be given co-governing power,” the document reportedly added. The ambassador went on to warn that Trump would seek to weaponize the Department of Justice and the FBI against his political enemies and to help facilitate mass deportations. Michaelis suggested that the new administration could go so far as to launch a “military deployment within the country for police activities would be possible in the event of declared ‘insurrection’ and ‘invasion’.” Additionally, the German ambassador pointed to the supposed danger of Trump’s alliance with X owner Elon Musk, who has become a nemesis of the political establishment in Berlin for backing the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the February elections. According to Michaelis, Trump and Musk may seek to enact a “redefinition of the First Amendment,” claiming that they intend to punish non-friendly media outlets. “One is using lawsuits, threatening criminal prosecution and licence revocation, the other is having algorithms manipulated and accounts blocked,” he claimed. It comes as the German Defence Ministry announced this week that it would no longer actively post on X, complaining that “the factual exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult.” Berlin’s Foreign Ministry refused to verify or comment on the leaked document but affirmed that it still considers the United States to be a key ally of Germany. “The Americans chose President Trump in a democratic election. Of course, we will also work closely with the new U.S. administration in the interests of Germany and Europe,” the ministry said . The opinion of the German ambassador may not matter for much longer anyway, with the leftist coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsing the day after Trump’s victory, the governing Social Democrats look set to be removed from office following the February federal elections in Germany.

Dave Chappelle Wishes Trump the Best in ‘SNL’ Monologue: 'The Whole World Is Counting on You',"Dave Chappelle returned to the Saturday Night Live stage clad in a sharp suit, smoking a cigarette, and armed with an array of searing jokes touching on the presidential election, the Los Angeles wildfires, Sean Diddy Combs, and President-elect Donald Trump, whom the veteran comedian wished for success in his second term. “The presidency is no place for petty people. So, Donald Trump, I know you watch the show. Remember, whether people voted for you or not, they’re all counting on you,” Chappelle said, after jokingly saying he knows Mr. Trump watches the show. “Whether they like you or not, they’re all counting on you. The whole world is counting on you.” “I mean this when I say this: Good luck. Please, do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time,” Chappelle continued. “Do not forget your humanity. And please, have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine.” Those were the last lines of his nearly 20-minute monologue. Chappelle started his act by explaining how he initially told SNL creator Lorne Michaels he didn’t want to host the first episode after the election, as he did in 2016 and in 2020. After repeatedly telling Michaels no, Chappelle said he had an epiphany: “You know what? I could just get rid of all these old Trump jokes. I’ll do it!” he said, adding “The moment I said yes, L.A. burst into flames!” Chappelle, who lives in Ohio, one town over from Springfield (more on that later), noted how the deadly L.A. fires broke his heart. He also realized how the negative comments online lambasting the many celebrities who lost their homes reminded him why he hates poor people: “Because they can’t see past their own pain.” “The other day on the news, they said these fires were the most expensive tragedy that ever happened in the United States’ history. I think that’s because people in L.A. have nice stuff. I could burn 40,000 acres in Mississippi for like six or seven dollars,” Chappelle joked. “If you were a rational, thinking person, you’d have to at least consider the possibility that God hates these people.” Chappelle later turned his attention to Trump and his comments about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, last year. “Trump’s a wild guy. He said the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s dogs and cats. I live one town over from Springfield. That’s not what happened in Springfield at all,” Chappelle said. He said he wanted to show his support to the Haitian immigrants to let them know they were welcome. “Every day I’d drive over to Springfield and eat lunch at the Haitian restaurant,” Chappelle said, pausing, “And to be honest with you, I don’t know what that meat was. But whatever it was, it fell right off the bone.” Chappelle said he realized in the worst way why he didn’t know about Diddy’s “Freak Off” orgy parties. “Oh my god, I’m ugly!

Google Defies EU's 'Fact-Checking' Requirements for Search and YouTube,"Google has informed the European Union that it will not integrate work from “fact-checking” organizations into its Search and YouTube platforms, as the EU prepares to expand its disinformation laws. The Verge reports that Google has notified the European Union that it will not comply with the bloc’s upcoming requirements to integrate “fact checking” into its Search and YouTube services. The tech giant’s decision comes as the EU is in the process of formalizing its voluntary disinformation commitments into law under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Google had previously signed the EU’s set of voluntary commitments in 2022, which aimed to reduce the impact of online disinformation. However, in a letter addressed to the European Commission’s content and technology czar Renate Nikolay, Google’s global affairs president Kent Walker stated that the fact-checking requirement “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our services.” Furthermore, Google plans to withdraw from all fact-checking commitments in the Code before the rules become law in the DSA Code of Conduct. The EU’s Code of Practice on Disinformation currently requires signatories to collaborate with fact-checkers in all EU countries, make their work accessible to users in all EU languages, and reduce financial incentives for spreading disinformation on their platforms. The code also mandates companies to simplify the process for users to recognize, understand, and flag disinformation, as well as label political ads and analyze fake accounts, bots, and malicious deep fakes that spread disinformation. However, these commitments are not legally binding at present. Google’s objection to the fact-checking requirements is not entirely unexpected, as the company has not included fact-checking as part of its content moderation practices thus far. In its agreement with the EU, Google had stated that “Search and YouTube will endeavor to reach agreements with fact checking organizations in line with this measure, but services will not have complete control over this process.” While 40 online platforms have signed the code, including Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch, and Meta, the level of commitment to fulfilling the requirements has been inconsistent. Twitter (now X) initially signed the code but withdrew after Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform. The European Fact-Checking Standards Network has also noted that many of the other digital platforms that signed the voluntary disinformation code have been lax in fulfilling their commitments. The EU is currently in discussions with signatories to determine which commitments will be formalized into official rules under the DSA. It remains unclear whether all of the code’s requirements will be included in the final legislation. The European Commission has yet to announce when the code will officially become law, having previously stated that it is expected to come into force by January 2025 “at the earliest.” Read more at the Verge here.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T15:48:17+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/google-defies-eus-fact-checking-requirements-for-search-and-youtube/
Six People Shot in Six Hours in Brandon Johnson's Chicago,"Six people were shot during an approximate six-hour time-frame Saturday night into Sunday morning in Mayor Brandon Johnson’s (D) Chicago. Chicago 32 reported the first two shooting victims were shot and wounded at 9:39 p.m. Saturday and the sixth victim was shot at 3:46 a.m. Sunday. The first two victims–men who are both 37-years-old–were sitting in a vehicle “in the 5800 block of West Madison Street”–when someone opened fire on them then fled the scene. Both men were wounded with non-life-threatening wounds. Just before midnight Saturday, a 25-year-old woman and a man were traveling in a vehicle “in the 2800 block of North Laramie Avenue” when gunshots rang out. Both were shot and wounded, but the injuries are not life-threatening. Roughly two hours later, a 19-year-old was shot and left in serious condition following a verbal altercation with another individual. The altercation occurred in a parking garage “in the 3100 block of North Central Avenue.” At 3:46 a.m. Sunday, a 41-year-old man was also shot following an altercation. He was hospitalized in fair condition. It is January 19, 2025, and 23 people have already been killed this year in Chicago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times .",Breitbart,2025-01-19T15:15:21+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2025/01/19/six-people-shot-in-six-hours-in-brandon-johnsons-chicago/
NYT: L.A. Firefighters Took 20 Minutes to Respond to Palisades Fire,"Firefighters took 20 minutes to respond to the Palisades Fire on January 7, according to the New York Times , confirming what sources have told Breitbart News over the past two weeks about the city’s poor reaction. Breitbart News learned from local neighbors that while there was a fire engine near the origin of the fire, due to a traffic accident, it took 20-25 minutes for a helicopter to arrive at the top of the mountain ridge above Pacific Palisades where the fire began, and 44 minutes for a full response by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters have told Breitbart News that they did not pre-deploy ahead of the fire, despite warnings of extreme winds, due to budget cuts by Mayor Karen Bass and the city council that discouraged the use of overtime pay for pre-deployment. The Times reported Saturday: The [ Times ‘] review showed a series of planning failures, delayed evacuations and significant shortfalls in firefighting resources that together hampered efforts to limit the spread. Fire dispatch transmissions suggest that firefighters did not arrive on scene until about 20 minutes after the first 911 call in Pacific Palisades, a possible missed chance to stamp out the blaze while it was still small, the review showed. Residents are still piecing together evidence about how the fire started. Many believe that it was caused by re-ignition of a burn scar from a fire caused by fireworks set off by hikers on New Year’s Eve, though arson is also a possibility.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:26:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/nyt-l-a-firefighters-took-20-minutes-to-respond-to-palisades-fire/
Millionaires Flee UK in Record Numbers Since Left-Wing Labour's Election Win,"British millionaires are fleeing the country in record numbers since Sir Keir Starmer’s left-wing Labour Party claimed last year’s election win and set out in socialist fashion to try and tax the country into prosperity. Turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses has raised further concerns about Labour’s punitive tax plans while moves to remove the non-domiciled tax regime that allows people to keep non-UK income in a foreign country, in exchange for a fee, is also being blamed. LBC reports some 10,800 people with liquid assets of over $1 million left the country in 2024, an increase of over 150 percent on 2023, in a move predicted not long after Starmer moved into Number 10 Downing Street. A total of 78 centi-millionaires (people with $100 million or more) and 12 billionaires departed the UK last year, according to New World Wealth, a research firm. The news, coming on the back of recent turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses, has raised further concerns about Labour’s push to punish the rich will also hitting farmers, old age pensioners, and everyday taxpayers with a host of penalties. Millionaires are mostly moving to other European countries such as Switzerland and Italy,  as well as to places such as the United Arab Emirates. Labour are getting rid of the non-dom regime from April, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would raise nearly £13 billion over five years. Over 70,000 people with non-dom status lived in the UK in 2023. An intense lobbying campaign from wealth advisors and representatives for non-dom’s ensued in the run-up to the Autumn Budget, where the policy was announced. Experts warned it would lead to a “tidal wave” of departures. David Hawkins, of Foreign Investors for Britain, a group representing non-doms explained the Government’s policy is “a monumental act of national self-harm”. He said : “It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It’s a real worry because more and more people are leaving. And it’s businesses, jobs, investment, spending into the economy and tax take and philanthropy that are hit.” Follow Simon Kent on Twitter: Follow @SunSimonKent or e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:17:50+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/19/millionaires-flee-uk-in-record-numbers-since-left-wing-labours-election-win/
London Mayor Khan Warns of 'Resurgent Fascism' with Trump's Return,"Far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the “spectre of a resurgent fascism” threatens the West with the rise of populists in Europe, tech giants rolling back censorship, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The leftist Labour Party politician, writing for the Observer , the sister paper of the Guardian , likened the growing rejection of neo-liberal globalist policies in Europe and America to the rise of fascism in the “1920s and 1930s”. “The far right is on the march,” Mayor Khan exclaimed. “From Switzerland and Sweden to Hungary, Austria and Italy, European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism.” “In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month’s federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back,” he lamented. The far-left mayor said that the rise of populist parties is “deeply worrying… especially if you’re a member of a minority community.” “We should be in no doubt, this is a perilous moment. The spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the West,” Khan declared. Khan went on to argue that the global left must do more “to inoculate our societies against the virus of far-right populism. History shows us the time to act is now.” A major area of concern cited by the London mayor is social media, which he claimed is “fuelling racist populism and polarisation.” Khan pointed to X owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk, whom he accused of using his social media platform as a “propaganda tool to amplify lies and advance the cause of the far right.” He also lamented the decision by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to remove its so-called fact-checking apparatus in favour of an X-style community notes system, which he claimed was an act of bending the knee to the incoming Trump administration. Khan, who has long advocated using state power to crack down on speech, suggested that countries like the UK should use legislation such as the Online Safety Act to counteract the popularity of populist messages on social media. This act empowers the government to impose hefty fines of up to ten per cent of a large internet firm’s global revenue if it fails to police so-called “harmful content.” The London mayor has been a vocal critic of Trump, demanding in 2017, for example, that the then-president should be barred from having a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II over his supposed use of “ xenophobia, racism, and ‘otherness’ as an electoral tactic ”. Not one to take such accusations lightly, Trump branded Khan a “ stone-cold loser ” for failing to tackle knife crime and terrorism in London.

Failure to Record Ethnicity of Criminals Soars Among British Police Forces,"British police forces have been accused of being afraid of getting called racist as the recording of criminal ethnicity fell to the lowest rate in at least 15 years. According to Ministry of Justice data unearthed in Freedom of Information requests by former Tory minister Neil O’Brien, the percentage of instances in which British police failed to log the ethnicity of child sex offenders stood at 28.7 per cent last year, up from 11.6 per cent in 2010. For sex crimes as a whole, police failed to record the ethnicity of 29 per cent of perpetrators, up from 15 per cent, The Telegraph reported . Similarly, police failed to record the ethnicity of those convicted of murder, rape, and assault resulting in grievous bodily harm in over one in three instances (34.4 per cent) last year, compared to 11.8 per cent in 2010. The trend of listing the ethnicity of criminals as “unknown” was also seen in lower-level crimes, including 44 per cent of robberies last year, up from 14 per cent, and 30.2 per cent for shoplifting, compared to seven per cent in 2010. The MoJ figures showed the most significant increase in drug offences, from an eight per cent failure to record ethnic data in 2010 to 39 per cent in 2024. The failures come despite years of warnings that police forces throughout England had overlooked the scourge of child rape grooming gangs, in which mostly Muslim Pakistani-heritage men sexually preyed upon and trafficked young white girls for fear of appearing racist or stoking ethnic divides. Last week, a national police task force revealed that Pakistanis are up to four times more likely to commit child sexual grooming crimes than the general population. However, even the task force admitted that their figures were “limited” as police forces in England and Wales had only recorded the ethnicities of around a third of suspects. Commenting on the revelations, former Conservative government minister Neil O’Brien surmised that political correctness was to blame for the increasing instances of police not recording the ethnicities of offenders. “It has to be wariness on the part of the authorities about recording and fear of being called racist,” the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston MP said. “We don’t see a big rise in refusal to declare in other services, and the rise across the country is completely inconsistent.” Robert Jenrick, the Conservatives’ shadow justice secretary, demanded that the government provide Parliament with an annual report documenting every convicted offender’s ethnicity, nationality, visa, and asylum status. “The reduction in published data on the ethnicity of convicted criminals, in sharp contrast to data on age or sex, will only fuel perceptions that the British state is covering up the costs of migration,” Jenrick said. “We urgently need all the data so that, for the first time, we can see the actual impact of different types of migration.” While establishment governments of both Labour and the Tories have refused to publish data relating to the criminality of migrant groups in Britain, an analysis conducted last year by The Telegraph found that foreigners were over a quarter more likely to be imprisoned than the native population. The report also found wide disparities among different foreign nationalities, with Albanians being by far the most likely to be imprisoned, at a rate of one in 50, followed by migrants from Kosovo, Vietnam, Algeria, Jamaica, Eritrea, Iraq, and Somalia. On the other hand, Germans were the least likely, followed by Italians, Greeks, Americans, Sri Lankans, French, and Chinese. The findings led to calls for the government to curtail migration from countries which produced higher numbers of migrant criminals.

TikTok Goes Dark for Americans Hours Before Ban Takes Place,"American TikTok users were faced with a message that the app was unavailable Sunday and they would not be able to use it, hours before a ban was set to take effect. “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” a message pops up on the social media app when users in the United States open the app. The message further explains that due to a “law banning TikTok” being enacted in the U.S., Americans are unable to use the app. However, the message continues to praise President-elect Donald Trump for having “indicated that he will work” with TikTok to find “a solution to reinstate TikTok.” “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,” the message on TikTok reads. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” TikTok going dark comes after the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the “sell-or-ban legislation” on the app. Trump has previously expressed that he has a “warm spot” in his heart for TikTok, citing how he “won youth by 34 points” in the presidential election. Trump has also indicated that “TikTok had an impact” on him winning the election and stated his administration would look into it. As Breitbart News’s Alana Mastrangelo previously reported , in December a federal appeals court upheld that required ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to sell the app or face a possible ban in the U.S. During a recent interview with NBC News, Trump revealed that he would “most likely” give TikTok a “90-day extension” to avoid a ban.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T08:51:31+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-goes-dark-for-americans-hours-before-ban-takes-place/

In a statement issued on Saturday, Youngkin ordered the American flag and the flag of the Commonwealth of Virginia “to be flown at full-staff” for Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Youngkin added that the flags would be lowered to half-staff the next day in honor of former President James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr., who passed away in December at the age of 100. Youngkin said in a statement: In accordance with the authority vested in me as Governor and in accordance with federal law 4 U.S.C. § 6(d), I hereby order that the flags of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia are to be flown at full-staff on all state and local buildings and grounds in the Commonwealth in recognition of the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States. “The flags will be lowered back to half-staff the following day to continue honoring former President James Earl Carter, Jr. and remain at half-staff through January 28, 2025,” Youngkin added. “I hereby order that the flags shall be raised at 11 am on Monday, January 20, 2025 and lowered at sunrise on Tuesday, January 21, 2024.” Youngkin joins Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in making announcements that flags in their states would be raised to full-staff for Trump’s inauguration. In December, President Joe Biden ordered the flags to be flown at half-staff for a period of 30 days in honor of Carter: NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R.

I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

Adam Schiff Re-Hires Former Radical Pro-Palestinian Staffer Maher Bitar,"Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has re-hired Maher Bitar, a former White House staffer who spent his student years as a pro-Palestinian radical in Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and played a major role in the Biden administration. Bitar’s new job is confirmed by Legistorm. He also previously worked for Schiff during the first impeachment effort against then-President Donald Trump, who will return to office on Monday. As Breitbart News reported last year: Maher Bitar, the White House Coordinator for Intelligence and Defense Policy at the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), was a radical pro-Palestinian activist and a leader within Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). The SJP is one of the most prominent groups involved in the pro-Hamas, antisemitic “encampment” protests that have taken over dozens of university campuses. Its parent group is also the target of a lawsuit by survivors and families of victims of the October 7 terror attack that alleges SJP is a propaganda front for Hamas in the U.S. In addition, conservative author Daniel Greenfield wrote about Bitar’s record for the Jewish News Syndicate: At the PSM [Palestine Solidarity Movement] conference in Georgetown [in 2006], Bitar had run a session describing how to best demonize Israel. Next year, he facilitated a Palestinian Student Society summit addressed by Joseph Massad , who had called Israel a “Jewish supremacist state” and praised terrorism. … A few years later, Bitar could be found presenting at a Sabeel conference featuring some of the worst bigots like Rebecca Vilkomerson of JVP, who had invited a terrorist to address the BDS hate group, and Richard Falk, who had endorsed a book which wondered whether “Hitler might have been right after all.” … Bitar went to work for UNRWA, interned at the misnamed and militantly anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and studied at Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre, writing papers on the so-called “Nakba” and on “Palestinian” activism. He appeared to describe Israel’s security barrier as a “segregation wall.” Schiff is considered a pro-Israel Senator, by the standards of the Democratic Party, but his reliance on Bitar for advice on national security policy signals a possible shift mirroring the anti-Israel drift of much of the rest of his party.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T03:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/adam-schiff-re-hires-former-radical-pro-palestinian-staffer-maher-bitar/
Youngkin Slams Biden's Clemency of Men Who Killed Police Officer,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) criticized President Joe Biden for granting clemency to “two violent criminals” who killed a police officer, stating that he was “beyond outraged.” In a press release on Saturday, Youngkin stated that what made Biden granting clemency to Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson “even more unconscionable” was that “the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House” against commuting the sentences. Youngkin noted in the press release that “both” men had “admitted to being responsible for the brutal killing of Officer Allen Gibson in Sussex County Circuit Court.” Claiborne and Richardson were “acquitted of the 1998 murder” of Officer Allen Gibson, a Sussex County police officer, according to WRIC News. The outlet noted that while the men were “acquitted by a federal jury,” they ended up receiving “a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge.” However, in an unusual move, they still received a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge. Previously, a legal analyst told 8News that it was a “miscarriage of justice” to cross-reference a charge someone had been acquitted of when sentencing, adding that he had never seen that before. “I am beyond outraged and in utter disbelief that President Biden would announce clemency for Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson—two men who admitted for being responsible to brutally killing Officer Allen Gibson,” Youngkin said in a statement. “What makes this even more unconscionable is the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House not to commute these sentences as they are violent offenders.” “The pain and sorrow this clemency causes the Gibson family is unimaginable,” Youngkin added. “To know that the men who took Officer Gibson’s life will walk free is not just a grave injustice—it is a heartbreaking blow to those who continue to mourn his sacrifice. This is despicable; a grim day for justice and for the families who trust that our system will hold the guilty accountable.” Youngkin’s criticism of Biden commuting the sentences of Claiborne and Richardson came a day after Biden commuted the sentences of almost 2,500 people. As Breitbart News previously reported , in December, Biden issued presidential pardons to 39 Americans who were “convicted of non-violent crimes,” and commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 others.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T02:12:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/glenn-youngkin-slams-bidens-clemency-of-men-who-murdered-va-police-officer-beyond-outraged/
HHS Defunds EcoHealth for Facilitating Gain-of-Function Research,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has cut off all funding and “formally debarred” EcoHealth Alliance Inc. and its former president, Dr. Peter Daszak, after finding evidence that it facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight and violated statutes in its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Evidence was gathered over an eight-month investigation by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in a Friday news release . A letter from HHS states that a five-year “period of debarment for Dr. Daszak is necessary to protect the Federal Government’s business interests,” and confirms that EcoHealth terminated his employment on January 6 of this year. A May 2024 interim report from the coronavirus subcommittee revealed “serious, systemic weaknesses” within NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that “enabled” Daszak to fund “dangerous” gain-of-function research with the the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) with a multi-million dollar federal grant. Then-subcommittee Chair, Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), accused the British doctor of having “blatant contempt for the American people,” calling it “reprehensible”: EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak is not a good steward of U.S. taxpayer dollars and should never again receive funding from the U.S. taxpayer. Dr. Daszak and his organization conducted dangerous gain-of-function research at the WIV, willfully violated the terms of a multi-million-dollar NIH grant, and placed U.S. national security at risk. This blatant contempt for the American people is reprehensible. It is imperative to establish higher standards of oversight at the NIH. The Select Subcommittee’s detailed and comprehensive report today holds Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance accountable and sheds light on severe shortcomings in our public health systems. On top of debarment, the interim report also recommended that Daszak be criminally investigated. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) celebrated the defunding and debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak in a Friday statement: “Justice for the American people was served today. Bad actor EcoHealth Alliance and its corrupt former President, Dr. Peter Daszak, were formally debarred by HHS for using taxpayer funds to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in China,” the Kentucky Republican said in the committee’s press release. “Today’s decision is not only a victory for the U.S. taxpayer, but also for American national security and the safety of citizens worldwide.” “Given that a lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is the most likely origin of COVID-19, EcoHealth and its former President should never again receive a single cent from the U.S. taxpayer,” Comer added. EcoHealth Alliance’s period of debarment is set to end on May 14, 2029, and Daszak’s is set to end six days later, Fox News reported. The medical research firm got nearly $100 million from the U.S. government over the last 15 years, the outlet noted.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T01:21:17+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/18/hhs-defunds-ecohealth-dr-peter-daszak-for-facilitating-dangerous-wuhan-gain-of-function-research/
Georgia 'BLM' Mayor Under Fire for Spending 1.000s of Taxpayer Dollars,"A Georgia mayor who claims to be “America’s first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office” is accused of spending $26,000 of public funds for unauthorized expenses, primarily for international travel. South Fulton Mayor Khalid Kamau has come under fire this week residents and at least one city council member questioned items he allegedly bought with his city-issued purchase card, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Kamau, who boasts of being a “self-proclaimed Elected Activist” and BLM protester on the city’s website , identifies as a “socialist” who was proud to support legislation to “eliminate Columbus Day in favor of Indigenous People’s Day” and to “ban the box” asking city job applicants to disclose their criminal history. When asked if the mayor had made unauthorized purchases, Councilwoman Helen Willis said, “It appears so. Within the last fourth quarter of 2024, it was approximately $26,000.” One of the major purchases was a trip to Africa, she alleged. “It’s a pretty large amount of unauthorized charges, mainly for international travel,” Willis told the Atlanta outlet. Kamau, who was elected in 2017 and goes by “Mayor Kobi” on Instagram for unclear reasons, documented a 20-day trip to Ghana in December on the platform, one disgruntled resident told WSB-TV. One video shared by the mayor on December 22 shows him dancing with a couple of smiling ladies at a popular beach club in the West African nation’s capital of Accra: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mayor Kobi (@kobi.cares) “I wanted to find out if taxpayers paid for this trip,” the resident, Reshard Snellings, told the station. “We should not be asked to go without something so that our elected officials can travel all over the globe.” When asked if the city of South Fulton was conducting any business in Africa, Councilwoman Willis said no. “Not to my knowledge, that isn’t even a priority,” she told the outlet. “We need more economic development here and we don’t need to go to Africa in order for the city to have a multi-business deal.” On top of multiple flight purchases totaling more than $5,000, there was also a $1,300 purchase for a drone and multiple expensive Amazon orders, according to WSB-TV. Councilman Jaceey Sebastian, mayor pro tem, said that Kamau needs to provide an explanation. “There are some things that I see in the public that need some explanation,” he said to Fox 5 Atlanta. Councilwoman Linda Pritchett concurred, saying, “I would like to see the mayor have the opportunity to address the issue transparently.” While international travel is not prohibited for the mayor, using the city card for personal items and services is. The city council ultimately voted to suspend international travel for 30 to 45 days while that statute is reviewed, the local Fox affiliate reported. Kamau has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the accusations are politically motivated. “It’s really a smear campaign. You will see in the meetings, the people who are talking the most are running for mayor in 2025,” the mayor said to WSB-TV. Kamau was arrested at a complete stranger’s home and charged with trespassing and burglary in 2023, after allegedly bypassing a “No Trespassing” sign on a property in the neighboring town of Fairburn and entering a lake house without permission, 11Alive reported.

Former Intel Officials: Tulsi Gabbard Puts Party Loyalty Far Behind Duty to Country,"Former intelligence officials said that Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard has put “party loyalty far behind duty to country.” In the week after his historic election, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Gabbard to serve as director of National Intelligence. “For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,” Trump s aid in a written statement. “I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!” Gabbard thanked Trump on X “for the opportunity to serve as a member of your cabinet to defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people,” adding, “I look forward to getting to work.” Her nomination garnered swift backing from many leaders in the intelligence community. Bernard Hudson, a retired CIA official who was the agency’s chief of counterterrorism, where he oversaw the CIA’s efforts in the Global War on Terror, said in a statement to Breitbart News, “To be successful, a Director of National Intelligence must have two key attributes. One, they need to have the confidence of the President. An intelligence chief without this is going to be a severe disadvantage in trying to carry out their duties. Tulsi Gabbard clearly has the confidence of the incoming Chief Executive. Two, the DNI needs to be willing to speak truth to power, no matter what the personal or political cost to them. This tends to be easier said than done. Tulsi Gabbard has already demonstrated she is willing to pay a steep price for speaking uncomfortable truths. “During her run for the Democratic nomination for President, she demonstrated this time and time again. And she paid a price for it, but it had not deterred her from seeking and speaking the truth. In regards to her experience with the intelligence world, she’s been both a consumer of tactical and strategic intelligence,” he continued. “As a soldier, especially during her combat tour in Iraq, she has seen the value, and sometimes the limitations, of tactical intelligence for the warfighter.” As a member of congress sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was privy to and responsible for understanding and supporting some of the most sensitive and vast global intelligence programs the United States has. Lastly, she is someone who has put party loyalty far behind duty to the country,” the former senior CIA officer concluded in his statement to Breitbart News. “That bipartisan background should help her demonstrate to the American people that the intelligence community she leads is a non-partisan tool that supports the key interests of the United States and its key allies.” Robert C. O’Brien, who served as the 27th U.S. National Security Adviser under Trump, on Sunday wrote an op-ed calling on the Senate to confirm Gabbard and all of Trump’s national security nominees. He explained: Gabbard also has an open mind and the curiosity necessary to evaluate complex and, often, contradictory reports that are commonplace in the Intel World. Her path from congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate to supporting President Trump demonstrates her ability to put country above party and ideology when the facts require courageous action. … In my hours of meetings with Gabbard since her nomination, it is clear why the president selected her to serve as DNI. She listens, she asks questions that go to the heart of the matter being discussed and she is concise and eloquent in sharing her views. She is also unafraid of the IC bureaucracy that she will have to reform and bring into the 21 st Century by rooting out partisanship and introducing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing into both intelligence collection and analysis. On Sunday, Gabbard received the backing of Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee after the nominee said she believes in balancing the need for protecting Americans’ civil liberties and national security. Lankford explained: She’s now coming in and saying, those changes have been done because even since she was in Congress, there have been quite a few changes that we’ve made in Congress to make sure we’re protecting the civil rights of Americans. But when she came out and said, “Hey, this is something I’m going to stand for” – that’s part of the role of the Director of National Intelligence is to make sure we’re actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:25:04+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/former-intel-officials-director-national-intelligence-nominee-tulsi-gabbard-put-party-loyalty-far-behind-duty-to-country/
Poll Shows Post-Election Crash in Public Tolerance for Illegal Migration,"Just 10 percent of Americans oppose President Donald Trump’s promise to deport illegal migrants with criminal records, according to an Ipsos poll for the New York Times . In contrast, 87 percent support the deportations strongly or “somewhat,” so providing a broad consensus for a national enforcement campaign. And just 19 percent of Americans — fewer than one in five — strongly oppose “deporting all immigrants who are here illegally ,” the Ipsos poll also showed. Fifty-six percent support the deportations strongly or somewhat. The post-election collapse of tolerance for illegal migration was spotlighted Saturday when the newspaper posted its early-January poll of 2,128 citizens and residents that confirmed recent polling trends . The broad shift in political opinion — dubbed a “preference cascade” by academics —  was likely caused when Trump’s campaign and November win showed Americans how many other Americans oppose migration. The new numbers will help Trump and his deputies begin the careful, low-drama, and gradual removal of millions of wage-cutting, rent-spiking migrants from U.S. society. A patient and popular enforcement campaign will also help shift the political attention to the even bigger impact of legal migration on Americans. Already, the rising public demand for less legal migration was spotlighted over Christmas when Twitter erupted in a furious debate over white-collar migration via the H-1B visa program. That drama was ignored by the poll but is expected to rise as the nation draws closer to the 2026 election. Pro-migration groups, however, hope the Trump enforcement is chaotic and rushed because any tactical mistakes will help their media allies paint the repatriations as cruel and counterproductive. The newspaper’s coverage of the poll downplays the drama, saying : Many Americans who otherwise dislike President-elect Donald J. Trump share his bleak assessment of the country’s problems and support some of his most contentious prescriptions to fix them, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Ipsos . The new poll includes much evidence that GOP voters are leading Democrats away from their politically disastrous support for the quasi-open borders policies put in place by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration, Cuban-born border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. For example, only 16 percent of Democrats oppose the deportation of criminal migrants, and only 34 percent of Democrats now “strongly” oppose the deportation of “ all immigrants [emphasis added] who are here illegally.” Overall, 55 percent want all migrants to be deported, and 87 percent want crminal migrants to be deported. These numbers — the approaching 20256 midterm elections — help to explain why a critical share of Senate Democrats are expected on Monday to support the Laken Riley bill that would allow the detention of criminal migrants. Similarly, 56 percent said the Mayorkas migration has caused more crime. Just 38 percent — including 63 percent of Democrats, said the migration “doesn’t have much impact on crime.” The poll said that 41 percent of Americans, including 68 percent of GOP voters — say “immigrants today are a burden on our country because they take our jobs, housing and health care.” However, the “forced choice” question did not offer alternative answers, so it prodded 56 percent of respondents to say immigrants “strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents.” There is much evidence that legal and illegal migration makes ordinary Americans poor and less productive . Elsewhere in the poll, Ipsos asked if there were too many or too few legal migrants. Thirty percent said too many, and just 24 percent said too few. But the plurality of 43 percent picked a middle option — “the right number” — likely because the respondents do not know that Biden’s deputies imported roughly one migrant for every American birth since 2021. Other recent polls show less support for migration. A January 5-8 survey by YouGov showed a 34 percent plurality believes legal migration makes the nation “worse off,” and a 41 percent plurality favor cuts or ending legal migration.  Just 17 percent favor additional legal migration. Similarly, a January 8 poll by YouGov showed that 27 percent of Americans want the white-collar H-1B migration program to be reduced or eliminated, while only 17 percent want it increased. Among Republicans, 40 percent want to cut or eliminate the program, while only 12 percent want it to be expanded.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:08:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/18/poll-shows-post-election-crash-in-public-tolerance-for-illegal-migration/
Google CEO to Attend Inauguration After Hosting Party for Left Resistance,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai will attend Monday’s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump after the search giant in November planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to “resist the Republican agenda.” The inauguration will feature many of the most prominent Silicon Valley leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and Google’s Pichai. While other big tech platforms have tried to steer right in the aftermath of Trump’s landslide election, Google reportedly planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those affiliated with the super PAC sought to “resist the Republican agenda.” Breitbart News’s Lucas Nolan wrote : According to an invitation obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Priorities USA will first hold a “digital retrospective” to discuss the role of online campaigning in the 2024 election cycle and strategize ways to “resist the Republican agenda.” Following this meeting, Google will co-host a social hour for the attendees. Priorities USA, which has received substantial funding from billionaire donors such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg, reportedly spent $75 million on digital mobilization efforts to support Harris’s campaign. The timing of the event is particularly notable, as President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Google, accusing the company of rigging its search engine to promote negative stories about him. While Trump has indicated that he may not pursue breaking up Google as a monopoly, he has vowed to take action to ensure that the search engine is “more fair.” A Google spokesperson said that the big tech company will host the happy hour for Priorities USA; however, the spokesman said that the company would not participate in the “digital retrospective” event. “We did not participate in creating the content of the meeting. As they do for large ad buyers on both sides of the aisle, our political sales team will host some drinks after it,” the spokesman said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T21:54:22+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/https-www-breitbart-com-politics-2025-01-18-poll-plurality-either-enthusiastic-or-satisfied-with-next-4-years-of-trump/
Exclusive--Kentucky AG Commissioner: Confirmation of USDA Nominee Brooke Rollins Will Help Make America Healthy Again,"Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said on Breitbart News Saturday that swiftly confirming agriculture secretary nominee Brooke Rollins will aid the Trump administration’s efforts to Make America Healthy Again. Shell spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as nearly two dozen state agricultural commissioners have called for a speedy confirmation of Rollins. “There is no mystery as to why President-elect Donald J. Trump won 433 of the nation’s 444 farming-dependent counties with an average of 77.7% of the vote,” the commissioners wrote in their letter. Shell said that Rollins will have the policy acumen to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one of the largest federal departments. “What I love about her the most is she comes from a policy background, the think tank world,” Shell remarked. Rollins has led many major conservative think tanks, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the Trump-backed America First Policy Institute. “She brings a different perspective that will solidify what we need to move into the future for Kentucky agriculture and American agriculture and our interests abroad,” the Kentucky commissioner wrote. Shell noted that Rollins can help push back against other countries’ unfair trade practices to boost American agriculture and cut “so much red tape” holding back American farmers. He also argued that if President-elect Donald Trump could do “one thing” to aid farmers, it would be to lower gas prices. Shell noted that Rollins could work alongside Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to enact the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. He said that “food is medicine” and that health starts with decentralizing our food system. Shell also noted that schools often do not provide the proper food for America’s school children. “There’s no way to make America Healthy Again without American farming and American agriculture. It starts with the food that we eat,” he explained to Breitbart News Saturday . Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

NYT Exposes 6 People Responsible for Trying to Cover Up Joe Biden's Health,"“Six key people” knew of President Joe Biden’s condition for years and tried to cover it up, the New York Times reported Friday. The establishment media tried for years to help the president appear able to lead the nation, but now that Biden is set to retire from office, some in the media are beginning to expose those who worked behind the scenes to cover up the state of Biden’s health. The six key people who covered up Biden’s health situation were, according to the Times’ Katie Rogers, Adam Entous, Maggie Haberman, and Carl Hulse: First Lady Jill Biden Hunter Biden Mike Donilon, the president’s longtime strategist, Steve Ricchetti, the president’s lawyer Annie Tomasini, the deputy chief of staff Anthony Bernal, the first lady’s most senior aide Many — if not all — of those named in the report still claim Biden is fit to serve. “I mean, today, I think he has a full schedule,” Jill Biden recently told the Washington Post . “He started early with interviews and briefings, and it just keeps going.” “We can get through it,” Ricchetti reportedly told lawmakers about Biden’s health before he stepped aside as a candidate. “We think our allies on the Hill are wrong.” The Times reported on the coverup: The people closest to President Biden were well aware that he had changed. He talked more slowly than he had just a few years before, needed to hoist himself out of his seat in the presidential limousine and walked with a halting gait. … The president’s acknowledgment has put a new spotlight on his family and inner circle, all of whom dismissed concerns from voters and Mr. Biden’s own party that he was too old for the job. And yet they recognized his physical frailty to a greater degree than they have publicly acknowledged. Then they cooperated, according to interviews with more than two dozen aides, allies, lawmakers and donors, to manage his decline. They rearranged meetings to make sure Mr. Biden was in a better mood — a strategy one person close to him described as how aides should handle any president. At times, they delayed sharing information with him, including negative polling data, as they debated the best way to frame it. They surrounded him with aides when he walked from the White House to the waiting presidential helicopter on the South Lawn so that news cameras could not capture his awkward bearing. The Times’s report is corroborated. Biden’s aides successfully covered up his health until he stepped into the spotlight for July’s debate, according to Wall Street Journal interviews with nearly 50 people, including many who had direct knowledge of the operation. Interviews conducted by the Journal reveal Biden’s aides protected the “diminished” president from cabinet members, donors, pollsters, and top Democrat lawmakers, who might have undermined the aides’ directives. Biden’s aides reportedly excluded negative stories about the president in his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign. Those closest to the president took the following actions to cover up Biden’s health, the Journal reported: Adjusted the presidential schedule, starting at the beginning of his term, due to “Biden’s advanced age” Limited Biden’s schedule because he “became tired if meetings went long” causing him to “make mistakes” Told “visitors to keep meetings focused,” including meetings with senior Democrat lawmakers and some cabinet members Excluded negative stories about the president from his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign Implemented greater than normal “controls” over who Biden “spoke with,” what they “said to him” Limited “the sources of information he consumed” Gave Biden great assistance at public events, which was characterized as “hand holding” unlike “other recent presidents have had” Allowed Biden to start his day later in the morning, “since Biden has never been at his best first thing” Handled things in such a way that “[a]t least one cabinet member stopped requesting calls with the president, because it was clear that such requests wouldn’t be welcome” Dictated agency “decisions and expect[ed] cabinet agencies to carry them out” Fielded concerns from cabinet members, who were mostly not allowed to take their concerns directly to the president Tried to protect the president, who “couldn’t recall lines that his team had previously discussed with him” during meetings Prevented the press, donors, and stakeholders in Biden’s campaign from direct contact with the president Often repeated “basic instructions to him, such as where to enter or exit a stage” Looked for a “voice coach to improve the president’s fading warble” Many Republicans believed Biden was in poor health for years. The speculation, based on visual evidence, appeared to be confirmed when Special Counsel Robert Hur characterized Biden in February 2024 as “an elderly man with a poor memory.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T20:46:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/nyt-exposes-six-people-responsible-trying-cover-up-joe-bidens-health/
WaPo Admits Trump 'Already Conquered' Washington Before Inauguration ,"President-elect Donald Trump “already conquered” Washington, DC, before Inauguration Day, the Washington Post ‘s Marianne LeVine , Clara Ence Morse, and Aaron Schaffer admitted Saturday. The report details a “stark contrast to his divisive entry in 2017 and departure in 2021” compared to Trump’s reelection, but it failed to mention the amount of obstacles he overcame to achieve the greatest political comeback in American history. Trump ultimately defeated political opponents who tried to imprison him, bankrupt him, remove him from the ballot, and make him politically irrelevant by introducing a partisan committee to investigate January 6 — and whose inflammatory rhetoric created a ripe environment for two assassination attempts. The omission amplifies the Post’s framing of Trump’s return to Washington: President-elect Donald Trump is returning to Washington triumphant: His legal cases are behind him, corporate executives are flocking to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, his inaugural committee has raised record sums of money for Monday’s ceremony and the Republican Party is now fully in his control. It’s a stark contrast both to his 2017 inauguration — when Trump came to Washington as a political unknown without close personal relationships to his Cabinet or congressional leaders — and to his departure from the Oval Office in January 2021, when he was widely condemned for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Now, many of his Cabinet picks appear poised to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate, including his controversial pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, whose nomination seemed in danger just a month ago. Trump is expected to sign scores of executive orders as he takes office, especially on the border, a central issue of his presidential campaign. He is personally closer to his proposed Cabinet and other top aides compared with eight years ago and is enjoying some of the highest favorability ratings of his political career. Days before coming into office, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that both Trump and President Joe Biden have sought to take credit for. The report did mention how Trump’s polling numbers are high, perhaps as high as they ever have been. A CNN poll found Trump’s approval rating was 48 percent, up from 39 percent just last year. Trump’s imminent return to Washington has caused President Joe Biden to feel “totally dejected,” NBC News reported based on people who recently met with officials. The mood at the White House reflects the state of the Democrat party. The shattered party does not appear to know why Trump won or how to prevent further Democrat defeats. It is in the middle of revamping its nine-year-old talking points that claimed without evidence that Trump and Republicans were racist, bigots, and misogynists. In recent weeks, the bewildered party does not seem equipped to mount a strong resistance to Trump’s cabinet nominees, most of whom appear to be on a glide path to confirmation, although Senate Democrats might try delay tactics, moves that are expected but can be overcome with strong Senate Republican leadership. “It’s hard to reflect, it’s hard for it to sink in that we’re done here — until we’re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,” one White House official told NBC News. “That’s their mood… it hasn’t sunk in for people who are still here yet because we’re working until the last minute.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:55:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2025/01/18/wapo-admits-trump-already-conquered-washington-before-inauguration/
"Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross Attend Pre-Inauguration Crypto Ball -- Both Fantasized About Killing Trump","Rappers Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross appeared at the pre-inauguration “Crypto Ball” on Friday — signaling a change of heart for both rappers after they fantasized about killing President-elect Donald Trump in their music, with Snoop even pretending to point a gun at the then-president in a music video. Snoop Dogg headlined the pro-Trump Crypto Ball event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington D.C., with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in attendance — along with other rappers including Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, according to multiple reports. Video footage from the party has gone viral, showing Snoop Dogg taking the stage to perform a set for the tuxedoed crowd. In a video message , Ross denied he was performing at the event, though he did appear to confirm his attendance saying, “it’s a private ‘vibe’ I’m doing with my brother Snoop Dogg.” However, additional viral footage from Friday’s party showed Ross performing on stage. Snoop Dogg vehemently opposed Trump during his first term in the White House. In 2017, the rapper starred in a politically-charged music video for the single “Lavender” that saw the rapper pull a gun and “shoot” a parody clown version of then-President Donald Trump. Rick Ross also fantasized about the death of Trump. In a music video for his single “Free Enterprise” released in 2016, Ross rapped: “Assassinate Trump like I’m Zimmerman/Now accept these words as they came from Eminem.” The lyrics are an apparent reference to George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Rapper Soulja Boy has publicly opposed Trump, attacking fellow rapper Kanye West during a radio interview in 2019 by questioning his support for the then-president in a profane rant. “You supporting Trump, bruh? What the fuck wrong with you, bruh? That shit not right, bruh,” Soulja Boy erupted on The Breakfast Club. Snoop Dogg signaled a change of heart when it comes to Trump a year ago during a conversation with the U.K. Sunday Times. “Donald Trump? He ain’t done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris,” he told the outlet, later adding: “So I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump.” Friday’s Crypto Ball was a private, four-hour affair, with tickets going for $2,500 and $5,000, according to a report from Coindesk. Other attendees included Trump’s crypto czar pick, David Sacks, as well as tech entrepreneurs Michael Saylor, Brian Armstrong, and the Winklevoss brothers.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:50:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/18/snoop-dogg-rick-ross-attend-pre-inauguration-crypto-ball-both-fantasized-about-killing-trump/
Brad Sherman Criticizes Pacific Palisades Residents Who Returned to Their Homes,"Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) criticized residents of the Pacific Palisades who had returned to their homes without authorization, telling a telephone town hall on Wednesday that they had “ruined” things for other local residents. Sherman was providing information about federal relief funds and fielding questions about when people would be allowed to return to their homes — whether to remove any remaining belongings, or simply to grieve the ruins. The Los Angeles Police Department and the National Guard are currently denying entry to residents in the evacuation zones, and have said that anyone caught violating a 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew in the area will be arrested. He said that while police escorts had been provided for some residents for several days (Jan. 9-11), they had been suspended — and he blamed the fact that some people had tried to return to their homes, often successfully. You’re gonna say, “Well, why not at least let me in to check out my own house?” Um, they were doing that for a while, they didn’t have the resources. And then there’s another problem that I hesitate to mention and that is some people were taken in to look and they stayed, they “de-evacuated” themselves, they walked in their front door and locked it behind them, and, uh, they were not arrested. And so, uh, they kind of ruined it for other people. Of course the research commitment is also very high to, to, to escort people back in. So they’ve got to deal with the toxic chemicals, they’ve got to deal with the safety of the utilities, in order to, uh, uh, I, in order to let people into the fire area. I’m sure we’ll get more questions on that. Sherman’s comments triggered outrage among some residents, who are worried about looting and who have, in some cases, hired private security companies to protect their neighborhoods, or have slipped past police and the National Guard. There are a few residents who have refused to evacuate, preferring to live secretly in their surviving homes without electricity, power, gas, or water rather than to leave. One homeless man, “Eric,” lives openly in the burn zone.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:18:42+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/brad-sherman-criticizes-pacific-palisades-residents-who-returned-to-their-homes/
"Israel Will Release Mass Murderers, Terrorists in Hostage Deal","Israel will release major terrorists, including those who have murdered dozens of civilians, in exchange for the 33 hostages who will be freed by Hamas from captivity in Gaza, where they have been held illegally for 470 days of war. Under the terms of the deal, there will be a ceasefire lasting six weeks (42 days), during which Hamas will free several living hostages once a week, plus twelve hostages in the final week, freeing living hostages before deceased ones. In return, Israel will withdraw partially from Gaza, and will release roughly 1,900 terrorists — including nearly 1200 who were arrested during the war, and more than 700 who were already serving prison sentences in Israeli prisons. While no terrorists who took part in the October 7, 2023, attacks will be released, Israel has agreed to release some terrorists who committed mass murder in past terrorist attacks. For example, according to Israel’s Army Radio, one terrorist who will be released was involved in planning a suicide bombing at the Megiddo junction in northern Israel in 2002, during the second intifada . The attack killed 17 innocent civilians who were simply riding a public bus. The Israeli government said Saturday that authorities would begin notifying families of victims of terror that those involved in the murders of their relatives were about to be released. The ceasefire-and-hostage deal goes into effect on Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. local time in Israel — though there could still be snags. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government will not go through with the deal unless Hamas fulfills its obligation to provide the names of the hostages to be released. The Red Cross is preparing to handle the transfer of hostages, as it did in the last truce, in November 2023, though the international agency has come under criticism for failing to visit the hostages during their captivity, and allowing Hamas to use the releases as propaganda events. Update: Netanyahu addressed his nation on Saturday night, emphasizing that Israel had not given up its military gains in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. He quoted from the Bible, citing Jeremiah 31:16: “And the children shall return to their borders.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:45:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/18/israel-will-release-mass-murderers-terrorists-in-hostage-deal/
Aggressive Driver Shot Numerous Times After Allegedly Chasing Couple,"An aggressive driver was shot numerous times Friday night in Houston, Texas, after allegedly brake-checking, blocking, and chasing a couple riding in another vehicle. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. KHOU reported that the suspect, a man in his 40s, was driving a pickup truck when he allegedly “zeroed in on a car driven by a 20-year-old man.” There was also a pregnant woman in the car with the younger man. The driver allegedly brake-checked the 20-year-old, drove into oncoming traffic to get beside him, and finally, blocked the car’s forward motion, then exited his truck with his hand near his pockets. The 20-year-old feared for himself and for the woman with him and opened fire, hitting the 40-year-old numerous times. Houston Police Department’s Lt. R.

"Exclusive -- Sen. Ron Johnson: 'Most, if Not All' of Trump's Nominees Will Get at Least 50 Votes","Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Wednesday predicted that “most, if not all” of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees will get at least 50 votes in the Senate on Breitbart News Daily . When asked if he believes Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, will get 50 votes, Johnson replied, “Oh, yeah, I think most, if not all, Trump nominees will.” “The default position of Republican senators is this is a convincing election,” he said, explaining that it is presidents who decide who they want in their cabinet, not senators. “Our role is to respect the results of the election and confirm that the people that President Trump wants to surround himself in his administration,” the senator said. “He’s ultimately responsible.” Host Mike Slater pointed to an analysis from the Washington Post that highlighted a number of senators who could potentially vote “no” on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s choice for Health and Human Services Secretary. “Well, what’s interesting is I did sort of the unofficial whip count for Bobby Kennedy early on, and I talked to, I think 41 of my Republican colleagues and 15 Democrats. I think that was my account almost. The conversation was almost identical with everyone. It was started off with, ‘Boy, there’s a lot that I really love that Bobby’s trying to do,’ but they have concerns,” he said, explaining that Kennedy can “easily” alleviate those concerns. “And I think he will, and I think he has, so we’ll see how this goes. I know there will probably be an extensive lobbying effort from all corners of the swamp… because by bringing forward the truth to the political process here, it does threaten people’s business models, I suppose, but that’s what we need,” he said, explaining that the American people “absolutely support getting to the truth of what is causing chronic illness.” LISTEN: Breitbart · Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) – January 15, 2025 “Is there a problem with 80 some doses of childhood vaccines — the schedule? What is the truth about it?

You pay for a scientific research paper, you’re going to get the result you want. Peer review is a joke. It is. It’s also corrupt. Scientific journals are corrupt. They’ve all been corrupted by the money that funds them. So that needs to be exposed, so that we actually get back to true scientific research,” the Wisconsin senator added.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:04:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/exclusive-sen-ron-johnson-most-if-not-all-of-trumps-nominees-will-get-at-least-50-votes/
Poll: Plurality Either 'Enthusiastic' or 'Satisfied' with Next 4 Years of Trump,"A plurality is either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with President-elect Donald Trump leading the country over the next four years, according to the latest weekly survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, “How do you feel about the next 4 years with Donald Trump as president?” Overall, 47 percent are either enthusiastic or satisfied. Of those, 31 percent said they are enthusiastic, and 16 percent are satisfied. Another 31 percent said they are actively upset, and 13 percent are “dissatisfied but not upset.” Another nine percent remain unsure. Predictably, most Democrats — 60 percent — are upset, compared to 31 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans who feel the same. One in five independents said they are enthusiastic, as did 71 percent of Republicans. Only two percent of Democrats feel the same way. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 U.S. citizens. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey comes as the Democrat Party remains in disarray after its loss to Trump — a loss that occurred even after they subverted the will of their voters and coronated Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump instead of President Joe Biden. To their surprise, Trump not only won the election but secured every single swing stat, as well as the popular vote. RELATED — Trump: MAGA Saving, Not Threatening Democracy Biden, 82, still believes that he would have defeated Trump had he remained the Democrat nominee. “Do you believe you could have won in November?” USA Today ‘s Susan Page asked Biden in a January interview. “It’s presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,” he said, referencing polling. However, Biden was not so confident that he would have the “vigor” to serve four more years. “Do you think you would’ve had the vigor to serve another four years in office?” she asked. “I don’t know. That’s why I thought when I first announced, talking to Barack about it, I said I thought I was the person,” he said, adding: I had no intention of running after Beau died – for real, not a joke. And then when Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn’t looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton. But I don’t know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I’m going to be when I’m 86 years old? Trump’s inauguration is less than a week away. So far, the president-elect’s inaugural committee has raised over $170 million, according to reports. As Breitbart News reported , “Trump’s political accounts could reportedly be brimming by the summer of 2025 with as much as $500 million.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:54:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/poll-plurality-either-enthusiastic-or-satisfied-with-next-4-years-of-trump/
Poll: 'Border and Immigration Handling' Identified as Biden's Biggest Failure,"“Border and immigration handling” has been identified as President Joe Biden’s biggest failure, according to a survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, “Which, if any, of the following do you consider to be the biggest failure of Joe Biden’s presidency?” It listed several failures, but a plurality, 23 percent, chose border and immigration handling as Biden’s biggest failure. The high inflation rate came in second place with 17 percent choosing that as Biden’s biggest failure. In third place is Biden’s decision to run for a second term, with eight percent choosing that as the biggest failure of his presidency. Six percent said Biden’s biggest failure is the withdrawal from Afghanistan, six percent said handling the Israel-Hamas conflict, five percent said handling investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, five percent said pardoning Hunter Biden, and four recent said ineffective messaging. Another three percent said his handling of abortion policy, and three percent said the increase of the national debt. One-third of Republicans chose border and immigration handling as Biden’s biggest failure, and 24 percent of independents agreed. Fifteen percent of Democrats said Biden’s decision to run for a second term was his biggest flop. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 respondents. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels “like a morgue” and “glum” as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in. According to NBC News : In the White House, the mood feels “like a morgue,” according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don’t appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said. “He’s totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,” another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump’s impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden’s aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week. The report also cited a White House official who said it is “hard to reflect.” “It’s hard for it to sink in that we’re done here — until we’re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,” the individual added.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:46:50+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/poll-border-and-immigration-handling-identified-as-bidens-biggest-failure/
Outrage over Short Prison Sentences for Grooming Gang Child Rapists,"The British judicial system has come under criticism after eight child rape grooming gang members were given what some feel were light sentences for the abuse and rape of two girls in Keighley in the late 1990s. The West Yorkshire Police revealed Friday that over the past two years, the Bradford Crown Court has sentenced eight members of a grooming gang over the sexual exploitation of two young girls between 1996 and 1999. However, the announcement was mired by what many saw as overly-lenient sentences for child rape, particularly given that most offenders in Britain are released after serving just half their sentences behind bars. This would likely mean that some of those imprisoned by the Bradford court would serve less than two years in prison for raping a child. The police force said that following the first trial, which concluded on October 20th of 2023, five men were jailed, including Amreaz Asghar,47, for four and a half years for rape, Perwaz Asghar, 50, for six and a half years for two indecent assaults,  Mohammed Din, 47, for 14 years for 11 counts of rape, Sajid Mahmood Khan, 45, for three years for rape, and Zehroon Razak, 47, for six and a half years for rape. Following the conclusion of the second trial, which concluded on Friday, a further three men were sentenced, though two were tried in absentia as their whereabouts are currently unknown. The West Yorkshire Police said that Ibrar Hussain, 47, was jailed for six and a half years for two counts of rape. The two men tried in absentia, Fayaz Ahmed, 45, and Imtiaz Ahmed, 61, were sentenced to seven and a half years and nine years in prison, respectively. The two victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 years old during the time of the grooming offences. Mohammed Din was convicted of raping both girls, while the other men were convicted of raping the first victim to come forward to police, which she did as an adult. Responding to the sentences, former detective turned grooming gang whistleblower Maggie Oliver said : “These sentences in this Keighley group rape gang case just beggar belief, again – children of 13/14 raped repeatedly and their rapists will serve HALF these sentences!!!! So 18 months for one of the rapists, just over 2 years for another. “Shocking! Yet again! And I honestly find myself lost for words, and I’ve no doubt the police officers who have put this case together are equally disgusted with these sentences! Disgusting!” Grooming gang victim and activist Sammy Woodhouse added : “The Judges in the UK are sentencing men to 3 years for raping a child. He won’t even serve half of that. Absolutely vile. No wonder there’s so many children being raped in our country.” The British public also appears to want harsher sentencing for grooming gang child rapists. According to a survey published this week by Friderichs Advisory and JL Partners, some 47 per cent of Britons support life sentences for such offenders, while 30 per cent backed the death penalty for grooming gang child rapists. Following the publication of the sentences in Keighley, Detective Chief Inspector Vicky Greenbank of Bradford District Police said: “We welcome the sentences that have been handed down to these men. Cases such as these are incredibly sensitive and complex and it has taken years of painstaking investigation to bring them before the courts. “I would like to take this opportunity to praise both victims for coming forward and reporting these offences to the police. They have both shown immense patience whilst the criminal investigation has been ongoing and courage throughout the court process. “The abuse both girls endured robbed them of their childhood and I hope seeing these men sentenced for these horrendous offences, will give them justice and some closure.” Follow Kurt Zindulka on X: Follow @KurtZindulka or e-mail to: kzindulka@breitbart.com",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:38:25+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/outrage-over-short-sentences-for-grooming-gang-child-rapists/
'Shark Tank' Investor O'Leary Offers $20 Billion Cash to Buy China's TikTok,"Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary is offering $20 billion in cash to buy communist China’s social media platform TikTok. During an interview Friday on Fox News’s America’s Newsroom , O’Leary said , “Right now, $20 billion’s on the table. Cash.” O’Leary said in March that he or another American would buy TikTok to keep it from being shut down, per Breitbart News. He stated at the time, “It [is] not going to get banned. I’m going to buy it. Somebody will buy it. It won’t be Meta and Google. A regulator will stop that. A syndicate will be formed. I’d like to be involved obviously. What I would do is form a bipartisan committee, an advisory committee for 18 months. Go to them and say to them, how much will you let me keep of the Chinese?” There have been strong opinions regarding a potential ban of TikTok as users, who are mostly teenagers and young adults, do not want access interrupted or restricted, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. O’Leary’s recent $20 billion offer comes after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law requiring the company to find a buyer or face being banned, the Fox report continued: In its decision, the Supreme Court backed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a law passed by Congress last April with wide bipartisan support. The law gave TikTok nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services. Congress has voiced concerns about how the app could be used as a weapon or a way to gather massive amounts of data from users. “TikTok, ByteDance and several users of the app swiftly sued to block the ban in May, arguing the legislation would suppress free speech for the millions of Americans who use the platform,” the Fox article reads. “After a lower court upheld the ban, the Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok’s emergency request to either block or pause implementation of the law under a fast-track timeline just nine days before the ban was slated to go into effect,” it said. TikTok will “go dark” when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday unless a deal is made to keep it going, O’Leary said. Meanwhile, TikTok users are reportedly shifting over to another app called Xiaohongshu, or “Little Red Book” as the ban looms, Breitbart News reported on Friday. “Xiaohongshu, which Chinese media is referring to as ‘RedNote’ in an apparent bid to distance it from its Mandarin name – is also controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and is named after all-time murder champion Mao Zedong’s ‘Little Red Book’ of communism,” the article said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:15:58+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-offers-20-billion-cash-buy-chinas-tiktok/
"GOP Rep. Pushes Bill Prohibiting State Bans on Certain Rifles, Shotguns","Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) introduced legislation this week that would prevent states from banning rifles and/or shotguns that are legal federally. The legislation, the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), would operate as a national preemption law, preventing states from banning firearms the federal government has not banned. Moreover, it would undo bans contained in laws like New York’s SAFE Act. Rochester First quoted Tenney. “The SAGA Act nullifies New York’s unconstitutional SAFE Act and prevents other states from enacting laws that violate the Second Amendment,” she said. “This legislation upholds our country’s founding principle of protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans, even from liberal states with anti-gun policies.” The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) reached out to Breitbart News regarding SAGA, noting that the measure is cosponsored by Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and Nick Langworthy (R-NY). CCRKBA chairman Alan Gottlieb pointed to the SAGA Act, noting that it allows “America’s gun owners…[to] put anti-gun lawmakers on notice that we’re tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and that our rights are more important than their ill-advised crusade to disarm law-abiding Americans and erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.” He added, “Millions of people already own these firearms across the country and there is no good reason to penalize them for crimes they didn’t commit, and for merely choosing to exercise a right guaranteed by the Constitution.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T15:43:48+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2025/01/18/gop-rep-introduces-saga-act-if-you-like-your-ar-15-you-can-keep-your-ar-15/
"Wilders: Unlike Trump's America, EU Bigwigs Censor to 'Protect Democracy' from Voters","Next Tuesday, the European Parliament will discuss with the European Commission the “need to enforce the Digital Services Act to protect democracy on social media platforms, including against foreign interference and biased algorithms.” The Digital Services Act (DSA) is the central European Union legislation regulating social media. The EU bigwigs in Brussels are up in arms because Elon Musk had a chat on X with Alice Weidel, leader of the Alternative for Germany. The AfD is an increasingly popular right-wing party which the EU establishment wants to isolate in a cordon sanitaire. According to the European Commission, Ms. Weidel’s chat with Mr. Musk “improperly boosts” her agenda over her political rivals ahead of Germany’s upcoming Feb. 23 elections and constitutes “foreign interference” in the German electoral process. Brussels has also reacted in outrage to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement to end the fact-checking era on Facebook and restore free expression. Zuckerberg regretted that in the past, Facebook had suppressed information, and he confirmed years of systematic online censorship, either on demand of politically biased “fact-checkers” or under direct government pressure. While the American elections were “a cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech,” Mr. Zuckerberg pointed out that Europe has yet to come to the same conclusion. “Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship,” he said. The Meta boss was at once denounced by the European Commission. He is not telling the truth when he says the EU is institutionalizing censorship, European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen whined. It is “not true” and “misleading,” she wailed. At the same time, she took a snipe at Elon Musk for his support of AfD on X, threatening the platform with legal sanctions, saying that X has “obligations under our Digital Services Act and X is supposed to assess and mitigate the risks they are posing to our electoral processes and to civic discourse.” Last December, the presidential elections in Romania were annulled after an outsider had surprisingly won the first round with 23 per cent of the vote. According to the EU bigwigs, this was the result of foreign “disinformation” spread via TikTok and other social media platforms. While the EU’s Digital Service Act (DSA) pays lip service to freedom of speech, it acts as an instrument to restrict freedom of speech and censor social media platforms so that “risks to the electoral processes and civic discourse” are “mitigated”. On these platforms, politicians such as I, who were the victims of media bias, but also every citizen, can freely speak our minds and voice our opinions without “mitigation” by the powers that be. The fact that platforms such as X and Facebook are owned by Americans is used as a xenophobic pretext to add “foreign interference” to “the risks to Europe’s electoral processes and civic discourse.” The EU uses the word “democracy” in the same way as the former Communist dictatorship in East-Germany used to call itself the German “Democratic” Republic. In the infamous G“D”R, “democracy” also needed to be protected against critics who were said to be in cahoots with foreign powers. I am the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), by far the most popular party in the Netherlands. For decades, the PVV and other parties like mine have hardly ever been fairly treated by mainstream journalists. But never did the European Commission voice any concern about how the disinformation about us might “improperly boost” our political adversaries or how it might subvert the “electoral process.” I am not complaining, just pointing out the EU hypocrisy. I am not complaining, because guess what? The scandalous behaviour of the mainstream media had the same effect as water on a duck’s back. It flowed off us. The voters kept coming to us because voters are mature enough to make their own decisions. For decades, we were also the victims of outright censorship by some social media outlets. Parties like mine have been censored online for years. I am one of many like-minded European politicians whose views were banned. Whenever we voiced our opinion on Islamization or mass immigration, so-called fact-checkers had our messages removed as “hate speech”. It happened to me on Twitter — before that company was bought by Elon Musk — and on YouTube. Despite years of social media censorship, however, we kept winning the elections. Voters can feel when they are being lied to. They sense when they are being deceived. They realize well enough that the authorities are deceiving them when social media remains silent about what is happening on the streets of Europe. Indeed, the electorate is mature enough to make their own decisions. Companies like X and Facebook are abandoning censorship. I applaud them for that. The mainstream media say they “sprint to kiss Trump’s ring” and “suck up to the incoming president,” but the decision is plain common sense. Censorship is a costly business and just not worth the effort. The mainstream media refuse to see it, but they are a dying breed. Who cares about what The Guardian writes? Parties such as mine have survived decades of media bias and disinformation; if anything, it has only made us stronger and more popular. Ultimately, we won. This will happen everywhere. Ultimately, freedom and truth will prevail! The only “risk to the electoral processes” that I see in Europe, is the EU “interfering” in elections because Brussels does not like the outcome and claims it has to protect “democracy” against the voters.

Maine Admits Licensing Transnational Criminal Organizations to Grow Marijuana,"Maine’s Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) Director John Hudak told state legislators he is aware that his office has been issuing marijuana grow licenses to persons associated with Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO). On Wednesday, Hudak told members of the state legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee that his agency cannot deny the medical licensing requests. Hudak told the committee members that state statutes did not give his office the authority to deny the licenses to the suspected Transnational Criminal Organizations. Hudak’s statements were made in response to concerns about illegal cannabis cultivation in parts of Maine that are believed to be controlled by Asian Transnational Criminal Organizations, including those with connections to China. Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow, told the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee legislators that individuals associated with the TCOs who have had to grow operations raided by authorities in the past are now using the medicinal license application process to continue their illicit activity and avoid law enforcement scrutiny. Hudak elaborated saying “They’re applying so they can have a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card, or what they perceive as a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card to continue to do the operations that they’re doing.” Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) addressed the issue of foreign criminal organizations operating in her state with FBI Director Christopher Wray during a June FBI budget hearing just days after a Somerset County Sheriff’s Office raid shut down an illegal growing operation that involved 1,500 marijuana plants and more than 30 pounds of processed marijuana. The unlawful growing operation was located adjacent to a daycare. During the hearing, Collins asked Wray, “What is the theory about why Chinese nationals or Chinese Transnational Criminal Organizations are setting up these illegal marijuana growing operations in states like Maine?” Wray responded saying the FBI was actively conducting several investigations into the connections between illegal grow operations and the Chinese government itself. Still, no clear connections had been established at the time. Wray did, however, acknowledge the agency is seeing more ties between the growing operations and Chinese organized crime. As for why the Chinese TCOs are choosing to engage in illicit marijuana cultivation, Wray went on to say, “Our assessment is that it’s a combination of the fact that it is activity that can be done relatively cheaply, and by comparison to other drugs in the United States, the consequences that they face from a legal perspective are not as severe as that they might be in other countries where they might also want to operate.” Collins has spearheaded several efforts to address the issue that she believes is assisting the Chinese TCO’s to launder money for other purposes, including to bring more fentanyl into the country. The latest admission that state licensing officials knowingly provide cover for the illicit growing operations will likely hinder federal efforts to crack down on the foreign TCOs operating within the state.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T14:28:45+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/18/maine-admits-licensing-transnational-criminal-organizations-to-grow-marijuana/
GRAPHIC: Cartel Gunmen Behead Rivals as Mexican Officials Claim Crime Dramatically Lower,"Three days of shootouts led to several dead gunmen and a gory beheading as members of the terrorist organization Cartel Jalisco New Generation continued their push for control of the western state of Michoacan. This escalation in violence comes one day before Mexican government officials talked about how crime has decreased in recent weeks. On Friday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her top security officials held a news conference. During the presentation, they displayed a series of statistics claiming that violence had decreased in states like Sinaloa and Guerrero. They also claimed to have made numerous arrests and seized various weapons, causing noticeable decreases in crime. Hours before the news conference, gunmen from Cartel Jalisco New Generation photographed themselves beheading a rival in the state of Michoacan. The killing came at the end of three days of constant shootouts as CJNG has been pushing into the town of Apatzingan to take over areas controlled by a small cartel called Knights Templar. The latter cartel is allied with a “self-defense” group run by the narco-terrorist Juan Jose “El Abuelo” Farias. As Breitbart Texas first reported last year, several smaller cartels from Michoacan, including Los Viagras, the forces of El Fresa, El Boto, and others, joined forces with CJNG to fight off their rivals. Earlier this year, CJNG and its allies announced that they would be making a push for APatzingan and the surrounding communities and try to push out the Knights Templars. Since then, violence has escalated throughout the state. As Breitbart Texas reported , El Abuelo Farias has a long history of crime in Michoacan and other parts of the country and has been arrested in the past on organized crime and drug trafficking charges. However, in 2018 and other prior cases, Mexican judges ordered his release under suspicious circumstances. For several years, Michoacan has been ground zero to a fierce turf war as various organizations continue to fight for control of lucrative drug production and drug trafficking routes into Mexico.

Ukrainian Police Raid Draft-Dodgers in Nationwide Conscription Searches,"Ukrainian police conducted nationwide raids on draft dodger gangs on Friday as the country battles to generate enough conscripted soldiers to keep its military competitive in the war against Russia without radically widening recruitment criteria. The National Police of Ukraine said they conducted “over 200 searches” of gangs assisting illegal border crossings by adult Ukrainian males, who have been banned from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in 2022. The searches “at the premises of persons involved in illegal transactions” took place in 19 of 27 Ukrainian regions, police said Friday. According to the AFP news agency, the raids against draft dodging-enabling gangs followed searches of 600 addresses last week. In a statement, Ukraine’s police said draft-dodging crimes are “committed through fraud, forgery of documents, unauthorized interference in the operation of electronic registers, and bribery of officials.” Announcing the latest raids, Ukraine’s police published images, including one anonymised picture [top] of officers wearing police and ‘Cyberpolice Department’ patches on their coats accompanying fatigue-wearing armed officers of the national police’s Special Patrol unit. While Ukraine has over a million men in its conscription army, thousands of nationals have evaded call-up orders or registration on the national database. As previously reported in 2023, 20,000 military-aged men were known to have illegally crossed Ukraine’s borders by that point to flee abroad. Ukraine’s border guards said then they had caught another 21,000 at the frontier and brought them back into the country. While many will presumably have fled out of concern for their own lives, attempting to go abroad is not without risks, with the Ukrainian government stating in Spring 2024 that they know of 30 people who died trying to flee the country . A spokesman for the government said those who died had attempted to get out of Ukraine by trying to cross hazardous mountain passes, swimming border rivers, and in some cases, had even been killed by wild animals in the wilderness, presumably bears, which are common in that part of Europe. Some reportedly have frozen to death trying to cross the Carpathian mountains. It is claimed that the recent crackdown on draft dodgers has caused “panic” among those avoiding enlistment and the criminal gangs that support them. Even before this recent change in tactics, military officers in “conscription squads” patrolled the streets of Ukrainian cities, checking the identities of men to ensure they had entered their details in the national database and were not fugitives if call-up papers had been served. In 2024, men were dragged out of a Kyiv nightclub if they were unable to show their identity papers or produce proof of exception from conscription amid overnight raids on restaurants, shops, and music venues. UK broadcaster the BBC noted a wedding of a young Ukrainian couple where half the guests didn’t show up because they were in hiding from conscription and felt turning up was too risky, and noted: “For those avoiding the draft, public transport is now off limits. So, too, are restaurants, supermarkets, and weekend trips to the park to play football.” The broadcaster cited the remarks of one conscription officer who said of the people he was rounding up at train stations: “I don’t consider them men. What are they waiting for? If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes, rape their women, and kill their children.” Those caught dodging can face criminal prosecution. But as reported in the Ukrainian press this week , courts can take a lenient view in rare cases. A Poltava man who was discovered to have been served call-up papers but who had ignored them for a year was let off with one year on probation as the judge noted he has an elderly mother who was dependent on his care, has a young child, and that he had made regular donations of money to the military. Ukraine reduced its minimum age of conscription from 27 to 25 last year, a difficult and unpopular decision the government had resisted in a bid to avoid a post-war demographic crisis by risking the deaths of the country’s generation of future parents. The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is in the 40s. There have been protests in Ukraine by groups of wives, mothers, and children against the fact conscription is open-ended and lasts for the duration of the conflict. Protesters state they want their men back and call for a return of the pre-war standard of an 18-month callup.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T12:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/ukrainian-police-raid-draft-dodgers-in-nationwide-conscription-searches/
W.H.O. Demands World Give It $1.5 Billion to Handle Emergencies,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) launched a campaign on Thursday urging the world to invest $1.5 billion into its emergency fund – a separate pool of money from its regular operations funding intended to address health crises around the world. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus launched the campaign at a press conference on Thursday accompanied by an over 100-page brochure detailing the various global health emergencies the W.H.O. intends to address, focusing heavily on the collapse of a functioning state in Afghanistan, poor conditions caused by Hamas terrorists exploiting health centers to hide fighters and terrorists in Gaza, and the spread of cholera, malaria, and monkeypox (mpox) in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.N. agency predicted that it would have to address 42 health emergencies around the world in 2025. The costly appeal follows years of bad press as a result of the W.H.O.’s poor performance under Director-General Tedros. The W.H.O. was at the forefront of efforts in early 2020 to assure global observers that the highly contagious novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, was not capable of “human-to-human transmission” and later published a report on the origins of the virus so lacking in clarity that Tedros himself condemned it. Scores of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have accused W.H.O. staffers of raping them for forcing them to have sex for much-needed jobs or other humanitarian needs. In 2023, the W.H.O. paid some of the victims $250 and offered them baking classes. Tedros obtained a second term at the helm of the world’s largest public health body in 2022 in an election in which he ran unopposed. The W.H.O. emergency appeal touted the agency’s work in DRC, among other countries, as a prime reason for requesting upwards of a billion dollars in additional funding. The breakdown of how the agency expected to spend that money listed DRC as one of the least expensive crises for 2025, however, using up only about $2 million of the $1.5 billion requested. The most expensive crisis on the list is that in Gaza, labeled as the “occupied Palestinian territory.” The W.H.O. is asking for nearly $300 million to address the situation in the war-torn area controlled by Hamas for nearly two decades. The W.H.O. is also asking for $141 million to offer health care and other aid to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of the Assad family dynasty in December. The ongoing crisis in Sudan, it predicted, would require $135 million to address in 2025. “The climate crisis, increasingly frequent and severe disasters, and unprecedented levels of conflict are jeopardizing health and decimating health systems, making those displaced more susceptible to disease, and disrupting lifesaving, vaccinations and care, particularly for children,” Tedros and W.H.O. Emergencies Director Michael Ryan wrote in a message accompanying the appeal. “We are no longer moving from emergency to recovery but instead enduring rolling crises that extend across years and decades, making health services inaccessible to many,” they continued. “Yet, as the urgent need for assistance grows, the global financial landscape is shrinking, forcing us to make increasingly difficult decisions about whom we can reach and how far we can go.” In a press conference to announce the push, Tedros insisted that health crises in the modern era were “relentless, overlapping, and intensifying.” “Without adequate and sustainable funding we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not,” he noted grimly. The two branded offering funding to the W.H.O. a “powerful act of global solidarity” that could “save lives … uphold the universal right to health, and to help restore peace to communities.” The appeal emphasized that this $1.5 billion is intended for the W.H.O. Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE), not the general pool of funding for the W.H.O. The CFE is distinct from general funding in that it is easier and faster to use those funds and is intended, the agency explained, to “revolutionize how public health emergencies are addressed.” While claiming the funds will be used to address health emergencies explicitly, the appeal’s brochure repeatedly emphasizes the agency’s fixation on “climate change,” declaring it “a health crisis” itself “wreaking havoc on human health, societies, economies, and overwhelming health care systems worldwide.” “Climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, are intensifying disease outbreaks and worsening health inequities,” the W.H.O. claimed. “WHO leads emergency responses and builds resilience in health systems to mitigate these impacts.” The agency also claimed the money would help in the “prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, asserting it would fund “strengthening the prevention of, and response to, genderbased violence, including capacity-building and increased accountability within W.H.O.” This commitment did not specifically address the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in DRC. The W.H.O.’s appeal arrived less than a week before the United States, one of the W.H.O.’s most generous donors historically, welcomes President-elect Donald Trump into the White House once again. Trump famously cut funding and withdrew from the agency in 2020 in response to its catastrophic handling of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, declaring that the W.H.O. “failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable.” Outgoing President Joe Biden reintegrated America into the W.H.O. and restored funding. Multiple reports following Trump’s election in November indicated that the president-elect is planning to withdraw from the W.H.O. “immediately” after taking office.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T04:20:44+00:00,National Security,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/17/w-h-o-demands-world-1-5-billion-emergencies/
Exclusive—Sen. Tim Sheehy Ushers in Bold New Era of MAGA Leadership: ‘This Country Was Not Founded by 65-Year-Old Bureaucrats’,"The United States “was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats” but by patriotic young risk takers, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) explained in a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Marlow opined that officials in President Joe Biden’s administration like Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had “no leadership qualities.” He questioned why the Democrats support these establishment politicians and get “offended” when Republicans support “natural leaders” who are “outside the box thinkers” like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth, who have been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve in his new administration. Sheehy agreed that “leadership matters” and said that the U.S. is dealing with multiple disasters–such as rising inflation and a “wide open border”–because the country is being led by bureaucrats who have “really never done anything else in their” lives outside of politics. “Leadership matters and decisiveness matters, and this country was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats,” Sheehy said. “The signers of the Declaration of Independence, I think the average age of the signers was like 24 years old. I mean, you look at — some of them were 18, 19, 21 years old. Thomas Jefferson was 33… These were young people who had a vision for the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, which is this country.” “It wasn’t 80-year-old, career government bureaucrats who took the risk to craft a new concept of human governance,” he continued. “It was young people who were creative, who had a decisive vision and were willing to take the risk to act on it.” Sheehy added that “in the last 50 years,” the U.S. “drifted away” from having younger political leaders and shifted instead towards having “highly educated, highly qualified, very experienced, bureaucrats to run the government.” “This technocrat concept, which, you know, Obama put that on afterburners and Biden just took it to a whole level further,” Sheehy continued. “This whole technocrat outlook–where we need these people who’ve really never done anything else in their life other than be involved in government policy–and the downfall of that is exactly what we’re seeing. The results are laid bare: Afghanistan disaster; $36 trillion in debt and growing rapidly disaster; wide open border; 20 million illegal immigrants; we have foreign policy crises around the world; rapid inflation; record interest rates.” “Pick a category that’s going well and show it to me, because I don’t think there’s any of them,” Sheehy concluded. “And, we’ve been led there by people who are apparently so highly qualified to be doing it.” The Alex Marlow Show , hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Exclusive—‘No Excuse’: Former Aerial Firefighter Sen. Tim Sheehy Details What CA Got Wrong Ahead of Wildfire Disaster,"There was “no excuse” for California not to be prepared for the wildfires engulfing Los Angeles County, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT), a former aerial firefighter, explained during a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Sheehy detailed the scope of the Los Angeles wildfires, the government’s role in the disaster, and the environmental policies that make firefighting more difficult. Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL who founded the aerial fire fighting company Bridger Aerospace, explained that “the entire wildland fire community” has been sounding the alarm for years that “we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness” in fighting wildfires. Sheehy noted that over the past 18 months there have been increasingly destructive wildfires in states as far-flung as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Texas; and, thus, he argued that there was “no excuse” for California to have been unprepared for a similar situation. “It’s not just me saying it,” he said. “The entire wildland fire community has really been screaming from the rooftops for years that we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness for these types of disasters. Just look at the last 18 months. Lahaina, Maui — remember that was wiped off the map? One hundred people [were] killed. In December and November, we had fires burning in New Jersey. Last year in February, March, we had the Smokehouse Creek fire in Texas, [the] largest fire in Texas history, second largest fire in American history. And then, of course, now we’re seeing literally… L.A. burning to the ground in front of us.” Sheehy added that wildfires were “threats we can prepare for and can fight.” “What we’re seeing in L.A. particularly is the confluence and culmination of decades of wrong-headed policies that have put common sense on the back burner and instead prioritized a bunch of really goofy priorities,” he said. He noted that the wildfires that occurred in California were not a “Pearl Harbor moment where the first time it ever happened, nobody saw it happen.” “This has been happening all the time. I mean, Paradise, California, wiped off the map; Lahaina, Maui, wiped off the map; as I said all the other fires I listed,” Sheehy explained. “This threat is not a one-time out-of-nowhere typhoon. This is something that happens every single year for decades. And there’s no excuse not to be prepared. I think for those in the industry, we were more prepared about 30, 40 years ago. We had a far more supportive environment for what we called full suppression, which is when we basically have a lot of helicopters, a lot of airplanes, a lot of firefighters ready to go.” Sheehy explained that we had been seeing a “massive decrease in suppression preparedness,” and he attributed the decrease in wildfire suppression preparedness to environmentalists who have “taken over” and said, “‘Nope, fighting fire is bad.'” He noted in particular the resistance from environmentalists to the use of water additives in fighting fires. “Every other country in the world that fights wildfire puts foam and gel additives into the water so when they spray the fire, just like a fire extinguisher, the water foams up and is three to six times more effective to suppress that fire,” Sheehy explained. “Every other country in the world does that, except for, ding, ding, ding, America. And, why? Because the environmentalists have said, ‘Nope, those foams could be bad for the endangered goldfish in that pond, so therefore you can’t use that.'” “Two things can be true,” Sheehy added. “We can want to protect our environment and take care of our endangered species. We can also want to protect our communities and protect our people from getting burned alive and their houses burned down. We can do both. Right now, we’ve chosen, instead to prioritize the protection of spotted owls, and trees, and salamanders, and goldfish instead of our communities.” The Alex Marlow Show , hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Elizabeth Warren Accuses Longtime Democrat Donor Sam Altman of Seeking 'Favors' from Trump After $1 Million Inaugural Donation,"Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) in a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accused the tech entrepreneur of wanting “favors” from President-elect Donald Trump after donating $1 million to his inaugural committee; Altman has been a longtime donor to Democrats. “Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats…,” Altman wrote on X, sharing the letter he received from the two Senate Democrats. Altman has confirmed to outlets he plans to attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday. It appears that the two Democrats have accused Altman of seeking some form of a quid-pro-quo scheme. “You have a clear and direct interest in obtaining favors from the incoming administration: your company and many other Big Tech donors are already the subject of ongoing federal investigations and regulatory actions,” Warren and Bennet claimed. The two continued, saying that the “industry’s efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules.” “This would be good for billionaire tech executives, but is bad for America,” they added. Warren and Bennet also said that the donation “raise[s] questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration.” The two Senate Democrats are attacking the OpenAI CEO as many outlets have reported that Altman has overwhelmingly donated to Democrats over Republicans. In one July report, Newsweek wrote that Altman has donated to hundreds of Democrats and just one Republican. Even a cursory glance at federal election databases show that Altman has been a major funder of the Democrat Party. Altman wrote on X that his own donation “was a personal contribution as you state; i am confused about the questions given that my company did not make a decision.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T02:02:37+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/elizabeth-warren-accuses-longtime-democrat-donor-sam-altman-of-seeking-favors-from-trump-after-1-million-inaugural-donation/
First Female Los Angeles Fire Chief Faces Calls to Resign as Blazes Rage On,"Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Chief Kristin Crowley, the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the position, is facing calls to resign as the destructive wildfires rage on in Southern California. Crowley has found herself in an awkward situation with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D), who has also received demands to step down, after she said the city “failed” her department and claimed that budget cuts “limited” their ability to respond to “large-scale events.” The fire chief, who was appointed by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) in 2022, then “disappeared” into a closed-door meeting in Bass’s office last Friday “for so long that they missed an evening news briefing,” the New York Times reported. Sources close to the situation told the Daily Mail that the mayor summoned Crowley to her office to fire her but said, “Whatever happened in that meeting, minds got changed.” “[Crowley] was going into the meeting, telling everybody goodbye, because she was told the whole purpose of the meeting was to fire her,” the source told the U.K. outlet. By the next morning, the Times reported that the chief and the mayor were “projecting a unified front, though the tension was apparent.” “The chief and I are in lock step,” the mayor, who also entered her role in 2022, said. “And if there are differences that we have, we will continue to deal with those in private.” Firefighters are still trying to extinguish the nearly 40,000 acres of active wildfires, which have killed at least 27 people since they began on January 7, NBC News reported. The drama intensified when active and retired LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators wrote a scathing letter demanding that Crowley step down: Arguing that the chief’s statement that the city “failed” her department was “ill-advised” and “poorly timed,” the coalition of unnamed current and former local fire officials concluded that Crowley has “lost the confidence of the Mayor and more importantly you have lost the confidence of many Chief Officers of the LAFD.” The group also claimed in the letter that the controversial chief knew about the LAFD’s budget issues before she entered the role but “went along” with the budget cuts, per NewsNation: Another large portion of criticism directed at the department’s leader stems from the fact that a shift of about 1,000 firefighters were “not on standby” when powerful winds swept through Los Angeles, picking up embers and rapidly spreading the flames, the California Globe reported. There also were not any additional firetrucks positioned in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood — where the initial major blaze sparked last Tuesday — in advance, the outlet noted. “Positioning firefighters and equipment near fire zones in significant numbers well in advance during periods of high wildfire danger has long been a key strategy in the department,” said former LAFD assistant chief and current Redondo Beach Fire Department Chief Patrick Butler. “It’s unfathomable to me how this happened, except for extreme incompetence and no understanding of fire operations,” he said. Los Angeles County pollster Manny Rodriguez told the Globe that he does not see a scenario where both Crowley and Bass “are still in office by the end of 2025.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T01:39:28+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/first-female-los-angeles-fire-chief-facing-calls-resign-blazes-rage/
