ICC Prosecutor Leading Charge Against Israel Meets Syria's Jihadi Overlords,"International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to ""Syrian authorities"" for ""open & constructive discussions"" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a ""caliphate"" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. ""Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,"" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. ""I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have."" The visit was reportedly a "" surprise "" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an ""inclusive"" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. ""We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,"" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that ""people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly."" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. ""HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,"" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. ""The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked."" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. ""He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,"" Saar wrote in a social media message. ""So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are."" ""Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,"" Saar observed.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T20:16:03+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/20/icc-prosecutor-leading-charge-against-israel-meets-syrias-jihadi-overlords/
"Exclusive — Senate Sources: FBI, Senate Democrats Reason for Tulsi Gabbard’s Slow-Walked Confirmation","Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T20:08:56+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/exclusive-senate-sources-fbi-senate-democrats-reason-tulsi-gabbards-slow-walked-confirmation/
Trump: Official U.S. Government Policy Is 'There Are Only Two Genders',"President Donald Trump in his inauguration speech on Monday unequivocally rejected the gender insanity pushed by the Biden administration over the past four years. The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. ""As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,"" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify ""gender identity"" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. ""With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,"" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. ""And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school."" ""And, we will keep men out of women's sports,"" Trump added. ""And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one? Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government, that there are only two genders, male and female.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T19:48:21+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-in-inauguration-speech-official-policy-of-u-s-government-is-there-are-only-two-genders-male-and-female/
Javier Milei Condemns Brazil for Keeping Bolsonaro from Trump Inauguration,"President of Argentina Javier Milei blamed the ""regime"" of Brazilian radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for not allowing conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro to travel to the United States for the inauguration of President Donald Trump. ""He [Bolsonaro] is my friend. I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,"" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged ""coup"" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled ""anti-fake news crusader"" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a ""flight risk"" and that he showed ""indications"" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was ""upset"" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. ""It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,"" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a ""blatant persecution"" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing ""whatever he wants"" with the intention of ""eliminating"" Brazil's right wing. ""Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,"" Bolsonaro said. ""They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world."" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a ""historic partner"" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. ""There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,"" Lula said. On Sunday, Eduardo Bolsonaro published a video on his Instagram account of former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro holding a video call with Jair Bolsonaro while she participated in a dinner on the eve of January 20.

President Donald Trump to Declare National Emergency at Southern Border,"President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border, he announced Monday during his inaugural address in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. ""Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,"" Trump said. ""With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense."" He continued, ""First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country."" Trump will go even further. ""Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,"" he said. ""And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities."" ""As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,"" Trump said. ""We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T19:12:44+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/president-donald-trump-declares-national-emergency-southern-border/
"Trump Promises Release of JFK, RFK, MLK Assassination Records","President Donald Trump vowed during his pre-inauguration speech on Sunday night to release records ""in the coming days"" related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Trump also promised to release records related to ""other topics of great public interest,"" during the event at Washington, DC's Capital One Arena. ""As a first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents, and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other topics of great public interest,"" the 45th and 47th president said. "" It's all going to be released, Uncle Sam,"" he added. Robert F. Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., notably backed Trump's 2024 bid for the presidency, and has been selected by Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). During his campaign, Trump pledged to create a commission on presidential assassination attempts, as a tribute to RFK Jr. ""After I was — can't even believe I have to say this — nearly assassinated in Pennsylvania last month, Bobby called me to express his best wishes. He knows firsthand the risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment,"" Trump said at the time. ""And when you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what's right. You have to do what's right for the country. I'll tell you, we are both in this to do what's right for the country."" Both Kennedy's father and uncle were assassinated. Kennedy's father, Robert F. Kennedy, was shot on June 5, 1968, after winning the Democrat primary in California and died the next day. Kennedy's uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been very vocal in his belief that the CIA was involved in the killing of his uncle, although the agency denies the accusations. ""He lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign, while being denied protection by the Harris-Biden administration,"" Trump said. The Biden administration notably only ordered Secret Service protection for RFK Jr. after the Trump assassination attempt and after Trump demanded protection for him. During his rally on Sunday, Trump additionally promised to sign over 200 executive orders on day one of his administration. ""Every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office,"" Trump said.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T18:59:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-promises-release-jfk-rfk-mlk-assassination-records-coming-days/
President Donald Trump Lights Up Political Class: Election a Mandate to Reverse 'Horrible Betrayal' of Americans,"President Donald Trump's election was a mandate to reverse the ""horrible betrayal"" of America and its values, Trump said in his inauguration speech delivered in the Capitol Rotunda right after taking the oath of office to become the 47th President of the United States. ""From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer,"" Trump said, adding, ""During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first."" Trump promised that the country will be more ""exceptional"" than ever before, lighting up the political class for leaving Americans in the dust over the last four years. ""We must be honest about the challenges we face; while they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing,"" he said, explaining that the U.S. government now faces a ""crisis of trust."" ""For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,"" he continued, noting that the government — as it currently operates — cannot even manage a ""simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.""

Exclusive - Schweizer Rips Biden's Family Pardons: 'An Utter Disgrace',"Former President Joe Biden's pardon of five family members before leaving office ""confirms the deep corruption"" during the past four years, says Peter Schweizer, the president of the Government Accountability Institute and Breitbart Senior Contributor. Receiving clemency raises questions about potential wrongdoing, Schweizer suggested in his immediate reaction to the outgoing president's announcement. The family members pardoned include: James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden. ""This pardon is an utter disgrace. A singular act that confirms the deep corruption he has denied for years.

""My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end."" ""That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,"" he added.

Exclusive – ‘The Schumer Precedent’: Tom Cotton Smashes Senate Democrats for Holding Up Trump Cabinet Confirmations,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, told Breitbart News that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is personally to blame for slow-walking the cabinet confirmations of President Donald Trump. As it stands on inauguration day just before the inauguration, Trump will see only one cabinet confirmation for sure on Jan. 20—the confirmation of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) as his Secretary of State. Despite several other Trump cabinet picks like CIA Director-designate John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary-designate Scott Bessent, Homeland Security Secretary-designate Kristi Noem, and Defense Secretary-designate Pete Hegseth having the votes for confirmation, the Democrats are using Senate floor procedures to slow down final confirmation votes on these people—possibly endangering the American public in so doing. Now, Cotton is speaking out telling Breitbart News exclusively just moments before Trump is sworn in that if Democrats do not cut the shenanigans now, that he will forever into the future apply what he is now calling ""The Schumer Precedent"" to Democrat presidents whereby they get only one Cabinet pick confirmed on Inauguration Day forever. ""Chuck Schumer is playing with fire with these nominations,"" Cotton said. ""If all they allow is Marco Rubio to be confirmed tonight they'll be setting the Schumer Precedent. For as long as I'm in a US Senator, no Democrat POTUS will get more than one day one official confirmed, regardless of resume or merit."" The Senate has held hearings already for the aforementioned Trump Cabinet picks, and several others, but there are several others yet to even get a hearing. For instance, Trump's Director of National Intelligence (DNI) nominee former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii does not even have a hearing scheduled at this point. Conversely, outgoing President Joe Biden had his DNI confirmed on Inauguration Day in 2021. So this new standard that's being created in large part by Senate Democrats and deep state bureaucrats slow-walking Trump's Cabinet picks could seriously hurt future presidents especially Democrats. But more broadly than this new precedent that Schumer is creating, Senate Republicans either need to figure out a way to get around the obstruction and power through it or they will begin facing the wrath of the Trump base which will hold any Cabinet confirmation delays or failures against Senate Republicans.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T18:14:35+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/exclusive-the-schumer-precedent-tom-cotton-smashes-senate-democrats-for-holding-up-trump-cabinet-confirmations/
Leftist Echo Chamber Bluesky Is Plagued by Bots as Trump Takes Office,"Bluesky, the social media platform that became a leftist echo chamber after the election of Donald Trump, is grappling with an influx of bots and impersonation accounts as Trump takes office. Inc. reports that as Bluesky continues to gain traction among leftists seeking an alternative to platforms like X and Threads, the company is grappling with a growing bot problem. The influx of spam accounts and impersonators is a byproduct of the platform's success, but it's leaving many users frustrated and concerned about the future of their social media experience. In recent weeks, Bluesky users have reported an uptick in bot activity, including dupe accounts impersonating real users and porn bots promoting explicit content. Patrick George, a journalist covering the electric vehicle industry, found himself the target of an impersonation bot despite his relatively modest following of 4,000. The bot contacted one of George's sources, attempting to continue a conversation that never took place. While George was able to report the account and have it deactivated, the experience left him unsettled. According to an analysis by Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, 44 percent of the 100 most popular Bluesky accounts have at least one doppelganger, but only 16 percent of those accounts are labeled as impersonators. V.S. Subrahmanian, a computer science professor at Northwestern University, suggests that smaller accounts like George's can be appealing targets for bad actors, as they can more easily embed themselves in the platform and evade detection. Bluesky's bot problem is a testament to its growing prominence in the social media landscape. The platform has seen its user base nearly double from 15 million in mid-November to 27 million currently, largely driven by users fleeing X in the wake of Elon Musk's controversial involvement with Donald Trump's presidential campaign. However, the influx of bots poses a significant challenge for Bluesky, which lacks the financial resources of its competitors. The platform's current verification method, which involves linking one's profile handle to a custom web domain, is somewhat technical and may not be sustainable as the platform grows. Mantzarlis argues that this method is easily replicable by malicious actors, making it an inadequate solution for a platform hoping to compete with Threads and X. As Bluesky navigates this new terrain, it will need to invest more in developing robust systems to identify and combat bot accounts. Subrahmanian suggests that the company must build training sets that look at both bot accounts and benign accounts to more easily distinguish between the two.

Donald Trump to Declare National Energy Emergency to Lower Energy Prices,"President-elect Donald Trump will reportedly declare a national energy emergency to boost American energy production and lower energy prices. Politico wrote that an incoming administration official said that the soon-to-be 47th president will sign a series of executive orders to speed up energy development. ""The rationale for this national energy emergency is that high costs of energy are unnecessary. They are by design. It is a cause of policy. We can address that,"" the official told reporters ahead of Monday's inauguration. In contrast to Trump's planned move, outgoing President Joe Biden used many national emergency declarations, the Defense Production Act, which grants the president wartime powers, to increase production of green energy. The executive orders will likely address developing critical minerals that industries need to manufacture batteries and other high-tech products, which is viewed as a way to reduce reliance on countries such as China. The Trump administration official continued, ""Critical minerals are so crucial to our national security. They are the building blocks of so much of our technology, and that's incorporated within the definition of energy here and energy abundance and the natural resources that these executive orders will unlock again."" The official stated that the moves will also roll back Biden policies to boost green energy and move the country away from fossil fuel development. This includes ending vehicle fuel economy standards, ending energy efficiency mandates on consumer goods such as gas stoves and dishwashers. For instance, one Biden rule sought to require that a majority of new cards sold sold in the U.S. are electric vehicles or hybrids by 2032. Democrats, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) have argued that America is in a clean energy ""arms race"" with China; Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent noted that China is projected to build 100 coal fired plants this year. He explained. Sen. Wyden, just so we can frame this for everyone in the room, China will build a 100 new coal plants this year. There is not a clean energy race, there is an energy race. China will build ten nuclear plants this year, that is not solar. I am in favor of building more nuclear plants and I would note that the IRA, as scored by the CBO, is wildly out of control of spending on the upside. Trump has said he aims to cut gasoline prices during his first year in office. ""The president is taking these actions as soon as possible here on day one so that we can lower prices as soon as possible for the American people,"" the official remarked.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T17:53:28+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-to-declare-national-energy-emergency-to-lower-energy-prices/
Donald Trump to End 'Birthright Citizenship' via Executive Order,"President Donald Trump will issue an Executive Order ending the awarding of birthright citizenship to the children of illegal migrants, administration officials said. The citizenship order will face years of legal fights before it is reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The rule would not apply to children born before the rule is confirmed. If upheld, the change would sharply reduce the government-created incentives for migrants to sneak into Americans' society and it would help Americans build their own families. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that in 2024 migrants gave birth to almost 400,000 "" anchor babies "" — the term used to describe the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens and other foreign nationals. The decision to birth a child in the United States is rational for foreigners and their children — and is good for progressives' goal of imposed diversity. But the process drains the value of citizenship held by Americans. The Washington Post reported : Trump will issue other executive orders that will ramp up deportations, restart border wall construction and send U.S. troops to patrol the 2,000-mile boundary with Mexico, said the incoming official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules for a call with reporters set by the incoming administration. After Trump is inaugurated, he plans to declare a national emergency at the southern border. Trump will then issue orders to restart the "" Remain in Mexico "" policy of his first term, designate drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, and suspend refugee resettlement in the United States for at least four months, officials said, reading a list of Inauguration Day actions and orders. ... Trump's rapid-fire decrees have been crafted to immediately put immigration advocates and other opponents on their heels, his aides say. They view his November win as a mandate to order sweeping changes to the U.S. immigration system and said the record influx of unlawful crossings in the first three years of the Biden administration demands bold action. Roughly 3.6 million children are born in the United States each year. The birth rate is declining partly because immigraiton flatlines salaries and drives up housing prices, making it doubly difficult for couples to have all the children they would like to. In general, Democrats — and most business lobbies — favor policies that help import migrants over policies that help American families.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T17:46:49+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/20/donald-trump-to-end-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/
Trump Saves the Whales: Plans End to Disastrous Northeast Offshore Wind Farms,"Multiple reports over the weekend indicated that President-elect Donald Trump is promising near-immediate action to shut down offshore wind farm projects throughout the Northeast United States, which were widely unpopular with locals who feared the industrialization of their natural shorelines and environmental destruction. The administration of outgoing President Joe Biden had prioritized funding and support for offshore wind projects during its four years in power, including major wind farm subsidies in the so-called ""Inflation Reduction Act"" and relying on leftist governors in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts to back the projects. The projects attracted loud opposition from local tourism industries and environmentalists, who noted a significant increase in the number of washed-up whale carcasses along the shoreline as sonar work began off the Northeast coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has rejected the alleged links between whale deaths and offshore wind development, but many prominent local political leaders have rejected the denials on the grounds that they were offered with little detail. NOAA blames the increased number of whale deaths oh an ""unusual mortality event"" that began in 2016, shortly before the development of America's first offshore wind farm, the Block Island Wind Farm off of Rhode Island. The Associated Press confirmed on Friday with Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), one of the most vocal opponents of offshore wind farms in New Jersey, that President-elect Trump had asked for his help in drafting an executive order to stop offshore wind projects. ""I said 'Mr. President, we need to move on this.' He said, 'Yeah, we definitely do. I agree. I'm against them,' "" Van Drew told the Associated Press. ""He said, 'Write an executive order, get it to my people.'"" Van Drew indicated that his draft was meant as more of a first draft to begin the discussion on the executive order than a text that would be replicated verbatim. The Congressman said that he had already written his draft and sent it to Trump's choice to be Secretary of the Interior, former North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The Interior Department is home to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which is in charge of approving offshore wind projects. Rep. Van Drew was among the most prominent lawmakers opposing wind projects. ""It's going to hurt fishing, hurt our environment, hurt tourism, and just in general I don't see any good in it except that for those people who want to gain something from it, there's a lot of money floating around,"" Rep. Van Drew told Breitbart News in March 2023. ""There's been few things in my career — and I've spanned from being a mayor to what used to be called a freeholder, a county commissioner, to state senate state assembly,"" Van Drew emphasized, ""I don't know if there's anything that has truly in my heart, and I mean this, bothered me as much as this does. I'm really worried about it."" On Sunday, New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra confirmed on social media that he had spoken to Burgum while attending a pre-inaugural event in Washington, DC. Kanitra, formerly the mayor of the coastal community of Point Pleasant Beach, said he discussed offshore wind with Burgum for 20 minutes. ""My fellow offshore wind warriors will be very happy to hear that he told me directly that no new wind farms will be built off New Jersey's coast during the Trump Administration!!!"" Kanitra wrote. ""So sorry to break this news to all the international corporations that were trying to industrialize our ocean and destroy the Jersey Shore, but you guys might as well start packing up now."" Spoke to incoming Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum last night for 20 minutes at the America First Policy... Posted by Assemblyman Paul Kanitra on Sunday, January 19, 2025 Other disparate reports have also indicated that Trump will move swiftly to shut down offshore wind farm development, a move celebrated by some environmentalists who prioritize saving marine life over the reduced carbon emissions that wind development offers compared to more conventional energy sources. In apparent anticipation of Trump's halt in offshore development, BOEM reportedly approved one more offshore wind project in the last days of the Biden administration. The agency offered a final approval to a project known as ""Mayflower Wind,"" expected to be built off the coasts of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts, which would ""grandfather"" in the project. In the event that Burgum halts future projects, those already approved are more likely to be completed. Reports that Trump's administration will not be friendly to wind development preceded the news that some companies would withdraw from offshore wind projects. On Sunday, the Boston Herald reported that the Italian company Prysmian Group announced it would no longer invest in a $300 million offshore wind project in Somerset, Massachusetts, though it did not name Trump as a factor in its decision. ""Prysmian is continuously evaluating market opportunities for our capacity to be aligned with demand,"" the company announced, ""to best serve our customers' needs and to also carry out efficient and timely investments."" ""As a result of the consideration, including the strong growth opportunities in the U.S. and global cable markets, Prysmian has decided to not proceed with the purchase of the land in Somerset,"" it concluded. Opposition to offshore wind development skyrocketed in New Jersey in 2023 following a large number of whales, including dolphins, washing up on the sands of multiple boardwalks, shocking local families attempting to enjoy the traditional activities available there. Point Pleasant Beach, under former mayor Kanitra and represented by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) in Congress, became a focal point of protest, holding a ""Save the Whales"" rally in February 2023. ""The commercial fishing is extremely upset with the visual observations of dead whales floating at sea,"" Brick Wenzel, Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey's, fishing liaison and a longtime commercial fisherman, told Breitbart News in March 2023. ""One vessel said they had seen 3 different whales in one trip. Another had parts of a whale come up in their net. Most of the captains are generational fishers and are in their 60s — No one has heard of or seen anything like the carnage being witnessed."" ""In my 50+ years of working on the ocean, I have never seen anything remotely like this,"" Captain Robert Bogan of the Gambler , a party fishing boat in front of Point Pleasant Beach, wrote in a letter to Rep. Smith he shared with Breitbart News in August 2023. ""Dead whales on our beach absolutely and logically have everything to do with the oceanic geo-surveys."" ""NOAA was so concerned about slowing our boats down to less than 10 knots (basically a crawl), so as not to strike a whale and yet they signed-off on these invasive surveys, and admitted there would be an 'acceptable' whale mortality involved,"" he continued. ""Now, they don't want to admit there was any mortality coinciding with wind research."" ""Ocean Wind I and II,"" the projects that prompted the protest in Point Pleasant Beach, were canceled in November 2023. The Danish company Ørsted, responsible for the projects, withdrew citing inflation skyrocketing under the Biden administration. ""Macroeconomic factors have changed dramatically over a short period of time, with high inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain bottlenecks impacting our long-term capital investments,"" Ørsted Group EVP and CEO Americas David Hardy said in a statement. ""As a result, we have no choice but to cease development of Ocean Wind 1 and Ocean Wind 2.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:35:14+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2025/01/20/trump-saves-the-whales-plans-end-to-disastrous-northeast-offshore-wind-farms/
Joe Biden Pardons 5 Family Members Involved in Family Business,"President Joe Biden grants clemency to family members deeply involved in the Biden family business, including brothers James and Frank Biden. Receiving clemency raises questions about potential wrongdoing. ""My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end."" ""That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,"" he added. ""The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense."" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer asked attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, to investigate and prosecute James Biden for allegedly making false statements to Congress, according to a letter obtained by Breitbart News. James is a member of the Biden family business. Many of his interactions with the business are below, as Breitbart News reported: During Comer's probe into the family, he found a $200,000 check from Americore, a company that allegedly defrauded Medicare, which landed in Joe Biden's bank account via James Biden. James Biden denied the check was due to a preexisting business relationship. He claimed the money was a return payment for money Joe Biden lent him. Comer then requested the alleged ""loan documents"" the Biden brothers might have consummated, but the White House stonewalled the request. Comer also subpoenaed James's Lion-Hall Group and JBBSR, Inc., entities. The subpoena appeared directed at obtaining records linked to Joe Biden's corporation, ""CelticCapri Corp,"" which received nearly $10 million in 2017 without specifying revenue line items. James was also business partners with CEFC China Energy Co., an organization closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), Comer discovered that Biden associate Rob Walker received a $3 million wire transfer from CEFC. In turn, four Biden family members — Hunter, James, Hallie, and an unidentified ""Biden"" — received a collective $1.3 million cut from the $3 million wire transfer. Frank Biden, Joe Biden's youngest brother, was ""hired by the Illinois-based industrial manufacturing firm Federal Signal Corp. to help connect the company with Florida lawmakers,"" the Wall Street Journal reported . ""During a weekly call, Frank Biden, 69 years old, would frequently interrupt the meeting and say he had to take a call from 'the Big Guy,' as he put it."" Breitbart News reported on Valerie Biden Owens involvement in the family business: Valerie Biden Owens, the sister of former vice president Joe Biden (D), who served as the campaign manager for his past presidential campaigns, directed $2.5 million from ""Citizens for Biden"" and ""Biden for President Inc."" to her own consulting firm during her brother's 2008 presidential bid alone, Breitbart senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer's investigative blockbuster Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite reveals.

"Big Tech Titans Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Pichai Seated by Elon Musk at Trump Inauguration","The leaders of the influential tech platforms in the world are attending President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration after donating millions of dollars to his inauguration committee. Silicon Valley leaders, many of whom established the most censorious practices on their respective platforms, are attending Trump's inauguration to become the 47th president. They join prominent Trump adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in taking a place of honor at the inauguration. The list includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim cook, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Other prominent tech leaders attending include TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, OpenAI boss Sam Altman, and Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi. Many of these big tech companies and their chief executives including Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, have donated millions of dollars to Trump's inaugural committee. Several of these tech companies have started pivoting away from their onerous fact-check regimes in favor of prioritizing free speech. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in early January major changers to his platforms' content moderation policies and practices on Facebook and Instagram, including scrapping Facebook's third-party ""fact-check"" system known for its leftist bias. Zuckerberg also announced that the recent election of Donald Trump serves as a ""cultural tipping point"" towards prioritizing free speech over curbing alleged misinformation or hate speech. Meta also eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and will instead focus on hiring regardless of one's immutable characteristics. Google said it would not add fact checks to its search results or YouTube video in Europe, flouting an EU law that requires tech giants to use fact checkers. However, as Pichai is attending Monday's inauguration, it seems that the search giant has not fully pivoted towards Trump . Sundar Pichai of Google and Elon Musk cheer Donald Trump (Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty) Google, in the aftermath of Trump's historic election, planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to ""resist the Republican agenda.""

Mexican Government Downplays Cartel Shootout that Triggered U.S. Consular Warning,"Mexican government officials tried to downplay a large-scale cartel shootout in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, that went on for hours. The shootout triggered a security warning from the U.S. consulate in that city. The shootouts occurred on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning throughout Nuevo Laredo. The shootouts started on the western side of the city when a convoy of Mexican army soldiers was carrying out a series of security patrols and encountered a group of gunmen from the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas. The soldiers tried to intercept the gunmen, who began shooting as additional gunmen began to mobilize throughout the city, setting up roadblocks and providing extra support. At the same time, the military forces fought back and called for backup. The fighting soon spread throughout the city, prompting the U.S. Consulate General in Nuevo Laredo to send a security warning and ask all its employees to shelter in place. The shelter-in-place order lasted for approximately 8 hours as gunmen and soldiers chased each other throughout the city. In the aftermath of the shootout, Jorge Cuellar, the security spokesman for the Tamaulipas government, claimed that only three individuals had been injured in the ""isolated event"" and that no fatalities had resulted. The claims by the bureaucrat are false as internal communications within Tamaulipas law enforcement, as well as within Mexico's military, point to at least three dead gunmen and several arrests. As Breitbart Texas has reported , Cuellar has a history of suppressing information about the violence in Tamaulipas and going as far as lying to claim that the state is safe. He is the same public official who claimed that the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros was wrong for issuing a travel alert over kidnappings in passenger buses near the border city of Reynosa.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T16:53:06+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/20/mexican-government-tries-to-downplay-cartel-shootout-that-u-s-triggered-consular-warning/

Sen. John Fetterman Arrives at Inauguration in Hoodie and Shorts,"Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) arrived at the inauguration Monday in his classic fit — a hoodie and shorts — despite the freezing temperatures in the nation's capital. All eyes were therefore not just on Melania Trump's stunning outfit. Fetterman happily showed off gray shorts and a black Carhartt hoodie for this momentous occasion of the swearing in of President-elect Trump for his second term. The fashion choice comes as D.C. fights freezing temperatures, with a high of 28° and wind chills even lower. Because of that, the swearing-in ceremony has been moved to inside the Capitol Rotunda. Trump made this announcement in a January 17 Truth Social post: January 20th cannot come fast enough! Everybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen. It is my obligation to protect the People of our Country but, before we even begin, we have to think of the Inauguration itself. The weather forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!). Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda, as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985, also because of very cold weather. The various Dignitaries and Guests will be brought into the Capitol. This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience! ""We will open Capital One Arena on Monday for LIVE viewing of this Historic event, and to host the Presidential Parade. I will join the crowd at Capital One, after my Swearing In,"" Trump added, noting that ""All other events will remain the same..."" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) attends the Inauguration of Donald J.

Steve Bannon: Mark Zuckerberg Is a Criminal that Can't Be Trusted,"In a fiery interview on ABC's This Week , former Trump adviser Steve Bannon accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of being a criminal and called for his prosecution over the infamous ""Zuckerbuck"" donations made during the 2020 presidential election. The Hill reports that Steve Bannon recently launched a scathing attack on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an interview with Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week . Bannon accused Zuckerberg of being a criminal and pushed for his prosecution over donations made through his company during the 2020 presidential election. The heated exchange took place as Karl and Bannon discussed Monday's inauguration, where several tech moguls, including Zuckerberg, are set to receive prime seats . Bannon claimed that Trump had ""broken the oligarchs"" and forced them to ""surrender."" When asked if he believed in Zuckerberg's ""conversion,"" Bannon responded with a resounding ""Absolutely not,"" before labeling the Meta founder a ""criminal."" Bannon's accusations stem from ""Zuckerbucks"" — the many millions of dollars Zuckerberg poured into a nonprofit that distributed funds to election boards in 2020. While Zuckerberg claimed the contributions were intended to be non-partisan, Republicans have accused the organization of unfairly distributing the money to benefit leftists. Bannon called for a systematic adjudication of the matter, either through the House or a grand jury led by a special prosecutor. He clarified that he was not directly calling for the Justice Department, under President-elect Trump, to prosecute Zuckerberg. Instead, he suggested that the House should investigate first, and if they are not prepared to do so, a special counsel should be set up to examine the 2020 election seriously. This is not the first time Bannon has heavily criticized the Meta CEO. Earlier last week, he stated that Zuckerberg ""can't be trusted."" Bannon also expressed his belief that Zuckerberg will ""flip on us in the second"" when it becomes convenient for him. The accusations come amid a series of events that have raised eyebrows regarding Zuckerberg's relationship with the incoming administration. The Meta CEO is set to host a black-tie reception on January 20, following Trump's inauguration. Additionally, Zuckerberg has recently attended meetings with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, made a $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural fund, and swiftly ended Meta's heavily biased fact-checking program.

Former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards Dies of Brain Cancer,"Former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards died on Monday at the age of 67 after battling brain cancer. Her family confirmed her death in a statement, saying she passed away at home ""surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie."" ""Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,"" they said, according to NPR. Richards, daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards (D), revealed in January of 2024 she was living with brain cancer, but vowed to continue her fight for abortion while battling her illness. She had been diagnosed in mid-2023 with an incurable and aggressive ailment called glioblastoma. Richards oversaw nearly four million abortions while leading Planned Parenthood for 12 years, between 2006 and 2018, according to Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. During that time, she massively grew the organization, with the base of donors and volunteers increasing from three million to 11 million, according to the The Texas Tribune . She also raised more money than at any other point in Planned Parenthood's history and supercharges the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which is the organization's political advocacy arm. Richards was at the helm of the organization when Planned Parenthood was accused of illegally harvesting and selling body parts from aborted babies, although the organization denies the allegations. She stepped down in 2018, and still continued to work as an abortion activist. A few months before her death, outgoing President Joe Biden awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a private ceremony. The Medal of Freedom is given at the discretion of the president to a civilian who has made an ""especially meritorious contribution"" to the United States. ""Today, I had the honor of awarding Cecile Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom. With absolute courage, she fearlessly leads us forward to be the America we say we are – a nation of freedom,"" 82-year-old Biden said in a post to X. ""Through her work to lift up the dignity of workers, defend and advance women's reproductive rights and equality, and mobilize Americans to exercise their power to vote, she has carved an inspiring legacy."" Richards urged women to ""be bold"" in speaking about their abortions — during a speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in 2024, she said women are ""unstoppable"" when they are able to have their unborn babies aborted.

Chip Roy on Biden's Pardons: 'Let’s Call Them All Before Congress',"""The implication is that they needed"" them, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) said of President Joe Biden's eleventh hour preemptive pardons on Monday. Roy called on Congress to ""demand the truth."" Hours before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive presidential pardons of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Retired Gen. Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 Committee, calling them ""dedicated, selfless public servants"" and the ""the lifeblood of our democracy."" ""These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,"" the statement reads in part. Of Fauci Biden stated that he ""saved countless lives by managing the government's response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses,"" crediting him for helping the country ""tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic."" ""The United States is safer and healthier because of him,"" he declared, making no mention of Fauci's constant flip-flopping, his erroneous advice — including but not limited to the made-up social distancing rule, universal masking, and vaccine mandates during the coronavirus pandemic — and his involvement in gain-of-function research. ""Implication is that they needed the pardons... So, let's call them all before Congress and demand the truth,"" Rep. Roy said in reaction to the pardons. ""If they refuse or lie – let's test the constitutional 'reach' of these pardons with regard to their future actions,"" he added. ""Absolutely,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in response to Roy's idea. ""But one of the reasons bureaucrats behave badly in the first place is because Congress has failed to wield its oversight and spending authority effectively,"" he added. Andrew Huff, author of The Truth About Wuhan: How I Uncovered the Biggest Lie in History , told Breitbart News Saturday earlier this month that a pardon of Fauci would incriminate everyone, adding that acceptance of a pardon is ""admission of guilt of the crimes."" ""At best, Dr Fauci is guilty of 25 million counts of negligent criminal homicide,"" Huff explained. ""So they knew that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was a leaky lab, but they allowed the research to go on. They illegally exported the technology. They didn't have the proper safety controls in place from a risk management perspective on the United States side and with the contractors involved with this research,"" Huff said, deeming it all illegal. ""So in U.S. law, if the president issues a pardon to someone, and the person accepts the pardon, it's an admission of guilt of the crimes. And if you look at all the individuals involved with the cover up, the export of this technology, that is a violation of the RICO Act,"" Huff explained. ""And you can use, you know, basically the same kind of criminal process and prosecution that they use against mobsters to go after someone like Anthony Fauci and all his conspirators,"" he continued. ""So even if they pardon Anthony Fauci, if he accepts the pardon, it then incriminates everyone involved in the RICO, and they're all guilty ""So you know, if they go and they pardon Anthony Fauci with a blanket pardon, [if] he accepts it, well, he condemns everyone else in the government who's — who is involved in this operation,"" Huff added.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:54:47+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/chip-roy-biden-preemptive-pardons-fauci-january-6-committee-members-lets-call-them-all-before-congress-demand-truth/
Eight Die in Nursing Home Arson Believed to Have Been Set by Resident,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) – Eight people died Monday in a fire at a home for older people on the outskirts of the Serbian capital, Belgrade, that is suspected of being set by a resident, officials said. Seven others were injured in the blaze that erupted around 3:30 a.m. in Barajevo, a municipality on the southern edge of Belgrade, state RTS television reported. ""Emergency crews reacted swiftly ... but unfortunately the fire had already flared up and eight people lost their lives,"" said Serbian Social Care Minister Nemanja Starovic. Police said in a statement that 30 people were in the home when the fire broke out. They said the fire engulfed over a third of the care facility, which is located in a house in a rural area. The suspected cause of the fire was arson, police said. The state prosecutor's office said an investigation is still underway but that initial indications suggest that one of the residents who died in the fire had started it. The injured were transferred to two hospitals in Belgrade, RTS said. At least one person was in serious condition, doctors said. ""This is a huge tragedy, but it could have been even worse,"" RTS quoted emergency sector officer Luka Causic as saying.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:52:16+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/eight-die-in-nursing-home-arson-believed-to-have-been-set-by-resident/
Farage Says 'Gigantic Cover Up': Southport Killer Rudakubana Guilty,"Rwandan heritage teen Axel Rudakubana unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges including the murder of three young girls and terrorism related offences at the first day of his trial on Monday, prompting Nigel Farage to again express concerns about the coverups he says surrounds the deadly Southport attack. There will be no trial of 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana after he unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges put before him in Liverpool Crown Court. The plan had been for the trial proper to begin on Tuesday morning, meaning the families of the deceased were not in court to hear the surprise plea at this morning's preparatory hearing. Rudakubana responded ""guilty"" when three charges of murder, ten of attempted murder, one of possessing a knife, one of producing a biological toxin, and one of possessing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. He has admitted killing six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar. Most of his other victims cannot be named due to their right to privacy as children, but two of the ten victims of attempted murder were adults, a dance teacher who shielded the children from his blows, and a local businessman who ran to their aid. Rudakubana will appear in court again on January 23rd for sentencing. The Judge, Mr Justice Goose, told Rudakubana in court this morning it would be ""inevitable"" that a life sentence would be imposed. Speaking outside the court a spokesman for the Criminal Prosecution Service said the attack was a ""meticulously planned rampage"" and that Rudakubana is a ""young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence. He has shown no signs of remorse."" While Rudakubana will certainly now go to prison, many questions over the attack remain. Indeed, as acknowledged by UK state broadcaster the BBC answers to the mystery of his motivations may now never be answered. They stated: ""Some answers may have emerged from the trial – or they may not. Now, after Axel Rudakubana's guilty pleas this morning, there will be no trial."" British Member of Parliament and leader of the Reform UK Party and the decades-long Brexit movement Nigel Farage, who has previously expressed serious concerns that his absolute right to freedom of speech as a parliamentarian had been curtailed over this case, again expressed concern over a cover-up on those issues as the news of a guilty plea emerged today. Speaking from Washington D.C., where he is to attend the inauguration of once and future President Donald Trump today, Mr Farage told The Daily Telegraph : ""I was pretty certain from what I had been told very early on that this was a terrorist-related attack. I wanted to ask questions in Parliament about what the authorities knew about this man, but my rights of parliamentary privilege were taken away and I was not allowed to say anything, which is extraordinary. I wasn't even allowed to ask any questions in Parliament, and the suggestion that it was because of ongoing court proceedings is completely wrong. This reflects very badly on the Prime Minister."" Mr Farage said it is his understanding that there has been ""a gigantic cover up from day one"" but refuse still to classify the attack as terrorist for political reasons. Adding to Mr Farage's positions was the revelation from the Press Association that while police discovered Rudakubana's attempts to create biological warfare agent Ricin and his Al-Qaeda training manual within days of the attack, these details weren't made public for several months. Mr Farage has previously asserted this delay, which is now officially known, existed and had possibly been a deliberate move as part of the government's management of the public's feelings about the mass stabbing of young children. Farage said the riots that followed the stabbing last year were not suppressed in any way by government censorship, but rather had been fuelled by the information vacuum created by Downing Street. ""What really led to the riots was the withholding of information... The public are capable of absorbing the truth about terrorist attacks, we have had them before without them causing riots"", he said, stating there had not been riots after terror attacks such as the Westminster Bridge attack where the facts were made public quickly. Also made public for the first time today are new details about Rudakubana's school days and his activity in the weeks leading up to the killings. While it is emphasises by the Press Association that these facts have not been proven, it is at least claimed that Rudakubana had said he was ""racially"" bullied at school and carried a knife in the classroom for self-defence. It is stated he was excluded from school for the knife, and staff at other schools he subsequently was enrolled in — although in one case his attendance was recorded as just one per cent — expressed concern about his violence towards others. Rudakubana returned to his former school once and attacked someone there with a hockey stick, allegedly a ""a former bully or someone he had a grievance with"". He attempted to return to the school again just a week before the Southport stabbings but was restrained by his father, it is stated.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:33:51+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/farage-says-gigantic-cover-up-southport-killer-rudakubana-guilty/
Cartel-Connected Human Smuggler Sent to Prison for Kidnapping Texas Teen,"A cartel-connected human smuggler will spend 20 years in prison for the ransom kidnapping of a Texas teen at the hands of the Gulf Cartel in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Sixto Gonzalez Jr. went before Chief U.S. District Judge Randy Crane, who sentenced him to 20 years in prison for the charge of hostage-taking. Gonzalez, a previously convicted human smuggler with known ties to the Gulf Cartel, had pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2023. According to court documents and information released by the U.S. Attorney's Office, on June 19, 2021, the smuggler lured a 19-year-old teenage male from Alamo, Texas, to go with him to the Mexican city of Reynosa for a job opportunity. When the two got to a house in that city, other men were waiting for them and tied up the victim before beating him. The men demanded $5,000 and a weapon in exchange for his release. As a way to pressure the victim's family, the suspects sent a video of them using a wooden board to strike the victim in the buttocks area. Known as a ""tabliza"" or paddling, the practice is a common torture method used by the Gulf Cartel in Tamaulipas. In the video, the men used the board to repeatedly beat the victim until it broke. At the time, FBI agents worked with Tamaulipas state authorities, who were able to locate the house where the cartel gunmen had the victim and rescue him. At the time of the rescue, authorities claimed the victim was restrained with zip ties and had multiple bruises. Court records revealed that while in federal custody, on May 17, 2022, Gonzalez and two other men tried to bribe a correctional officer at the East Hidalgo Detention Center.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:25:08+00:00,Border / Cartel Chronicles,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/20/cartel-connected-human-smuggler-sent-to-prison-for-kidnapping-texas-teen/
"Texas Crackdown on Illegal Migrants Nets 50,000 Criminal Arrests, Reduced Crossings","Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is touting the success of the Lone Star State's crackdown on illegal migration he says has curtailed activity of the dangerous Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and resulted in 50,000 criminal arrests. Abbott says that since ""Operation Lonestar"" was launched in 2021, Texas officials and participants in several other states have led to the apprehension of more than 530,400 illegal aliens, 42,900 criminal arrests, and more than 42,900 felony charges, Fox News reported. RELATED: Officer Catches, Arrests Colorado Driver for Human Smuggling ""Our top priority is the safety and security of Texans, including against the growing threat of Tren de Aragua,"" Abbott said in a January 10 post on X. ""We will not allow this gang to operate or gain a foothold in Texas."" Abbott's office also reported ""Operation Lonestar"" interdicted more than 620 million lethal doses of fentanyl, ""enough to kill every man, woman, and child in the United States, Mexico, and Canada combined."" The operation and its subsequent initiatives reportedly cost the state $11 billion, but all of that budget was dedicated to keeping Texans safe, rooting out crime, and putting a cap on the activities of dangerous gangs including Tren de Aragua. ""Because of these efforts, Texas has decreased illegal crossings into the state by 87%,"" said Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris.

Chicagoans Siding with Trump's Illegal Alien Deportation Plans,"Media outlets have reported Donald Trump's plan to focus on Chicago as a launching pad to begin his promised efforts to round up and deport illegal aliens. While city officials have been plotting ways to hamper that effort, many Windy City voters and citizens are rising up to support the move. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the incoming Trump administration is ""planning a large-scale immigration raid in Chicago"" set to launch sometime during the third week of January after Trump's inauguration. ""The raid is expected to begin on Tuesday morning, a day after Trump is inaugurated, and will last all week, the people said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will send between 100 and 200 officers to carry out the operation,"" the WSJ reported . The Associated Press added that Trump officials have a list of more than 300 violent criminal illegals that they intend to round up and prepare for deportation back to their native countries. Indeed, incoming Trump border czar Tom Homan has given Chicago and Mayor Brandon Johnson a stark warning, saying , ""We're going to start right here in Chicago, Illinois. And if the Chicago mayor doesn't want to help, he can step aside. But if he impedes us, if he knowingly harbors or conceals an illegal alien, I will prosecute him."" RELATED — ""You Work for Me!"" Trump's New Border Czar Doesn't Put Up with Democrat Nonsense Meanwhile, the city council is lining up to work against efforts by the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin rounding up criminal illegals to begin shipping them back to where they belong. Just last week an amendment to weaken the city's policy preventing the Chicago Police Department from working with the feds was defeated by a large margin. More than three quarters of the city's 50 aldermen voted against an amendment introduced by alderman Raymond Lopez and alderwoman Silvana Tabares to allow the CPD to work with ICE to identify and deport illegal aliens convicted of various violent crimes. Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the vote to maintain the city's sanctuary city policies, and said, ""Our job is to make sure that people are protected and safe. That is the top priority of any government, and that's what we're going to do."" He added that efforts to roll back protections for criminals ""was just stoking the flames of fear."" ""The people of Chicago can rest assured that the full force of government will do everything in its power to protect the residents of this city,"" the self-professed ""progressive"" mayor insisted. Despite Johnson's claims that Chicagoans are happy that he is making sure they are ""safe,"" many of his own constituents have been railing against his generous and expensive support for criminal illegals. Chicago city hall meetings have become raucous events as citizens have routinely filled the gallery sections to protest Johnson's continuing efforts redirect budget money and city resources away from black communities and to the tens of thousands of illegal aliens that have flooded the city at his repeated invitation. In November, voters surged into city hall to protest Johnson's plan to sharply raise taxes so that he could spend the money on illegals. Johnson ended up losing his bid for higher taxes in that round of budget negotiations. But the protests over his policies have come in waves. In a later city hall meeting, Johnson even cleared the room to prevent the citizen protesters from being heard as he continued to push more spending on illegal migrants. Several weeks before all this, Chicagoans were even heard urging incoming Trump border czar Tom Homan to arrest Mayor Johnson for his efforts to hamper deportation of criminal illegals. Similar incidents have been cropping up since 2023 as citizens have risen up to mount protests over Johnson's fealty to illegals over his own citizens. The protests and conflict have taken a toll on Johnson's approval ratings and he now ranks as one of the nation's least popular big city mayors. A Change Research poll from November, for instance, found that 75 percent of Chicago voters disapprove of Johnson's work as mayor. And another poll taken that same month by Urban City Action and M3 Strategies, found that 60 percent view Johnson unfavorably and his favorable rating was a lowly 28 percent. Johnson now ranks as the most unpopular mayor in modern Chicago history, National Review reported in October.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:29:40+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/20/chicagoans-siding-with-trumps-illegal-alien-deportation-plans/
"Poland Focusses on Security, Russian 'Hybrid Attacks'","POLOWCE, Poland (AP) – Poland's six-month presidency of the European Union is firmly focused on security. As Europe ́s biggest land war in decades rages, fewer places highlight the challenges and contradictions of defending the bloc and its values more starkly than the border with Belarus. Some 13,000 border guards and soldiers protect around 400 kilometers (250 miles) of border. It ́s become a buffer zone since Belarus ́ ally, Russia, invaded neighboring Ukraine three years ago. Similar fortifications farther north line Poland's frontier with the Russian region of Kaliningrad. Poland is Ukraine ́s top logistical backer. Most of the Western-supplied arms, ammunition and equipment helping to keep Ukraine ́s armed forces afloat transit through. Russia, meanwhile, uses Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion. At the border near the town of Polowce, a 5.5-meter (18-foot) steel barrier strung with razor wire and topped by security cameras separates once-friendly communities that war has turned into wary rivals. Drones, helicopters and armored vehicles keep watch. The border crossing is closed. Around 40 border guards and troops could be seen on Jan. 16, when the Polish EU presidency invited 60 reporters from international media to witness the security effort. The road was strewn with layers of concrete obstacles and concertina wire likely to dissuade an advancing army. Border guards peered into Belarus. It ́s needed, the government in Warsaw says, because Russia and Belarus are waging a particular kind of hybrid warfare: helping groups of migrants – mostly from Africa or the Middle East – to break through the border to provoke and destabilize Poland and the rest of Europe. ""We have tightened our visa policy, and above all we have decided to suspend the right to asylum wherever we are dealing with mass border crossings organized by Belarus and Russia,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Friday. Almost 30,000 attempted border crossings were spotted last year. Most are young men, often from Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Polish authorities say they arrive in Belarus on tourist or student visas and are helped across for a fee ranging from $8,000 to $12,000. Poland says they ́re assisted by the Belarus security services and other ""organizers."" They're mostly Ukrainians, perhaps fallen on hard times since fleeing the war. They can earn $500 for each person they help, border officials say. Border guards claim to be routinely attacked. One guard was killed last year and several injured. They say that migrants shoot slingshots, throw small explosives or rocks, or use pepper spray on guards. More than 400 incidents were recorded last year in this section of the border, with 307 people hospitalized. The deputy commander of the Podlaski border guard division, Col. Andrzej Stasiulewicz, said the migrants are hard to discourage. ""Warning shots don ́t work, so force is needed,"" he said. Reporters were shown video and photos purported to show migrants assailing the border. Stasiulewicz said their actions are ""very unpredictable, and very precise and coordinated."" Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders paints a different picture. The charity says it's treated more than 400 people since November 2022, ""many of them stranded for weeks in uninhabitable forests and exposed to violent practices at the border."" People suffered from exhaustion, hypothermia, dehydration and mental health issues. Last year, it noted ""a sharp increase in people carrying the scars of physical assaults, including bruises and dog bites."" It ́s almost impossible to independently verify such reports. The area is off limits. NGOs and media must apply for a permit to enter. EU and international agencies that work with migrants are not invited either, although migrants are provided with their contact details should they want to complain. Stasiulewicz said those who force their way in ""are sent back to Belarus, which is in line with our legal framework."" The Norwegian Refugee Council, a migrant aid charity, has another take. It said that nearly 9,000 ""violent pushbacks "" have been reported by NGOs in what it describes as ""Europe ́s death zone"" since 2021. Pushbacks – depriving someone who may be in fear for their safety of their right to apply for asylum – are illegal under international law. Polish Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk rejects the pushback allegations. He prefers ""turnbacks."" The rationale is that migrants are obliged to apply for asylum in good faith at open border points, not force their way in. The nearest place they can do that is in Terespol, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Polowce. As far as the Polish authorities are concerned, their methods are working. The number of people arriving in Polowce has dropped significantly. Around 670 people applied for asylum there last year, and none to mid-January. The Office for Foreigners was empty when reporters visited. To keep numbers down, the government intends to suspend asylum applications in times of crisis. A draft law winding its way through parliament would see the border shut for 60 days if Warsaw suspects that migrants are being ""weaponized"" – should they approach the border in large groups, try to intimidate Polish officers or damage border infrastructure. ""If anyone uses violence against the border guards, we close the border,"" Duszczyk said. Doctors Without Borders says this could have ""dramatic consequences."" It ́s urged Poland ""to drastically change course of action"" and do all it can to protect migrants and refugees. But EU leaders signed off on Poland ́s actions at a summit last month. Countries on Europe ́s eastern flank received a greenlight to suspend the right to protection when they believe that Belarus and Russia are "" weaponizing"" migrants. Ultimately, security and migration policies are highly politicized. Tusk has been in power for more than a year but his party ́s candidate in a presidential election in May faces a strong challenge from a nationalist opponent. The EU shifted further right in June after elections to the European Parliament, with nationalists and populists shaking Europe ́s foundations, particularly in major powers France and Germany. Tusk believes that tough migration policy can win back voters. ""If we do not want to hand over these matters to radicals, extremists, populists, we must find the right answers so that no one in the world doubts that democratic states are able to effectively defend themselves against illegal migration,"" he said on Friday. He described the ""tough protection"" of borders as a ""sacred duty."" Poland ́s borders also make up the 27-nation EU ́s external frontier. For Tusk, his country ́s security is Europe ́s security. It's a similar argument made by Hungary's staunchly nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:08:03+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/poland-focusses-on-security-russian-hybrid-attacks-with-rotating-council-of-europe-presidency/
Trump Taps Space Force Vet Fired Under Biden in Parting Gift to AWOL Austin,"President-elect Donald Trump recently announced the appointment of Space Force veteran and former fighter pilot Matthew Lohmeier as Air Force under secretary the same day Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin left the building for the last time. Although the timing may have been a coincidence, the move highlights the massive change about to be ushered in at the Pentagon under incoming Trump administration. Lohmeier was fired from his job as a squadron commander in May 2021 under the Biden administration after he published a book in May of that year criticizing Marxism taking hold in the United States military and discussed it on a podcast. Lohmeier had said on the podcast, ""The diversity, inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we are receiving in the military ... is rooted in critical race theory, which is rooted in Marxism."" Lohmeier's comments put him directly at odds with the Biden administration's focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. He was fired by Space Force Command Commander Lt. Gen. Stephen Whiting — who is still in the position. Current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown was the chief of staff of the Air Force at the time Lohmeier was fired. Biden's defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, made diversity his top priority during the first year of his tenure. He appointed the department's first diversity, equity, and inclusion adviser, stood up a counter-extremism working group that seemed aimed at Trump-supporting conservatives, and eliminated restrictions on transgender individuals serving in the military. He also fired more than 8,000 troops who did not want to take the COVID vaccine — a move that effectively targeted many troops who opposed the vaccine based on religious or personal liberty concerns. Austin in a self-congratulatory move posted on social media of him leaving the building to a ""clap out"" — where Pentagon staff lined the halls as he walked out for the last time as defense secretary. Now, Lohmeier, an Air Force Academy graduate and former fighter pilot, will be in position to undo the woke policies in the Air Force that took root during the Obama administration and festered throughout the military under the radar since then. President Trump announced Lohmeier's appointment on Friday, posting on Truth Social: I am pleased to announce that Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier will be the next United States Under Secretary of the Air Force. Matt is a former fighter pilot, and Space Force Squadron Commander, who has devoted his life to serving our Great Nation. He is a proud graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Matthew will work with the GREAT Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth, to end the devastating ""woke"" policies that have destroyed our Military, and make our Country STRONG AGAIN. Congratulations Matthew! Trump has vowed to fire woke generals, making their fates unclear. Defense Secretary Nominee Pete Hegseth — who is all but certain to be confirmed after locking down the minimum 50 votes in the Senate — said at his confirmation hearing after being asked whether Brown would be removed from his position. ""Every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders,"" he said. Hegseth has said his focus will be on restoring the focus on war fighting skills and standards, and get rid of the woke policies that has eroded the military's readiness.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:07:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-tap-space-force-veteran-fired-under-biden-in-parting-gift-to-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin/
'Vengeful': Euro Media Whips Itself Up For Trump Inauguration,"While Europe's politicians learnt their lesson from 2017 and appear to have decided to play nice in public with the incoming President Trump second term, the continent's legacy media feels no such restraint and morning-of-inauguration coverage is loaded with dire predictions, accusations, and even unfavourable comparisons to dictators. While the top story slots for Europe's newspapers on Monday morning were reserved for the news and images of the Israel hostage deal, as the morning ground on and the clock counted down to Trump-hour these stories were rapidly displaced with inauguration content, with many publications incapable or unwilling of hiding their content for the results of American democracy. In the United Kingdom, The Guardian sets the tone that could immediately be seen in left-liberal newspapers continent-wide, warning of the coming ""Vengeful second term"" and stating ""the United States was bracing for a new era of disruption and division"". Drawing meaning from the plan for Trump to be sworn in under the Capitol rotunda which featured on January 6th, 2021, the paper stated: ""Few imagined then that Trump, twice impeached and now a convicted criminal, would set foot inside the White House again. But over the weekend the 78-year-old revelled in his improbable political comeback with supporters of his Maga (Make America great again) movement."" Reviewing the feeling in Europe as a whole, the paper's Diplomatic editor noted the old continent is more hostile to Trump than most other regions worldwide — citing a recent global poll that found ""European anxiety about Donald Trump's return to the White House is not shared in much of the world"" — and stating: ""the foreboding is great"". Yet in the UK, as elsewhere in Europe, the publishers less aggressively opposed to Trump focussed more on procedure: the history of American presidential inaugurations, what to expect from the day ahead, and the timings of events. National newspaper of record The Times led with Trump's comments from the night before about executive orders and the coming golden age, stating: ""Trump vows to start destroying Biden's legacy within hours"". In France, which has a very well developed left-wing media ecosystem, Libération warns Trump is to be ""Revengeful and more uninhibited than ever"" in their lead, while Le Monde the editor's pick is an op-ed comparing once and future President Trump to Russia's Vladimir Putin. Conservative-leaning newspaper Le Figaro , meanwhile, carries a guest piece by a prominent French lawyer and essayist who states the age of ""democratic, open and universalist"" America is now comprehensively over, and that for the rest of this century the country is to develop ""oligarchic, protectionist and imperial"" characteristics. President Trump thinks and acts ""like Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin or Recep Erdogan"", he declares, stating President Trump is to build ""an imperial America that claims the same principles as the tyrannies and autocratic regimes of the 21st century"". In this view, European states must be content to be vassal states in the new American empire, or the European Union should respond by transforming itself into an imperial power in its own right to ""defend our sovereignty, our freedom and our civilization"". This is not an uncommon point of view in Europe on any day, never mind Trump's inauguration day: to turn the European Union, what was once merely a free trade area, into an armed and active empire is a matter of simple reflex for the progressive and globalist-minded of the continent. It is the default position for many in the capitals of Europe. In Poland, the liberal-leaning Wyborcza takes this view too, stating what doesn't kill Europe (Trump) will only serve to make it stronger (pan-European Federal superstate). Rzeczpospolita meanwhile publishes and absolute laundry list of everything the globalist class hates and fears about Trump, stating its view that while ""Democracy and the rule of law have been the glue of the free world for eighty years"", President Trump is working to ""extinguish the West"". German newspapers are just as blunt. The progressives at Die Tageszeitung (TAZ) refer airily to the Trump government as ""The Horror Clown and His Cabinet of Horrors"" and decry his supporters, as well as fans of Elon Musk, as fools who confuse success with competence, appearing to tacitly imply there is some moral superiority in being a highly technically competent failure.

"Biden Preemptively Pardons Milley, Fauci, and January 6 Committee Members","President Joe Biden preemptively pardoned former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Retired Gen. Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 Committee — with just hours left in his administration. In a statement released Monday morning at 7 a.m. — just several hours before President-Elect Donald Trump's inauguration, the White House issued a statement from Biden touting them ""dedicated, selfless public servants."" He claimed he believed in the rule of law, but said, ""But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing."" House Oversight Committee Republicans reminded Americans that Biden also pardoned his son Hunter Biden — which the outgoing president had told the country he would not do: Joe Biden will be remembered for using his last few weeks in office to shield his son from the law and protect himself. Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) posted: ""Mark Milley might be pardoned but we will continue to explore ways to hold him accountable."" Biden's statement said in full: Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy. Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties. In certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions, including General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, and the members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions. General Milley served our nation for more than 40 years, serving in multiple command and leadership posts and deploying to some of the most dangerous parts of the world to protect and defend democracy. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he guided our Armed Forces through complex global security threats and strengthened our existing alliances while forging new ones. For more than half a century, Dr. Fauci served our country. He saved countless lives by managing the government's response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses. During his tenure as my Chief Medical Advisor, he helped the country tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic. The United States is safer and healthier because of him. On January 6, 2021, American democracy was tested when a mob of insurrectionists attacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn a fair and free election by force and violence. In light of the significance of that day, Congress established the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol to investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes of the insurrection. The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth. Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions. I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing. Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong—and in fact have done the right thing—and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances. That is why I am exercising my authority under the Constitution to pardon General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Members of Congress and staff who served on the Select Committee, and the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the Select Committee. The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:46:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/president-biden-preemptively-pardons-general-milley-anthony-fauci-and-january-6-committee-members/

Pope Francis Debuts on TikTok to Hawk New Autobiography,"ROME — Pope Francis made his debut on TikTok Sunday to promote his new autobiography, written with Italian journalist Carlo Musso for Mondadori. ""I would like to thank Mr. Carlo Musso who had the patience to help me remember so many things about my life,"" the pontiff said on the controversial Chinese social media platform in regard to his book titled Hope: The Autobiography . ""It is an autobiography, but for me autobiographies are to thank God for what he has done with my life,"" he said from the study of his Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. ""Ultimately, the real protagonist is the Lord who took me by the hand and led me forward."" On Sunday evening the pope appeared on Italy's number-one television talk show Che Tempo Che Fa (""What Weather We're Having""), during which he also spoke of his autobiography with host Fabio Fazio. The book ""gives a sense of what I am like,"" Francis said. The pope has suffered criticism from conservatives for doubling down in the autobiography on his decision to ban the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM) in Catholic parishes, specifically lamenting its appeal to the ""younger generations."" The ""rigidity"" of those who prefer the Traditional Latin Mass ""is often accompanied by elegant and costly tailoring, lace, fancy trimmings, rochets. Not a taste for tradition but clerical ostentation, which is none other than an ecclesiastical version of individualism"" the pope declares. ""These ways of dressing up sometimes conceal mental imbalance, emotional deviation, behavioral difficulties,"" he continues. ""Not a return to the sacred but to quite the opposite, to sectarian worldliness,"" he adds. As one review noted , the pope comes close to ""conflating a love of the Old Mass with psychosexual disorder"" and to ""equating liturgical conservatism with effeminacy."" The pope's de facto ban on the TLM was also sharply criticized by a number of high-ranking Catholic prelates, including Cardinal Gerhard Müller, the former chief of the Vatican's doctrinal office (CDF), Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen, and Cardinal Raymond Burke, former head of the Vatican's highest court. Cardinal Müller rebuked Pope Francis for his severe clampdown on the TLM while allowing progressives to reject central tenets of the faith with impunity. Pope Francis has ""drastically restricted"" the celebration of the Latin Mass with the clear intent to ""condemn the Extraordinary Form to extinction in the long run,"" Müller stated. By punishing the conservative peripheries, Francis ""ignores the religious feelings of the (often young) participants in the Masses according to the Missal of John XXIII"" without the ""slightest empathy,"" he wrote. ""Instead of appreciating the smell of the sheep, the shepherd here hits them hard with his crook,"" Müller declared, with an allusion to one of Francis' favorite sayings. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former bishop of Hong Kong, similarly insisted that the measures were unreasonably harsh and hurt ""the hearts of many good people."" The pope's attack on the TLM ""considers the very existence of a parallel rite to be an evil,"" Zen declared, and reflects wishes ""for the death of the [traditional] groups."" Cardinal Burke published an essay bemoaning the pope's attack on conservative Catholics. Those who are attached to the Traditional Latin Mass ""are deeply disheartened by the severity of the discipline"" imposed by Pope Francis in his letter and ""offended by the language it employs to describe them, their attitudes and their conduct,"" Burke wrote. ""It is apparent from the severity of the document,"" Burke said, that Pope Francis issued it ""to address what he perceives to be a grave evil threatening the unity of the Church."" The pope's message to the ""devout faithful who have a deep appreciation and attachment"" to the Traditional Latin Mass is that ""they suffer from an aberration which can be tolerated for a time but must ultimately be eradicated,"" Burke declared.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:09:03+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/pope-francis-debuts-on-tiktok-to-hawk-new-autobiography/
Nelly Says 'It's an Honor' to Perform at Trump's Inauguration in Response to Backlash: 'The Klan Was Created by the Democrats',"Rapper Nelly has defended his decision to perform at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, calling it ""an honor."" Nelly said in an often contentious interview with fellow rapper Willie D that he will be performing at the Liberty Ball on Monday out of respect for the office of the president. ""I'm not doing this for money. I'm doing this 'cause it's an honor. I respect the office,"" Nelly said. ""It don't matter who is in office. The same way that our men and women, our brothers and sisters who protect this country, have to go to war and have to put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office."" ""So, if they can put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office, I can damn sure perform for whoever [is] in office,"" he added. ""I was born on military base in Austin. My father served. My grandfather served. My uncle served. My auntie served. My cousins served. I've entertainment the troops all over the world. Ain't no money in that. That's something that I felt I had to do because I was one of those kids on those military bases, "" Nelly added. Nelly also dismissed the idea of Trump being a white supremacist. ""I would ask them to show me where he's a white supremacist,"" Nelly said. ""The politics, for me, is over. He won! He's the president. He's the commander in chief of what I would like to say is the best country in the world."" ""It is an honor for me to perform for the president of the United States, regardless of who is in office. If President Biden would've asked me to perform, I would've performed. If Vice President Kamala Harris would've won and asked me to perform, I would've performed,"" he added. The Grammy-winner also criticized Biden and Democrats, saying it was racist when Biden told radio host Charlamagne da God ""you ain't black"" if you vote for Trump. The conversation later changed when host Willie D called America a ""Klan country."" ""That was created by the Democrats. The Klan was created by the Democrats,"" Nelly said, a historic point to which Willie D conceded. ""If you tell me this a Klan country. I ask you what party did the Klan come from. All the damage the Klan did, in the 20s, the 30s, the 40s, ... all the damage that they did — but that party — we supposed to forgive all of that damage?"" Country artist Carrie Underwood will also be performing at the event along with Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus and Lee Greenwood. ""I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,"" Underwood said in a statement. ""I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:00:24+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/20/rapper-nelly-defends-performing-at-trumps-inauguration-its-an-honor/
Senior UK Royals Plan Tour of America Under Trump for Soft-Power Push,"Senior members of the British Royal Family are reportedly planning on touring the United States during the incoming Trump administration in a bid to improve relations. According to a report from The Times of London , yet-to-be-named top members of the British Royal Family are starting to plan trips to America as early as 2026. The Labour Party government in the UK of Sir Kier Starmer got off to a rough start with the incoming administration, with the leftist party dispatching operatives and activists to the United States to aid the Kamala Harris campaign. This came on top of a long history of Labour cabinet members frequently disparaging President Trump, including Britain's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who previously described the American leader as a ""woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath"" and a ""dangerous clown"". Even the appointed ambassador to Washington, former Tony Blair communications director Peter 'Prince of Darkness' Mandelson, called President Trump a ""little short of a white nationalist and racist."" However, the Labour Party government, including Lammy and Mandelson, have attempted to soften their rhetoric around Trump as Britain will seek to avoid tariffs and still hopes to ink a post-Brexit trade deal with America. While the leftists that staff the Labour government may not be to the taste of the 47th President, Mr Trump has long been a vocal admirer of the British Royal Family and has often highlighted his own British heritage, with his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump hailing from the Isle of Lewis. Therefore, London may seek to use the Royals as a go-between and as soft-power negotiators to sway Trump once again to elevate the UK-U.S. relationship above others in Europe. According to The Times , Royal trips to America will likely coincide with the 250th anniversary of America's founding, during which President Trump promised year-long festivities. A senior UK government source told the paper: ""Donald Trump has a clear affinity for the royal family. ""He had a great relationship with the late Queen, recently met Prince William and has spoken highly of King Charles. A royal tour to the US would help reinforce the 'special relationship'."" Indeed, Prince William was one of the first international figures to meet with Trump following his re-election, meeting in private with the president-elect on the sidelines of the re-opening of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris last month.

Pope Francis: Trump's Illegal Immigrant Deportation Plan Is a ‘Disgrace’,"ROME — Pope Francis has trolled President-elect Donald Trump on the eve of his inauguration, insisting his plan to deport illegal immigrants from the United States is a ""disgrace."" Appearing on Italian national television Sunday night, the pontiff was asked about Mr. Trump's deportation plan and answered that ""this is not the way to solve things."" During a 49-minute interview, Fabio Fazio, the host of Che Tempo Che Fa (""What Weather We're Having""), recalled that Monday would be the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who has made it known that ""within two days he will begin his program of expulsion of irregular immigrants from the United States."" Asked whether he had spoken to Trump about this, the pope made known that he hasn't spoken with the president-elect since he came to the Vatican in May 2017, suggesting that he had not congratulated him on his election. ""But if it's true, this will be a disgrace, because it makes these poor wretches, who have nothing, pay the price for the imbalance,"" Francis said of the deportation plan. ""This isn't right. This is not the way to solve things."" On January 9, Pope Francis declared that migrants should not be treated as a ""problem to me managed"" but should be ""welcomed"" for their skills and aspirations. ""I find it greatly disheartening to see that migration is still shrouded in a dark cloud of mistrust, rather than being seen as a source of empowerment,"" the pontiff said in his yearly address to members of the diplomatic corps. ""People on the move are seen simply as a problem to be managed,"" he lamented, insisting that they should not be ""treated like objects to be moved about."" Migrants ""have dignity and resources that they can offer to others; they have their own experiences, needs, fears, aspirations, dreams, skills and talents,"" he said. What is needed is an international effort to confront the phenomenon of migration by creating ""safe regular pathways,"" the pope urged. At the same time, the Vatican recently announced the tightening of its own border controls, threatening stiff penalties for anyone entering its territory or violating its airspace without permission. In a recent decree, the Vatican said that violators of its borders will face monetary fines ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 euros and prison sentences from one to four years. Anyone who ""enters the territory of Vatican City State with violence, threat, or deception will be punished with imprisonment from one year to four years and a fine from €10,000.00 to €25,000.00,"" the Italian-language text reads. The document goes on to clarify its understanding of ""deception,"" noting that it includes sneaking into Vatican territory without permission. ""Entry by fraudulent circumvention of the State's security and protection systems or by evading border controls shall be deemed to have occurred 'by deception,'"" the decree elucidates. The Vatican City State is the world's only completely walled-in sovereign territory, whose entry points are manned by members of the Swiss Guard, backed up by armed gendarmes not far away. All but one of the entry points are locked tight from dusk until dawn.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T10:09:33+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/pope-francis-trumps-illegal-immigrant-deportation-plan-is-a-disgrace/
'He's Back' -- TIME Magazine Salutes Donald Trump's Triumphant Return,"Out with the (very) old, in with the new. TIME magazine has saluted President Donald Trump by putting him on the cover of it latest edition in honor of his return to the epicenter of public life in America. Of course, there is no shortage of his supporters who would argue he never really left. Trump is seen clearing President Joe Biden's belongings from the desk in the Oval Office with a single sweep of his arm in the inauguration edition while sending the octogenarian's aviator glasses flying into oblivion at the same time. The image comes with the simple honorific: ""He's Back."" The magazine previewed the new cover in a post on X on Sunday, touting its story titled ""Donald Trump's Disruption is back."" The illustrated TIME cover is the fourth for the magazine by artist Tim O'Brien, who has previously depicted Trump either seated at or floating above the famous resolute desk, as the NY Post notes . The article calls the incoming 47th commander-in-chief ""an unpredictable force for change"" and concedes, ""Whatever one thinks of him, he has altered America in ways unimaginable a decade ago."" In December, the magazine named Trump its annual ""Person of the Year."" That effort drew sneers, disbelief and canceled subscriptions from readers who supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the election a few weeks earlier, as Breitbart News reported .

Historic: Trump Will Be First President to Host Foreign Leaders at Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday will feature multiple heads of foreign governments among the dozens of VIP guests expected to attend, a first in American history. Most of the world leaders expected, many of them already attending events this weekend in Washington, are from the Spanish-speaking Western Hemisphere and are outspoken anti-communist leaders. They will be accompanied by high-level representatives of other countries that will not be sending their presidents, such as Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. The Associated Press confirmed this weekend that Trump's will be the first inauguration ceremony attended by any foreign head of state. The swearing-in ceremony is part of a varied, days-long itinerary of events that began on Saturday with a reception for the president, continued with a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Sunday, and on Monday will feature a parade and the traditional inaugural ball. In between the daytime festivities and the inaugural ball, Trump will have an opportunity to engage in some presidential business. Reports indicate that he is considering signing as many as 200 executive orders on Monday, many to reverse the policies of leftist predecessor Joe Biden. Biden and all other living American presidents – Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush – are expected to attend. The first world leader to meet with Trump after his electoral victory in November, Argentine President Javier Milei, has been touring Washington throughout the weekend and is expected at the inauguration. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, currently running for reelection amid a chaotic gang war, also reportedly accepted the invitation to attend. Paraguayan President Santiago Peña arrived in Washington, DC, this weekend, as well, stating in an interview that the State Department team led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) Trump has assembled is a ""dream come true"" for his country. Trump reportedly invited Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to attend the inauguration; reports remain unclear regarding whether he would attend or not. Bukele has not addressed the invitation in public at press time; he posted a cryptic photo of himself on social media on Sunday night that led to further inconclusive speculation about his attendance. Outside of Latin America, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, often described as an ideological ally to Trump, has confirmed that she is planning to attend the inauguration. Reports indicate that President-elect Trump also invited genocidal dictator Xi Jinping to attend the ceremony and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Both declined, but Xi sent his vice president, Han, who will be the highest ranking Chinese official in history to attend an American inauguration. Xi also held a phone call with Trump on Friday that the president-elect said was ""very good"" and would ""solve many problems."" Modi dispatched his top diplomat, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, who was also seen out and about in Washington this weekend meeting with other inauguration guests. Jaishankar held a meeting on Sunday with his Australian and Japanese counterparts, the foreign ministers Penny Wong and Takeshi Iwaya respectively, which he described only vaguely as featuring a ""discussion on the state of the world."" On the guest list but unable to attend is another prominent conservative leader in the Western Hemisphere: Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro and Trump maintained an extraordinarily friendly relationship when both were in office and, Bolsonaro recently noted, share the bond of both surviving assassination attempts. Bolsonaro is facing several legal cases at home in Brazil that have resulted in the socialist government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva seizing his passport, branding him a ""flight risk."" Bolsonaro requested a special approval to travel to the United States for the inauguration, noting that he left the country to attend Milei's inauguration in 2023, but the Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) rejected his requests on the grounds that the email invitation he received was somehow insufficient proof he was invited. Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker in Brazil, is expected to attend the inauguration and spent the weekend meeting with Milei and other conservative leaders in anticipation of the event. Other prominent conservative leaders from around the world are expected to be in attendance, including longtime Trump ally Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom and the head of the populist Spanish party Vox, Santiago Abascal. Abascal shared an ebullient moment at a pre-inauguration event with Milei, who elbowed through a crowd to embrace him. Trump ended the last day before his second term in office with what many believe could be his last political rally in Washington, DC – an event to thank supporters and celebrate the electoral victory a final time. In his remarks on Sunday, Trump promised supporters they were ""going to have a lot of fun watching television tomorrow"" while he repealed ""every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration ... within hours."" He promised a special emphasis on eradicating ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" (DEI) provisions in the federal government.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T05:48:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/historic-trump-first-president-host-foreign-leaders-inauguration/
Report: Trump to Snip Transgenderism Out of Federal Government on Day One,"President Donald Trump will remove transgenderism — root-and-branch — from the U.S. federal government via an Executive Order, likely on his first day, according to a report in FreePress.com. The action will implement the preferences of many millions of American citizens, including some who voted on election day just to win this valuable prize. TheFreePress.com reported that the order — titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"" — will ensure that: All radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms are removed. Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination. ""Woman"" means an ""adult human female."" The Executive Order directs that Government identification like passports and personnel records will reflect biological reality and not self-assessed gender identity. The order also suggests that Trump's Department of Justice will legally defend Americans who oppose the workplace use of transgender-style pronouns. The win is a huge victory for the many women and men who organized and fought against the transgender ideology. The winners include the many young women who defied peer pressure to ""detransition"" from the ideology, British author JK Rowling, and Riley Gaines, a swimmer who was required to compete against a man — Lia Thomas –in a women's competition at university. Gaines helped turn that 2022 sports defeat into a political victory. Many reporters at Breitbart News charted the debate closely and wrote more than 4,000 articles on the topic since 2008 . Trump's Executive Order order is likely to be very popular, according to data in an Ipsos poll conducted in early January. The poll showed that 77 percent of Republicans, and 49 percent of Americans, agree that ""Society has gone too far in accommodating transgender people."" Only 23 percent of Americans, and just 37 percent of Democrats, say society has not gone far enough. Twenty-eight percent of Americans said, ""Society has reached a reasonable balance when it comes to accommodating transgender people."" Ipsos The poll also showed that 79 percent of Americans — and 94 percent of Republicans — say male athletes should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. Only 18 percent said men should be allowed into women's sports. The FreePress report said officials would also crack down on transgender-related medical treatment of children. The poll showed that 71 percent of Americans — and 90 percent of Republicans — said doctors should not be allowed to prescribe ""puberty-blocking drugs or hormone therapy to minors between the ages of 10 and 18."" Stephen Miller: ""There are men and there are women. And it's not up to you whether you're a man or a woman. That's a decision that's made by God and it can't be changed."" [image or embed] — Aaron Rupar ( @atrupar.com ) January 19, 2025 at 4:26 PM Trump's election — and similar polls — may push transgenderism ideology to the margins of society and the media. The ideology says the government should force Americans to treat particular men — or teenagers — as if they are women whenever the man or teenager says he is transgender. In contrast, Americans have built their laws, social norms, and civic expectations on the recognition that the two biological sexes are equal, different, competing, and complementary. However, the Democratic Party coalition of the diverse includes a strong base of pro-transgender donors — and one new representative who insists he is a woman. The representative — Rep. Sarah McBride (D-DE) — was just given a leading role in setting policy within the Democrats' House caucus.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T05:01:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/report-trump-excise-transgenderism-federal-government-day-one/

GOP Demands Investigation of CDC for Funding 21 Abortions Overseas,"Republican lawmakers are demanding an investigation into Biden's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for allegedly illegally using U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay for at least 21 abortions in Mozambique through PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). ""Frankly, it's not a surprise to find that they are performing abortion with U.S. taxpayer dollars,"" said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Security and Diplomacy Bureau. ""Their denials over the years have rung hollow in the face of their aggressive promotion of abortion and collaboration with some of the largest international abortion providers."" ""The CDC's actions are a direct violation of both the letter and spirit of the law. It is unacceptable for our government to use PEPFAR's taxpayer dollars to promote or provide abortion, especially in a program meant to save lives from HIV/AIDS,"" Smith added. Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, confirmed on Thursday that the CDC recently disclosed that PEPFAR funds were used to pay health workers who performed at least 21 abortions and accused the CDC of violating the Helms Amendment, a policy which prohibits the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for abortions abroad. ""It is disgusting that the Biden Administration has allowed U.S. taxpayer dollars to be used to perform abortions overseas. This is not only illegal – it cuts against deeply held American values,"" Risch said in a statement. ""The CDC must be investigated for its misuse of PEPFAR funds, and those who have violated long-standing U.S. laws that protect life must be held accountable. This violation means that the future of the PEPFAR program is certainly in jeopardy. I will not support one dollar of American money going towards abortion anywhere in the world, and I will do all I can to ensure this never happens again."" ""For 20 years, PEPFAR has been a global health issue with deep bipartisan agreement and respect for life, but the actions of the CDC have polarized and destroyed this bipartisan foundation. Whether CDC staff were being overly zealous, stupid, evil, or inept, they have violated the law and done a disservice to the country and those suffering from AIDS worldwide,"" he added. PEPFAR was created in 2003 under President George W. Bush has ""invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving 25 million lives, preventing millions of HIV infections, and supporting several countries to achieve HIV epidemic control...,"" according to the State Department. While abortion is legal in Mozambique, a review of service providers in the country who receive PEPFAR funding revealed that four nurses had performed at least 21 abortions since January 2021, Reuters reported , citing three U.S. officials who briefed members of Congress this week. Officials alleged that this is the first time they have discovered PEPFAR-funded providers performing abortions in the program's history. ""That's why we wanted to notify Congress right away,"" said one of the officials, who is involved in administering PEPFAR at the State Department. ""It also is an important indication that the compliance measures we have in place have been effective, but could be further strengthened."" A State Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly allegedly told Politico that the CDC worked with the Mozambique Ministry of Health to investigate the abortions and see if there had been a violation of the law. The investigation revealed that four nurses operating in a small province of the country allegedly were unaware that they were not allowed to perform abortions while receiving PEPFAR funding, the official said. A CDC spokesperson told the outlet the Mozambique government refunded the money, $4,100, with the spokesperson noting that the agency spends $189 million in PEPFAR funds in Mozambique. ""CDC identified the error, took immediate action, has a plan in place to prevent it from happening again and briefed relevant committees,"" the CDC spokesperson said. The State Department told the outlet that PEPFAR will begin requiring every service provider to state annually that they have received training and understand the rules around receiving PEPFAR funding. The revelation comes less than three months before PEPFAR is up for reauthorization. Up until 2023, Congress had typically granted five-year reauthorizations to the program, however, it was renewed for only one year last March after Congressional Republicans sounded the alarm on the Biden administration trying to use the program to push for abortions abroad — mostly in Africa. At the time, Rep. Smith warned that Biden had "" brazenly hijacked this foreign aid program"" in 2022 by changing PEPFAR's strategic plan to include abortion promotion in its HIV/AIDS projects. PEPFAR's Regional Operational Plan Guidance for 2023 also stated that the program worked with ""organizations advocating for structural, systemic, and institutional reforms in law and policy regarding sexual, reproductive, and economic rights of women."" Smith further alleged that millions of dollars in PEPFAR funding under Biden had been given to organizations with a record of pushing abortions and lobbying to end pro-life laws abroad. READ MORE – GOP Congressman: Biden Admin Has ""Brazenly Hijacked"" AIDS Program to Push Abortion in Africa Smith was not alone in sounding the alarm. In May 2023, pro-life and conservative organizations wrote a letter to lawmakers asking them to remove any possibility of PEPFAR funding or promoting abortion abroad. ""We are concerned that grants from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) are used by nongovernmental organizations that promote abortions and push a radical gender ideology abroad. We urge you to ensure that any reauthorization of PEPFAR ensures that taxpayer money is not used for such purposes,"" the letter reads . In June 2023, 139 African parliamentarians also sent a letter to Congress stating they have ""concerns and suspicions that this funding is supporting so-called family planning and reproductive health principles and practices, including abortion, that violate our core beliefs concerning life, family, and religion.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T03:46:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/gop-demands-investigation-bidens-cdc-taxpayer-funding-21-abortions-overseas/
Trump to Visit California Friday; Breitbart News Leads Coverage of Wildfires,"President-elect Donald Trump told tens of thousands of supporters at a rally in Washington, DC, on the eve of his Inauguration on Sunday that he intends to devote his first presidential visit to the California wildfires on Friday. Trump said: Tonight, I also want to send our love to everyone affected by the wildfires raging in California. We are praying for you all. We love you all. We will be there soon. I'm going to go out there on Friday to see it and get it moving back. We will get some of the best builders in the world to get it moving back. I also want to pay my respects to the great people of North Carolina. You know, I won it every single time, and [they] have been treated badly. FEMA almost did not know it existed. And we are going to get North Carolina rocking and rolling, okay? They have been treated badly as a state. Together, we will rebuild Los Angeles better and more beautiful than ever before. We will get it going. We have the best builders in the world. In 2028, the Los Angeles Olympics will be one of the great sporting events and patriotic celebrations in history. Because of the wildfires, they are going to do a special job. They are going to do something very special on the Olympics. Breitbart News has led the world in coverage of the wildfires, with correspondents who physically live in the affected communities, both in the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and the Eaton Fire in Pasadena. Networks such as ABC, CBS, Sky News, and others have used Breitbart News coverage or reporting in their own reporting on the fires. Trump also visited California after previous disasters.

Trump to Sign over 200 Executive Orders on Day One -- Just Like 'The Agenda',"President-elect Donald Trump is preparing to sign over 200 executive orders as soon as he reaches the Oval Office after Inauguration — just as Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel B. Pollak suggested in his book, The Agenda . In The Agenda: What Trump Should Do in His First 100 Days , Pollak suggests over 200 executive orders, actions, and memoranda to launch Trump's policies and overwhelm Democratic Party attempts at ""lawfare"" to stop them. In August, he wrote: ""I have a new book coming out August 20. It's called The Agenda: What Trump Should Do in His First 100 Days . In it, I lay out over 200 suggestions for executive orders, executive actions, policy changes, and memoranda that President Trump can adopt immediately upon taking office."" Pollak wrote in November: ""[T]his author has recommended over 200 executive orders, actions, and policies that Trump should enact in his first 100 days, given that the media will portray him as a ""lame duck"" who cannot run again, and given past difficulties in passing his agenda through Congress, even in 2017-18, when — as in 2025 — Republicans control both chambers."" And Breitbart News' Wendell Husebø wrote in December: ""Breitbart News published a list of ten executive orders that Trump could issue on his first day. Breitbart News's Joel Pollak recommended over 200 executive orders, actions, and policies that Trump should enact in his first 100 days."" Stephen Miller, Trump's appointee for White House deputy chief of staff for policy, is said to have prepared a slew of executive orders for Trump to sign, starting with immigration policy and closing the borders to illegal migration. Other executive orders are expected to relate to the economy; to foreign policy; to the military; to tariffs; gender policy; and to pardoning, or commuting the sentences of, non-violent January 6 defendants.

Texas Man Pleads Guilty to Vandalizing Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers,"A Texas man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to vandalizing pregnancy centers in May of 2022 in response to the leaked Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade . Ethan Skorick, 23, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a press release. On May 7, 2022, Skorick intentionally damaged the properties of Loreto House and Woman to Woman pro-life pregnancy resource centers located in Denton, Texas. He vandalized the buildings with words including ""NOT A CLINIC,"" ""FORCED BIRTH IS MURDER,"" and ""PRO BIRTH [does not equal] PRO LIFE,"" and defaced the clinics security cameras with spray paint, according to court documents. Loreto House Between 3 and 3:10 a.m. Saturday, an unknown subject spray painted the building, sign, and three cameras at Loreto House in the 1100 block of Bonnie Brae Street. If you have information regarding the suspect in the video or information related to this incident, please contact Denton County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-388-8477 or www.dentoncountycrimestoppers.com. Posted by City of Denton Police Department on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 Skorick said he vandalized the pro-life pregnancy centers because ""both facilities provide reproductive health services that I opposed,"" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported , citing his statements from court documents. ""I was angered by the United States Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , which previously provided Constitutional protections for abortion services,"" he said, according to court documents. Crisis pregnancy centers notably offer support to pregnant women in need who choose life for their unborn children, including providing free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, medical exams, parenting classes, items like food, diapers, clothing, and financial assistance for housing. Many pro-life pregnancy centers also help women after their babies are born. RELATED: Fourth Pro-Abortion Activist Convicted in Florida Pregnancy Center Vandalisms ""This defendant sought to prevent fellow citizens from exercising rights protected by law,"" said U.S. Attorney Damien M. Diggs for the Eastern District of Texas. ""People cannot resort to destroying property in an effort to intimidate or prevent others from engaging in lawful activity simply because they disagree with the law. This office will remain dedicated to protecting the rights of all Americans to safely access medical services and ensuring providers can perform their duties freely."" Skorick faces up to one year in prison and up to $100,000 in fines, according to court documents cited by the Star-Telegram. The FACE Act was signed into law in 1994 by then-President Bill Clinton and prohibits ""violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services."" The FACE Act has been a flashpoint in the abortion debate during the Biden administration, with the DOJ using the law to almost explicitly go after pro-life advocates who peacefully protest at abortion clinics. While the law was written to equally protect abortion clinics, pro-life pregnancy resource centers, and churches, 97 percent of FACE Act cases since the law's inception have been against pro-life advocates. READ MORE – Explainer: DOJ Uses KKK-Era Charge to Extend Prison Time for Pro-Life Activists Data obtained by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) shows that in less than four years, Biden's DOJ has accounted for more than a quarter of all 211 FACE prosecutions. At least 55 FACE Act cases have been prosecuted during the Biden administration, and only a handful of those have been against pro-abortion activists, despite an increase in attacks against pro-life pregnancy centers and churches following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe . Some Republicans have called the FACE Act unconstitutional and have proposed doing away with the law altogether in response to the Biden administration's apparent weaponization of it. Democrats reject that assessment, countering that the federal law is needed — on top of state laws — to dissuade protesters from engaging in violent behavior.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T02:30:36+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/texas-man-pleads-guilty-vandalizing-pro-life-pregnancy-centers/
"Trump Vows to End Biden's DEI Mandate, Return to 'Merit System'","President-elect Donald Trump said at his Make America Great Again rally on Sunday that he will end President Joe Biden's ""diversity, equity, and inclusion mandates"" in favor of a merit-based system. Trump detailed his plans at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, DC, after vowing to sign a slew of executive orders on day one that would reverse policies of the Biden administration. ""Every radical and foolish Executive Order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office. Oh, you're gonna have a lot of fun watching television tomorrow,"" Trump said. He then zoned in on Biden's ""diversity equity and inclusion mandate."" ""But we're going to stop the destructive and divisive Diversity Equity and Inclusion mandates all across government and private sector and return our country to the merit system,"" Trump declared. ""You know, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States is allowed to go by the merit system, which is what made us great in the first place,"" he added. ""That was a big, big ruling that a lot of people don't even know about, but that was a big, tremendous ruling."" Trump did not specify which ruling he was referring to, but it could be the Court's decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in college admissions. ""And you're focusing on character, competence, qualifications in all hiring decisions,"" Trump said. ""Now, you're allowed to go by competence, ability, and genius. You don't have to hire somebody to send up one of his rocket ships that doesn't know anything about what's happening."" Trump first vowed to eliminate DEI programs across the federal government in 2023 after the court's decision on affirmative action. His mandate election has led to a self-purge of DEI in the private sector and sent the Pentagon into what sources called ""absolute disarray"" as he aims to fire military leaders who pushed DEI, as Breitbart News Pentagon Correspondent Kristina Wong reported.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T02:01:16+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2025/01/19/trump-vows-end-bidens-dei-mandate-return-merit-system/
AOC Criticizes TikTok for Praising Trump's Efforts on Restoring TikTok,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized TikTok for praising President-elect Donald Trump for vowing to delay a ban on TikTok, stating that he is ""not president right now."" In stories on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez referenced a message that appeared on TikTok after the social media app was restored in the United States for Americans to access. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the app for praising Trump for calling for companies to not allow the app to remain dark, and for stating he would issue an Executive Order delaying a ban on the social media app. Ocasio-Cortez also criticized the app for calling Trump, ""President Trump,"" and pointed out that Trump ""is not president right now"" and is still ""a private citizen."" ""Welcome back! Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.,"" Ocasio-Cortez said as she read the message that appeared on TikTok. ""First of all, Donald Trump is not president right now. He is a private citizen. He does not have access to presidential powers, he does not have the ability to do any of that. So, please understand that TikTok's decision to name Trump in the notification is a choice. They are signaling that they are privately collaborating. They have agreed to privately collaborate with Donald Trump and the Trump administration."" Ocasio-Cortez added that TikTok deciding to thank Trump and call him ""President Trump,"" meant that ""every social media platform"" in the U.S. has been ""taken over by the right-wing."" ""What this effectively means is that every social media platform, mass social media platform in the United States, has been taken over by the right-wing,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""With the exception of Bluesky, but Bluesky's still very small — relatively. When I say put the pieces together, Elon Musk took over Twitter and there's open reporting. It's pretty obvious as well, that they have manipulated the algorithms, they've artificially manipulated the algorithms to boost right-wing content on X and to amplify harassment."" On Sunday, TikTok issued a statement that they were ""in the process of restoring"" access to American users after Trump had said he would delay a ban on TikTok. The statement came after Trump stated on Truth Social under his Executive Order, ""there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark."" ""I'm asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark,"" Trump wrote. ""I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order."" TikTok going dark in the U.S. came after a federal appeals court upheld the law requiring ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok to either sell the app or face a ban in the U.S. As a result, ByteDance had until January 19 to either sell Tiktok or face a ban, unless the president granted a 90-day extension.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T01:44:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/aoc-criticizes-tiktok-praising-trump-vowing-delay-ban-not-president-right-now/

Biden Grants Posthumous Pardon to Black Nationalist Marcus Garvey,"In his final full day in office, President Joe Biden has given a posthumous pardon to black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Referring to the pan-Africanist and racial separatist as a ""renowned civil rights and human rights leader,"" Biden said his 1923 conviction and subsequent five-year sentence was an ""injustice."" Born in 1887 in Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica, Garvey moved to the U.S. in 1916 before forming the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which aimed to ""establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa."" In 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud after advertising the sale of stocks in a boat for his shipping company, Black Star Line, which the business did not yet own. After being found guilty and sentenced to serve five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey's sentence in 1927, and deported him back to Jamaica. Biden's Sunday statement from the White House on Garvey's posthumous pardon is as follows: Marcus Mosiah Garvey (1887-1940) was a renowned civil rights and human rights leader who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927. Notably, Mr. Garvey created the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as ""the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement."" Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction. The outgoing president has set a new record for giving out the most individual pardons and commutations, announcing on Friday that he was commuting sentences for almost 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders. Biden also notably pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing a 17-year sentence after being convicted of tax and gun charges.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:42:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/law-and-order/2025/01/19/biden-grants-posthumous-pardon-to-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey/
Trump to Swear In with Personal Bible and Lincoln Bible During Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump will swear into office with two Bibles — one given to him by his mother, and one that President Abraham Lincoln used in his own inaugural ceremony in 1861.

Poll: Most Americans One-Word Summary of Biden's Legacy Is 'Nothing',"Americans who participated in a recent poll appear to view President Joe Biden's (D) time in the White House as a big nothingburger. A poll conducted for the Daily Mail by J.L. Partners with some 1,009 registered voters asked how they would describe 82-year-old Biden's time in office, the Mail reported Sunday: When the results are arranged in a word cloud, the most common answer sticks out at the center. The next most popular answers are economy, inflation, and infrastructure, in a more encouraging nod to one of his landmark pieces of legislation. Yet the same word, 'nothing' stands out when the responses are split by political persuasion. ... When voters were asked whether they can remember a single Biden achievement, more than half say they cannot. Some 37 percent say they 'strongly' agree with the statement that they cannot name a single one. Social media users were quick to share their thoughts on the Mail 's report, one person writing , ""Worst President Ever. Good riddance."" ""Destroying the economy and enriching his family off of the American taxpayers,"" someone else commented , while another user replied ,""Hes wrecked our country and gotten dirty rich while doing it."" Meanwhile, a recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that ""border and immigration handling"" was named as Biden's biggest failure, per Breitbart News. ""The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels 'like a morgue' and 'glum' as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in,"" the article said. It is also important to note that Americas have been suffering under the grip of inflation during the Biden-Harris presidency. ""U.S. consumer prices climbed at a faster rate in December, capping off the inflation-plagued Biden administration's final year and suggesting that the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down inflation may have run out of steam,"" Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. In addition, Biden's health and ability to serve has also been questioned. In December, CBS News reporter Jan Crawford claimed that Biden's ""obvious cognitive decline"" was the most underreported story in 2024, per Breitbart News.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:51:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-one-word-summary-president-joe-bidens-legacy-nothing/
Exclusive: Sen. Tim Scott Highlights 'American Renewal' Under Trump,"Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) released a video highlighting how the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump signifies the ""American Renewal."" In the video , Scott speaks about how it is ""time for an American Renewal"" of the United States' security, economy, education, and ""national spirit."" Scott adds that only Trump could make the vision of American renewal a reality, and that the ""Great American Renewal starts today."" ""What is victory? When you defy the odds and get back up. When you show the world the strength of America,"" Scott says in his video. ""When your resilience sends a message. A message so powerful — it roars. It is time for an American Renewal. Renewal of our security, economy, energy, education, and our national spirit"": ""We're not just the Grand Old Party of the past,"" Scott added. ""We're the Great Opportunity Party of America's future. There's only one person who can make that vision a reality, Donald Trump. The Great American Renewal starts today."" The video from Scott comes a day before Trump is set to be inaugurated. As Breitbart News previously reported , Trump's inauguration was moved indoors and will be held in the Capitol rotunda ""due to forecasted freezing temperatures."" A recent CBS News poll , conducted January 15-17, found that 60 percent of Americans were optimistic about the next four years under Trump while 40 percent were pessimistic. When asked about how things were in the U.S. today, six percent said ""very well,"" 29 percent said things were ""somewhat well,"" 39 percent said things were going ""somewhat badly,"" and 26 percent said things were going ""very badly.""

TikTok Restores Services After Trump Says He Will Delay Ban,"TikTok restored services in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump clarified that he would issue an executive order delaying a ban on the app. In a post on X, TikTok issued a statement revealing that ""in agreement"" with their service providers, they were ""in the process of restoring service."" ""In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,"" TikTok said. ""We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."" ""It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,"" TikTok continued. ""We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States."" The statement from TikTok comes after Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he was calling for companies to not allow TikTok to remain dark. Trump also clarified that his executive order would ""confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark"" before the order. ""I'm asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,"" Trump said. ""The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order."" Trump added that he ""would like the United States"" to have a 50 percent ""ownership position in a joint venture,"" explaining that, by doing so, ""we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to"" remain up. ""Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok,"" Trump added. ""With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars — maybe trillions."" On Saturday evening, American users on TikTok were greeted with a message informing them that TikTok was unavailable in the United States, due to a ""law banning TikTok"" being enacted. As Breitbart News has previously reported , in December, the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to either sell the app or risk being banned in the U.S. ByteDance had until January 19 to sell TikTok or face a ban, unless a 90-day extension was granted by the president.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T21:38:51+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-restores-services-in-u-s-after-trump-says-he-will-issue-executive-order-delaying-ban/
"Jon Voight, Matt Boyle, James O'Keefe Tribute Andrew Breitbart","WASHINGTON, DC – Award recipients, ranging from actor Jon Voight to Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle, praised Andrew Breitbart during the Patriot Awards on Saturday, underscoring the immeasurable scope of his legacy. After winning one of just a handful of Patriot Awards, which recognize individual contributions to the MAGA movement, Voight gave a nod to Breitbart in his remarks. He recalled meeting Breitbart at a small gathering of conservatives in Hollywood years ago. WATCH — Actor Jon Voight Remembers Andrew Breitbart at Patriot Awards: ""I Loved Him"": ""I saw Andrew Breitbart, and I'm sitting there next to Gary Sinise and I'm saying, 'Gary, this guy's got it. He's amazing,'"" Voight recalled. Voight reminisced about his conversation with Breitbart after the event. ""I said, 'Andrew, you're a special guy.' I said, you know, 'What are you going to do with that energy?' And I was saying to him that, you know, 'I say a few things, I'm not as open as some people, but I say a few things — I'm not afraid to get in the game a little bit,'"" Voight recalled. ""And he said to me, 'Jon, I can't wait. I can't wait to get into their faces.'"" ""I said, 'Oh, this guy's dangerous,'"" he added, drawing laughs. ""And then I saw what he did with that energy. He did confront everything. He said these most wonderful things."" As one Voight pointed to Breitbart's famous standoff with Occupy protesters, telling them to ""behave"" themselves and to ""stop raping people!"" ""He got up in front of them, and they would shout him down and try to shout him down, and the press was there, right? So he knew what to do with the press,"" Voight said. ""He stood up and stood in front of these people, he went right to them, and he said, 'Stop raping! Stop raping!' He said it like 15 times, and that was it. That was the way the message got across to people that these people were perverse people, you see, bad people, criminals."" ""And anyway, he had this great imagination, and I loved him, and I spoke to him the day before he passed,"" Voight added. ""And he was he was attacked, you know, just like in the way our president was attacked, Rudy Giuliani was attacked, and all that, but he stood up. He was so beautiful, such a beautiful person."" Boyle also paid homage to Breitbart after being presented with his award. ""Andrew Breitbart always used to talk about how culture is upstream from politics and you have to win the culture war. Well, let me make it clear: the Presidential Inaugural Committee just announced that Nelly is performing at one of the inaugural balls on Monday night. Last night, we had Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Soulja Boy performing — not my cup of tea, but whatever. The point is — Rascal Flatts are performing at another one, Carrie Underwood is singing at the inauguration — we've won the culture war, guys,"" Boyle said, to applause. ""I will say, Andrew Breitbart would be so proud of where we are as a movement today; he was a really good friend of mine, and we have a very, very bright future ahead of us,"" he said to close out his remarks. ""So here in the heart of the establishment media's power, if you will, in Washington, DC, at the National Press Club, we declare: The establishment media, you are dead, and we're going to win this thing."" James O'Keefe, founder of O'Keefe Media Group, also honored Breitbart when he accepted his Patriot Award. ""So I'll keep this pretty short, but you know I appreciate this honor and Andrew Breitbart, there's so much to say, but way back when, because I've been doing this since I was in college, he used to say 'We are the media now' right? ' We are the media,'"" O'Keefe said after noting OMG broke a story last week leading to the firing of a Pentagon official. ""This week, you know, in an extraordinary series of events, the Pentagon fired this guy for, you know, he's an adviser to the Joint Chiefs; he's in meetings inside the Situation Room inside the Pentagon, and in an extraordinary series of events, not one single member of the DC press corps reported on it,"" O'Keefe added. ""So I think Andrew used to say this in so many words, but it's not that the legacy media is just merely not reporting news– n ow they're in the news suppression business. And stop complaining about the media. Understand that now you, me, we are the media."" The tributes come as the 13th anniversary of Breitbart's passing, March 1, 2025, approaches. The Patriot Awards, which are 18-inch bronze statues of Trump, resemble a larger-than-life two-story bronze statue of Trump, which Breitbart News first reported of in November as it neared completion. ""PATRIOT Founder Ashley Sansalone was responsible for the idea to create the statue and manages the construction and logistics of the project,"" event host Dustin Stockton told Breitbart News. ""Without Ash, none of this could have happened."" Stockton is a former Breitbart News reporter.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T21:20:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/jon-voight-matt-boyle-james-okeefe-tribute-andrew-breitbart-patriot-awards/
Poll: Most Americans Have Poor View of President Biden's Time in Office,"Citizens are not looking favorably on President Joe Biden's (D) time in office as President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration approaches. According to CBS News polling, ""When Americans look back now on Biden's presidency, 37% approve of the job he has done over the last four years. That is just below any approval mark he received while in office,"" the outlet reported Sunday. When Biden took office four years ago, most Americans felt optimistic about the job he would do. However, following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that left many service members dead, his approval rating took a dive and continued to drop as Americans suffered in the grip of inflation, and ""it never recovered,"" the article stated. Social media users shared their thoughts on the CBS News report, one person writing , ""And you did everything possible to cover for him. You're a joke."" ""Over the past four years you told us he was fit for office, reducing our debt, and bringing illegal workers across the border to help America. You have earn 'old media' tag which you will never shed. What you paid to play has earned you a walk in the media shadows,"" another user commented . Meanwhile, some members of the Democrat party are distancing themselves from claims that Biden was fit to serve, Breitbart News reported January 7. ""After Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July following a poor debate performance, Democrats claimed he was fit to serve,"" the outlet said. ""Now two weeks before Biden leaves office, a handful of Democrats are starting to trash the president and warn of accountability."" A recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that ""border and immigration handling"" were named as Biden's biggest failure as president, per Breitbart News. The news of Biden's decline in favorability comes as Trump prepares for his inauguration on Monday in Washington, DC, AFP reported Saturday. Per the CBS News report, ""This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,174 U.S. adults interviewed between January 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

"Actor, CNN Show Host Michael Ian Black Wants to 'Fu**ing Impeach' Trump Before He's Sworn In","Well, that didn't take long. Donald Trump has yet to take the oath of office at his second inauguration and Hollywood celebrities are already clamoring to run him out of office. Trump surprised fans and foes alike over the weekend when he announced the release of $TRUMP, his very own cryptocurrency. The meme coin's value is already surging as a feverish flood of buying sent its market capitalization through the roof on Saturday to several billion dollars. That's good news right? Not if you ask left-wing comedian Michael Ian Black. ""Fucking impeach him,"" Black wrote in a Bluesky screed. Fucking impeach him. [image or embed] — Michael Ian Black ( @michaelianblack.bsky.social ) January 18, 2025 at 3:21 PM If you didn't already know, Black wasn't rooting for Trump during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he was among the few people who thought Kamala Harris ""kick Trump's withered old ass"" during their one and only debate. Black, a co-captain on the CNN quiz show Have I Got News for You , was last seen on these pages embarrassing himself on the aforementioned CNN program for making false claims about a diplomatic success story Trump explained during the aforementioned debate. Black spent Trump's first term in office obsessing over nearly ever thing the president-elect did or said. He wrote an anti-Trump children's book and even advised reporters tell Trump to ""fuck off."" Black is already reeling again, so we can probably expect more of the same sad shrieks.

"Michael Rapaport Celebrates the Demise of 'Dirty, Biased, Damn Near Soft Porn Dumphole' TikTok","Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport celebrated the shuttering of Chinese-owned social media outlet TikTok, which went dark on Sunday in the wake of a ban put in place by an act of Congress. TikTok went dark on Sunday in compliance with the ban put in place by Congress and upheld on Friday by the U.S. Supreme court. Consequently, the site told users that it was shutting down in compliance on Sunday but also noted they were hoping to work with Donald Trump to resolve the issue. For Rapaport, TikTok's seeming demise was all good news. The Prison Break actor jumped to his account to celebrate TikTok's closure on Sunday, and called the Chinese-affiliated site a ""dumphole."" ""Say what you want about Elon & Zuckerberg at least we know where to find them,"" he said in his caption. ""TikTok, au revoir,"" he said emphatically in his video. ""You did it to yourself, TikTokers,"" he added. ""You can say what you want about Elon Musk, you can say what you want about [Mark] Zuckerberg,"" he continued, ""at least we have a face,"" he said of X and Facebook's owners. ""At least we have people to complain to, we can tweet at them, we can DM them, we can put our face on wax and scream and yell at them, we don't know who the fuck has been running this platform [TikTok]. This platform is dirty. This platform is biased. It's damn near soft porn on here."" ""I've seen some crazy shit on TikTok. You did it to yourselves, TikTok, you did it to yourself TikTokers!"" he exclaimed. ""Say what you want about Facebook, Instagram, X, Whatsapp, Snapchat, at least we know who's running the joint,"" he explained. ""We don't know what the fuck and who the fuck is doing what at TikTok. And the vile, antisemitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, soft porn, tits and ass, every fucking five seconds the weirdos, the creeps, the creep cock-suckers — bye bye TikTok, you did it to yourself, if this is signing off, farewell. You know where to find me, I'm on Instagram and X and Facebook."" ""See ya later assholes,"" he concluded with a beaming grin. Rapaport's glee may have been a bit premature, though, because only hours after shutting down, TikTok began restorting service after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push out an executive order in the social media outlet's favor after he is inaugurated.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T19:27:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/19/michael-rapaport-celebrates-the-demise-of-dirty-biased-damn-near-soft-porn-dumphole-tiktok/
German Ambassador Warns Trump Will Undermine 'Constitutional Order',"Germany's ambassador to the United States reportedly warned that Donald Trump's incoming administration will undermine ""basic democratic principles"" and seek a ""redefinition of the constitutional order."" While European leaders have been relatively muted in their response to the re-election of Donald Trump, particularly compared to the hysterical reaction to his victory in 2016, the panic has apparently merely been confined to backrooms rather than in public. According to Reuters, a confidential document briefing Berlin on the incoming administration signed by Ambassador to the U.S. Andreas Michaelis warned that the incoming administration would seek ""maximum disruption"" and usher in ""a redefinition of the constitutional order – maximum concentration of power with the president at the expense of Congress and the federal states."" ""Basic democratic principles and checks and balances will be largely undermined, the legislature, law enforcement and media will be robbed of their independence and misused as a political arm, Big Tech will be given co-governing power,"" the document reportedly added. The ambassador went on to warn that Trump would seek to weaponize the Department of Justice and the FBI against his political enemies and to help facilitate mass deportations. Michaelis suggested that the new administration could go so far as to launch a ""military deployment within the country for police activities would be possible in the event of declared 'insurrection' and 'invasion'."" Additionally, the German ambassador pointed to the supposed danger of Trump's alliance with X owner Elon Musk, who has become a nemesis of the political establishment in Berlin for backing the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the February elections. According to Michaelis, Trump and Musk may seek to enact a ""redefinition of the First Amendment,"" claiming that they intend to punish non-friendly media outlets. ""One is using lawsuits, threatening criminal prosecution and licence revocation, the other is having algorithms manipulated and accounts blocked,"" he claimed. It comes as the German Defence Ministry announced this week that it would no longer actively post on X, complaining that ""the factual exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult."" Berlin's Foreign Ministry refused to verify or comment on the leaked document but affirmed that it still considers the United States to be a key ally of Germany. ""The Americans chose President Trump in a democratic election. Of course, we will also work closely with the new U.S. administration in the interests of Germany and Europe,"" the ministry said . The opinion of the German ambassador may not matter for much longer anyway, with the leftist coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsing the day after Trump's victory, the governing Social Democrats look set to be removed from office following the February federal elections in Germany.

Dave Chappelle Wishes Trump the Best in ‘SNL’ Monologue: 'The Whole World Is Counting on You',"Dave Chappelle returned to the Saturday Night Live stage clad in a sharp suit, smoking a cigarette, and armed with an array of searing jokes touching on the presidential election, the Los Angeles wildfires, Sean Diddy Combs, and President-elect Donald Trump, whom the veteran comedian wished for success in his second term. ""The presidency is no place for petty people. So, Donald Trump, I know you watch the show. Remember, whether people voted for you or not, they're all counting on you,"" Chappelle said, after jokingly saying he knows Mr. Trump watches the show. ""Whether they like you or not, they're all counting on you. The whole world is counting on you."" ""I mean this when I say this: Good luck. Please, do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time,"" Chappelle continued. ""Do not forget your humanity. And please, have empathy for displaced people, whether they're in the Palisades or Palestine."" Those were the last lines of his nearly 20-minute monologue. Chappelle started his act by explaining how he initially told SNL creator Lorne Michaels he didn't want to host the first episode after the election, as he did in 2016 and in 2020. After repeatedly telling Michaels no, Chappelle said he had an epiphany: ""You know what? I could just get rid of all these old Trump jokes. I'll do it!"" he said, adding ""The moment I said yes, L.A. burst into flames!"" Chappelle, who lives in Ohio, one town over from Springfield (more on that later), noted how the deadly L.A. fires broke his heart. He also realized how the negative comments online lambasting the many celebrities who lost their homes reminded him why he hates poor people: ""Because they can't see past their own pain."" ""The other day on the news, they said these fires were the most expensive tragedy that ever happened in the United States' history. I think that's because people in L.A. have nice stuff. I could burn 40,000 acres in Mississippi for like six or seven dollars,"" Chappelle joked. ""If you were a rational, thinking person, you'd have to at least consider the possibility that God hates these people."" Chappelle later turned his attention to Trump and his comments about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, last year. ""Trump's a wild guy. He said the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's dogs and cats. I live one town over from Springfield. That's not what happened in Springfield at all,"" Chappelle said. He said he wanted to show his support to the Haitian immigrants to let them know they were welcome. ""Every day I'd drive over to Springfield and eat lunch at the Haitian restaurant,"" Chappelle said, pausing, ""And to be honest with you, I don't know what that meat was. But whatever it was, it fell right off the bone."" Chappelle said he realized in the worst way why he didn't know about Diddy's ""Freak Off"" orgy parties. ""Oh my god, I'm ugly! That's a tough way to find out,"" he joked. ""Can you imagine if you were me reading the newspaper finding out: everyone in Hollywood had an orgy behind your back?""

Google Defies EU's 'Fact-Checking' Requirements for Search and YouTube,"Google has informed the European Union that it will not integrate work from ""fact-checking"" organizations into its Search and YouTube platforms, as the EU prepares to expand its disinformation laws. The Verge reports that Google has notified the European Union that it will not comply with the bloc's upcoming requirements to integrate ""fact checking"" into its Search and YouTube services. The tech giant's decision comes as the EU is in the process of formalizing its voluntary disinformation commitments into law under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Google had previously signed the EU's set of voluntary commitments in 2022, which aimed to reduce the impact of online disinformation. However, in a letter addressed to the European Commission's content and technology czar Renate Nikolay, Google's global affairs president Kent Walker stated that the fact-checking requirement ""simply isn't appropriate or effective for our services."" Furthermore, Google plans to withdraw from all fact-checking commitments in the Code before the rules become law in the DSA Code of Conduct. The EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation currently requires signatories to collaborate with fact-checkers in all EU countries, make their work accessible to users in all EU languages, and reduce financial incentives for spreading disinformation on their platforms. The code also mandates companies to simplify the process for users to recognize, understand, and flag disinformation, as well as label political ads and analyze fake accounts, bots, and malicious deep fakes that spread disinformation. However, these commitments are not legally binding at present. Google's objection to the fact-checking requirements is not entirely unexpected, as the company has not included fact-checking as part of its content moderation practices thus far. In its agreement with the EU, Google had stated that ""Search and YouTube will endeavor to reach agreements with fact checking organizations in line with this measure, but services will not have complete control over this process."" While 40 online platforms have signed the code, including Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch, and Meta, the level of commitment to fulfilling the requirements has been inconsistent. Twitter (now X) initially signed the code but withdrew after Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform. The European Fact-Checking Standards Network has also noted that many of the other digital platforms that signed the voluntary disinformation code have been lax in fulfilling their commitments. The EU is currently in discussions with signatories to determine which commitments will be formalized into official rules under the DSA. It remains unclear whether all of the code's requirements will be included in the final legislation. The European Commission has yet to announce when the code will officially become law, having previously stated that it is expected to come into force by January 2025 ""at the earliest.""

NYT: L.A. Firefighters Took 20 Minutes to Respond to Palisades Fire,"Firefighters took 20 minutes to respond to the Palisades Fire on January 7, according to the New York Times , confirming what sources have told Breitbart News over the past two weeks about the city's poor reaction. Breitbart News learned from local neighbors that while there was a fire engine near the origin of the fire, due to a traffic accident, it took 20-25 minutes for a helicopter to arrive at the top of the mountain ridge above Pacific Palisades where the fire began, and 44 minutes for a full response by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters have told Breitbart News that they did not pre-deploy ahead of the fire, despite warnings of extreme winds, due to budget cuts by Mayor Karen Bass and the city council that discouraged the use of overtime pay for pre-deployment. The Times reported Saturday: The [ Times '] review showed a series of planning failures, delayed evacuations and significant shortfalls in firefighting resources that together hampered efforts to limit the spread. Fire dispatch transmissions suggest that firefighters did not arrive on scene until about 20 minutes after the first 911 call in Pacific Palisades, a possible missed chance to stamp out the blaze while it was still small, the review showed. Residents are still piecing together evidence about how the fire started. Many believe that it was caused by re-ignition of a burn scar from a fire caused by fireworks set off by hikers on New Year's Eve, though arson is also a possibility.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:26:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/nyt-l-a-firefighters-took-20-minutes-to-respond-to-palisades-fire/
Millionaires Flee UK in Record Numbers Since Left-Wing Labour's Election Win,"British millionaires are fleeing the country in record numbers since Sir Keir Starmer's left-wing Labour Party claimed last year's election win and set out in socialist fashion to try and tax the country into prosperity. Turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses has raised further concerns about Labour's punitive tax plans while moves to remove the non-domiciled tax regime that allows people to keep non-UK income in a foreign country, in exchange for a fee, is also being blamed. LBC reports some 10,800 people with liquid assets of over $1 million left the country in 2024, an increase of over 150 percent on 2023, in a move predicted not long after Starmer moved into Number 10 Downing Street. A total of 78 centi-millionaires (people with $100 million or more) and 12 billionaires departed the UK last year, according to New World Wealth, a research firm. The news, coming on the back of recent turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses, has raised further concerns about Labour's push to punish the rich will also hitting farmers, old age pensioners, and everyday taxpayers with a host of penalties. Millionaires are mostly moving to other European countries such as Switzerland and Italy, as well as to places such as the United Arab Emirates. Labour are getting rid of the non-dom regime from April, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would raise nearly £13 billion over five years. Over 70,000 people with non-dom status lived in the UK in 2023. An intense lobbying campaign from wealth advisors and representatives for non-dom's ensued in the run-up to the Autumn Budget, where the policy was announced. Experts warned it would lead to a ""tidal wave"" of departures. David Hawkins, of Foreign Investors for Britain, a group representing non-doms explained the Government's policy is ""a monumental act of national self-harm"". He said : ""It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It's a real worry because more and more people are leaving. And it's businesses, jobs, investment, spending into the economy and tax take and philanthropy that are hit.""

London Mayor Khan Warns of 'Resurgent Fascism' with Trump's Return,"Far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the ""spectre of a resurgent fascism"" threatens the West with the rise of populists in Europe, tech giants rolling back censorship, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The leftist Labour Party politician, writing for the Observer , the sister paper of the Guardian , likened the growing rejection of neo-liberal globalist policies in Europe and America to the rise of fascism in the ""1920s and 1930s"". ""The far right is on the march,"" Mayor Khan exclaimed. ""From Switzerland and Sweden to Hungary, Austria and Italy, European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism."" ""In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month's federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back,"" he lamented. The far-left mayor said that the rise of populist parties is ""deeply worrying... especially if you're a member of a minority community."" ""We should be in no doubt, this is a perilous moment. The spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the West,"" Khan declared. Khan went on to argue that the global left must do more ""to inoculate our societies against the virus of far-right populism. History shows us the time to act is now."" A major area of concern cited by the London mayor is social media, which he claimed is ""fuelling racist populism and polarisation."" Khan pointed to X owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk, whom he accused of using his social media platform as a ""propaganda tool to amplify lies and advance the cause of the far right."" He also lamented the decision by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to remove its so-called fact-checking apparatus in favour of an X-style community notes system, which he claimed was an act of bending the knee to the incoming Trump administration. Khan, who has long advocated using state power to crack down on speech, suggested that countries like the UK should use legislation such as the Online Safety Act to counteract the popularity of populist messages on social media. This act empowers the government to impose hefty fines of up to ten per cent of a large internet firm's global revenue if it fails to police so-called ""harmful content."" The London mayor has been a vocal critic of Trump, demanding in 2017, for example, that the then-president should be barred from having a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II over his supposed use of "" xenophobia, racism, and 'otherness' as an electoral tactic "". Not one to take such accusations lightly, Trump branded Khan a "" stone-cold loser "" for failing to tackle knife crime and terrorism in London.

Failure to Record Ethnicity of Criminals Soars Among British Police Forces,"British police forces have been accused of being afraid of getting called racist as the recording of criminal ethnicity fell to the lowest rate in at least 15 years. According to Ministry of Justice data unearthed in Freedom of Information requests by former Tory minister Neil O'Brien, the percentage of instances in which British police failed to log the ethnicity of child sex offenders stood at 28.7 per cent last year, up from 11.6 per cent in 2010. For sex crimes as a whole, police failed to record the ethnicity of 29 per cent of perpetrators, up from 15 per cent, The Telegraph reported . Similarly, police failed to record the ethnicity of those convicted of murder, rape, and assault resulting in grievous bodily harm in over one in three instances (34.4 per cent) last year, compared to 11.8 per cent in 2010. The trend of listing the ethnicity of criminals as ""unknown"" was also seen in lower-level crimes, including 44 per cent of robberies last year, up from 14 per cent, and 30.2 per cent for shoplifting, compared to seven per cent in 2010. The MoJ figures showed the most significant increase in drug offences, from an eight per cent failure to record ethnic data in 2010 to 39 per cent in 2024. The failures come despite years of warnings that police forces throughout England had overlooked the scourge of child rape grooming gangs, in which mostly Muslim Pakistani-heritage men sexually preyed upon and trafficked young white girls for fear of appearing racist or stoking ethnic divides. Last week, a national police task force revealed that Pakistanis are up to four times more likely to commit child sexual grooming crimes than the general population. However, even the task force admitted that their figures were ""limited"" as police forces in England and Wales had only recorded the ethnicities of around a third of suspects. Commenting on the revelations, former Conservative government minister Neil O'Brien surmised that political correctness was to blame for the increasing instances of police not recording the ethnicities of offenders. ""It has to be wariness on the part of the authorities about recording and fear of being called racist,"" the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston MP said. ""We don't see a big rise in refusal to declare in other services, and the rise across the country is completely inconsistent."" Robert Jenrick, the Conservatives' shadow justice secretary, demanded that the government provide Parliament with an annual report documenting every convicted offender's ethnicity, nationality, visa, and asylum status. ""The reduction in published data on the ethnicity of convicted criminals, in sharp contrast to data on age or sex, will only fuel perceptions that the British state is covering up the costs of migration,"" Jenrick said. ""We urgently need all the data so that, for the first time, we can see the actual impact of different types of migration."" While establishment governments of both Labour and the Tories have refused to publish data relating to the criminality of migrant groups in Britain, an analysis conducted last year by The Telegraph found that foreigners were over a quarter more likely to be imprisoned than the native population. The report also found wide disparities among different foreign nationalities, with Albanians being by far the most likely to be imprisoned, at a rate of one in 50, followed by migrants from Kosovo, Vietnam, Algeria, Jamaica, Eritrea, Iraq, and Somalia. On the other hand, Germans were the least likely, followed by Italians, Greeks, Americans, Sri Lankans, French, and Chinese. The findings led to calls for the government to curtail migration from countries which produced higher numbers of migrant criminals.

TikTok Goes Dark for Americans Hours Before Ban Takes Place,"American TikTok users were faced with a message that the app was unavailable Sunday and they would not be able to use it, hours before a ban was set to take effect. ""Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now,"" a message pops up on the social media app when users in the United States open the app. The message further explains that due to a ""law banning TikTok"" being enacted in the U.S., Americans are unable to use the app. However, the message continues to praise President-elect Donald Trump for having ""indicated that he will work"" with TikTok to find ""a solution to reinstate TikTok."" ""A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,"" the message on TikTok reads. ""Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!"" TikTok going dark comes after the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the ""sell-or-ban legislation"" on the app. Trump has previously expressed that he has a ""warm spot"" in his heart for TikTok, citing how he ""won youth by 34 points"" in the presidential election. Trump has also indicated that ""TikTok had an impact"" on him winning the election and stated his administration would look into it. As Breitbart News's Alana Mastrangelo previously reported , in December a federal appeals court upheld that required ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to sell the app or face a possible ban in the U.S. During a recent interview with NBC News, Trump revealed that he would ""most likely"" give TikTok a ""90-day extension"" to avoid a ban.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T08:51:31+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-goes-dark-for-americans-hours-before-ban-takes-place/
Youngkin Orders Flags to Be Flown at Full-Staff for Trump's Inauguration,"Virginia Gov.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Youngkin ordered the American flag and the flag of the Commonwealth of Virginia ""to be flown at full-staff"" for Trump's inauguration on Monday. Youngkin added that the flags would be lowered to half-staff the next day in honor of former President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter Jr., who passed away in December at the age of 100. Youngkin said in a statement: In accordance with the authority vested in me as Governor and in accordance with federal law 4 U.S.C. § 6(d), I hereby order that the flags of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia are to be flown at full-staff on all state and local buildings and grounds in the Commonwealth in recognition of the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States. ""The flags will be lowered back to half-staff the following day to continue honoring former President James Earl Carter, Jr. and remain at half-staff through January 28, 2025,"" Youngkin added. ""I hereby order that the flags shall be raised at 11 am on Monday, January 20, 2025 and lowered at sunrise on Tuesday, January 21, 2024."" Youngkin joins Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in making announcements that flags in their states would be raised to full-staff for Trump's inauguration. In December, President Joe Biden ordered the flags to be flown at half-staff for a period of 30 days in honor of Carter: NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr., and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

Adam Schiff Re-Hires Former Radical Pro-Palestinian Staffer Maher Bitar,"Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has re-hired Maher Bitar, a former White House staffer who spent his student years as a pro-Palestinian radical in Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and played a major role in the Biden administration. Bitar's new job is confirmed by Legistorm. He also previously worked for Schiff during the first impeachment effort against then-President Donald Trump, who will return to office on Monday. As Breitbart News reported last year: Maher Bitar, the White House Coordinator for Intelligence and Defense Policy at the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), was a radical pro-Palestinian activist and a leader within Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). The SJP is one of the most prominent groups involved in the pro-Hamas, antisemitic ""encampment"" protests that have taken over dozens of university campuses. Its parent group is also the target of a lawsuit by survivors and families of victims of the October 7 terror attack that alleges SJP is a propaganda front for Hamas in the U.S. In addition, conservative author Daniel Greenfield wrote about Bitar's record for the Jewish News Syndicate: At the PSM [Palestine Solidarity Movement] conference in Georgetown [in 2006], Bitar had run a session describing how to best demonize Israel. Next year, he facilitated a Palestinian Student Society summit addressed by Joseph Massad , who had called Israel a ""Jewish supremacist state"" and praised terrorism. ... A few years later, Bitar could be found presenting at a Sabeel conference featuring some of the worst bigots like Rebecca Vilkomerson of JVP, who had invited a terrorist to address the BDS hate group, and Richard Falk, who had endorsed a book which wondered whether ""Hitler might have been right after all."" ... Bitar went to work for UNRWA, interned at the misnamed and militantly anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and studied at Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre, writing papers on the so-called ""Nakba"" and on ""Palestinian"" activism. He appeared to describe Israel's security barrier as a ""segregation wall."" Schiff is considered a pro-Israel Senator, by the standards of the Democratic Party, but his reliance on Bitar for advice on national security policy signals a possible shift mirroring the anti-Israel drift of much of the rest of his party.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T03:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/adam-schiff-re-hires-former-radical-pro-palestinian-staffer-maher-bitar/
Youngkin Slams Biden's Clemency of Men Who Killed Police Officer,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) criticized President Joe Biden for granting clemency to ""two violent criminals"" who killed a police officer, stating that he was ""beyond outraged."" In a press release on Saturday, Youngkin stated that what made Biden granting clemency to Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson ""even more unconscionable"" was that ""the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House"" against commuting the sentences. Youngkin noted in the press release that ""both"" men had ""admitted to being responsible for the brutal killing of Officer Allen Gibson in Sussex County Circuit Court."" Claiborne and Richardson were ""acquitted of the 1998 murder"" of Officer Allen Gibson, a Sussex County police officer, according to WRIC News. The outlet noted that while the men were ""acquitted by a federal jury,"" they ended up receiving ""a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge."" However, in an unusual move, they still received a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge. Previously, a legal analyst told 8News that it was a ""miscarriage of justice"" to cross-reference a charge someone had been acquitted of when sentencing, adding that he had never seen that before. ""I am beyond outraged and in utter disbelief that President Biden would announce clemency for Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson—two men who admitted for being responsible to brutally killing Officer Allen Gibson,"" Youngkin said in a statement. ""What makes this even more unconscionable is the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House not to commute these sentences as they are violent offenders."" ""The pain and sorrow this clemency causes the Gibson family is unimaginable,"" Youngkin added. ""To know that the men who took Officer Gibson's life will walk free is not just a grave injustice—it is a heartbreaking blow to those who continue to mourn his sacrifice. This is despicable; a grim day for justice and for the families who trust that our system will hold the guilty accountable."" Youngkin's criticism of Biden commuting the sentences of Claiborne and Richardson came a day after Biden commuted the sentences of almost 2,500 people. As Breitbart News previously reported , in December, Biden issued presidential pardons to 39 Americans who were ""convicted of non-violent crimes,"" and commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 others.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T02:12:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/glenn-youngkin-slams-bidens-clemency-of-men-who-murdered-va-police-officer-beyond-outraged/
HHS Defunds EcoHealth for Facilitating Gain-of-Function Research,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has cut off all funding and ""formally debarred"" EcoHealth Alliance Inc. and its former president, Dr. Peter Daszak, after finding evidence that it facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight and violated statutes in its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Evidence was gathered over an eight-month investigation by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in a Friday news release . A letter from HHS states that a five-year ""period of debarment for Dr. Daszak is necessary to protect the Federal Government's business interests,"" and confirms that EcoHealth terminated his employment on January 6 of this year. A May 2024 interim report from the coronavirus subcommittee revealed ""serious, systemic weaknesses"" within NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that ""enabled"" Daszak to fund ""dangerous"" gain-of-function research with the the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) with a multi-million dollar federal grant. Then-subcommittee Chair, Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), accused the British doctor of having ""blatant contempt for the American people,"" calling it ""reprehensible"": EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak is not a good steward of U.S. taxpayer dollars and should never again receive funding from the U.S. taxpayer. Dr. Daszak and his organization conducted dangerous gain-of-function research at the WIV, willfully violated the terms of a multi-million-dollar NIH grant, and placed U.S. national security at risk. This blatant contempt for the American people is reprehensible. It is imperative to establish higher standards of oversight at the NIH. The Select Subcommittee's detailed and comprehensive report today holds Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance accountable and sheds light on severe shortcomings in our public health systems. On top of debarment, the interim report also recommended that Daszak be criminally investigated. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) celebrated the defunding and debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak in a Friday statement: ""Justice for the American people was served today. Bad actor EcoHealth Alliance and its corrupt former President, Dr. Peter Daszak, were formally debarred by HHS for using taxpayer funds to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in China,"" the Kentucky Republican said in the committee's press release. ""Today's decision is not only a victory for the U.S. taxpayer, but also for American national security and the safety of citizens worldwide."" ""Given that a lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is the most likely origin of COVID-19, EcoHealth and its former President should never again receive a single cent from the U.S. taxpayer,"" Comer added. EcoHealth Alliance's period of debarment is set to end on May 14, 2029, and Daszak's is set to end six days later, Fox News reported. The medical research firm got nearly $100 million from the U.S. government over the last 15 years, the outlet noted.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T01:21:17+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/18/hhs-defunds-ecohealth-dr-peter-daszak-for-facilitating-dangerous-wuhan-gain-of-function-research/
Georgia 'BLM' Mayor Under Fire for Spending 1.000s of Taxpayer Dollars,"A Georgia mayor who claims to be ""America's first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office"" is accused of spending $26,000 of public funds for unauthorized expenses, primarily for international travel. South Fulton Mayor Khalid Kamau has come under fire this week residents and at least one city council member questioned items he allegedly bought with his city-issued purchase card, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Kamau, who boasts of being a ""self-proclaimed Elected Activist"" and BLM protester on the city's website , identifies as a ""socialist"" who was proud to support legislation to ""eliminate Columbus Day in favor of Indigenous People's Day"" and to ""ban the box"" asking city job applicants to disclose their criminal history. When asked if the mayor had made unauthorized purchases, Councilwoman Helen Willis said, ""It appears so. Within the last fourth quarter of 2024, it was approximately $26,000."" One of the major purchases was a trip to Africa, she alleged. ""It's a pretty large amount of unauthorized charges, mainly for international travel,"" Willis told the Atlanta outlet. Kamau, who was elected in 2017 and goes by ""Mayor Kobi"" on Instagram for unclear reasons, documented a 20-day trip to Ghana in December on the platform, one disgruntled resident told WSB-TV. One video shared by the mayor on December 22 shows him dancing with a couple of smiling ladies at a popular beach club in the West African nation's capital of Accra: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mayor Kobi (@kobi.cares) ""I wanted to find out if taxpayers paid for this trip,"" the resident, Reshard Snellings, told the station. ""We should not be asked to go without something so that our elected officials can travel all over the globe."" When asked if the city of South Fulton was conducting any business in Africa, Councilwoman Willis said no. ""Not to my knowledge, that isn't even a priority,"" she told the outlet. ""We need more economic development here and we don't need to go to Africa in order for the city to have a multi-business deal."" On top of multiple flight purchases totaling more than $5,000, there was also a $1,300 purchase for a drone and multiple expensive Amazon orders, according to WSB-TV. Councilman Jaceey Sebastian, mayor pro tem, said that Kamau needs to provide an explanation. ""There are some things that I see in the public that need some explanation,"" he said to Fox 5 Atlanta. Councilwoman Linda Pritchett concurred, saying, ""I would like to see the mayor have the opportunity to address the issue transparently."" While international travel is not prohibited for the mayor, using the city card for personal items and services is. The city council ultimately voted to suspend international travel for 30 to 45 days while that statute is reviewed, the local Fox affiliate reported. Kamau has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the accusations are politically motivated. ""It's really a smear campaign. You will see in the meetings, the people who are talking the most are running for mayor in 2025,"" the mayor said to WSB-TV. Kamau was arrested at a complete stranger's home and charged with trespassing and burglary in 2023, after allegedly bypassing a ""No Trespassing"" sign on a property in the neighboring town of Fairburn and entering a lake house without permission, 11Alive reported. The homeowner held Kamau at gunpoint and called the police. When officers arrived, the mayor claimed he was taking his dog to a nearby park when he saw his ""dream home"" and knowingly trespassed because he wanted to buy it. He was later released on an $11,000 bond.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T00:40:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/local/2025/01/18/georgia-black-lives-matter-mayor-under-fire-for-spending-thousands-of-taxpayer-funds-on-africa-trip/
Former Intel Officials: Tulsi Gabbard Puts Party Loyalty Far Behind Duty to Country,"Former intelligence officials said that Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard has put ""party loyalty far behind duty to country."" In the week after his historic election, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Gabbard to serve as director of National Intelligence. ""For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,"" Trump s aid in a written statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!"" Gabbard thanked Trump on X ""for the opportunity to serve as a member of your cabinet to defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people,"" adding, ""I look forward to getting to work."" Her nomination garnered swift backing from many leaders in the intelligence community. Bernard Hudson, a retired CIA official who was the agency's chief of counterterrorism, where he oversaw the CIA's efforts in the Global War on Terror, said in a statement to Breitbart News, ""To be successful, a Director of National Intelligence must have two key attributes. One, they need to have the confidence of the President. An intelligence chief without this is going to be a severe disadvantage in trying to carry out their duties. Tulsi Gabbard clearly has the confidence of the incoming Chief Executive. Two, the DNI needs to be willing to speak truth to power, no matter what the personal or political cost to them. This tends to be easier said than done. Tulsi Gabbard has already demonstrated she is willing to pay a steep price for speaking uncomfortable truths. ""During her run for the Democratic nomination for President, she demonstrated this time and time again. And she paid a price for it, but it had not deterred her from seeking and speaking the truth. In regards to her experience with the intelligence world, she's been both a consumer of tactical and strategic intelligence,"" he continued. ""As a soldier, especially during her combat tour in Iraq, she has seen the value, and sometimes the limitations, of tactical intelligence for the warfighter."" As a member of congress sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was privy to and responsible for understanding and supporting some of the most sensitive and vast global intelligence programs the United States has. Lastly, she is someone who has put party loyalty far behind duty to the country,"" the former senior CIA officer concluded in his statement to Breitbart News. ""That bipartisan background should help her demonstrate to the American people that the intelligence community she leads is a non-partisan tool that supports the key interests of the United States and its key allies."" Robert C. O'Brien, who served as the 27th U.S. National Security Adviser under Trump, on Sunday wrote an op-ed calling on the Senate to confirm Gabbard and all of Trump's national security nominees. He explained: Gabbard also has an open mind and the curiosity necessary to evaluate complex and, often, contradictory reports that are commonplace in the Intel World. Her path from congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate to supporting President Trump demonstrates her ability to put country above party and ideology when the facts require courageous action. ... In my hours of meetings with Gabbard since her nomination, it is clear why the president selected her to serve as DNI. She listens, she asks questions that go to the heart of the matter being discussed and she is concise and eloquent in sharing her views. She is also unafraid of the IC bureaucracy that she will have to reform and bring into the 21 st Century by rooting out partisanship and introducing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing into both intelligence collection and analysis. On Sunday, Gabbard received the backing of Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee after the nominee said she believes in balancing the need for protecting Americans' civil liberties and national security. Lankford explained: She's now coming in and saying, those changes have been done because even since she was in Congress, there have been quite a few changes that we've made in Congress to make sure we're protecting the civil rights of Americans. But when she came out and said, ""Hey, this is something I'm going to stand for"" – that's part of the role of the Director of National Intelligence is to make sure we're actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:25:04+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/former-intel-officials-director-national-intelligence-nominee-tulsi-gabbard-put-party-loyalty-far-behind-duty-to-country/
Poll Shows Post-Election Crash in Public Tolerance for Illegal Migration,"Just 10 percent of Americans oppose President Donald Trump's promise to deport illegal migrants with criminal records, according to an Ipsos poll for the New York Times . In contrast, 87 percent support the deportations strongly or ""somewhat,"" so providing a broad consensus for a national enforcement campaign. And just 19 percent of Americans — fewer than one in five — strongly oppose ""deporting all immigrants who are here illegally ,"" the Ipsos poll also showed. Fifty-six percent support the deportations strongly or somewhat. The post-election collapse of tolerance for illegal migration was spotlighted Saturday when the newspaper posted its early-January poll of 2,128 citizens and residents that confirmed recent polling trends . The broad shift in political opinion — dubbed a ""preference cascade"" by academics — was likely caused when Trump's campaign and November win showed Americans how many other Americans oppose migration. The new numbers will help Trump and his deputies begin the careful, low-drama, and gradual removal of millions of wage-cutting, rent-spiking migrants from U.S. society. A patient and popular enforcement campaign will also help shift the political attention to the even bigger impact of legal migration on Americans. Already, the rising public demand for less legal migration was spotlighted over Christmas when Twitter erupted in a furious debate over white-collar migration via the H-1B visa program. That drama was ignored by the poll but is expected to rise as the nation draws closer to the 2026 election. Pro-migration groups, however, hope the Trump enforcement is chaotic and rushed because any tactical mistakes will help their media allies paint the repatriations as cruel and counterproductive. The newspaper's coverage of the poll downplays the drama, saying : Many Americans who otherwise dislike President-elect Donald J. Trump share his bleak assessment of the country's problems and support some of his most contentious prescriptions to fix them, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Ipsos . The new poll includes much evidence that GOP voters are leading Democrats away from their politically disastrous support for the quasi-open borders policies put in place by President Joe Biden's pro-migration, Cuban-born border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. For example, only 16 percent of Democrats oppose the deportation of criminal migrants, and only 34 percent of Democrats now ""strongly"" oppose the deportation of "" all immigrants [emphasis added] who are here illegally."" Overall, 55 percent want all migrants to be deported, and 87 percent want crminal migrants to be deported. These numbers — the approaching 20256 midterm elections — help to explain why a critical share of Senate Democrats are expected on Monday to support the Laken Riley bill that would allow the detention of criminal migrants. Similarly, 56 percent said the Mayorkas migration has caused more crime. Just 38 percent — including 63 percent of Democrats, said the migration ""doesn't have much impact on crime."" The poll said that 41 percent of Americans, including 68 percent of GOP voters — say ""immigrants today are a burden on our country because they take our jobs, housing and health care."" However, the ""forced choice"" question did not offer alternative answers, so it prodded 56 percent of respondents to say immigrants ""strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents."" There is much evidence that legal and illegal migration makes ordinary Americans poor and less productive . Elsewhere in the poll, Ipsos asked if there were too many or too few legal migrants. Thirty percent said too many, and just 24 percent said too few. But the plurality of 43 percent picked a middle option — ""the right number"" — likely because the respondents do not know that Biden's deputies imported roughly one migrant for every American birth since 2021. Other recent polls show less support for migration. A January 5-8 survey by YouGov showed a 34 percent plurality believes legal migration makes the nation ""worse off,"" and a 41 percent plurality favor cuts or ending legal migration. Just 17 percent favor additional legal migration. Similarly, a January 8 poll by YouGov showed that 27 percent of Americans want the white-collar H-1B migration program to be reduced or eliminated, while only 17 percent want it increased. Among Republicans, 40 percent want to cut or eliminate the program, while only 12 percent want it to be expanded.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:08:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/18/poll-shows-post-election-crash-in-public-tolerance-for-illegal-migration/
Google CEO to Attend Inauguration After Hosting Party for Left Resistance,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai will attend Monday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump after the search giant in November planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to ""resist the Republican agenda."" The inauguration will feature many of the most prominent Silicon Valley leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and Google's Pichai. While other big tech platforms have tried to steer right in the aftermath of Trump's landslide election, Google reportedly planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those affiliated with the super PAC sought to ""resist the Republican agenda."" Breitbart News's Lucas Nolan wrote : According to an invitation obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Priorities USA will first hold a ""digital retrospective"" to discuss the role of online campaigning in the 2024 election cycle and strategize ways to ""resist the Republican agenda."" Following this meeting, Google will co-host a social hour for the attendees. Priorities USA, which has received substantial funding from billionaire donors such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg, reportedly spent $75 million on digital mobilization efforts to support Harris's campaign. The timing of the event is particularly notable, as President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Google, accusing the company of rigging its search engine to promote negative stories about him. While Trump has indicated that he may not pursue breaking up Google as a monopoly, he has vowed to take action to ensure that the search engine is ""more fair."" A Google spokesperson said that the big tech company will host the happy hour for Priorities USA; however, the spokesman said that the company would not participate in the ""digital retrospective"" event. ""We did not participate in creating the content of the meeting.

Exclusive--Kentucky AG Commissioner: Confirmation of USDA Nominee Brooke Rollins Will Help Make America Healthy Again,"Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said on Breitbart News Saturday that swiftly confirming agriculture secretary nominee Brooke Rollins will aid the Trump administration's efforts to Make America Healthy Again. Shell spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as nearly two dozen state agricultural commissioners have called for a speedy confirmation of Rollins. ""There is no mystery as to why President-elect Donald J. Trump won 433 of the nation's 444 farming-dependent counties with an average of 77.7% of the vote,"" the commissioners wrote in their letter. Shell said that Rollins will have the policy acumen to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one of the largest federal departments. ""What I love about her the most is she comes from a policy background, the think tank world,"" Shell remarked. Rollins has led many major conservative think tanks, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the Trump-backed America First Policy Institute. ""She brings a different perspective that will solidify what we need to move into the future for Kentucky agriculture and American agriculture and our interests abroad,"" the Kentucky commissioner wrote. Shell noted that Rollins can help push back against other countries' unfair trade practices to boost American agriculture and cut ""so much red tape"" holding back American farmers. He also argued that if President-elect Donald Trump could do ""one thing"" to aid farmers, it would be to lower gas prices. Shell noted that Rollins could work alongside Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to enact the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. He said that ""food is medicine"" and that health starts with decentralizing our food system. Shell also noted that schools often do not provide the proper food for America's school children. ""There's no way to make America Healthy Again without American farming and American agriculture. It starts with the food that we eat,"" he explained to Breitbart News Saturday .

NYT Exposes 6 People Responsible for Trying to Cover Up Joe Biden's Health,"""Six key people"" knew of President Joe Biden's condition for years and tried to cover it up, the New York Times reported Friday. The establishment media tried for years to help the president appear able to lead the nation, but now that Biden is set to retire from office, some in the media are beginning to expose those who worked behind the scenes to cover up the state of Biden's health. The six key people who covered up Biden's health situation were, according to the Times' Katie Rogers, Adam Entous, Maggie Haberman, and Carl Hulse: First Lady Jill Biden Hunter Biden Mike Donilon, the president's longtime strategist, Steve Ricchetti, the president's lawyer Annie Tomasini, the deputy chief of staff Anthony Bernal, the first lady's most senior aide Many — if not all — of those named in the report still claim Biden is fit to serve. ""I mean, today, I think he has a full schedule,"" Jill Biden recently told the Washington Post . ""He started early with interviews and briefings, and it just keeps going."" ""We can get through it,"" Ricchetti reportedly told lawmakers about Biden's health before he stepped aside as a candidate. ""We think our allies on the Hill are wrong."" The Times reported on the coverup: The people closest to President Biden were well aware that he had changed. He talked more slowly than he had just a few years before, needed to hoist himself out of his seat in the presidential limousine and walked with a halting gait. ... The president's acknowledgment has put a new spotlight on his family and inner circle, all of whom dismissed concerns from voters and Mr. Biden's own party that he was too old for the job. And yet they recognized his physical frailty to a greater degree than they have publicly acknowledged. Then they cooperated, according to interviews with more than two dozen aides, allies, lawmakers and donors, to manage his decline. They rearranged meetings to make sure Mr. Biden was in a better mood — a strategy one person close to him described as how aides should handle any president. At times, they delayed sharing information with him, including negative polling data, as they debated the best way to frame it. They surrounded him with aides when he walked from the White House to the waiting presidential helicopter on the South Lawn so that news cameras could not capture his awkward bearing. The Times's report is corroborated. Biden's aides successfully covered up his health until he stepped into the spotlight for July's debate, according to Wall Street Journal interviews with nearly 50 people, including many who had direct knowledge of the operation. Interviews conducted by the Journal reveal Biden's aides protected the ""diminished"" president from cabinet members, donors, pollsters, and top Democrat lawmakers, who might have undermined the aides' directives. Biden's aides reportedly excluded negative stories about the president in his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign. Those closest to the president took the following actions to cover up Biden's health, the Journal reported: Adjusted the presidential schedule, starting at the beginning of his term, due to ""Biden's advanced age"" Limited Biden's schedule because he ""became tired if meetings went long"" causing him to ""make mistakes"" Told ""visitors to keep meetings focused,"" including meetings with senior Democrat lawmakers and some cabinet members Excluded negative stories about the president from his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign Implemented greater than normal ""controls"" over who Biden ""spoke with,"" what they ""said to him"" Limited ""the sources of information he consumed"" Gave Biden great assistance at public events, which was characterized as ""hand holding"" unlike ""other recent presidents have had"" Allowed Biden to start his day later in the morning, ""since Biden has never been at his best first thing"" Handled things in such a way that ""[a]t least one cabinet member stopped requesting calls with the president, because it was clear that such requests wouldn't be welcome"" Dictated agency ""decisions and expect[ed] cabinet agencies to carry them out"" Fielded concerns from cabinet members, who were mostly not allowed to take their concerns directly to the president Tried to protect the president, who ""couldn't recall lines that his team had previously discussed with him"" during meetings Prevented the press, donors, and stakeholders in Biden's campaign from direct contact with the president Often repeated ""basic instructions to him, such as where to enter or exit a stage"" Looked for a ""voice coach to improve the president's fading warble"" Many Republicans believed Biden was in poor health for years. The speculation, based on visual evidence, appeared to be confirmed when Special Counsel Robert Hur characterized Biden in February 2024 as ""an elderly man with a poor memory.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T20:46:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/nyt-exposes-six-people-responsible-trying-cover-up-joe-bidens-health/
WaPo Admits Trump 'Already Conquered' Washington Before Inauguration ,"President-elect Donald Trump ""already conquered"" Washington, DC, before Inauguration Day, the Washington Post 's Marianne LeVine , Clara Ence Morse, and Aaron Schaffer admitted Saturday. The report details a ""stark contrast to his divisive entry in 2017 and departure in 2021"" compared to Trump's reelection, but it failed to mention the amount of obstacles he overcame to achieve the greatest political comeback in American history. Trump ultimately defeated political opponents who tried to imprison him, bankrupt him, remove him from the ballot, and make him politically irrelevant by introducing a partisan committee to investigate January 6 — and whose inflammatory rhetoric created a ripe environment for two assassination attempts. The omission amplifies the Post's framing of Trump's return to Washington: President-elect Donald Trump is returning to Washington triumphant: His legal cases are behind him, corporate executives are flocking to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, his inaugural committee has raised record sums of money for Monday's ceremony and the Republican Party is now fully in his control. It's a stark contrast both to his 2017 inauguration — when Trump came to Washington as a political unknown without close personal relationships to his Cabinet or congressional leaders — and to his departure from the Oval Office in January 2021, when he was widely condemned for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Now, many of his Cabinet picks appear poised to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate, including his controversial pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, whose nomination seemed in danger just a month ago. Trump is expected to sign scores of executive orders as he takes office, especially on the border, a central issue of his presidential campaign. He is personally closer to his proposed Cabinet and other top aides compared with eight years ago and is enjoying some of the highest favorability ratings of his political career. Days before coming into office, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that both Trump and President Joe Biden have sought to take credit for. The report did mention how Trump's polling numbers are high, perhaps as high as they ever have been. A CNN poll found Trump's approval rating was 48 percent, up from 39 percent just last year. Trump's imminent return to Washington has caused President Joe Biden to feel ""totally dejected,"" NBC News reported based on people who recently met with officials. The mood at the White House reflects the state of the Democrat party. The shattered party does not appear to know why Trump won or how to prevent further Democrat defeats. It is in the middle of revamping its nine-year-old talking points that claimed without evidence that Trump and Republicans were racist, bigots, and misogynists. In recent weeks, the bewildered party does not seem equipped to mount a strong resistance to Trump's cabinet nominees, most of whom appear to be on a glide path to confirmation, although Senate Democrats might try delay tactics, moves that are expected but can be overcome with strong Senate Republican leadership. ""It's hard to reflect, it's hard for it to sink in that we're done here — until we're actually done and out the gates with our stuff,"" one White House official told NBC News. ""That's their mood... it hasn't sunk in for people who are still here yet because we're working until the last minute.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:55:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2025/01/18/wapo-admits-trump-already-conquered-washington-before-inauguration/
"Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross Attend Pre-Inauguration Crypto Ball -- Both Fantasized About Killing Trump","Rappers Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross appeared at the pre-inauguration ""Crypto Ball"" on Friday — signaling a change of heart for both rappers after they fantasized about killing President-elect Donald Trump in their music, with Snoop even pretending to point a gun at the then-president in a music video. Snoop Dogg headlined the pro-Trump Crypto Ball event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington D.C., with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in attendance — along with other rappers including Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, according to multiple reports. Video footage from the party has gone viral, showing Snoop Dogg taking the stage to perform a set for the tuxedoed crowd. In a video message , Ross denied he was performing at the event, though he did appear to confirm his attendance saying, ""it's a private 'vibe' I'm doing with my brother Snoop Dogg."" However, additional viral footage from Friday's party showed Ross performing on stage. Snoop Dogg vehemently opposed Trump during his first term in the White House. In 2017, the rapper starred in a politically-charged music video for the single ""Lavender"" that saw the rapper pull a gun and ""shoot"" a parody clown version of then-President Donald Trump. Rick Ross also fantasized about the death of Trump. In a music video for his single ""Free Enterprise"" released in 2016, Ross rapped: ""Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman/Now accept these words as they came from Eminem."" The lyrics are an apparent reference to George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Rapper Soulja Boy has publicly opposed Trump, attacking fellow rapper Kanye West during a radio interview in 2019 by questioning his support for the then-president in a profane rant. ""You supporting Trump, bruh? What the fuck wrong with you, bruh? That shit not right, bruh,"" Soulja Boy erupted on The Breakfast Club. Snoop Dogg signaled a change of heart when it comes to Trump a year ago during a conversation with the U.K. Sunday Times. ""Donald Trump? He ain't done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris,"" he told the outlet, later adding: ""So I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump."" Friday's Crypto Ball was a private, four-hour affair, with tickets going for $2,500 and $5,000, according to a report from Coindesk. Other attendees included Trump's crypto czar pick, David Sacks, as well as tech entrepreneurs Michael Saylor, Brian Armstrong, and the Winklevoss brothers.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:50:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/18/snoop-dogg-rick-ross-attend-pre-inauguration-crypto-ball-both-fantasized-about-killing-trump/
Brad Sherman Criticizes Pacific Palisades Residents Who Returned to Their Homes,"Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) criticized residents of the Pacific Palisades who had returned to their homes without authorization, telling a telephone town hall on Wednesday that they had ""ruined"" things for other local residents. Sherman was providing information about federal relief funds and fielding questions about when people would be allowed to return to their homes — whether to remove any remaining belongings, or simply to grieve the ruins. The Los Angeles Police Department and the National Guard are currently denying entry to residents in the evacuation zones, and have said that anyone caught violating a 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew in the area will be arrested. He said that while police escorts had been provided for some residents for several days (Jan. 9-11), they had been suspended — and he blamed the fact that some people had tried to return to their homes, often successfully. You're gonna say, ""Well, why not at least let me in to check out my own house?"" Um, they were doing that for a while, they didn't have the resources. And then there's another problem that I hesitate to mention and that is some people were taken in to look and they stayed, they ""de-evacuated"" themselves, they walked in their front door and locked it behind them, and, uh, they were not arrested. And so, uh, they kind of ruined it for other people. Of course the research commitment is also very high to, to, to escort people back in. So they've got to deal with the toxic chemicals, they've got to deal with the safety of the utilities, in order to, uh, uh, I, in order to let people into the fire area. I'm sure we'll get more questions on that. Sherman's comments triggered outrage among some residents, who are worried about looting and who have, in some cases, hired private security companies to protect their neighborhoods, or have slipped past police and the National Guard. There are a few residents who have refused to evacuate, preferring to live secretly in their surviving homes without electricity, power, gas, or water rather than to leave. One homeless man, ""Eric,"" lives openly in the burn zone.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:18:42+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/brad-sherman-criticizes-pacific-palisades-residents-who-returned-to-their-homes/
"Israel Will Release Mass Murderers, Terrorists in Hostage Deal","Israel will release major terrorists, including those who have murdered dozens of civilians, in exchange for the 33 hostages who will be freed by Hamas from captivity in Gaza, where they have been held illegally for 470 days of war. Under the terms of the deal, there will be a ceasefire lasting six weeks (42 days), during which Hamas will free several living hostages once a week, plus twelve hostages in the final week, freeing living hostages before deceased ones. In return, Israel will withdraw partially from Gaza, and will release roughly 1,900 terrorists — including nearly 1200 who were arrested during the war, and more than 700 who were already serving prison sentences in Israeli prisons. While no terrorists who took part in the October 7, 2023, attacks will be released, Israel has agreed to release some terrorists who committed mass murder in past terrorist attacks. For example, according to Israel's Army Radio, one terrorist who will be released was involved in planning a suicide bombing at the Megiddo junction in northern Israel in 2002, during the second intifada . The attack killed 17 innocent civilians who were simply riding a public bus. The Israeli government said Saturday that authorities would begin notifying families of victims of terror that those involved in the murders of their relatives were about to be released. The ceasefire-and-hostage deal goes into effect on Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. local time in Israel — though there could still be snags. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government will not go through with the deal unless Hamas fulfills its obligation to provide the names of the hostages to be released. The Red Cross is preparing to handle the transfer of hostages, as it did in the last truce, in November 2023, though the international agency has come under criticism for failing to visit the hostages during their captivity, and allowing Hamas to use the releases as propaganda events. Update: Netanyahu addressed his nation on Saturday night, emphasizing that Israel had not given up its military gains in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. He quoted from the Bible, citing Jeremiah 31:16: ""And the children shall return to their borders.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:45:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/18/israel-will-release-mass-murderers-terrorists-in-hostage-deal/
Aggressive Driver Shot Numerous Times After Allegedly Chasing Couple,"An aggressive driver was shot numerous times Friday night in Houston, Texas, after allegedly brake-checking, blocking, and chasing a couple riding in another vehicle.

There was also a pregnant woman in the car with the younger man. The driver allegedly brake-checked the 20-year-old, drove into oncoming traffic to get beside him, and finally, blocked the car's forward motion, then exited his truck with his hand near his pockets.

""The default position of Republican senators is this is a convincing election,"" he said, explaining that it is presidents who decide who they want in their cabinet, not senators.

Poll: Plurality Either 'Enthusiastic' or 'Satisfied' with Next 4 Years of Trump,"A plurality is either ""enthusiastic"" or ""satisfied"" with President-elect Donald Trump leading the country over the next four years, according to the latest weekly survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, ""How do you feel about the next 4 years with Donald Trump as president?"" Overall, 47 percent are either enthusiastic or satisfied. Of those, 31 percent said they are enthusiastic, and 16 percent are satisfied. Another 31 percent said they are actively upset, and 13 percent are ""dissatisfied but not upset."" Another nine percent remain unsure. Predictably, most Democrats — 60 percent — are upset, compared to 31 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans who feel the same. One in five independents said they are enthusiastic, as did 71 percent of Republicans. Only two percent of Democrats feel the same way. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 U.S. citizens. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey comes as the Democrat Party remains in disarray after its loss to Trump — a loss that occurred even after they subverted the will of their voters and coronated Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump instead of President Joe Biden. To their surprise, Trump not only won the election but secured every single swing stat, as well as the popular vote. RELATED — Trump: MAGA Saving, Not Threatening Democracy Biden, 82, still believes that he would have defeated Trump had he remained the Democrat nominee. ""Do you believe you could have won in November?"" USA Today 's Susan Page asked Biden in a January interview. ""It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,"" he said, referencing polling. However, Biden was not so confident that he would have the ""vigor"" to serve four more years. ""Do you think you would've had the vigor to serve another four years in office?"" she asked. ""I don't know. That's why I thought when I first announced, talking to Barack about it, I said I thought I was the person,"" he said, adding: I had no intention of running after Beau died – for real, not a joke. And then when Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn't looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton. But I don't know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old? Trump's inauguration is less than a week away. So far, the president-elect's inaugural committee has raised over $170 million, according to reports.

The high inflation rate came in second place with 17 percent choosing that as Biden's biggest failure. In third place is Biden's decision to run for a second term, with eight percent choosing that as the biggest failure of his presidency. Six percent said Biden's biggest failure is the withdrawal from Afghanistan, six percent said handling the Israel-Hamas conflict, five percent said handling investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, five percent said pardoning Hunter Biden, and four recent said ineffective messaging. Another three percent said his handling of abortion policy, and three percent said the increase of the national debt. One-third of Republicans chose border and immigration handling as Biden's biggest failure, and 24 percent of independents agreed. Fifteen percent of Democrats said Biden's decision to run for a second term was his biggest flop. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 respondents. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels ""like a morgue"" and ""glum"" as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in. According to NBC News : In the White House, the mood feels ""like a morgue,"" according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don't appreciate.

Outrage over Short Prison Sentences for Grooming Gang Child Rapists,"The British judicial system has come under criticism after eight child rape grooming gang members were given what some feel were light sentences for the abuse and rape of two girls in Keighley in the late 1990s. The West Yorkshire Police revealed Friday that over the past two years, the Bradford Crown Court has sentenced eight members of a grooming gang over the sexual exploitation of two young girls between 1996 and 1999. However, the announcement was mired by what many saw as overly-lenient sentences for child rape, particularly given that most offenders in Britain are released after serving just half their sentences behind bars. This would likely mean that some of those imprisoned by the Bradford court would serve less than two years in prison for raping a child. The police force said that following the first trial, which concluded on October 20th of 2023, five men were jailed, including Amreaz Asghar,47, for four and a half years for rape, Perwaz Asghar, 50, for six and a half years for two indecent assaults, Mohammed Din, 47, for 14 years for 11 counts of rape, Sajid Mahmood Khan, 45, for three years for rape, and Zehroon Razak, 47, for six and a half years for rape. Following the conclusion of the second trial, which concluded on Friday, a further three men were sentenced, though two were tried in absentia as their whereabouts are currently unknown. The West Yorkshire Police said that Ibrar Hussain, 47, was jailed for six and a half years for two counts of rape. The two men tried in absentia, Fayaz Ahmed, 45, and Imtiaz Ahmed, 61, were sentenced to seven and a half years and nine years in prison, respectively. The two victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 years old during the time of the grooming offences. Mohammed Din was convicted of raping both girls, while the other men were convicted of raping the first victim to come forward to police, which she did as an adult. Responding to the sentences, former detective turned grooming gang whistleblower Maggie Oliver said : ""These sentences in this Keighley group rape gang case just beggar belief, again – children of 13/14 raped repeatedly and their rapists will serve HALF these sentences!!!! So 18 months for one of the rapists, just over 2 years for another. ""Shocking! Yet again! And I honestly find myself lost for words, and I've no doubt the police officers who have put this case together are equally disgusted with these sentences! Disgusting!"" Grooming gang victim and activist Sammy Woodhouse added : ""The Judges in the UK are sentencing men to 3 years for raping a child. He won't even serve half of that. Absolutely vile. No wonder there's so many children being raped in our country."" The British public also appears to want harsher sentencing for grooming gang child rapists. According to a survey published this week by Friderichs Advisory and JL Partners, some 47 per cent of Britons support life sentences for such offenders, while 30 per cent backed the death penalty for grooming gang child rapists. Following the publication of the sentences in Keighley, Detective Chief Inspector Vicky Greenbank of Bradford District Police said: ""We welcome the sentences that have been handed down to these men. Cases such as these are incredibly sensitive and complex and it has taken years of painstaking investigation to bring them before the courts. ""I would like to take this opportunity to praise both victims for coming forward and reporting these offences to the police. They have both shown immense patience whilst the criminal investigation has been ongoing and courage throughout the court process. ""The abuse both girls endured robbed them of their childhood and I hope seeing these men sentenced for these horrendous offences, will give them justice and some closure.""

'Shark Tank' Investor O'Leary Offers $20 Billion Cash to Buy China's TikTok,"Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary is offering $20 billion in cash to buy communist China's social media platform TikTok. During an interview Friday on Fox News's America's Newsroom , O'Leary said , ""Right now, $20 billion's on the table. Cash."" O'Leary said in March that he or another American would buy TikTok to keep it from being shut down, per Breitbart News. He stated at the time, ""It [is] not going to get banned. I'm going to buy it. Somebody will buy it. It won't be Meta and Google. A regulator will stop that. A syndicate will be formed. I'd like to be involved obviously. What I would do is form a bipartisan committee, an advisory committee for 18 months. Go to them and say to them, how much will you let me keep of the Chinese?"" There have been strong opinions regarding a potential ban of TikTok as users, who are mostly teenagers and young adults, do not want access interrupted or restricted, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. O'Leary's recent $20 billion offer comes after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law requiring the company to find a buyer or face being banned, the Fox report continued: In its decision, the Supreme Court backed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a law passed by Congress last April with wide bipartisan support. The law gave TikTok nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services. Congress has voiced concerns about how the app could be used as a weapon or a way to gather massive amounts of data from users. ""TikTok, ByteDance and several users of the app swiftly sued to block the ban in May, arguing the legislation would suppress free speech for the millions of Americans who use the platform,"" the Fox article reads. ""After a lower court upheld the ban, the Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok's emergency request to either block or pause implementation of the law under a fast-track timeline just nine days before the ban was slated to go into effect,"" it said. TikTok will ""go dark"" when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday unless a deal is made to keep it going, O'Leary said. Meanwhile, TikTok users are reportedly shifting over to another app called Xiaohongshu, or ""Little Red Book"" as the ban looms, Breitbart News reported on Friday. ""Xiaohongshu, which Chinese media is referring to as 'RedNote' in an apparent bid to distance it from its Mandarin name – is also controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and is named after all-time murder champion Mao Zedong's 'Little Red Book' of communism,"" the article said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:15:58+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-offers-20-billion-cash-buy-chinas-tiktok/
"GOP Rep. Pushes Bill Prohibiting State Bans on Certain Rifles, Shotguns","Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) introduced legislation this week that would prevent states from banning rifles and/or shotguns that are legal federally. The legislation, the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), would operate as a national preemption law, preventing states from banning firearms the federal government has not banned. Moreover, it would undo bans contained in laws like New York's SAFE Act. Rochester First quoted Tenney. ""The SAGA Act nullifies New York's unconstitutional SAFE Act and prevents other states from enacting laws that violate the Second Amendment,"" she said. ""This legislation upholds our country's founding principle of protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans, even from liberal states with anti-gun policies."" The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) reached out to Breitbart News regarding SAGA, noting that the measure is cosponsored by Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and Nick Langworthy (R-NY). CCRKBA chairman Alan Gottlieb pointed to the SAGA Act, noting that it allows ""America's gun owners...[to] put anti-gun lawmakers on notice that we're tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and that our rights are more important than their ill-advised crusade to disarm law-abiding Americans and erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights."" He added, ""Millions of people already own these firearms across the country and there is no good reason to penalize them for crimes they didn't commit, and for merely choosing to exercise a right guaranteed by the Constitution.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T15:43:48+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2025/01/18/gop-rep-introduces-saga-act-if-you-like-your-ar-15-you-can-keep-your-ar-15/
"Wilders: Unlike Trump's America, EU Bigwigs Censor to 'Protect Democracy' from Voters","Next Tuesday, the European Parliament will discuss with the European Commission the ""need to enforce the Digital Services Act to protect democracy on social media platforms, including against foreign interference and biased algorithms."" The Digital Services Act (DSA) is the central European Union legislation regulating social media. The EU bigwigs in Brussels are up in arms because Elon Musk had a chat on X with Alice Weidel, leader of the Alternative for Germany. The AfD is an increasingly popular right-wing party which the EU establishment wants to isolate in a cordon sanitaire. According to the European Commission, Ms. Weidel's chat with Mr. Musk ""improperly boosts"" her agenda over her political rivals ahead of Germany's upcoming Feb. 23 elections and constitutes ""foreign interference"" in the German electoral process. Brussels has also reacted in outrage to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent announcement to end the fact-checking era on Facebook and restore free expression. Zuckerberg regretted that in the past, Facebook had suppressed information, and he confirmed years of systematic online censorship, either on demand of politically biased ""fact-checkers"" or under direct government pressure. While the American elections were ""a cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech,"" Mr. Zuckerberg pointed out that Europe has yet to come to the same conclusion. ""Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship,"" he said. The Meta boss was at once denounced by the European Commission. He is not telling the truth when he says the EU is institutionalizing censorship, European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen whined. It is ""not true"" and ""misleading,"" she wailed. At the same time, she took a snipe at Elon Musk for his support of AfD on X, threatening the platform with legal sanctions, saying that X has ""obligations under our Digital Services Act and X is supposed to assess and mitigate the risks they are posing to our electoral processes and to civic discourse."" Last December, the presidential elections in Romania were annulled after an outsider had surprisingly won the first round with 23 per cent of the vote. According to the EU bigwigs, this was the result of foreign ""disinformation"" spread via TikTok and other social media platforms. While the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA) pays lip service to freedom of speech, it acts as an instrument to restrict freedom of speech and censor social media platforms so that ""risks to the electoral processes and civic discourse"" are ""mitigated"". On these platforms, politicians such as I, who were the victims of media bias, but also every citizen, can freely speak our minds and voice our opinions without ""mitigation"" by the powers that be. The fact that platforms such as X and Facebook are owned by Americans is used as a xenophobic pretext to add ""foreign interference"" to ""the risks to Europe's electoral processes and civic discourse."" The EU uses the word ""democracy"" in the same way as the former Communist dictatorship in East-Germany used to call itself the German ""Democratic"" Republic. In the infamous G""D""R, ""democracy"" also needed to be protected against critics who were said to be in cahoots with foreign powers. I am the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), by far the most popular party in the Netherlands. For decades, the PVV and other parties like mine have hardly ever been fairly treated by mainstream journalists. But never did the European Commission voice any concern about how the disinformation about us might ""improperly boost"" our political adversaries or how it might subvert the ""electoral process."" I am not complaining, just pointing out the EU hypocrisy. I am not complaining, because guess what? The scandalous behaviour of the mainstream media had the same effect as water on a duck's back. It flowed off us. The voters kept coming to us because voters are mature enough to make their own decisions. For decades, we were also the victims of outright censorship by some social media outlets. Parties like mine have been censored online for years. I am one of many like-minded European politicians whose views were banned. Whenever we voiced our opinion on Islamization or mass immigration, so-called fact-checkers had our messages removed as ""hate speech"". It happened to me on Twitter — before that company was bought by Elon Musk — and on YouTube. Despite years of social media censorship, however, we kept winning the elections. Voters can feel when they are being lied to. They sense when they are being deceived. They realize well enough that the authorities are deceiving them when social media remains silent about what is happening on the streets of Europe. Indeed, the electorate is mature enough to make their own decisions. Companies like X and Facebook are abandoning censorship. I applaud them for that. The mainstream media say they ""sprint to kiss Trump's ring"" and ""suck up to the incoming president,"" but the decision is plain common sense. Censorship is a costly business and just not worth the effort. The mainstream media refuse to see it, but they are a dying breed. Who cares about what The Guardian writes? Parties such as mine have survived decades of media bias and disinformation; if anything, it has only made us stronger and more popular. Ultimately, we won. This will happen everywhere. Ultimately, freedom and truth will prevail! The only ""risk to the electoral processes"" that I see in Europe, is the EU ""interfering"" in elections because Brussels does not like the outcome and claims it has to protect ""democracy"" against the voters.

Maine Admits Licensing Transnational Criminal Organizations to Grow Marijuana,"Maine's Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) Director John Hudak told state legislators he is aware that his office has been issuing marijuana grow licenses to persons associated with Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO). On Wednesday, Hudak told members of the state legislature's Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee that his agency cannot deny the medical licensing requests. Hudak told the committee members that state statutes did not give his office the authority to deny the licenses to the suspected Transnational Criminal Organizations. Hudak's statements were made in response to concerns about illegal cannabis cultivation in parts of Maine that are believed to be controlled by Asian Transnational Criminal Organizations, including those with connections to China. Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow, told the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee legislators that individuals associated with the TCOs who have had to grow operations raided by authorities in the past are now using the medicinal license application process to continue their illicit activity and avoid law enforcement scrutiny. Hudak elaborated saying ""They're applying so they can have a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card, or what they perceive as a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card to continue to do the operations that they're doing."" Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) addressed the issue of foreign criminal organizations operating in her state with FBI Director Christopher Wray during a June FBI budget hearing just days after a Somerset County Sheriff's Office raid shut down an illegal growing operation that involved 1,500 marijuana plants and more than 30 pounds of processed marijuana. The unlawful growing operation was located adjacent to a daycare. During the hearing, Collins asked Wray, ""What is the theory about why Chinese nationals or Chinese Transnational Criminal Organizations are setting up these illegal marijuana growing operations in states like Maine?"" Wray responded saying the FBI was actively conducting several investigations into the connections between illegal grow operations and the Chinese government itself. Still, no clear connections had been established at the time. Wray did, however, acknowledge the agency is seeing more ties between the growing operations and Chinese organized crime. As for why the Chinese TCOs are choosing to engage in illicit marijuana cultivation, Wray went on to say, ""Our assessment is that it's a combination of the fact that it is activity that can be done relatively cheaply, and by comparison to other drugs in the United States, the consequences that they face from a legal perspective are not as severe as that they might be in other countries where they might also want to operate."" Collins has spearheaded several efforts to address the issue that she believes is assisting the Chinese TCO's to launder money for other purposes, including to bring more fentanyl into the country. The latest admission that state licensing officials knowingly provide cover for the illicit growing operations will likely hinder federal efforts to crack down on the foreign TCOs operating within the state.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T14:28:45+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/18/maine-admits-licensing-transnational-criminal-organizations-to-grow-marijuana/
GRAPHIC: Cartel Gunmen Behead Rivals as Mexican Officials Claim Crime Dramatically Lower,"Three days of shootouts led to several dead gunmen and a gory beheading as members of the terrorist organization Cartel Jalisco New Generation continued their push for control of the western state of Michoacan. This escalation in violence comes one day before Mexican government officials talked about how crime has decreased in recent weeks. On Friday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her top security officials held a news conference. During the presentation, they displayed a series of statistics claiming that violence had decreased in states like Sinaloa and Guerrero. They also claimed to have made numerous arrests and seized various weapons, causing noticeable decreases in crime. Hours before the news conference, gunmen from Cartel Jalisco New Generation photographed themselves beheading a rival in the state of Michoacan. The killing came at the end of three days of constant shootouts as CJNG has been pushing into the town of Apatzingan to take over areas controlled by a small cartel called Knights Templar. The latter cartel is allied with a ""self-defense"" group run by the narco-terrorist Juan Jose ""El Abuelo"" Farias. As Breitbart Texas first reported last year, several smaller cartels from Michoacan, including Los Viagras, the forces of El Fresa, El Boto, and others, joined forces with CJNG to fight off their rivals. Earlier this year, CJNG and its allies announced that they would be making a push for APatzingan and the surrounding communities and try to push out the Knights Templars. Since then, violence has escalated throughout the state. As Breitbart Texas reported , El Abuelo Farias has a long history of crime in Michoacan and other parts of the country and has been arrested in the past on organized crime and drug trafficking charges. However, in 2018 and other prior cases, Mexican judges ordered his release under suspicious circumstances. For several years, Michoacan has been ground zero to a fierce turf war as various organizations continue to fight for control of lucrative drug production and drug trafficking routes into Mexico.

Ukrainian Police Raid Draft-Dodgers in Nationwide Conscription Searches,"Ukrainian police conducted nationwide raids on draft dodger gangs on Friday as the country battles to generate enough conscripted soldiers to keep its military competitive in the war against Russia without radically widening recruitment criteria. The National Police of Ukraine said they conducted ""over 200 searches"" of gangs assisting illegal border crossings by adult Ukrainian males, who have been banned from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia's invasion in 2022. The searches ""at the premises of persons involved in illegal transactions"" took place in 19 of 27 Ukrainian regions, police said Friday. According to the AFP news agency, the raids against draft dodging-enabling gangs followed searches of 600 addresses last week. In a statement, Ukraine's police said draft-dodging crimes are ""committed through fraud, forgery of documents, unauthorized interference in the operation of electronic registers, and bribery of officials."" Announcing the latest raids, Ukraine's police published images, including one anonymised picture [top] of officers wearing police and 'Cyberpolice Department' patches on their coats accompanying fatigue-wearing armed officers of the national police's Special Patrol unit. While Ukraine has over a million men in its conscription army, thousands of nationals have evaded call-up orders or registration on the national database. As previously reported in 2023, 20,000 military-aged men were known to have illegally crossed Ukraine's borders by that point to flee abroad. Ukraine's border guards said then they had caught another 21,000 at the frontier and brought them back into the country. While many will presumably have fled out of concern for their own lives, attempting to go abroad is not without risks, with the Ukrainian government stating in Spring 2024 that they know of 30 people who died trying to flee the country . A spokesman for the government said those who died had attempted to get out of Ukraine by trying to cross hazardous mountain passes, swimming border rivers, and in some cases, had even been killed by wild animals in the wilderness, presumably bears, which are common in that part of Europe. Some reportedly have frozen to death trying to cross the Carpathian mountains. It is claimed that the recent crackdown on draft dodgers has caused ""panic"" among those avoiding enlistment and the criminal gangs that support them. Even before this recent change in tactics, military officers in ""conscription squads"" patrolled the streets of Ukrainian cities, checking the identities of men to ensure they had entered their details in the national database and were not fugitives if call-up papers had been served. In 2024, men were dragged out of a Kyiv nightclub if they were unable to show their identity papers or produce proof of exception from conscription amid overnight raids on restaurants, shops, and music venues. UK broadcaster the BBC noted a wedding of a young Ukrainian couple where half the guests didn't show up because they were in hiding from conscription and felt turning up was too risky, and noted: ""For those avoiding the draft, public transport is now off limits. So, too, are restaurants, supermarkets, and weekend trips to the park to play football."" The broadcaster cited the remarks of one conscription officer who said of the people he was rounding up at train stations: ""I don't consider them men. What are they waiting for? If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes, rape their women, and kill their children."" Those caught dodging can face criminal prosecution. But as reported in the Ukrainian press this week , courts can take a lenient view in rare cases. A Poltava man who was discovered to have been served call-up papers but who had ignored them for a year was let off with one year on probation as the judge noted he has an elderly mother who was dependent on his care, has a young child, and that he had made regular donations of money to the military. Ukraine reduced its minimum age of conscription from 27 to 25 last year, a difficult and unpopular decision the government had resisted in a bid to avoid a post-war demographic crisis by risking the deaths of the country's generation of future parents. The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is in the 40s. There have been protests in Ukraine by groups of wives, mothers, and children against the fact conscription is open-ended and lasts for the duration of the conflict. Protesters state they want their men back and call for a return of the pre-war standard of an 18-month callup.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T12:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/ukrainian-police-raid-draft-dodgers-in-nationwide-conscription-searches/
W.H.O. Demands World Give It $1.5 Billion to Handle Emergencies,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) launched a campaign on Thursday urging the world to invest $1.5 billion into its emergency fund – a separate pool of money from its regular operations funding intended to address health crises around the world. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus launched the campaign at a press conference on Thursday accompanied by an over 100-page brochure detailing the various global health emergencies the W.H.O. intends to address, focusing heavily on the collapse of a functioning state in Afghanistan, poor conditions caused by Hamas terrorists exploiting health centers to hide fighters and terrorists in Gaza, and the spread of cholera, malaria, and monkeypox (mpox) in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.N. agency predicted that it would have to address 42 health emergencies around the world in 2025. The costly appeal follows years of bad press as a result of the W.H.O.'s poor performance under Director-General Tedros. The W.H.O. was at the forefront of efforts in early 2020 to assure global observers that the highly contagious novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, was not capable of ""human-to-human transmission"" and later published a report on the origins of the virus so lacking in clarity that Tedros himself condemned it. Scores of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have accused W.H.O. staffers of raping them for forcing them to have sex for much-needed jobs or other humanitarian needs. In 2023, the W.H.O. paid some of the victims $250 and offered them baking classes. Tedros obtained a second term at the helm of the world's largest public health body in 2022 in an election in which he ran unopposed. The W.H.O. emergency appeal touted the agency's work in DRC, among other countries, as a prime reason for requesting upwards of a billion dollars in additional funding. The breakdown of how the agency expected to spend that money listed DRC as one of the least expensive crises for 2025, however, using up only about $2 million of the $1.5 billion requested. The most expensive crisis on the list is that in Gaza, labeled as the ""occupied Palestinian territory."" The W.H.O. is asking for nearly $300 million to address the situation in the war-torn area controlled by Hamas for nearly two decades. The W.H.O. is also asking for $141 million to offer health care and other aid to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of the Assad family dynasty in December. The ongoing crisis in Sudan, it predicted, would require $135 million to address in 2025. ""The climate crisis, increasingly frequent and severe disasters, and unprecedented levels of conflict are jeopardizing health and decimating health systems, making those displaced more susceptible to disease, and disrupting lifesaving, vaccinations and care, particularly for children,"" Tedros and W.H.O. Emergencies Director Michael Ryan wrote in a message accompanying the appeal. ""We are no longer moving from emergency to recovery but instead enduring rolling crises that extend across years and decades, making health services inaccessible to many,"" they continued. ""Yet, as the urgent need for assistance grows, the global financial landscape is shrinking, forcing us to make increasingly difficult decisions about whom we can reach and how far we can go."" In a press conference to announce the push, Tedros insisted that health crises in the modern era were ""relentless, overlapping, and intensifying."" ""Without adequate and sustainable funding we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not,"" he noted grimly. The two branded offering funding to the W.H.O. a ""powerful act of global solidarity"" that could ""save lives ... uphold the universal right to health, and to help restore peace to communities."" The appeal emphasized that this $1.5 billion is intended for the W.H.O. Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE), not the general pool of funding for the W.H.O. The CFE is distinct from general funding in that it is easier and faster to use those funds and is intended, the agency explained, to ""revolutionize how public health emergencies are addressed."" While claiming the funds will be used to address health emergencies explicitly, the appeal's brochure repeatedly emphasizes the agency's fixation on ""climate change,"" declaring it ""a health crisis"" itself ""wreaking havoc on human health, societies, economies, and overwhelming health care systems worldwide."" ""Climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, are intensifying disease outbreaks and worsening health inequities,"" the W.H.O. claimed. ""WHO leads emergency responses and builds resilience in health systems to mitigate these impacts."" The agency also claimed the money would help in the ""prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, asserting it would fund ""strengthening the prevention of, and response to, genderbased violence, including capacity-building and increased accountability within W.H.O."" This commitment did not specifically address the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in DRC. The W.H.O.'s appeal arrived less than a week before the United States, one of the W.H.O.'s most generous donors historically, welcomes President-elect Donald Trump into the White House once again. Trump famously cut funding and withdrew from the agency in 2020 in response to its catastrophic handling of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, declaring that the W.H.O. ""failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable."" Outgoing President Joe Biden reintegrated America into the W.H.O. and restored funding. Multiple reports following Trump's election in November indicated that the president-elect is planning to withdraw from the W.H.O. ""immediately"" after taking office.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T04:20:44+00:00,National Security,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/17/w-h-o-demands-world-1-5-billion-emergencies/
Exclusive—Sen. Tim Sheehy Ushers in Bold New Era of MAGA Leadership: ‘This Country Was Not Founded by 65-Year-Old Bureaucrats’,"The United States ""was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats"" but by patriotic young risk takers, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) explained in a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Marlow opined that officials in President Joe Biden's administration like Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had ""no leadership qualities."" He questioned why the Democrats support these establishment politicians and get ""offended"" when Republicans support ""natural leaders"" who are ""outside the box thinkers"" like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth, who have been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve in his new administration. Sheehy agreed that ""leadership matters"" and said that the U.S. is dealing with multiple disasters–such as rising inflation and a ""wide open border""–because the country is being led by bureaucrats who have ""really never done anything else in their"" lives outside of politics. ""Leadership matters and decisiveness matters, and this country was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats,"" Sheehy said. ""The signers of the Declaration of Independence, I think the average age of the signers was like 24 years old. I mean, you look at — some of them were 18, 19, 21 years old. Thomas Jefferson was 33... These were young people who had a vision for the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, which is this country."" ""It wasn't 80-year-old, career government bureaucrats who took the risk to craft a new concept of human governance,"" he continued. ""It was young people who were creative, who had a decisive vision and were willing to take the risk to act on it."" Sheehy added that ""in the last 50 years,"" the U.S. ""drifted away"" from having younger political leaders and shifted instead towards having ""highly educated, highly qualified, very experienced, bureaucrats to run the government."" ""This technocrat concept, which, you know, Obama put that on afterburners and Biden just took it to a whole level further,"" Sheehy continued. ""This whole technocrat outlook–where we need these people who've really never done anything else in their life other than be involved in government policy–and the downfall of that is exactly what we're seeing. The results are laid bare: Afghanistan disaster; $36 trillion in debt and growing rapidly disaster; wide open border; 20 million illegal immigrants; we have foreign policy crises around the world; rapid inflation; record interest rates."" ""Pick a category that's going well and show it to me, because I don't think there's any of them,"" Sheehy concluded. ""And, we've been led there by people who are apparently so highly qualified to be doing it.""

Sheehy noted that over the past 18 months there have been increasingly destructive wildfires in states as far-flung as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Texas; and, thus, he argued that there was ""no excuse"" for California to have been unprepared for a similar situation. ""It's not just me saying it,"" he said. ""The entire wildland fire community has really been screaming from the rooftops for years that we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness for these types of disasters. Just look at the last 18 months. Lahaina, Maui — remember that was wiped off the map? One hundred people [were] killed. In December and November, we had fires burning in New Jersey. Last year in February, March, we had the Smokehouse Creek fire in Texas, [the] largest fire in Texas history, second largest fire in American history. And then, of course, now we're seeing literally... L.A. burning to the ground in front of us."" Sheehy added that wildfires were ""threats we can prepare for and can fight."" ""What we're seeing in L.A. particularly is the confluence and culmination of decades of wrong-headed policies that have put common sense on the back burner and instead prioritized a bunch of really goofy priorities,"" he said. He noted that the wildfires that occurred in California were not a ""Pearl Harbor moment where the first time it ever happened, nobody saw it happen."" ""This has been happening all the time. I mean, Paradise, California, wiped off the map; Lahaina, Maui, wiped off the map; as I said all the other fires I listed,"" Sheehy explained. ""This threat is not a one-time out-of-nowhere typhoon. This is something that happens every single year for decades. And there's no excuse not to be prepared. I think for those in the industry, we were more prepared about 30, 40 years ago. We had a far more supportive environment for what we called full suppression, which is when we basically have a lot of helicopters, a lot of airplanes, a lot of firefighters ready to go."" Sheehy explained that we had been seeing a ""massive decrease in suppression preparedness,"" and he attributed the decrease in wildfire suppression preparedness to environmentalists who have ""taken over"" and said, ""'Nope, fighting fire is bad.'"" He noted in particular the resistance from environmentalists to the use of water additives in fighting fires. ""Every other country in the world that fights wildfire puts foam and gel additives into the water so when they spray the fire, just like a fire extinguisher, the water foams up and is three to six times more effective to suppress that fire,"" Sheehy explained. ""Every other country in the world does that, except for, ding, ding, ding, America. And, why? Because the environmentalists have said, 'Nope, those foams could be bad for the endangered goldfish in that pond, so therefore you can't use that.'"" ""Two things can be true,"" Sheehy added. ""We can want to protect our environment and take care of our endangered species. We can also want to protect our communities and protect our people from getting burned alive and their houses burned down. We can do both. Right now, we've chosen, instead to prioritize the protection of spotted owls, and trees, and salamanders, and goldfish instead of our communities.""

Elizabeth Warren Accuses Longtime Democrat Donor Sam Altman of Seeking 'Favors' from Trump After $1 Million Inaugural Donation,"Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) in a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accused the tech entrepreneur of wanting ""favors"" from President-elect Donald Trump after donating $1 million to his inaugural committee; Altman has been a longtime donor to Democrats. ""Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats...,"" Altman wrote on X, sharing the letter he received from the two Senate Democrats. Altman has confirmed to outlets he plans to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday. It appears that the two Democrats have accused Altman of seeking some form of a quid-pro-quo scheme. ""You have a clear and direct interest in obtaining favors from the incoming administration: your company and many other Big Tech donors are already the subject of ongoing federal investigations and regulatory actions,"" Warren and Bennet claimed. The two continued, saying that the ""industry's efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules."" ""This would be good for billionaire tech executives, but is bad for America,"" they added. Warren and Bennet also said that the donation ""raise[s] questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration."" The two Senate Democrats are attacking the OpenAI CEO as many outlets have reported that Altman has overwhelmingly donated to Democrats over Republicans. In one July report, Newsweek wrote that Altman has donated to hundreds of Democrats and just one Republican. Even a cursory glance at federal election databases show that Altman has been a major funder of the Democrat Party. Altman wrote on X that his own donation ""was a personal contribution as you state; i am confused about the questions given that my company did not make a decision.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T02:02:37+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/elizabeth-warren-accuses-longtime-democrat-donor-sam-altman-of-seeking-favors-from-trump-after-1-million-inaugural-donation/
First Female Los Angeles Fire Chief Faces Calls to Resign as Blazes Rage On,"Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Chief Kristin Crowley, the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the position, is facing calls to resign as the destructive wildfires rage on in Southern California. Crowley has found herself in an awkward situation with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D), who has also received demands to step down, after she said the city ""failed"" her department and claimed that budget cuts ""limited"" their ability to respond to ""large-scale events."" The fire chief, who was appointed by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) in 2022, then ""disappeared"" into a closed-door meeting in Bass's office last Friday ""for so long that they missed an evening news briefing,"" the New York Times reported. Sources close to the situation told the Daily Mail that the mayor summoned Crowley to her office to fire her but said, ""Whatever happened in that meeting, minds got changed."" ""[Crowley] was going into the meeting, telling everybody goodbye, because she was told the whole purpose of the meeting was to fire her,"" the source told the U.K. outlet. By the next morning, the Times reported that the chief and the mayor were ""projecting a unified front, though the tension was apparent."" ""The chief and I are in lock step,"" the mayor, who also entered her role in 2022, said. ""And if there are differences that we have, we will continue to deal with those in private."" Firefighters are still trying to extinguish the nearly 40,000 acres of active wildfires, which have killed at least 27 people since they began on January 7, NBC News reported. The drama intensified when active and retired LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators wrote a scathing letter demanding that Crowley step down: Arguing that the chief's statement that the city ""failed"" her department was ""ill-advised"" and ""poorly timed,"" the coalition of unnamed current and former local fire officials concluded that Crowley has ""lost the confidence of the Mayor and more importantly you have lost the confidence of many Chief Officers of the LAFD."" The group also claimed in the letter that the controversial chief knew about the LAFD's budget issues before she entered the role but ""went along"" with the budget cuts, per NewsNation: Another large portion of criticism directed at the department's leader stems from the fact that a shift of about 1,000 firefighters were ""not on standby"" when powerful winds swept through Los Angeles, picking up embers and rapidly spreading the flames, the California Globe reported. There also were not any additional firetrucks positioned in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood — where the initial major blaze sparked last Tuesday — in advance, the outlet noted. ""Positioning firefighters and equipment near fire zones in significant numbers well in advance during periods of high wildfire danger has long been a key strategy in the department,"" said former LAFD assistant chief and current Redondo Beach Fire Department Chief Patrick Butler. ""It's unfathomable to me how this happened, except for extreme incompetence and no understanding of fire operations,"" he said. Los Angeles County pollster Manny Rodriguez told the Globe that he does not see a scenario where both Crowley and Bass ""are still in office by the end of 2025.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T01:39:28+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/first-female-los-angeles-fire-chief-facing-calls-resign-blazes-rage/
"Americans Increasingly Saying No to Sex, Especially Amongst Young Men","Americans are increasingly losing their appetite for sex, especially amongst young men, according to a government study. Sexlessness has climbed among adults aged 22-34 years old, data from the National Survey of Family Growth found. This trend is especially profound with the youth, with 10 percent of young males and seven percent of young females claiming that they are still virgins. ""In sum, for young adult males, sexlessness has roughly doubled across all measures over the last 10 years or so. For young adult females, it has risen by roughly 50 percent,"" the Institute of Family Studies (IFS), which analyzed the study, stated. Twenty-four percent of males in this age bracket had reported not having sex between 2022-2023, which is up nine percent compared to 2013-2015. For women, that figure is up 13 percent from eight percent. When asked if he or she had sex in the last three months, 35 percent of men and 31 percent of women said that they had not. Among those that are having sex aged 22-34 years-old, more are finding less love. The Institute of Family Studies blamed a lack of matrimony as one of the biggest drivers for lack of sex. ""One of the biggest drivers of declining sexual activity is the decline in marriage. Married people have more sex, and for most young adults, marriage is occurring later or not at all. As a result, sex is declining,"" the IFS wrote . The institute continued: There was a rise in the share of heterosexual males with no female sexual partners in the last year—but it was driven mostly by a decline in the number of males with one female partner, and secondarily by a decline in the number of men with two. There was no change at all in the prevalence of heterosexual men with large numbers of female sexual partners. Thus, what we can actually observe is not that a small number of men are having sex with more and more women, but simply that men and women are failing to couple off together: the major decline is in sex between people who only had sex with one person in the prior year, i.e. approximately monogamous sex. A Pew Research study found that 25 percent of Americans 40-years old and younger had never been married.",Breitbart,2025-01-24T21:11:22+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/pre-viral/2025/01/24/americans-increasingly-saying-no-to-sex-especially-amongst-young-men/
