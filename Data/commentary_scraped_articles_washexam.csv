"Trump rides the vibes, for better or worse","After a flurry of activity — the president’s tariff threats and showdowns with Mexico and Canada, his expressions of interest in Greenland , the policy changes obtained by Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trips to Panama and El Salvador, the release of arrested Americans in Venezuela — it seemed clear that the focus of Donald Trump’s foreign policy would be the Western Hemisphere. And then, just a few days later, as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the first head of government to visit the White House, Trump announced that “the United States will take over the Gaza Strip.” This is obviously in tension with Trump’s and many Trump supporters’ opposition to U.S. military actions and “nation building” in the Middle East, and while Greenland is arguably within the Western Hemisphere, Gaza clearly is not. Cleaning up and policing Gaza doesn’t sound like a way for Americans to avoid endless wars and violence, as Trump says he wants. On the other hand, looking for outside-the-box solutions sometimes works. It had been gospel among Middle East specialists that Israel couldn’t achieve diplomatic relations with Arab nations without sanctioning the establishment of a Palestinian state first. But the Abraham Accords that Trump negotiated between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and with Bahrain in 2020 did exactly that. As the Abraham Accords suggested, so Trump’s proposal that the U.S. “take over” Gaza jogs the mind and, as Fox News’s Brit Hume writes , moves people “away from the endless pursuit of a ‘two-state solution,’ which has proved such a dead end.” Maybe in some better direction, though no one, including Trump, seems to have an idea of exactly what. In September 2016, the Pittsburgh-based reporter Salena Zito explained that while “the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.” To them, he signals the kind of “make America great again” change he seeks, even where his proposals, as on Gaza, seem ludicrous on their face. Almost 10 years later, economist Tyler Cowen advances a similar explanation. “Trumpian policy,” he argues , “elevates cultural policy above all else.” The cultures of the foreign policy establishment, of great corporations, of public schools, of public health and scientific research — none is in great shape. So whenever “the policy or policy debate pushes culture in what you think is the right direction, just do it.” Assume that “the cultural factors will, over some time horizon, surpass everything else in import.” Don’t worry about other constraints, whether it’s legal, whether it will persist. Much of it probably will. Democrats and journalists hope the courts will put the kibosh on Trump’s initiatives. But at some point, this lawfare runs up against the first words of Article II of the Constitution : “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” His orders to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs have the backing of the large majority of people of all ethnicities and hues who oppose racial quotas and preferences — and the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His termination of foreign aid programs that advance widely unpopular cultural stands, the hill Democrats are choosing to die on this week, are likely to stand as well. His threats to impose huge tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while economically ruinous if put into effect, prompted promises of increased border surveillance. His instant and massive retaliation against Colombia’s refusal to accept deported immigrants resulted in immediate surrender there and a preemptive surrender by the Maduro government of Venezuela, whose legitimacy the United States and the European Parliament refuse to recognize . Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, confirmed by only a 51-50 Senate vote, is reporting that Army recruitment has had its “best recruiting numbers ” in a dozen years in the two months since Trump was elected. A change in the culture resulting from Trump’s abolition of DEI and Hegseth’s emphasis on the “ warrior ethos ”? Not clear, but sort of looks like it. Whether Trump’s tactics and unorthodox policy initiatives will produce his promised peace in Ukraine and deter China from attacking Taiwan is far from certain. Clearly, some of Trump’s executive orders and policy directives are carefully vetted, while others — the Gaza acquisition? — are not. If one of his audacious bluffs gets called, the resulting damage could prove horrifying: Think seriously about the wreckage those 25% tariffs would have inflicted on auto supply chains. On foreign policy, matters of war and peace, damage could be orders of magnitude worse. After two weeks, Trump’s job approval is hovering around 50% , higher than at any point in his first term, but still below that of all other incoming presidents since 1953. But the “vibes,” what John Maynard Keynes would have called “animal spirits,” of the nation seem to have shifted. The death of former President Jimmy Carter last December reminded us that some of his policies — transportation deregulation and a defense buildup — helped produce the accomplishment and morale boost of the 1980s. But in his “malaise” speech — he never actually used the word — he admitted that the nation’s “vibes” were negative. They turned positive under his successor, Ronald Reagan, though he entered office with job approval not much above Trump’s, with positive material consequences for America and the world. Could something like that happen again?",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T17:47:51+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3311520/trump-rides-the-vibes/
Ignore Trump’s Gaza distraction. Focus on Iran,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with President Donald Trump , the first post-inaugural White House visit by a foreign leader, could shape the Middle East for generations. Pre-meeting speculation centered on how the leaders would handle the Hamas-Israel war. Stunningly, Trump’s comments just before and then after his meeting with Netanyahu focused on the U.S. taking control of the Gaza Strip while Gaza’s residents are resettled elsewhere in the Middle East. There is little point in commenting seriously on this “idea,” which appears to be entirely Trump’s own. The most important strategic issue in the real Middle East remains Iran’s existential threat to Israel. Tehran’s ayatollahs can only be delighted if the Trump administration expends any time and effort at all on the Gaza idea rather than addressing their nuclear weapons program. Restoring the “maximum pressure” campaign from Trump’s first term is a sound decision, but still only the beginning of an effective strategy. Since Hamas’s barbaric Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Israel, with U.S. assistance, has dealt Iran and its “ring of fire” strategy major blows. Hamas and Hezbollah have been decimated but not destroyed. Iran’s ballistic missile production facilities and its sophisticated, Russian-supplied, S-300 air-defense systems have been all but eliminated. Syria’s Iran-friendly Assad regime has fallen, and its S-300 systems and other military assets have been destroyed. Unfortunately, the Houthis in Yemen, West Bank terrorists, and Iranian-controlled Shia militias in Iraq are only wounded, and not severely. The job is unfinished, but enormous progress has been made to diminish Iran’s overall threat, especially its terrorist surrogates. The existential danger remains: Its nuclear program is essentially intact, with only one location, the Parchin weaponization facility, attacked . Looking ahead, the central issue remains how to destroy Tehran’s nuclear weapons efforts, which threaten not only Israel but also constitute a major proliferation threat to America and the world. Eliminating this menace is Netanyahu’s real top priority, but it should not be solely Jerusalem’s responsibility. The United States is the only country that can stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (chemical and biological as well as nuclear). For America and Israel, there has never been a better time to do just that, using carefully targeted force against Iran’s nuclear arms facilities. Accordingly, Israeli-American objectives should be victory against both Iran’s nuclear and terrorist threats. In World War II, Prime Minister Winston Churchill explained to his countrymen why this was the only acceptable outcome: “victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.” The real debate is between those advocating victory and those advocating the Obama-Biden approach: endless negotiations on an elusive deal to return Iran’s government to civilized behavior. There are certainly legitimate questions about the timing of striking Tehran’s nuclear facilities. Most important is reducing Iran’s capacity to retaliate against Israel, friendly Gulf Arab states, and deployed U.S. forces in the region. In Lebanon, Hezbollah likely retains tens of thousands of Iranian-supplied missiles, and Iran itself still has significant numbers of missiles and drones. The clock is running. Tehran is racing to repair the production facilities Israel leveled in October 2024 to replenish its missile stockpiles. Another mutual priority is achieving Israel’s objective of eliminating the political and military capabilities of Hamas and Hezbollah, as Netanyahu stressed yesterday. Although Israel has enjoyed remarkable success in Gaza and Lebanon, the recent Gaza hostage releases were staged to portray Hamas as a viable fighting force, with considerable support among Gaza’s civilians. Yet under former President Joe Biden’s ceasefire deal, which Trump’s pre-inaugural pressure on Netanyahu ironically brought to fruition, Israeli negotiations with Hamas over Gaza’s future are due to start. Yet this is precisely what Netanyahu wanted to avoid and why Biden failed for seven months to close the deal. Just because it is now Trump’s deal does not improve it substantively. Hamas can have no part in any future Gaza, whatever it looks like, nor can Hezbollah have any future in Lebanon. Only by removing these cancers can Gazans and Lebanese have any prospect of normality. And so long as the ayatollahs rule in Tehran, they will do their best to rearm their terrorist proxies, even under “maximum pressure” against Iran. Following their summit, Netanyahu and Trump must demonstrate the resolve to persevere, as Churchill said, however long and hard the road may be. Watch what happens on Iran. John Bolton served as national security adviser to then-President Donald Trump between 2018 and 2019.

How Trump and DOGE should reform the Social Security Administration,"As President Donald Trump and his administration look to reduce wasteful government spending and improve federal government productivity, they can find low-hanging fruit at the Social Security Administration . In particular, the administration should undo Biden-era regulations that unnecessarily bloated spending on welfare and disability benefits. The president, working with the technology experts at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, should also push for modernized information technology, including new digital features, to enhance accuracy and speed and help solve the agency’s service crisis. Finally, to reduce administrative costs and better target spending to those most in need, Trump must simplify and modernize the basic regulatory rules for disability programs. The Trump administration and DOGE need to act positively and methodically within the law to serve and protect taxpayers and SSA beneficiaries. To begin with, the Trump administration should roll back the unnecessary expansion of eligibility for, and the level of, welfare disability benefits. The SSA issued these regulations, costing about $20 billion over 10 years, with no analysis of how they would help the most disadvantaged people. Another set of regulations, costing about $30 billion, says that disability claimants need to be evaluated based on only five years of work history – down from the requirement in recent rules of fifteen years. This change ignores clear research evidence showing that workers’ skills from past jobs continue for at least ten years and often longer. Another set of administrative actions, costing about $10 billion, essentially forgives the collection of old overpayments made by SSA to beneficiaries. This gloss-over ignores the root cause of the problem – deficiencies in processing information on earnings, assets, and other items. The Biden administration stated that a major motivation for these changes was to reduce agency costs investigate the ability of disability claimants to work, or to see if they had other available resources of support. The aim was to help the agency at a time when it is failing to serve the public. SSA, however, is still failing to answer the phones promptly and accurately and is struggling to process changes in beneficiary status and condition. Furthermore, the agency has a massive backlog of claims for disability benefits. These changes abandoned the prudent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. By the faulty logic of the Biden administration, SSA could pay out on every disability claim made or forgive every overpayment, solving its backlog and service problems. That approach is easier than addressing the underlying sources of SSA’s failures – manual processes, antiquated technologies, and programming languages that were once cutting edge in the 1960s but now are costly to maintain and difficult to integrate into more efficient technology. Indeed, there are still only a few services that the public can get from SSA entirely online, without needing to call or visit a field office. In addition to modernizing customer-facing IT, SSA needs to simplify and modernize its complex and costly disability program rules. The agency needs to use the new statistical data on occupational requirements in its program rules to adjudicate disability claims and continuing benefits. It cannot continue to rely on information last updated almost 50 years ago. Moreover, the new data must be integrated with a modern view of the labor market, less focused on physical work. In the 21st century, more and more people are employed at older ages, and new types of careers are available to more people of various educational backgrounds. Implementing these new rules through an automated tool would simplify and speed up the program administration and improve the consistency of adjudication. Compared to current vocational rules, some disability claimants would get benefits paid while others would not. The net effect would likely be a significant reduction in government spending, from a more accurate and current read of labor market realities. Other recommended changes include a simplification of the return-to-work rules for when disability benefits are cut off and making greater use of claimant attorneys to provide complete information to the agency when filing a claim for a client instead of relying on the agency to collect the required medical and vocational records. Finally, the agency should consider and publish a full analysis of whether all the many layers of appeals are needed and cost-effective for speed and fairness to claimants and to protect the taxpayer. The Trump administration has the opportunity to make policy changes and to use the DOGE in a productive and positive manner to make long overdue technology changes in how the federal government functions. Efficiency and fiscal responsibility are imperative goals – especially for SSA to protect taxpayers and best serve its beneficiaries. Mark J.

Universities need more change than neutrality,"Institutional neutrality policies, such as those adopted by Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania , are good steps for hyperpoliticized universities . They also could prove entirely inconsequential. Each school has published a statement of its own explaining the policy and what it aims to accomplish. Universities taking official positions on sociopolitical events has become commonplace and even expected occurrences. The neutrality policy declares these schools will now refrain from doing so, in an effort instead to support the “creativity and academic freedom” of students and faculty, UPenn officials wrote. They still will issue statements on matters that directly affect the university. The conflict between Israel and Palestinians, for example, no matter how imminent college protesters’ theatrics want to make it appear, does not have any bearing on university functions. It is likely that these student demands were a primary catalyst for the schools’ final movements toward neutrality. The rest of the policy’s reasoning is that an institution cannot possibly represent the views of the diverse communities found on a college campus and that it will enhance future expression of free speech. Members will engage in debate without the burdens of political bias and self-censorship. These are benefits we can all hope eventually will take effect on campuses. As it is, though, the policy will change little of the substance that comes from these universities. Universities house mostly left-wing professors. A certain flavor of messaging and education comes out of these institutions as a result and becomes what is effectively the official position of a given school. Unless they hire more conservative professors, universities will strike no neutrality in their politics. Unfortunately, that sounds a lot like diversity hiring, but discrimination is the name of the game for liberal institutions that strive for balanced representation. Aside from that, encountering professors of varying political persuasions opens up a world of study for students. It only deepens their academic interests, provided professors are committed to a similar level of neutrality in the classroom. For their part, conservative professors have been practicing careful neutrality for years. The learning curve of this policy rests on liberal faculty. Without action that intentionally changes the university environment, high-up institutional policies will end up as passive maintenance for the leftism that already controls the school. Neutrality is a good hope, but it wants pairing with substantive measures.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T15:11:14+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3154264/universities-need-more-change-than-neutrality/
Rubio must reverse the Biden administration’s designations of US allies,"One year ago, Marco Rubio and seven other senators penned a letter to then-President Joe Biden expressing concerns over Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s misuse of sanctions in Latin America and the Caribbean. “Since January 2021, the overwhelming majority of public designations made under Section 7031(c) have targeted officials in Latin American and Caribbean governments that have cooperated with the United States on strategic diplomatic and national security interests,” the senators pressed. The senators expressed deep concerns about politicizing the sanction process and seemingly targeting politicians on the Right and ignoring “egregious actions in the region by others.” They urged Biden that the administration “must immediately explain the process and criteria it has used since January 2021 to designate individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean under Section 7031(c).” This may seem like an American, right-wing, or human rights concern. Still, as stated in the letter from the Republican senators, it is not just a U.S. problem and especially not just a concern of Latin America and the Caribbean. Among the eight, Rubio is acting as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state. By expressing concerns over U.S. allies’ designations and demanding the Democratic administration review and reverse them, Rubio has set a clear precedent. He must now uphold it. Enter Sali Berisha, a former president and prime minister of Albania who visited the White House twice in the early ’90s and was received by Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton. In 2007, Berisha welcomed the first and only U.S. president to visit Albania, George W. Bush. Berisha was and is a staunch ally of the United States, aligning with American interests on everything from the Middle East to Russia, from NATO expansion to the war on terrorism. Berisha’s fall from grace came in May 2021 when Blinken designated him for “undermining democracy” and “significant corruption.” Ironically, Blinken himself, while a senior adviser to Vice President Biden, lauded Berisha and his government’s anti-corruption efforts. Other U.S. Democrats once felt similarly. In 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a speech in Albania’s parliament, when Berisha was prime minister, stating that “if one wants to see democracy in motion, one should come to Albania.” Berisha blames billionaire George Soros and his cronies in the U.S. for his designation. Case in point, George’s son Alex Soros has been a mainstay in Albanian and Balkan politics since Prime Minister Edi Rama came to power. Former chief of the FBI’s New York counterintelligence office Charles McGonigal’s involvement in Albanian affairs should not be brushed aside. He was sentenced to 28 months in prison by a Washington, D.C., court for this involvement, accepting bribes from Albanian individuals set in motion by Rama’s office, according to the Justice Department file, and pushing the FBI to open an investigation into Berisha’s right-wing Democratic Party. Now that Rubio is in charge and Blinken is out, will Rubio reverse Blinken’s policies and condemnations of right-wing U.S. allies, not only in Latin America and the Caribbean but also in southeastern Europe? Many in Albania think Rubio will do so. Some point to an interesting reason: Being a descendant of anti-communist Cuban immigrants, he knows what communism is. Albania and his grandparents’ country have one thing in common: having suffered dearly under the communist joke. Berisha’s designation is nothing less than a new international Left trying to expunge its right-wing rivals.

Rubio’s good start blunting Chinese influence in Panama,"The selection of former Sen. Marco Rubio to become the nation’s secretary of state sent the message that shoring up Latin America will be a top priority for the new administration. Early returns suggest the selection is paying off. Rubio’s trip to Panama, his first stop as the nation’s most senior Cabinet member, delivered a significant concession from the Panamanian government. Following his meeting with Rubio, President Jose Raul Mulino, after months of denying President Donald Trump’s claims that China controlled the Panama Canal, announced that his country will not renew a 2017 infrastructure funding agreement with China. As a result, Panama will cease participating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative once the current agreement expires in 2027. Mulino even expressed openness to ending the agreement beforehand. While Panama’s exit from the BRI will not directly involve operations or control of the canal, it is significant on a number of fronts. For the United States, the Panama Canal is critically important for national security because of its location for commercial and military traffic. China’s partnership with the Panamanian government raised concerns about its influence over the canal, which would enable them to disrupt U.S. commerce, influence toll rates and ship prioritization, and provide economic leverage for China to make strategic gains in the region. Mulino’s concession not only keeps the canal from falling under Chinese control but also broadly blunts Chinese expansionism in Latin America. In recent years, China has invested heavily in the region on infrastructure projects and increased trade. Chinese development banks have provided substantial loans to Latin American countries for infrastructure deals or resource-backed loans. This has stoked U.S. fears of “debt trap diplomacy,” in which high levels of debt would give China control over key assets. The case of Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port is instructive. Completed in 2010, the port, which is positioned on major shipping routes in the Indian Ocean, was built by the China Harbour Engineering Company and funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. However, it quickly became apparent that the port was not generating enough revenue. Debt repayment problems caused Sri Lanka to lease the port in 2017 to China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited for 99 years. Today, China controls the port. While Rubio’s success in convincing Panama not to renew its participation in the BRI is a positive step in countering Chinese influence in Panama, there is still plenty of work to be done in the region. For instance, countries such as Panama must agree to accept more deportees, as well as increase their cooperation in curbing the flow of migrants to the U.S., especially by way of the perilous Darien Gap. It is part of the Pan-American Highway that was never completed and is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world. Mulino has vowed to “close” the gap — and he must be held to his word. Panama must also clamp down on organized crime, which exacerbates migration to the U.S. and causes regional instability generally. The U.S. Embassy’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement has provided $12 million in recent years to help Panama fight organized crime, which includes drug trafficking in the country that serves as a transit point for drugs that eventually arrive in North America. To win this battle, Mulino must also tackle deep-seated corruption in the Panamanian government, which is no small task. Increased security cooperation and enhanced economic ties between the U.S. and Panama are crucial components of maintaining U.S. leadership in the Western hemisphere and beyond. Rubio’s mission to achieve this is a good start, but the real work has only just begun.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3310152/rubio-good-start-blunting-chinese-influence-panama/
Trump endangers American interests with Gaza ownership plan,"President Donald Trump stated his interest in seeing the United States take ownership of the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. At a White House press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump argued that American ownership of Gaza would lead to the Palestinian territory being transformed from a Hamas-dominated dystopia to a place of prosperity and peace. Asked whether he would order U.S. military forces to secure Gaza, Trump responded, “We’ll do what’s necessary.” The president added that he wanted the U.S. to take a “long-term ownership” interest in Gaza that would see both Palestinians and the “people of the world” living there. Trump reemphasized his plan for most of the Palestinians now living in Gaza to be relocated to neighboring countries. Trump’s aspirations for a durable Israeli-Palestinian peace are moral. But his policy as presented is one of self-immolation. It is plainly at odds with U.S. security interests. Contrary to the president’s claims, the forcible relocation of Palestinians out of Gaza and/or the American abandonment of Palestinian interests in any sense of statehood is a nonstarter for U.S. regional allies. It would lead to a breach in U.S. relations with key security partner Jordan and greatly undermine U.S. relations with the Sunni Arab monarchies. Moreover, a move to assert U.S. ownership over Gaza would make the U.S. a direct party to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It would catalyze organized jihadist recruitment, mobilization, and action against U.S. interests. It would also greatly encourage increased jihadist terrorism against the U.S. by so-called lone wolf attackers and other “inspired” small group actors. This is not a debatable point. Their many disagreements and hatreds with and toward one another notwithstanding, a unifying raison d’être of the leaders of Salafi-Jihadist, Shia-Khomeneist, and most other preeminent Islamic extremist terrorist movements is the subversion of secular democratic individualism with Islamic law. They despise America as the world’s foremost democracy. Still, the primary ground-level cause for jihadist recruitment against America is rooted in two other factors: first, the perception of unjust American military occupations in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and second, the perception of unjust American military and political support for Israel. To be sure, these perceptions are not cause for American foreign policy changes to placate jihadists. Israel has a right to exist, and America should support the defense of the Middle East’s only true democracy. And as the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023, so plainly illustrated, to yield to these terrorists is to invite atrocities against innocents. But alongside Trump’s simultaneous suggestion on Tuesday that the U.S. will soon recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entirety of the West Bank, it is clear that the president is adopting a far more antagonistic stance against even the most moderate Palestinian and Arab allied political agendas. In turn, Trump’s suggestion of taking ownership of land that does not, in any historic or politically legitimate sense, belong to America is a grand gift for jihadist propaganda. If effected in any sense, it will inspire violence and antipathy by Muslims against America, and it will cost a large number of American military and civilian lives. Again, Trump is basically talking about replacing the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. This is not a recipe for prosperity and peace, it is a recipe for brutal, prolonged urban warfare — oh, and in an environment unlike that in cities in 2003-2011 Iraq, where there was at least some resident support for U.S. efforts to counter terrorists. Trump’s Gaza deployment would make the ill-fated early 1980s U.S. military deployment to Lebanon look like a cakewalk in comparison. The better course for Trump is to endorse Israeli efforts to exert pressure on Hamas, secure remaining Israeli hostages, and secure regional buy-in for a post-Hamas governing structure in Gaza — a structure that matches Israeli security needs to the longer-term interest of a Palestinian territory defined by growing prosperity and hope rather than one defined by corruption and fanatical despair. But pitting the U.S. as an occupying force against Palestinian identity and global Muslim sentiment is not in America’s favor, nor, in any sense, is it compatible with Trump’s oft-stated interest in avoiding “stupid wars.”",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T01:12:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310965/trump-endangers-american-interests-gaza-ownership-plan/
An early look at the Virginia governor’s race,"In the next set of off-year elections , the Virginia governor’s race will likely be the most contested. Since Virginia governors can’t run for consecutive terms, Republicans will need to find a candidate to replace current Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA). Youngkin won the 2021 governor’s race over Terry McAuliffe by about two points in a state that former President Joe Biden carried by over nine points against President Donald Trump in 2020. During his election, Youngkin successfully walked the line of appealing both to Trump supporters and never-Trump voters. Youngkin’s victory proved that Republicans can still win a statewide election in Virginia, even though the state has moved left over the last two decades. Youngkin has enjoyed positive approval ratings throughout his term and some polls indicate that he is one of the more popular governors in the nation. His name was floated in vice president considerations before Trump picked JD Vance. Although there is no incumbency advantage in the race, the fact that Virginia has a popular Republican governor may be helpful to other Republican candidates looking to win in November. Two Republicans and one Democrat have declared their candidacy. Current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA) will face investigative reporter Merle Rutledge in the Republican primary, and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is currently running unopposed in the Democrat primary. However, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) is considering a run and could challenge Spanberger for the nomination. The most likely matchup currently looks to be Earle-Sears against Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District from 2019-2025 until she decided to step down from her seat to run for governor. Earle-Sears’s path to nomination got easier after Youngkin gave her his endorsement, and current Attorney General Jason Miyares sought to run for reelection rather than challenge her for the nomination. The primary elections for both parties will take place on June 17. Early polling indicates a small lead for Democrats. Spanberger currently leads Earle-Sears by between one and five points. Democrats will also be running on a high after they took control of the House of Delegates in the 2023 midterm elections. However, Republicans have reason to be optimistic. First, Earle-Sears proved that she could win a statewide race when she won the lieutenant governorship in 2021. Second, voting numbers in the state indicate a shift to the right. Although Biden beat Trump by nine points in 2020, former Vice President Kamala Harris only carried the state by five points. Harris was more unpopular than Biden was in 2020, which may account for the difference, but the numbers indicate a path for Earle-Sears. Also, although the polls show Spanberger leading, most feature a high percentage of undecided voters. When those voters begin to break, there will be a clearer picture of where this race is heading. The Virginia governor’s race is currently a toss-up. Democrats will be looking to ride the trend from the last midterm elections, as well as historical state trends, while Republicans will be looking to bank off Younkin’s popularity to elevate Earle-Sears to the governorship.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T22:07:53+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3310524/early-look-virginia-governor-race/
Trump continues to show that tariffs work,"The leaders of Canada and Mexico agreed to terms with President Donald Trump regarding border security on Monday. To combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, Trump issued an executive order Saturday imposing a 25% tariff on imports from both countries. The tariffs were to remain in effect until the end of the crisis. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was quick to agree to Trump’s terms, sending 10,000 border patrol agents to stop the flow of illegal immigration. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to terms later the same day. “I just had a good call with President Trump,” Trudeau said in a Monday post on X. “Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.” Trudeau said he would employ a “fentanyl czar” to stop the flow of the harmful drug across the border. As a result of the agreements, Trump delayed the implementation of the tariffs by 30 days in both countries, pending final agreements on the matter. “I am very pleased with this initial outcome,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. “The Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured.” Both leaders caved one week after Colombian President Gustavo Petro blocked U.S. aircraft carrying deported illegal immigrants from landing. Petro initially refused to take the migrants, claiming that the United States was not treating them with dignity and respect. Trump immediately promised a 25% tariff on Colombian goods, which would be raised to 50% the following week. Trump also threatened a travel ban on Colombian nationals and suspension of visas for Colombian government officials. After initially promising to retaliate with tariffs of his own, Petro stepped back and agreed to take deported illegal immigrants, even offering his presidential plane to help with deportations. The events of the past week showed that Trump’s tariff policies have benefits in addition to generating government revenue. According to the World Bank, the U.S. is the biggest trade partner in exports from Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. With the U.S. a large part of their economies, a loss of business would be more costly to the countries than sending troops to defend the border. Trump has shown that for some countries, the mere idea of tariffs is enough to make them reconsider their immigration policies. Some politicians may doubt the efficacy of tariffs, but Trump has shown that, at least for immigration, it is far more effective than any policy the previous administration attempted.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T20:05:10+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310112/trump-shows-tariffs-work/
Ending plunder and grift at USAID,"Guatemalan transgender organizations scooped $2 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and oxymoronic diversity, equity, and inclusion “scholarships” in Burma took another $45 million. Advancing DEI in Serbian workplaces was financed with $1.5 million, and $47,000 was found for a transgender opera in Colombia. These and many other left-wing grifts are being brought to light by early Trump administration moves to get bloated federal spending under control. It is incontestable that such egregiously unnecessary programs richly deserve the chop. But there is a yawning abyss between the thousands, millions, and even billions of dollars wasted on them and the $2 trillion that Elon Musk wants to cut with the sharp edge of the Department of Government Efficiency. If the axman severed every USAID program and nothing else, it would save only $40 billion a year. Although taxpayers would applaud, the improvement to public finances would be almost undetectably small. America would keep hurtling toward insolvency. Doing easy things, taking a win, and walking away leaving really difficult stuff untouched will be tempting, but it is a temptation that must be resisted. Absurd programs draw disproportionate attention and invite justified outrage precisely because of their triviality. Where they are not pernicious, they are obviously frivolous. A well-governed nation, especially one living beyond its means as America is, would drop them without hesitation or a backward glance. But they are not the substantive danger to the nation’s finances. That comes, rather, from massive entitlements such as Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and food stamps. Means-tested social welfare spending reached $1.6 trillion in 2023 and needs cutting immediately. Social Security and Medicare are dire problems that must be dealt with immediately afterward. Such programs have accumulated like financial snowfalls to form a glacier that is grinding down and gouging out the valley of public policy from a mountaintop of good intentions to a torpid ocean of fiscal ruin. To continue the metaphor, USAID programs being targeted for elimination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and lamented by vested interests are little ice pebbles on top of that glacier and contribute almost nothing to its weight and destructive power. Cutting entitlement programs is enormously difficult politically but is legally straightforward. The Supreme Court has ruled, for example, that Social Security payments are taxes, not insurance premiums conferring guaranteed benefits. So Congress and the executive are free in principle to cut payouts and raise the retirement age, as in prudence they should. But no president since George W. Bush has even suggested, let alone tried, touching this third rail of politics, with its potential to deliver a fatal electoral shock, and President Donald Trump has explicitly ruled it out. Having duly noted that Trump and DOGE need to go where the big money is, let us return to USAID boondoggles. Although they are minuscule in monetary value compared to America’s overall fiscal dismay and incontinence, they should not be lightly passed over. They are symptomatic of a moral rot that must be cured as the first order of business in returning the nation to good governance fit for future generations. The premise of those who argue that a few million dollars here and there make no difference, even when they add up to $40 billion, are like those who argued for decades that America was so big and powerful that it could withstand every protest, slight, retreat, and humiliation. The truth, however, is that the drip, drip, drip of wasted dollars is similarly destructive to the drip, drip, drip of denigration. The former erodes the probity of those who have a duty of care in spending taxpayer money, just as the latter wears down our strength, patriotism, self-confidence, and international authority. America is big and rich, but not so big and rich that it can withstand either profligate spending or moral corrosion indefinitely. All but 3% of political donations from USAID employees went to the Democratic Party, and the agency has, for decades, been plundered to finance every conceivable work of left-wing propaganda. The agency became a sort of propaganda bank, from which career bureaucrats drew funds for work that was unnecessary at best and often destructive, sometimes deliberately so. USAID spread wokery to all corners of the globe, persuading the rest of the world that America represents a corpus of ideas and values that are, if truth be told, repellent to the majority of Americans as much as they are alien to overseas peoples on whom the money is spent. To acknowledge that is not to suggest all USAID work is worthless. It is not. But much of it is. And it is right that Rubio should sift through payments, save only what is right, and zero out what is left. Aid must, as he said, “be aligned with American foreign policy.”",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T19:06:48+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/3310394/ending-plunder-grift-usaid/
Democrats’ abortion cult is getting even more morbid,"The Democratic Party is so obsessed with promoting abortions that the New York government is going to the mat for a doctor who helped kill a teenager’s unborn child against her will in a different state where abortion is illegal. The legal feud playing out between Louisiana and New York shows just how committed the Democratic Party is to its sacrament of abortion. In January, officers received a 911 call from a girl under 18 who was apparently dealing with a miscarriage, according to West Baton Rouge District Attorney Tony Clayton. It was determined at the hospital that she had taken abortion medication, which is illegal in Louisiana. According to Clayton, the teenager had apparently planned a gender reveal party and did not want to get an abortion. The teen’s mother, who allegedly ordered abortion pills from New York and gave them to her daughter, has been charged with violating the state’s abortion ban. Louisiana also charged the doctor who provided the pills with “criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs.” Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) and Attorney General Letitia James are both boasting that the doctor will not face consequences for knowingly sending illegal abortion pills to Louisiana and having a baby killed against the will of the mother. Hochul, in fact, has vowed to “do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she’s doing that is so essential.” New York has “shield laws” in place that allow its doctors to send abortion pills to states where the pills are banned under the protection of the New York government. Not content with widespread legal killings of unborn children in its own state, New York’s legal regime protects doctors who outsource these killings to states with abortion bans. It does not matter in this case that the mother of the child did not want an abortion, nor that these abortion drugs are dangerous if their usage isn’t monitored by a professional, as was clear with the death of Amber Thurman in Georgia. The Democratic Party’s obsession with abortion has no limiting principles and takes a back seat to nothing. Hochul and New York Democrats are enthusiastically cheering the exportation of abortion to states that have banned it and to women who don’t even want it. And they will continue to do so as long as these “shield” laws are allowed to stand by the Supreme Court.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T18:50:59+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310324/democrats-abortion-cult-getting-more-morbid/
Sean Parnell once again answers the call to serve,"PITTSBURGH — Western Pennsylvania native Sean Parnell said he is humbled and honored to once again serve his country, this time not on the battlefield, but as the chief Pentagon spokesman for the Trump administration . Parnell told the Washington Examiner the call to duty feels amazing. “I accept the position with great humility. One of the things I wish I understood when I joined the military at the age of 23 was that we were standing on the shoulders of giants. That we had inherited an extraordinary legacy of everyone who came before us,” he said. President Donald Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social that he was pleased to announce Parnell’s new roles as chief Pentagon spokesman and assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. “Sean is a fearless Combat Veteran, who led one of the most decorated units in the Afghanistan War. He earned two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart while his platoon achieved an incredible record of eliminating over 350 enemy fighters,” said Trump, adding that during his first term, Parnell was instrumental in helping to pass the MISSION Act, “the biggest VA reform in history.” As he accepted the position, Parnell said he could not help but think of the men and women who came before him. “All of those who sacrificed their lives for this country, I work for them, for the men and women in uniform then, for the men and women in uniform today, and for the men and women who don the uniform in the future,” he said. His 14-year-old daughter Emma, who was with him when he got the news, said she is so proud of her dad right now, “Plus, I get to go to see him at the Pentagon.” Born in Pittsburgh and raised in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Greensburg Central Catholic, Parnell went on to study elementary education at Clarion University. He said he struggled to find his purpose on Sept. 11, 2001. “I woke that morning lying flat on my back on this beat-down couch in my living room, turned on the television, and in that moment, was shaken to my core,” he said, recounting how most of the United States felt that horrific day. What caught his attention more than anything else was how ordinary people responded. “Police officers and firefighters ran into the flames to save people they didn’t even know. In many cases, people who ran into the flames that day never came out again,” he said. It was when he observed these acts of selflessness that he decided he needed to serve something greater than himself. He transferred to a university that had an ROTC program, became an officer, and was on the ground in December 2006. He said he found his purpose and why God had placed him on this Earth. Parnell went on to spend 485 days in heavy combat, where he earned two Bronze Stars, one for valor, and a Purple Heart. In one of those battles, he suffered a skull fracture in three places and received a medical discharge after being diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and PTSD. When he got out of the military, he shifted from defense of the country to capturing and preserving the legacy of his soldiers. This led the Army combat veteran to write the New York Times bestseller Outlaw Platoon and Man of War . Parnell, who has known Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth since their military days, thanked him for the opportunity. Hegseth said on X that Parnell exudes courageous leadership and selfless service. Parnell ran for office in 2020 against incumbent Democrat Conor Lamb, narrowly losing the House seat in Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District. He ran briefly for a Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2021 but withdrew when concerns for his children unfolded during a court battle. Parnell was in the stands in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 after giving a speech ahead of Trump’s remarks when Thomas Matthew Crooks shots rang out at the Butler Farm Show Complex, wounding Trump and two other supporters and killing retired fire chief Corey Comperatore. Parnell’s battlefield composure took over in the aftermath, immediately calming and evacuating people from the scene.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T17:32:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3310165/sean-parnell-once-again-answers-call-serve/
Trump can ‘reset’ relations with Iran’s mullah regime,"Diplomatic resets have a bad name in Washington, D.C., these days, ever since former President Barack Obama promised one with Moscow in 2009, then oversaw the collapse of U.S.-Russian relations, including the never-ending Ukraine crisis and war. There’s nothing wrong with resetting bad relations between rivals, so long as any reset is grounded in geopolitical reality rather than the naïve wishes of the Obama-Biden foreign policy set, which birthed so many needless reversals in American power over the last two decades. President Donald Trump’ s second administration offers the chance for a reset with Iran precisely because he was tough on the mullah regime during his first term. The last time he was in the Oval Office, Trump projected strength toward Tehran, including sanctions that limited Iran’s ability to harm American allies and interests, plus scrapping Obama’s cherished Iran deal on nuclear development. Moreover, Trump applied lethal force against Tehran in a limited but effective fashion. Cemeteries worldwide are filled with allegedly indispensable people, but occasionally, someone turns out to be irreplaceable. The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020, at the hands of the U.S. Air Force, was a game-changing event for the Middle East. On Trump’s orders, the Pentagon assassinated Soleimani, who, for more than two decades, was the top terrorist for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the head of its special operations arm, the Quds Force. As the Quds Force boss, Soleimani directed what Tehran calls “liberation movements” across the Middle East, waging war on Israel and the West, especially the United States. A cagey strategist, Soleimani had more blood on his hands than Osama bin Laden, including hundreds of U.S. military personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan by Soleimani’s militias. As the second most powerful man in Iran, behind only Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Soleimani had enormous influence over all of Tehran’s interactions with the West. Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” strategy to pressure Israel and America across the Middle East through proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, various militias in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Palestinian resistance groups, preeminently Hamas. Soleimani grasped that while Iran is a weakling in conventional military terms, with dilapidated armed forces incapable of confronting America and its allies on the field of battle, Tehran possesses powerful asymmetric tools to challenge Western might in the Middle East. What a difference five years make. The Guard vibrantly mourned Soleimani’s death and threatened to avenge him with murder plots against Trump and top U.S. officials, but he hasn’t been meaningfully replaced . Ever since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Iranian-supplied weapons, the Axis of Resistance has fallen apart. Gloves off, the Israel Defense Forces crushed one Iranian proxy after another. Hamas is more down than out, but Gaza has been shattered, and the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel hasn’t been this weak in decades. Israel’s assassination of Hamas political boss Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024, sent a pointed message to the mullahs. In Lebanon, IDF strikes decapitated Hezbollah and revealed that the group’s military power, despite over 40 years of Guard investment in training and equipping Hezbollah, is distinctly limited. Then, the collapse of Syria’s Bashar Assad regime, a key Iranian ally, unraveled Tehran’s entire strategic position in the Levant. IDF conventional strikes on Iran, especially its nuclear program, were answered with Iranian missile barrages that were brusquely blunted by U.S. and Israeli cooperation with timely intelligence and anti-missile defenses. Tehran’s massive investment in ballistic missiles, instead of more conventional airpower, was revealed to be a grand blunder. Simply put, Iran lacks any significant military capability against Israel, much less the U.S. Only the Houthis, in faraway Yemen, are keeping the Axis of Resistance alive, hurling Iranian missiles at Western shipping in the Red Sea, yet they have failed to cut off international trade routes. This strategic shift against Iran offers an opening for Trump if he wants one. There’s worry in Tehran that the new administration may employ the U.S. military to attack Iran’s nuclear development program directly, which is assessed by Western intelligence to be getting close to weaponization, after decades of fits and starts. Certainly, U.S. Central Command possesses precision strike capabilities, including deep-penetrating bombs and real-time intelligence, which the IDF can’t dream of. Together, CENTCOM and the IDF might deliver Iran’s nuclear ambitions a painful blow that would set them back into the next decade. Then again, they might not. The difficult truth is that if a kinetic solution to the Iranian nuclear dilemma could be assured to buy time — several years, preferably a decade, of delay in atomic weaponization — the Pentagon would have done this long ago. Such a comprehensive strike was considered not just during the last Trump term but during the presidency of George W. Bush. Every time, the political risks were not deemed acceptable, given the variables at play. Now that Tehran has concluded a mutual defense pact of sorts with Moscow, termed the “comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,” the threat of Russian response to any major U.S. interest must be considered. It would be wiser to give the mullahs a bloody nose not at home but against their last proxy standing that’s seriously fighting the West. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have proved a thorn in the side of global trade, forcing the U.S. Navy to deploy ships on station for months to keep international shipping lanes open. The Biden administration, in line with its broad policy of not challenging Tehran, even when it behaves badly, kept the Pentagon on a short leash against the Houthis. It’s time to unleash the Pentagon against the Houthis. To date, CENTCOM strikes in Yemen against Houthi critical nodes have been restrained. Trump should take off the leash and let our Navy and Air Force take down Houthi bases, command posts, and logistical sites. Iranian shipments of weapons, especially missiles, to Houthi proxies should be interdicted harshly. That will send the mullahs a clear message without threatening Iran at home. Hit the Houthis hard, then seek parley with the mullah regime. Here, Trump possesses one clear advantage over his predecessors: His White House isn’t penetrated by Iranian sympathizers as Obama’s and Biden’s were through three terms in office. The Democrats allowed suspected friends of Tehran, of dubious loyalty to the U.S., including known Israel-haters, to occupy top national security positions. Some of them can be plausibly termed Iranian agents. They’re gone now. No longer can Tehran count on having its allies on the other side of the negotiating table in Washington. This changes the game in both intelligence and diplomatic terms. Tehran is already signaling that it’s open to talking with the Trump administration. Last week, Khamenei criticized the White House while signaling that parley is possible despite tough rhetoric from regime-connected senior clerics. Moreover, another senior cleric who is deemed a decent bellwether for regime views, Mohsen Qara’ati, just compared discussions with Trump to a difficult divorce: “Even when ending a relationship or in conflict, one shouldn’t destroy all bridges at once,” he explained . “There should always be a path for return.” This week, Iran’s foreign ministry denied that there’s a diplomatic back channel forming between Tehran and Washington, which means that there probably is. It just can’t be admitted yet. Trump is the master of making threats and showing strength to induce discussion and, if possible, then birth a deal that seemed unattainable before. If he confronts the mullahs with strength, a reset with Iran can come into focus. John R.

Trump can help prevent aviation disasters,"Last week saw the worst U.S. aviation disaster in nearly a quarter century when an Army helicopter collided in midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National Airport. None survived among the 64 passengers and crew onboard American Eagle flight 5342, nor did the helicopter’s three soldiers. While investigation into the accident is ongoing, a tragedy such as Wednesday’s was, sadly, a matter of time . Aviation safety has withered, reliant on outdated technology and a workforce weakened by progressive policies. Near collisions have generated concern in recent years following several high-profile incidents . From 2019-2024, almost 10,000 runway incursions were reported by the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s perhaps impressive that more incidents don’t occur: 45,000 flights take off on any given day, transporting over 10 million passengers annually — that’s an exponential increase from the 1970s, before deregulation made flight affordable for almost everyone. Technology to manage air traffic has not kept pace with air travel’s democratization. Given astounding advancements like the internet, self-driving cars, and artificial intelligence, travelers could be forgiven for not realizing that air traffic controllers keep us safe with outdated tools that have been used since before World War II: binoculars and radar. Without modern technology, safety is contingent on humans prone to human error. And capacity to prevent, review, and learn from close calls is limited; post-incident reviews can be difficult to undertake and slow to complete. When video footage is available after the fact, it’s unofficial — typically from citizen plane spotters or passersby. Wednesday’s collision was recorded by a Kennedy Center camera 4 miles from Reagan Airport, capturing only enough low-quality video to relay the already-known: Something went horribly wrong. Inadequate staffing exacerbates inadequate technology. A preliminary FAA report said that staffing at Reagan’s air traffic control tower was “not normal” at the time of Wednesday’s accident, with one controller assigned to do two jobs. Staffing problems more broadly are normal, however. A persistent shortage of air traffic controllers has contributed to several near-incursions, and FAA facilities are struggling to hire enough qualified personnel. President Donald Trump suggested that diversity, equity, and inclusion policies may have played a role in the collision. Air traffic controller shortages appear to be a factor here, so he’s not far off. Shortages can be partially attributed to an older workforce — many air traffic controllers are nearing or at retirement age — but affirmative action-style policies have also affected the candidate pool. In 2013, the Obama administration implemented a biographical questionnaire as part of the air traffic controller hiring process in an effort to bring in more minorities. The questionnaire awarded higher points to applicants who indicated unemployment in the past three years, that science was one’s lowest grade in high school, or gave other preferred responses on demographically skewed questions. Meanwhile, thousands of qualified candidates were turned away to mechanically induce a lower proportion of white staff. To be clear, air travel is still overwhelmingly safe. But challenges from dated technology and bad hiring practices make horrific incidents more likely to occur. The Trump administration can prevent future aviation disasters through straightforward, practical solutions. The newly confirmed secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, and FAA acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau can expediently execute Trump’s executive orders to rid their agencies of DEI programs and affirmative action language. Doing so will remove barriers for the best candidates to become air traffic controllers. “One of the things we’re advocating for is a total review of how the FAA hires and posts for ATCs,” Nicholas Calio, CEO of the trade association representing major U.S. airlines, told Airlines Confidential Podcast in December. “The system clearly isn’t working.” The FAA should support this industry ask. Given the aging workforce, it’s not enough to rely on staffing up alone. As DOGE rids federal agencies of wasteful spending on progressive pet issues, it could instead fund and implement innovative technologies at airports that help air traffic controllers do more with less. Better technology for safety exists: For one, a startup called Spotty Aerospace offers a network of smart cameras that can be inexpensively installed and scaled based on airport size, then used to augment human operations through greater situational awareness and predictive alerts. Popular tracking tools such as FlightAware and FlightRadar24 could also be approved by the FAA for air traffic control use as a supplement to radio communications with pilots. In 2023, air traffic controllers reported having to turn to a free version of FlightRadar24 when radio frequencies cut out at dangerous moments. The Spotty Aerospace startup was founded in Crystal City, Virginia — where Wednesday’s collision near Reagan National Airport occurred. A hopeful view in the wake of tragedy might consider that a sign: A modern approach to aviation safety is not only possible but very close. Accidents like this need not happen again. Carolyn D.

Partners can help the US thwart the Russia-Iran axis,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington on Tuesday can be a significant step forward for the Trump administration to stabilize the Middle East. Despite its loss of Syria and setbacks to its Hamas and Hezbollah proxies, Iran remains the key disruptive actor in the region. Tehran’s nuclear ambitions are very close to realization, and its quests for dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of Israel and America remain unchanged. Further aggravating this scenario, Iran just signed a mutual defense pact with Russia. The United States and Israel can undermine Iranian-Russian objectives on two fronts. An Israeli-American partnership has emerged to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russian missiles and Iranian drones. The U.S. military has transferred about 90 decommissioned Patriot air defense interceptors from storage in Israel to Poland for delivery to Ukraine. This is the most significant supply of weapons from Israel to Ukraine since the Russian invasion. It demonstrates that Jerusalem calculates that Ukraine’s military resistance impedes Moscow’s capabilities to assist Iran. In the Middle East, President Donald Trump has stated that his policy will focus on expanding the 2020 Abraham Accords , normalizing relations between Israel and America’s Arab allies. With the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and a new government in Lebanon vowing to limit the influence of Iran’s proxy Hezbollah, Washington has a unique opportunity to put Tehran in check. Trump can reinstate all sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the Biden administration, limit its energy exports, prevent its nuclear program from reaching weaponization, and help eliminate its terrorist proxies. Taking such critical steps to restrain Iran will also bolster the confidence of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other moderate states to join the Abraham Accords. Washington must also deepen its engagement with nearby pro-Western Muslim countries such as Azerbaijan, which oppose Tehran’s ambitions. Azerbaijan is a secular, Shia Muslim-majority state and the largest country in the South Caucasus by territory, population, economy, and military capability. It is a growing contributor to Europe’s energy security, supplying oil and gas to European Union countries and Israel, an alternative to Russia, and a transportation hub between Europe and Central Asia. Azerbaijan has developed more far-reaching ties with Israel than any other Muslim state, including a 30-year military and strategic partnership. Israel sided with Azerbaijan when it reclaimed the territory of Karabakh from Armenia in a brief military operation in September 2020, while Iran supported Armenia. Following the war, disputes intensified between Iran and Azerbaijan over transportation routes across the South Caucasus. Leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee stated at a December 2024 meeting with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev that Washington had not fully appreciated Baku’s support for Israel. Azerbaijan has been key for Israel’s energy security, has been its largest oil supplier, and boosted its oil exports during Israel’s 2024 war against Hamas. Azerbaijan has also been a leading purchaser of Israeli military equipment . A new military agreement was signed in September 2024 that will boost Baku’s engagement in projects critical to Israel’s security. Azerbaijan’s positive regional role is also evident in efforts to mediate relations between Israel and Turkey, which have deteriorated since the war against Hamas. Aliyev has participated in previous efforts and is prepared for a similar role, while also mediating between Israel and other Muslim states. Azerbaijan and Israel have also developed close ties between their intelligence agencies , especially in monitoring Iran, as both countries view the ayatollah regime as an existential threat. Working with Israel, the Abraham Accords countries, and other partners willing to challenge the Iranian and Russian agendas in the Black Sea basin, the Caucasus, and the greater Middle East will enable the Trump administration to undercut terror and war without having to do all of the heavy lifting.

Violent climate action is not free speech,"As the Trump administration pursues a mission to develop America’s fossil fuel resources, people must unfortunately brace for the impending countermovements from environmental activists who increasingly deploy destructive tactics to gain attention and spread their message. While the Biden administration was largely friendly to environmental causes, it was not immune to disruptive and confrontational protests against its officials. Protesters chanting “Petro Pete” chased former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg offstage at a Maryland policy forum in 2023. Roughly 100 activists attempted to blockade former President Joe Biden’s Department of Energy last December. Biden even found himself interrupted by a climate protester during a speech honoring the late Sen. John McCain. If this is how the environmental movement treats its friends, one can only imagine the lengths it will go against President Donald Trump, who has vowed to “drill, baby, drill.” People should be concerned because environmental activists aren’t just protesting. They are vandalizing works of art and culture. In the past year alone, they have put adhesive stickers on a Monet painting, thrown tomato soup on the works of Van Gogh and the Mona Lisa , and sprayed orange paint on Stonehenge. Protesters are also actively interfering with commerce, upending the lives of ordinary citizens. Last May, climate activists glued themselves to the runway of a busy German airport, leading to flight cancellations and delays. In April, protesters blocked traffic during rush hour in Boston, a tactic they had previously employed over multiple days in Washington, D.C., provoking angry responses from commuters unable to get to work. If the day-to-day concerns of the working class don’t resonate with these environmental protesters, perhaps it’s because so few of them come from it. A recent Brookings Institution paper found that the most radical flank of environmentalists are overwhelmingly white (93%), middle-aged (average age of 52), and highly educated, with 91% having completed college and one-third having an advanced degree. These highly educated, what they would deem “privileged,” groups care far more about the opinions of wealthy progressive groups such as the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, which keeps a global tracker of climate protests and their outcomes. They are also cheered on by bureaucrats at the United Nations, who issued a report calling for countries to listen to these disruptive protesters rather than enforce the multiple laws they are breaking. This is just one of many issues the United Nations gets wrong. When environmental protesters break the law, they should be prosecuted just like any other people. To do otherwise sends a dangerous message that their cause puts them above the law. An impending court case in North Dakota could help deliver that message. In 2016, Greenpeace helped organize and sustain “protests” against a lawful pipeline project in the state. The Greenpeace-backed protesters destroyed property, set fires, and engaged in violent riots. The broader movement also targeted banks and financial institutions thought to be financing the project. In one case, a Denver bank had its windows smashed and was graffitied with anti-pipeline rhetoric. Ultimately, after protests turned violent, six banks pulled their financing for the project. While the pipeline was ultimately built, a University of Colorado study found that the environmental terrorism campaign cost the energy company and its partners constructing the pipeline an estimated $7.5 billion. The company is now suing Greenpeace, alleging the group helped organize and fund the costly and damaging demonstrations. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech and protest, but it does not give organizations or individuals the right to engage in violence and destruction. When laws are broken and property is destroyed, there must be consequences. “Climate action” is not a defense to illegal action. As the Trump administration delivers on its energy development promises, outraged radical environmental activists deserve to have their say. But while protecting their rights, the justice system must also protect the rights of the rest of society by holding accountable any activists, as well as their Big Green backers, who go beyond vitriol and engage in vandalism and violence to bully those with whom they disagree. The decisions made in the North Dakota case will set the tone for whether, in the future, activist groups are permitted to fund and perpetuate crimes when their arguments fail to persuade the majority.

Trump should help save the SS United States,"In its heyday, the SS United States was a glorious ocean liner, a modern marvel of the world, and a prodigious example of U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing at a time when U.S. manufacturing was arguably at its zenith. It was built during the Cold War in 1951 and is the country’s largest ocean liner ever constructed, a behemoth that is 100 feet larger than the Titanic. It set a record for the fastest ocean liner ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean during its maiden voyage in 1952, which still stands today. It is a cherished piece of American innovation and history and a stunning example of engineering ingenuity. However, now, the SS United States needs the help of President Donald Trump. Otherwise, its fate awaits a final resting place at the bottom of the Gulf of America, formerly the Gulf of Mexico, as an artificial reef. However, if Trump has shown anything over his political career, it is his ability to turn the seemingly impossible into a reality. Since 1996, the ship has been largely forgotten, docked at a pier in south Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In August, a judge ruled it could no longer stay there and gave the deadline of Sept. 12 to find it a new home. In October 2024, Okaloosa County, Florida, purchased the vessel for $10 million, with plans to turn the iconic ocean liner into an artificial reef . The ship was supposed to be transferred several times from Philadelphia to Florida before a stop in Alabama, but there have been multiple delays. It’s almost as if divine intervention is preventing the ship from meeting its fate. Now, there needs to be a presidential intervention. Trump would have to act fast, as the ship’s voyage to its final destination has been delayed yet again, with the departure date now scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 19 . Admittedly, it could be too little, too late, but through the Antiquities Act of 1906, Trump would seemingly have the authority to declare the SS United States a protected historical landmark. The Antiquities Act typically focuses on designations on federal lands. However, ships have been designated as national historic landmarks in years past, including the USS Olympia , a ship from the Spanish-American War, located just a few miles from where the SS United States is currently docked in Philadelphia. The National Historic Preservation Act permanently established this ship’s historical importance. Trump should use that as a precedent to give the SS United States the same designation. And, if neither of the aforementioned acts is sufficient legislation to save the vessel, something should still be done to preserve it. If there is a way for Trump or any U.S. legislator to save the legendary ocean liner, it should be done. Furthermore, Trump has shown a great fondness and appreciation for U.S. history. He has regularly stressed the importance of defending the country’s history and the significance of the nation’s historical artifacts, landmarks, and monuments. In 2020, he created a task force to build a National Garden of American Heroes . Although an ocean liner, the construction of the SS United States was heroic. It is an example of the American mind and the brilliance of engineering. It’s a first-of-its-kind ocean liner that wowed the world with its size and speed. The nautical icon should be recognized for its historical importance and legacy.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-18T03:46:50+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3322085/trump-should-help-save-ss-united-states/
Trump’s Latin America realignment puts America first,"It’s simple: if you care about problems such as drugs, crime, and illegal migration, you must care about what’s happening in Latin America. But for a long time, the region has taken a backseat in U.S. foreign policy. Until now. For the first time in nearly 50 years, the United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has made Latin America the top priority of U.S. foreign policy. One of the most important signals the administration sent was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make his first international trip to Latin America. There, he successfully negotiated with Panama to curb China’s influence over the Panama Canal, leading Panama to rescind its agreement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative. He also secured an agreement with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for the Central American country to receive criminal deportees to alleviate the U.S. system. Trump has also made it clear that he will not allow socialist puppets of Cuba and Venezuela to undermine American security interests. He confronted Colombia’s failed socialist president, Gustavo Petro, demanding that Colombia accept two flights of illegal migrants being repatriated from the United States—and Petro paid for it. Trump demonstrated American resolve and embarrassed Petro on the world stage. The administration has also delivered on its promise to use tariffs to ensure fair treatment from other nations in the Western Hemisphere. After threatening a 25% tariff on Mexican imports, Trump forced Mexico’s socialist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to deploy Mexican national guard troops to our southern border to curb the flow of fentanyl. These things matter because they have an impact on the everyday life of Americans — and what a great thing that Trump knows and understands that. The actions our partners in the western hemisphere take, or the actions they don’t, directly correlate to gang violence in our communities, such as Tren de Aragua members wreaking havoc in Colorado. It goes hand-in-hand with violent criminals who should never have been here taking the lives of our loved ones, heartbreaking scenarios that are very real to people such as Laken Riley’s family. It’s tied to the kitchen table, where an empty seat marks the loss of a loved one to an entirely preventable fentanyl-related death. Trump promised the people he would address the root causes of migration, drug flows, and illegal migration. Promises made, promises kept. This has been the core motto of the administration’s foreign policy toward Latin America—and it’s a motto well-earned. The first 100 days of any presidency set the tone for the entire term. We didn’t need even a month to see Trump assert that this hemisphere is our sphere of influence and we will not allow our adversaries to take it from us. Not now, not ever. As Chairwoman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am working alongside the president to strengthen relationships with our Latin American partners, establish common ground for mutual benefit with countries that may be skeptical of the U.S., and dismantle the destructive influence of our enemies in the region. To our allies across the hemisphere—from the courageous democratic movement in Venezuela to the Christians in Nicaragua resisting the regime of Daniel Ortega to the brave freedom fighters confronting the repressive apparatus of the Castro/Díaz-Canel dictatorship in Cuba —know this: the United States stands by your side. We are fighting for you and doing the hard work necessary to create the conditions for freedom and democracy to flourish. To those who stand in the way of freedom, who aid and abet cartels, terrorists, and human traffickers, or who ally with China, Russia, and Iran, know this: your days are numbered. A golden age in America will lead to a golden age for the world. No matter what, liberty and prosperity will prevail.

Democrats backed DOGE for years — until Trump took over,"The United States is $36 trillion in debt , and Washington, D.C., continues to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars. Instead of efficiency, people have gotten an ever-growing bureaucracy that wastes taxpayer dollars and is unaccountable to the public. This is exactly why President Donald Trump’s initiative to implement the Department of Government Efficiency represents a bold step toward draining the bureaucratic swamp, forcing federal agencies to streamline, modernize, and justify their spending. But the biggest irony of the backlash against DOGE is who is leading the resistance. DOGE is actually the new name for the United States Digital Service, which then-President Barack Obama created in 2014 . For years, Democrats praised it. They had no problem when Obama and Joe Biden’s USDS embedded Silicon Valley insiders deep in our federal agencies, including giving engineers access to Medicare’s mainframe , which processes billions of dollars in payments every year. USDS ballooned into a bureaucratic mess with little accountability, but because its politics aligned with the Democratic Party, its access to sensitive government systems was never questioned. But now that Trump has renamed the USDS the DOGE and enlisted one of the most brilliant innovators of our time, Elon Musk, to reform our bloated bureaucracy, the same people who cheered USDS are trying to incite a riot outside the Treasury Department. The same people who let USDS tinker with Medicare’s billion-dollar payment system now want to block Trump from cutting waste. Under Obama and Biden, employees of the USDS were described as “idealistic tech workers,” while Musk is described as an “oligarch” and his team labeled as “young” and “inexperienced.” The hypocrisy is nonsensical. Contrary to reports, members of the DOGE team do not have access to people’s sensitive details or information, and they cannot stop payments. As they work to audit federal agencies, they are monitored by agency officials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was confirmed by the Senate, granted the DOGE team access to the Treasury’s payment system in a read-only capacity to review the overall efficiency of the system. But government reform shouldn’t be a partisan issue. DOGE represents a turning point in how our government operates. For decades, despite my attempts to get reforms, Washington’s default solution to inefficiency has been to throw more money at the problem. But Trump knows better — real reform means cutting waste, not feeding it. If Democrats were truly serious about responsible governance, they would be applauding Trump. Instead, they’re doing what they do best: protecting the bloated status quo. I made a pledge to my constituents to stop the spigot of spending, and with Trump back in the White House, we will not accept the status quo. We are committed to cutting waste, reining in spending, and building the golden age of America.

Trump should call for new elections in Georgia,"On Nov. 28, 2024, Georgia’s ruling Georgian Dream party announced the suspension of the country’s European Union accession process until 2028 — a move widely viewed as a betrayal of the nation’s long-standing aspirations to join Western alliances. Within an hour of the announcement, protesters flooded Tbilisi’s central thoroughfare in defiance of what they saw as a dangerous pivot away from the country’s pro-Western trajectory. In response, the United States suspended its Strategic Partnership with Georgia, with the State Department warning that the decision made the country more vulnerable to Kremlin influence. However, Washington’s reaction was largely symbolic, failing to deter the Georgian government. This marked a failure of deterrence on the part of the Biden administration, which, despite repeated warnings, failed to impose meaningful consequences on Georgian Dream’s leadership. For years, Georgia has stood out as a pro-American stronghold in a region increasingly contested by Russian and Chinese influence. The Georgian people have consistently demonstrated their commitment to Western values — through their overwhelming support for NATO membership, participation in U.S.-led military missions, and rejection of authoritarianism. Yet, despite this reservoir of goodwill, Washington has been unable to prevent Georgia’s leadership from steering the country toward Moscow and Beijing. Now, President Donald Trump has a critical opportunity to correct this course — if he chooses to leverage U.S. influence wisely. Under Georgian Dream, the country has drifted from its pro-Western orientation, embracing policies that align with the Kremlin’s interests rather than the will of its people. Crackdowns on media freedom, intimidation of opposition figures, and the passage of Russia-style “foreign agent” laws signal a troubling regression. Meanwhile, Georgia has deepened economic and security ties with China, which views the country as a critical transit hub for its Belt and Road Initiative. The ruling party has granted major infrastructure contracts to Chinese companies, including plans for a Chinese state-affiliated company to construct the strategic Anaklia Deep Sea Port — deliberately excluding U.S. involvement despite high-level interest from Trump’s first administration. The implications of this shift are severe. Georgia’s strategic importance cannot be overstated. Just an hour’s flight from Tehran, it has served as a key location for U.S. military and intelligence operations in the region. Georgia has previously offered its territory for American military purposes, underscoring its value as an ally. Allowing the country to fall into Russia and China’s sphere of influence would weaken U.S. security interests in the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Europe. Georgian Dream’s shift away from the West has sparked massive protests across the country. Instead of engaging with domestic and international concerns, the ruling party has opted for violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators, mass arrests of activists and journalists, and an intensification of anti-U.S. and anti-Western rhetoric. New repressive measures, including laws prohibiting protesters from wearing masks and new media restrictions, highlight the government’s desperation to maintain power at any cost. The party’s conspiratorial rhetoric has only grown more extreme. In the lead-up to the contested October elections, widely viewed as neither free nor fair, Georgian Dream framed the country’s political crisis as the work of a mythical “global war party” allegedly plotting revolution and seeking to open a second front against Russia. According to this narrative, billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the party’s founder and de facto ruler, stands as the sole force resisting these supposed global actors. Having built his fortune in Russia, Ivanishvili has since consolidated his grip over Georgia’s political system. Following Trump’s victory, Georgian Dream began invoking the term “deep state” in an apparent attempt to align itself with Trump’s worldview. This is a cynical ploy to secure his administration’s favor while continuing policies that contradict U.S. interests. In reality, it has transformed Georgian institutions into a kleptocratic “deep state” where the judiciary and state institutions are controlled by loyalists. The party’s anti-Western orientation was further exposed when Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze attended the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian alongside Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was later assassinated in Tehran. Meanwhile, Georgia has strengthened economic and political ties with China, signing a free trade agreement and a strategic partnership with Beijing, endorsing China’s vision of a restructured world order. Georgia’s informal ruler, Ivanishvili, now hopes that the Trump administration will shield it from international criticism and legitimize its authoritarian practices. One of the most concerning examples of this is the party’s handling of the strategic Anaklia Deep Sea Port project. Despite high-level U.S. interest in developing the port as a crucial transit hub, Georgian Dream instead granted major infrastructure contracts to Chinese companies, allowing Beijing to expand its influence in the region. The decision not only undermines Georgia’s strategic relationship with the West but also places a critical infrastructure project under the sway of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, further entrenching Chinese economic control in the region. If the Trump administration provides even tacit approval of Georgian Dream’s actions, it would legitimize the party’s authoritarian trajectory and effectively cede Georgia to Russian and Chinese influence. This would be a devastating betrayal for a country that has long resisted Russian aggression — from Soviet occupation to the 2008 war. It would also undermine decades of U.S. efforts to support Georgia’s independence and sovereignty. Instead, the U.S. must take a firm stance against the Georgian Dream’s growing authoritarianism. The Republican-led Non-Recognition Act, currently in Congress, outlines key measures that could shape Washington’s response. These should include targeted sanctions against regime figures, increased support for Georgian people, calls for the immediate release of political prisoners, and, most importantly, pressure for new free and fair elections. The Georgian people have made their aspirations clear: They seek to be part of Western civilization. Washington must ensure that their voices are heard — and that authoritarian backsliding does not go unchallenged. Trump must recognize that the Georgian Dream is not an ally — it is a Trojan horse for Russia and China in the South Caucasus.

Trump should follow the Florida and Virginia models on criminal justice reform,"Criminal justice reform has been a key priority for President Donald Trump, and there is a prime opportunity to enact changes that emphasize rehabilitation, reduce recidivism, and provide second chances for those willing to improve their lives. While states such as Virginia have made strides, Florida’s successful implementation of reform measures offers a powerful example of how policies can incentivize personal growth and reintegration into society while also promoting public safety. Florida’s version of criminal justice reform is centered on a transformative approach, focusing on giving people on supervision a real chance to earn their way out of the system. Gov. Ron DeSantis, supported by key figures such as now-U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, signed a reform bill that mirrors this idea: individuals on supervision can reduce their term of supervision in the community by engaging in rehabilitative actions such as educational programs, job training, mental health treatment, and securing stable housing. These policies not only reward proactive efforts but also foster a system of personal accountability, giving individuals a clearer path to rebuilding their lives. This approach works because it targets rehabilitation, offering those who have served their time the opportunity to prove they have changed while still maintaining accountability. In Florida, the ability to earn probation credits is a clear motivator, offering individuals an incentive to demonstrate their commitment to self-improvement. This system shows that the state isn’t simply letting people off the hook but is instead offering them the tools to be successful and reintegrate into the community. Florida’s success with this model has proven its effectiveness. By focusing on rehabilitation over punitive measures, the state has reduced its caseloads, cut costs, and created a more efficient system that helps people reintegrate rather than cycling through incarceration and supervision. Additionally, the reform helps keep dangerous offenders off the streets by prioritizing resources for those who pose a greater risk to society. For individuals who show genuine progress, this system allows them the opportunity to move beyond their past mistakes and return to productive, law-abiding lives. Moreover, Florida’s reforms have garnered broad support across political lines, proving that criminal justice reform doesn’t need to be a partisan issue. There is increasing recognition, both from Republicans and Democrats, that costly and ineffective prolonged supervision is not the solution. By focusing on reducing recidivism through rehabilitative measures, Florida has shown that justice and personal growth can coexist—ultimately benefiting taxpayers, communities, and individuals who are seeking a fresh start. Virginia, under Gov. Glenn Youngkin, has also embraced a forward-thinking approach to criminal justice reform. Youngkin’s “ Stand Tall, Stay Strong, Succeed Together ” Reentry Initiative mirrors Florida’s emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration. The executive order strengthens Virginia’s commitment to supporting successful reentry for individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system. The initiative focuses on collaboration between government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and local communities to provide the tools and resources necessary for successful reintegration, such as education, job training, and mental health services. Youngkin’s initiative aligns with Florida’s model by prioritizing rehabilitation over punishment and ensuring individuals who have served their time are provided the support they need to successfully reenter society. Like Florida’s reform efforts, Virginia’s approach is designed to reduce recidivism and help individuals avoid returning to the criminal justice system. Additionally, proposed legislation in Virginia, namely House Bill 2252 and Senate Bill 936, will bring the state’s probation system in line with Youngkin’s executive order but also with Florida’s successful model. These bills would allow individuals on supervision in Virginia to reduce their terms based on participation in rehabilitation programs, much like the system in Florida that incentivizes positive actions such as job training and educational involvement. This approach is designed to encourage self-improvement while reducing the burden on probation officers and the state’s resources. By adopting these reforms, Virginia can mirror the success Florida has seen, making the justice system more efficient, cost-effective, and focused on rehabilitation rather than prolonged supervision. The success of Florida’s reforms, combined with Virginia’s proactive steps under the executive order and proposed legislation such as HB 2252 and SB 936, serves as a model for other states. Both states have demonstrated that criminal justice reform doesn’t have to be an either/or between punishment and rehabilitation. Instead, they have shown that a smart, compassionate approach can help reduce crime, lower costs, and create safer communities while offering individuals a chance to rebuild their lives. For Trump and lawmakers in Congress, Florida’s success offers a blueprint for how reform can work, advancing a system that offers not just punishment but a real opportunity for redemption. By looking to Florida and Virginia as examples, lawmakers can enact reforms that align with the president’s agenda while making a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals who are working to turn things around.

The idea of DOGE is at the root of American values,"The federal government is very good at creating acronyms. However, what the federal government is terrible at doing is accounting for the money it spends. Despite spending nearly $2 billion on government-spending watchdog alphabet agencies, such as the OIG, or Office of the Inspector General, and GAO, or the Government Accountability Office, it took President Donald Trump ’s creation of an independent nonaligned auditor called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , to identify wasteful and possibly corrupt federal expenditures. It is headed by the technical and business genius Elon Musk . Democrats in Congress have become apoplectic at the idea that Trump has engaged the services of an independent person to conduct an audit of federal expenditures. The reasons for this have become quite obvious in recent days. Spending tax dollars is the engine that powers the Democratic Party’s political machine. Anything that jeopardizes this engine jeopardizes their power. Not surprisingly, it took very little time for Musk to find billions of taxpayer dollars being spent extravagantly, frivolously, wastefully — and, possibly, even corruptly. He informed Trump of this, and Trump ordered a freeze on spending. This drove House and Senate Democrats off a cliff. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led a group of Democratic politicians and a crowd of presumably government employees, whose livelihoods depend on government spending, in a protest. The demonstration quickly degenerated into calls by left-wing politicians for violent mob action. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) wanted the mob to “get into the faces” of Republicans. There were chants to shut down the Senate. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) called for Democrats to fight in the streets — just like their ideological ancestors, the socialists and communists, did. And it happened about a week after a lunatic planned to murder congressional Republicans with Molotov cocktails. The battle lines are now clearly drawn. On one side is the radical Democratic Left. It represents those who lust for government power, the party whose very existence depends on increasing the size and scope of government and whose members depend on government largesse for their livelihood. They are the people who fly flags with the sickle and hammer. They are the people who riot and destroy everything from urban communities to college campuses. They support socialism and neo-Marxism, the tenets of which are critical race theory, transgender ideology, hatred of Western civilization and American culture, and antipathy toward religion. On the other side are the Republicans, who believe the government serves the people. They are the party that believes, as Founding Father James Madison did, that the interests of men must be connected with constitutional rights. They support the ideals that emphasize the notion that government is a reflection of human nature. As Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers , “If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.” The problem is that one “must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.” The Republican Party represents Main Street, the Forgotten Person, social conservatism, fiscal responsibility, freedom from fear, freedom from poverty, freedom to worship, and freedom from war. It reveres the triumphs of Western civilization and American culture, accomplishments of human civilization that have improved the quality of life for all. Simply put, DOGE is the latest manifestation of one political party’s efforts to prevent the other from using America’s treasure to spread its toxic ideals while pursuing greater influence and power. The idea of DOGE is at the root of cherished American values. Madison would be happy.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-07T15:02:20+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3313825/doge-root-american-values/
Kelly Loeffler is the champion small businesses need,"In Iowa and across the country, Main Street is in trouble. Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities, but under former President Joe Biden’s administration, they were crushed by bureaucratic overreach. After four years of price hikes and dismay, optimism on Main Street recently surged to its highest level since 2018 because job creators are eager for Republicans and the Trump administration to revitalize the small business economy. That starts with fixing the broken Small Business Administration , which has become a bloated bureaucratic mess. Change starts at the top, and we need a proven business leader as SBA administrator to gut the red tape and refocus the agency on serving Main Street. As an accomplished businesswoman, Kelly Loeffler is the perfect person for the job. Throughout her career, she rose through the ranks at multiple companies due to her determination and grit. She also started many businesses and knows what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. Most importantly, she knows what it means to be overrun by Washington’s bureaucratic overreach — and that the government must instead get out of the way so businesses can thrive. I believe substantial reforms must be made to get the SBA back in shape, and that will require strong leadership. While the SBA once may have been characterized as a smaller agency, COVID-19-era small business programs made the agency a household name, as it received $1.1 trillion in taxpayer funding to assist small businesses during the pandemic. With that funding came big responsibilities, and I remain concerned that the SBA has too often failed to live up to its mission. The Biden administration decided to turn a blind eye to COVID-19 fraud and delinquencies, refusing to properly collect outstanding debt and fraudulent funds, which has huge implications for the taxpayer. Reports have indicated the SBA charged about $18.6 billion worth of economic injury disaster loans in fiscal 2024. The agency has also been unable to provide an accounting of its loans receivable and loan guarantees, which means the Government Accountability Office hasn’t been able to even issue a financial audit of the agency since fiscal 2020. The SBA also mismanaged and misinformed Congress last year regarding its disaster loan account, resulting in a shortfall that lasted 66 days — an unacceptable failure for the disaster victims in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Florida. On top of this, it also appears the agency’s workforce continues to stay home, while its more than 246,000-square-foot Washington headquarters sits empty . The GAO found that even if everyone did show up to work in person, the SBA’s building space would still only be 67% utilized . That is why I introduced a bill to relocate 30% of the headquarters workforce to the SBA district offices across the country and cut 30% of office space. Not only will this save taxpayers money, but it will bring SBA employees closer to the people they serve. As chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I will work with Loeffler to ensure that the SBA effectively utilizes its personnel and that small businesses across the country can access resources if they need them. Small businesses will drive America into the Golden Age, but only if we get Washington out of the way. Loeffler will get the job done, and I encourage my Senate colleagues to confirm her, so we can unleash the small business economy.

The HALT Fentanyl Act gives Americans hope,"The fentanyl crisis in America is an unnecessary story of anguish and despair, one that elicits pain and stifles hope. The story of 23-year-old college student Zach Cullen, who was preparing for life beyond college, is one of those stories of anguish. He spent four years delivering pizzas from Papa Johns and was interested in developing a technology company. Nine days after Cullen’s birthday, his parents got painful news. They were informed by police that their son, the youngest of their three boys, died from fentanyl-related poisoning. Cullen’s parents later testified before a House Energy and Commerce Committee roundtable demanding change. House Republicans then committed to preventing future tragedies such as Cullen’s. We put pen to paper and worked on a bill to save lives and crack down on the fentanyl crisis: the HALT Fentanyl Act. In 2023, of the more than 107,000 overdose deaths in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that nearly 70% of those deaths involved a synthetic opioid, such as fentanyl. Part of the fentanyl crisis is driven by the rise in fentanyl analogs, which are fentanyl-related substances chemically altered to avoid being defined as fentanyl under the U.S. criminal code. This means the penalties for trafficking these substances are not as severe as those for traditional fentanyl. Drug cartels have even attempted to exploit this loophole to get away with trafficking the illicit substance into the country. A key component of the HALT Fentanyl Act would permanently classify fentanyl analogs as a Schedule I substance. This designation would equip our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials with the power to go after those who traffic fentanyl analogs into the country and throughout our communities. What makes this legislation even more timely is that the Schedule I designation for fentanyl analogs currently operates on a temporary basis and is set to expire at the end of next month. Failure of Congress to act soon could exacerbate the fentanyl crisis. It is important to note that this permanent designation does not prevent medical researchers from studying fentanyl analogs. The HALT Fentanyl Act would enable research into the possible medical uses of the roughly 4,800 fentanyl analogs that exist, and the bill would not impede medical providers from using fentanyl in medical practices when necessary. It’s a win-win piece of legislation, and we wish it could have been law sooner. Almost two years ago, we passed the HALT Fentanyl Act out of the House. While the bill did garner bipartisan support, 132 House Democrats voted against it. In Sen. Chuck Schumer’s (D-NY) Senate, Democrats refused to bring it up for a vote. This week, we are glad to see the House will be voting on the bill once again. House Republicans are ready to make our communities safer and enhance medical research to prevent future poisonings. This time around, we implore all Democrats to join us in advancing this commonsense bill. They have a chance to join us on legislation that may be one of the first things President Donald Trump signs into law. More than 100,000 overdose deaths should have been a wake-up call. Even one is too many. Every single life lost to the fentanyl crisis is more than just a statistic. We have not given up hope because families such as Cullen’s should not have to experience the heartbreak of losing a child to fentanyl poisoning.

A new day for border security and the rule of law,"Just one year ago, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 300,000 southwest border encounters in a single month — a record. On Jan. 26, no southwest border sector experienced more than 200 border apprehensions. In fact, one of the busiest sectors along the southwest border, Del Rio, Texas, only recorded 60. Indeed, President Donald Trump has done more in the first 100 hours of his administration to secure our borders than former President Joe Biden did in his entire presidency. First, Trump took executive action to declare an emergency and surge resources to the southwest border, including mobilizing 1,500 additional active-duty troops to assist with border security operations. While these measures may seem drastic, it’s important to remember how we got here. For four years, Biden, former Vice President and “border czar” Kamala Harris, and former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas refused to enforce our nation’s laws or defend our sovereign borders, inflicting chaos and destruction on communities across this country. In just the first week of Trump’s presidency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 2,373 illegal immigrants nationwide in targeted removal operations. Many of them had criminal histories, including murder, sexual assault, and even a connection to foreign terrorist organizations. These illegal immigrants never should’ve been given the opportunity to roam free in our communities in the first place. By the last summer of Biden’s presidency, nearly 650,000 criminal illegal immigrants in the country were not in ICE detention, 35,000 of whom were convicted of or charged with either murder or sexual assault. This number includes both criminal immigrants encountered and released by CBP, immigrants released after committing crimes due to sanctuary city policies, and even some of the 2 million known “gotaways” who evaded apprehension at the border. While border encounters and releases rose to record highs, deportations of criminal immigrants dropped 74% under Biden compared to Trump’s first term. ICE officers were significantly obstructed by the Biden administration from fulfilling their duty to remove criminal immigrants from our communities. Now, Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and “border czar” Tom Homan have sent the message that America will fully enforce the laws on the books, starting with removing dangerous criminal illegal immigrants. In 2023, Chief Border Patrol Agent John Modlin of the Tucson Sector told my committee that illegal immigrants had begun turning themselves in along the border “because they believe they’re going to stay in the United States.” With the stroke of a pen, Trump ended catch-and-release and empowered Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers to do their jobs — both between and at ports of entry. In the last two years, a staggering 1.5 million inadmissible immigrants were unlawfully paroled into our communities, with insufficient vetting, at ports of entry nationwide under Biden’s Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan and CBP One app mass-parole scheme. The committee learned in 2023 that for months, around 96% of the inadmissible immigrants who scheduled appointments via the CBP One app were released on parole — not “on a case-by-case basis,” as the Immigration and Nationality Act requires. Even worse, the fraud in the CHNV program was so brazen that even the previous administration temporarily paused applications. In his first week, Trump ended this abuse of parole and reinforced ICE’s authority to swiftly remove these inadmissible immigrants. The impact of the Trump administration’s actions doesn’t stop at the border. By securing our borders, the president is also dismantling the cartels’ business model and weakening their influence in the U.S. In a 2023 transcribed interview with my committee, a Border Patrol sector chief confirmed that cartels consider Americans living near the border inside “the theater of engagement.” It’s no surprise — the Biden administration’s era of open borders and antienforcement policies gifted these cartels an estimated $14 million per day in profit from human smuggling alone. Now, Trump has set in motion the process to designate certain cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which would create a whole-of-government effort to combat their deadly human and drug smuggling operations. Even as threats from these desperate criminals continue, our front-line law enforcement can now breathe a sigh of relief with Trump back in the White House. Under Biden, Border Patrol agents were not just overworked but also prevented from accomplishing their true mission in the field. I spent time at the border with our CBP officers and agents. I saw their exhaustion and falling morale firsthand. I heard from their loved ones about the emotional and physical impacts of the Biden border crisis. Now, these agents know they have the support of their president as they carry out their sworn duty to protect Americans. If Trump’s first week in office is any indication of the next four years, every American has reason to hope. The days of our sovereignty being taken for granted are over. Promise made. Promise kept.

‘Conception begins at erection’: The absurd theater of the Left,"Ohio Democrats proposed a bill earlier this month to prohibit the discharge of semen except with the intent to fertilize any embryo. Titled the Conception Begins at Erection Act, this Saturday Night Live skit posing as legislation is proof that the remaining leftists in Ohio are neither serious nor likely to find their way out of the political wilderness anytime soon. This is clearly much ado about nothing. The bill has no bipartisan sponsors in a legislature that is dominated by the GOP. It will go nowhere and will get there in record time. However, the two Democratic legislators are hijacking the most essential process of self-government for absurd leftist theater. According to a report from the Statehouse News Bureau , the bill contains exceptions for masturbation, using a condom, and “the LGBTQ community.” The two sponsors said their bill was designed to “regulate the reproductive rights of men,” according to the outlet. The effect of the bill would be to prevent any heterosexual couple, but no one else, from engaging in sex unless they want to have a baby. There is no assertion as to why this outcome would produce any benefit whatsoever, and legacy media outlets have not pressed the question. Nor did they ask whether taking a law of general application and leaving out a group of people who cannot be objectively defined would be constitutional, much less desirable public policy. One might as well propose a bill that regulates car sales but excludes vegans. The sponsors did explain vaguely that they were reacting to past pro-life legislation that only applied to women, although in what appeared to be a concession that there are only two sexes, state Rep. Anita Somani, an OB-GYN, said, “We need to look at it from the broader perspective of regulating one sex and not the other.” Since her bill does precisely that, the only logical conclusion is that she is abusing her privilege as a legislator to make a partisan political statement with a proposed law that she has no intention of passing. Neither the Democratic sponsors nor the media discussed the serious question of why this legislation was timely or even needed in a state that has enshrined a broader-than- Roe v. Wade right to abortion in its state constitution. No matter. The bit of absurdity provided a rare opportunity to use the word “erection” in a headline, and the politicians and media collaborative got to share a clickbait giggle.

The problem with the artificial womb,"“What if we changed one of the fundamental building blocks of life?” That’s the question posed in a new short animated video by TED-Ed, one of a five-part series about revolutionizing human life. The producers explain, “This narrative follows the young library assistant Ada as she juggles two worlds: her daily mundane reality and the future she vividly imagines for all humanity. Traveling through her visions of potential futures, Ada grapples with the ethical and social implications of new technologies and how they could shape the world.” The fundamental building block Ada wants to eliminate in this video? Pregnancy . Ada participates in a thought experiment, considering if women would have more freedom or less if they weren’t the ones physically giving birth. She begins by explaining why the artificial womb is appealing: because birth isn’t. She says she’s not sure she wants to have children , especially given how pregnancy is sold. “I definitely don’t want to be pregnant. If you listen to the way people casually describe pregnancy and birth! ‘Oh, nothing out of the ordinary, just puked every day for months.’ ‘It was a routine delivery, just a standard tearing of the genitals,'” she says. “‘With modern medicine, hardly anyone dies!’ How is everyone just shrugging and just saying that’s the way it is? Like, excuse me? Am I the only one who thinks that this activity is not suitable for civilians?” Exasperated, she sighs, “It’s so unfair!” As someone who has done it six times, I’m not going to sit here and sugarcoat pregnancy. I did, in fact, puke every day for months. I’m not a fan, and my dread about pregnancy did make me think long and hard about whether I felt like I could physically and emotionally handle it again before taking the plunge. It was much easier to make that decision the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth times, though, because, after my first, I realized that even though my pregnancies might not be easy, they were going to be worth it. I never realized before I had a child that for how not great pregnancy is, the child you get on the other end is going to make up for it. This is something deeply wrong with how we’ve depicted motherhood for young people: We’re accentuating the negative and completely neglecting the positive. Women don’t hear about how empowering birth can be or how transformative the entire experience is. It’s a rite of passage, not one to be circumvented because of physical and emotional discomfort. However, just as we’re not teaching women and girls that there’s a profound upside to pregnancy, we’re also not imbuing in them a sense of resilience or pride in resilience. “Nothing that’s worth having in life comes easy” is not a message a generation who received participation trophies often heard. In the TED-Ed video featuring Ada, we also meet her grandmother, who reminds her she’s not getting any younger and encourages her to make the decision to have children before her biological clock makes the decision for her. Ada takes this urging as a challenge to figure out how to outsmart and circumvent Mother Nature (have none of these people seen Jurassic Park ?) instead of just considering that maybe Grandma possesses some generational wisdom worth heeding. Unsurprisingly, the TED-Ed video then takes a turn in the direction of abortion, with Ada worrying that if artificial wombs are created, there won’t be an excuse for women to abort babies any longer. The only thing more horrible than pregnancy to Ada is the idea that someone may view an unborn baby as deserving of life and give her the ability to survive outside of her mother’s womb if her mother does not wish to carry her to term. Instead of seeing an artificial womb as a way to eliminate the supposed need for abortion, Ada is concerned that women will no longer be able to terminate the lives of their unborn children if artificial wombs are created as a viable alternative. The video series is a reminder of how far the Left is moving away from biological reality with every passing day. For all of its protestations that “in this house we believe in science,” there’s no understanding or desire to learn about the critically important biological and emotional bonds that take place during pregnancy between mother and baby, not to mention fetal development. The future that TED-Ed’s Ada imagines of artificial wombs is truly dystopian to its core, artificial in every way. Bethany Mandel ( @bethanyshondark ) is a homeschooling mother of six and a writer.

Europe can’t yet handle the truth,"Sometimes a friend needs to hear the truth, even or perhaps especially if it hurts. Europe is a case in point. Vice President JD Vance delivered the painful truth at the Munich Security Conference, and the fact that it made his German hosts literally cry underscores both the veracity of his message and the state of denial to which our trans-Atlantic friends have sunk. “This conference started as a trans-Atlantic conference,” Chairman Christoph Heusgen said at the event’s closing. “After the speech of Vice President Vance on Friday, we have to fear that our common value base is not that common anymore.” He then burst into tears. What did Vance say to make Heusgen weep? He said plainly that European nations should allow their citizens to speak freely, even on contentious issues such as abortion and mass migration, and that they should honor the outcome of free and fair elections. For Europe’s governing class, such a vigorous defense of democratic values was shocking. Before becoming the Munich Security Conference chairman in 2022, Heusgen served as Germany’s ambassador to the United Nations, where he infamously laughed at President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Germany’s national security has been compromised by its dependence on Russian energy. Trump has since been completely vindicated by Germany’s economic weakness after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Before that, Heusgen served as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s under-secretary for foreign and security policy, overseeing Merkel’s disastrous open-border migrant policies. He is the epitome of an arrogant European oligarch whose naive energy and immigration policies weaken and divide Europe’s great powers. When Vance said, “The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,” Heusgen was the type of leader the vice president was talking about. After detailing how the governments of Romania, Sweden, Britain, Scotland, and even the United States suppress speech they disagree with, Vance warned, “What no democracy, American, German, or European, will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered.” Unfortunately, Vance’s message is needed here at home as much as across the Atlantic Ocean. On Face the Nation this Sunday, host Margaret Brennan attacked Vance’s defense of free speech, claiming, “he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.” It is difficult to imagine a more ignorant statement or one that better elucidates the threat that the cadres of such people as Brennan and Heusgen pose to democracy across the Western world. The Weimar Republic did not have free speech. While Article 118 of the German constitution of 1919 forbade censorship, Article 48 of the same document empowered the state to “temporarily suspend” freedom of speech and other “basic rights,” whenever “public order and security are seriously disturbed or threatened.” Weimar Germany routinely shut down newspapers, forbade certain people from speaking, and arrested those they deemed a threat. Not a single Jew was killed during World War II by words. They were murdered by physical violence inflicted by a tyrannical regime that, like today’s German government, frequently prosecuted citizens for expressing disfavored opinions. Government suppression of speech is inconsistent with democratic values except in very limited wartime circumstances and is especially antidemocratic when the suppressed speech relates to issues of political, ideological, philosophical, religious, or cultural importance, such as when life begins or who and how many people should be let into a political community and from where. The Heusgens and Brennans are still not ready to listen to people who say things they don’t like. They arrogantly assume they know best. So expect more tears.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-18T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3321826/europe-cannot-handle-truth-free-speech/
The complicated story of Iron Mountain,"BOYERS, Pennsylvania — People around here are used to the trucks that deliver paperwork to the old Pennsylvania limestone mine. Here, over 700 locals work as employees of the Office of Personnel Management processing the retirement papers of federal government workers. Everyone around here knows of its existence. In fact, a lot of people around here either work there or have a family member who works there. Once upon a time, the mines and quarries around Boyers were filled with limestone and coal, which powered and built the country, like hundreds of places across Pennsylvania. Work in those mines provided families with a decent wage and a reason to stay rooted in the region. In the 1950s, as these mines emptied of their natural resources, local elected officials across the state, and across the country for that matter, looked for ways to utilize them so that people wouldn’t lose their jobs and have to relocate. In 1951, during the early, fear-driven days of the Cold War, the city council in Scranton, Pennsylvania, proposed using former mines to construct underground parking lots. The argument was that they could serve as bomb shelters in the event of an enemy atomic attack. In 1960, the Cleveland Plain Dealer detailed the use of a worked-out limestone mine in Western Pennsylvania that National City Bank used as a bank storage vault. It was constructed as part of a detailed plan to ensure the continuity of their banking operation in the event of a catastrophe, including a nuclear attack. That bank became one of the few financial institutions in the United States to obtain underground bomb-proof storage facilities. They were to use the same mine located in Butler County, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh. At that time, the mine was operated by the National Storage Company , which already had other similar clients. Many of them were major, blue-ribbon industrial corporations in the Pittsburgh area and other sections of the eastern U.S. Today, that former limestone mine is Iron Mountain, which merged with the longtime owner of the National Storage Company or National Underground in 1998 . The facility is located right off of state route 308 in Boyers, a Butler County village located 20 miles from the Butler Farm Show Complex where President Donald Trump was shot on July 13, 2024. The Butler Farm Show Complex is the same place where Elon Musk took the stage with Trump for the first time to voice his support for the president. On Tuesday, Musk, the owner of X and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, brought attention to the facility during an appearance with Trump in the Oval Office. His comments implied that this mine might need examining. “All that retirement paperwork is manual on paper,” Musk said in a rare public appearance in his role as an adviser to the president. “It’s manually calculated. They’re written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down a mine and, like, what do you mean a mine? Like, yeah, there’s a limestone mine where we store all the retirement paperwork.” Musk is not the first person to beg that question. Both the Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama administrations questioned the efficiency and lack of automation in processing thousands of case files, moving them from cavern to cavern, one line at a time. As one local, who asked for their name not to be used because half of their family works at the mine, noted, “Back in the ’50s, the concern was nuclear attack. Today, the concern is cyberattack. It is all about the protection and preservation of these documents.” Some consider the place an oddity. And of course, there is the always-entertaining speculation that a bunker for the president has been located deep within it since the Cold War — a speculation without evidence. There are locals who also say there are ghosts within the massive series of vaults and mines, which is common local lore. When Musk posted on X about the existence of a mine full of paperwork, the social media platform lit up in reaction. Its existence around here is as commonly known, the same as who makes the best pizza in the area. The jobs they hold at the facility do more than just provide an income — they also keep generations of families intact who are deeply rooted in the area. That, in turn, provides a tax base for the school district and the local townships, keeping the rural region thriving. “There are 700 jobs here, around 300 of them are OPM, but the rest are government contract jobs that revolve around OPM, with the overwhelming majority of those jobs held by citizens of small towns in Butler County,” the longtime resident said. “If this place is nixed and 70% of the jobs are gone, it will devastate both northern Butler County and southern Butler County,” he said. “We have no comparable jobs.” For those who are hoping this will pull Trump supporters away from him because of the mention of the mine, there is no evidence of that yet. “I think Mr. Musk is misinformed because the workers tell me they don’t just deal in manila envelopes. A lot of their work is digitalized, no question,” he said, adding, “I think the job of DOGE is to be skeptical about everything, and in the end, they will find that this facility isn’t a place of excess.” Trump won Butler County by a whopping 65 percentage points. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), of Butler County, who has toured the mine several times, said he, too, believes this will all work out in the end. “Once there is more nuance and context provided as to what exactly is done here and why it is done the way it is done,” Kelly said in an interview with the Washington Examiner . “The space is utilized not just for its size, but the process is also for safety and security,” Kelly said. “During the Cold War, it was considered safe from external attacks. Now, during the digital age, it keeps important government documents safe and preserved if there was a cyberattack.” Kelly said he understands that the move now is to do everything online. “Everything has to be digitalized. Everything has to be done quickly. All I’m saying is, you know what? There’s a reason why things have a long lifespan in something like the mine. That is a very safe storage space for these documents.” On Tuesday, Musk bluntly admitted he would get things wrong from time to time. “Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected, so nobody can bat 1.000,” he said, promising to swiftly correct errors, with the same going for the Department of Government Efficiency. “We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we’ll also fix the mistakes very quickly,” Musk said. Kelly says the root of what Musk is doing is good, old-fashioned getting to the root of what is the federal bloated bureaucracy. “That is not what is happening at Iron Mountain, but you don’t know that until you ask,” Kelly said. The limestone excavated here was owned and used by U.S. Steel from 1902 to 1952. It was used in the then-booming steel mills located all around Pittsburgh. When it regained new life as a storage facility in the late 1950s, the stone walls of the Boyers mine were painted silver and the floor was blacktopped with wide corridors as armored trucks drove through the miles of underground roadway to each individual vault. The Times-Tribune wrote in 1960 that the mine was entirely air-conditioned and had electric heaters, humidity-controlled equipment, and generators for producing power. They also wrote that it contained escape hatches and alternate entrances and exits, but their locations were kept secret. The Center for Land Use Interpretation , a research and education organization, recently reported that Iron Mountain expanded its data center, known as WPA-1, inside the mine.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T22:59:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318785/complicated-story-iron-mountain/
Is Disney back to putting families over politics?,"One of the hopes from the 2024 elections is that major corporations such as Disney would reevaluate to whom they are trying to appeal. It appears that the House of Mouse is finally starting that self-reflection. In the aftermath of the election, Disney has changed course on some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The changes are modest, but they include reorienting performance factors for executive compensation away from diversity and inclusion and toward values that promote business success. Disney is also taking off the condescending trigger warnings from the beginning of classic films such as Peter Pan and Dumbo , instead exiling them to the details sections of those films. Disney is also reportedly reevaluating the costs at its Disney parks, with the percentage of people planning return trips to Disney parks dropping. In Anaheim, California, the cheapest tickets start at $104 per day for just one of the two parks, Disneyland or Disney California Adventure, with tickets often going past $200. That is the cost for just one adult, with the total cost of tickets for the whole family, as well as food costs in the parks, making visiting Disney a one-time experience for many families. These changes show that Disney is at least looking to appeal again to the majority of normal people who aren’t obsessed with race and to families who simply want to be able to afford what Disney is offering. Even before the 2024 elections, there were signs that Disney was coming around. The company stood down from the political fight it picked with Florida Republicans, and Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted that the quality of Disney’s entertainment was declining. It is a welcome shift from the woke corporate posturing that plagued the 2010s and was amplified in 2020. Google, McDonald’s, Target, and Walmart are among the major corporations that have been reevaluating and removing their DEI policies. But none has the influence over children and families that Disney has through its entertainment offerings. For Disney to be focused on eliminating divisive DEI policies and on making itself more affordable for families is a massive step in the right direction. Disney never had to make itself a soldier in the political Left’s culture war. By exiting that culture war and focusing on appealing to families, Disney can once again be the family-friendly entertainment company it used to be remembered as, so long as it continues to stay out of the racially divisive DEI movement moving forward.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T21:38:46+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3318406/disney-families-over-politics/
Why were hopes of the 1990s dashed?,"As one who shared the hope, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, that representative government , guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections would spread across the globe, I naturally look back over the intervening long generation and ask what went wrong. In the 1990s, it seemed to many that the vision of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man would prevail. Not that bad things would never happen again. Fukuyama’s more subtle thesis was that after the debacle of communism, there was no intellectually viable alternative to some combination of political democracy and market capitalism as the means to a decent society. But the past three decades have seen the vitality of politically viable alternatives — China’s dictatorial and Russia’s authoritarian state-directed capitalism, the oppressive clerical regimes of Shiite Iran, and various Sunni Muslim states. By Freedom House’s sophisticated measures , 2004 saw a high point in global freedom, which has been in decline ever since. How to explain this trend, the opposite of what I hoped for and predicted? As I have reflected on this question, I’ve fallen back on an article I wrote in 1993 for Irving Kristol’s Public Interest , in which I identified four types of political parties. Two were based on European conflicts over religion: Religious parties favored established churches, and liberal parties favored the separation of church and state. Two others, socialist and nationalist, had their beginnings in attempts to rally the masses in the failed European revolutions of 1848, appealing to their working-class interests or their folk national yearnings. Structural features — the Electoral College, the single-member House and Senate seats — push American politics into a two-party system in which both are incentivized to amass 50% majorities in what has always been a culturally and economically diverse nation. So, America’s political parties, operating in a unique republican framework and under democratic rules that predated Europe’s, have partaken of each of these four impulses in varying degrees. In my Public Interest article, I argued that religious parties tend to fade out in nations with no majority faith, liberal parties tend to collapse as their characteristic skepticism leaves them yielding to violent opposition parties, and socialist parties tend to peter out because, at some point, socialism fails to work. Parties that endure, I argued, were, in some major respect, nationalist. American politics over the past 30 years provides some confirmation. The market-respecting liberalism of former President Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party yielded to the woke socialism of former Presidents Barack Obama’s and Joe Biden’s. The religious emphasis and market economics of the Reagan-Bush Republican Party yielded to the demotic nationalism of President Donald Trump’s. And Trump won, despite lawfare persecution, a significant and possibly enduring victory over the Democrats’ woke socialism last November. My conclusion in 1993 and, tentatively, now is that nationalism is the glue that holds parties and nations together. The republican nationalism of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the democratic nationalism of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and the nationalism of the two Roosevelt presidents, who remain vivid figures 116 and 80 years after leaving office. The problem we have encountered over the last 30 years is that other countries’ nationalisms are not like America’s. It turns out that neither the leaders nor the masses in Muslim nations have much interest in electoral democracy, market capitalism, or the rule of law. It turns out that the leaders of Western Europe, traumatized by the horrifying wars of the first half of the 20th century, seek a transnational harmony that overrules nations’ democratic electorates and smothers market capitalism with regulations. In reaction, Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, as the formerly (under Tony Blair) liberal Labour Party split into socialist and Scottish National parties and the long-dominant Conservatives into high-education Conservatives and the Trumpish Reform UK party. In the 1990s, there was reason to hope that Russia was moving toward democracy and that China, despite the Tiananmen Square massacre, would move away from repression and toward convergence with rules-based market economies. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed power from the flailing Boris Yeltsin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping jailed one rival and abolished his predecessors’ term limits. Putin has been in power for 25 years, almost as long as Joseph Stalin’s 29, while Xi has been in power for 13 years, about half as long as Mao Zedong’s 27. Putin has been following a nationalist policy that dates back not only to Stalin but also to the czars, expanding Russia’s power outward from Muscovy in every direction — though not as far in Ukraine as he hoped and expected. Xi evidently sees China as its emperors did for 2,000 years, as the greatest nation in the world, unfortunately recovering from a hundred years of humiliation by Western powers and Japan. Something similar has been happening in Mexico. Economic integration with Mexico and replacement of its one-party authoritarian rule by democratic rotation in office and the rule of law was the goal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, pushed in the 1990s by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who grew up on a ranch facing the Lower Rio Grande. NAFTA was ratified, the economies converged, and, as I witnessed, the opposition party ended 71 years of PRI party rule in July 2000. But Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected in 2018, has reinstalled one-party rule and government control of the economy, and his handpicked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected with 61% of the vote. AMLO, as Obrador is universally known, managed to reach accommodations with Trump, and Sheinbaum has as well. But Mexico remains culturally distant, with uncertain property rights and opaque governance despite its geographic proximity. One lesson seems to be that national character matters and that it is more a product of deep-seated history than of recent American policy initiatives. It pops up even when you don’t expect it and can’t be transformed by paper guarantees. Another lesson is that America, with its unique Constitution, fashioned in 1787, revised in 1865-70 and, arguably, again in 1937-41, is indeed exceptional — and that American exceptionalism is a wine that does not travel. A third lesson is that the hopes of the 1990s were not totally dashed. Eighty-five years ago, in 1940, a time when some current leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), were living, Adolf Hitler and Stalin were allies in command of or with their allies holding most of the landmass of Eurasia, opposed actively only by Great Britain, whose air force and navy were stretched to the limit. Representative government, guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections are much better off today than they were then, thanks in large part to the leadership at the time of the British nationalist Winston Churchill, the American nationalist Franklin Roosevelt, and the French nationalist Charles de Gaulle — something to keep in mind as we bewail our current discontents.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T19:43:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318333/why-were-hopes-1990s-dashed/
The many problems with Trump’s Gaza plan,"President Donald Trump is standing firm on his plan to relocate “permanently” more than 2.1 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip to neighboring countries. Trump said the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop the territory to serve as prized real estate on the Mediterranean Sea. Trump told Fox News’s Bret Baier that those living in Gaza would not be allowed to return. Some commentators say the president should not be taken literally. They argue that Trump is attempting to secure greater regional efforts to support Gaza’s postwar development. That by dangling a deeply unpopular idea of displacing the Palestinians out of Gaza, America’s Middle Eastern partners will have to offer better alternatives. What these arguments fail to recognize, however, is that Trump’s rhetoric complicates rather than encourages greater regional support for efforts to stabilize Gaza and secure Israel. As a primary case in point, Saudi Arabia has already made clear that the potential for a peace agreement with Israel is being greatly undermined by Trump’s proposal. And while it’s true that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has other priorities than the plight of the Palestinians, his supplication to a forcible relocation is a nonstarter. It would fundamentally undermine the crown prince’s key priority of establishing himself and Saudi Arabia as the rising global power of modern Islamic leadership. Similarly, while Jordan is heavily reliant on U.S. aid, King Abdullah II would risk imploding his rule were he to tolerate Trump’s Gaza ownership plan. This would be a disaster for the U.S. both in terms of what might follow Abdullah’s government and what its loss would mean for Washington. The Jordanian GID intelligence service is regarded by U.S. intelligence officers as the most reliable of all Middle Eastern intelligence partners in its service of U.S. security interests. The General Intelligence Department is viewed as more reliable even than the Israeli Mossad, which works to a distinctly Israeli agenda on Middle Eastern issues. This is not a peripheral concern. Alongside the Saudi intelligence services, the GID was instrumental in infiltrating the Islamic State during the heydays of the terrorist group’s 2013-2017 caliphate. This infiltration cost the lives of many GID officers and agents but helped prevent numerous mass casualty attacks in Europe and against American targets. Allies like Jordan are hard earned and deserve American efforts to maintain their stability. This is especially important, bearing in mind the deep Arab affinity for personal honor and trust. Trump’s Gaza plan serves the opposite interest. Trump’s plan is impractical on paper and would cause great damage to U.S. and allied interests in practice. But Trump’s very articulation of his idea is already causing damage to U.S. interests. Even if their regimes are autocratic in nature, the Saudis/Sunni Arab monarchies, Jordanians, and Egyptians now face escalating domestic populist pressures against their alliances with America. Trump is seen to be pushing a nakedly imperialist effort not simply to sidestep Palestinian aspirations but to crush them. Worse, Trump’s “America will own Gaza” and “Palestinians won’t ever be able to return to Gaza” rhetoric is a near pitch-perfect replication of exactly that which jihadist propagandists have long accused American policy in the Middle East of pursuing. Osama bin Laden, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei might have diverging ideologies and interests. Still, all of them have had great success in mobilizing young Muslim men to their otherwise perverse causes by falsely portraying the U.S. as an evil empire that is determined to dominate Muslim peoples. The crux of their arguments has been supposed American support for Israeli efforts to subjugate the Palestinians. It is for this reason that the overwhelming majority of U.S. counterterrorism specialists strongly oppose Trump’s Gaza rhetoric. While some supporters of the president wish to portray these critics as delusional left-wing activists, their number includes a large number of Joint Special Operations Command and CIA counterterrorism officers who made their careers finding and killing Islamic terrorists without remorse. Put simply, the serious voices opposing Trump’s Gaza plan cannot be characterized as Code Pink morons. Regardless, there’s another glaring problem with Trump’s proposal: Even if the U.S. were able to persuade allies to host Palestinians from Gaza, many Palestinians in Gaza would refuse to leave. A large number of Palestinians would likely even take up arms to defend their homes. Their number would include a great many not affiliated with terrorist organizations. This bears note in light of Trump’s incomprehensible argument that the U.S. military would not be required to secure Gaza. The natural implication is thus either that the Israel Defense Forces will forcibly clear Gaza for the U.S. or that Palestinians in Gaza will suddenly somehow collectively decide they want to leave. Neither possibility is credible. The military costs of forcible relocation of Palestinians in Gaza would be very heavy for Israel, entailing street-to-street fighting and clashes with mixed groups of terrorists, armed civilians, and unarmed civilians. The diplomatic impact on Israel would be catastrophic. The moral impact would also be highly problematic for the Israeli psyche. After all, the forcible relocation of an ethnic group from its home would stir traumatic memories of the Jewish people’s darkest days. That leaves the U.S. military option. Would Trump support such an action so utterly at odds with American moral authority and strategic interests? Doesn’t Trump insist he wants to avoid “stupid wars” rather than start them? The heavy weight of evidence against Trump’s plan leads its supporters to make somewhat outlandish claims in support of it. Trump’s first-term ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, claims that Palestinians want to leave Gaza but then implicitly recognizes that many may not want to do so. He then excuses this not-so-insignificant truth by declaring that “from a moral perspective, they have forfeited the right to the land which they have destroyed.” Friedman justifies this argument by pointing out that Palestinians in Gaza elected Hamas in 2006. And while this is true, Hamas has long wielded power through coercion, violence, and bribery. Opposing Hamas in Gaza is a recipe for death. In turn, a vote for Hamas does not justify the forced relocation of 2.1 million people from their homes. Indeed, I would argue that the collective punishment of ethnic cleansing is antithetical to Israeli and American moral values. What I suspect really motivates much of the Israeli-American support on the Right for Trump’s plan is how it would affect the future of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy — namely, by extinguishing even the longer-term prospect of a two-state solution, which led to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has further fueled the optimism of the anti-diplomacy movement by suggesting that he might soon recognize full Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, much of which includes Palestinian settlements. But in contrast to the anti-diplomatic movement, I would argue that it is in the U.S. national interest to maintain political space for a two-state solution, which carries with it hardened guardrails against future terrorism against Israel. Yes, Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, atrocity and the ensuing Israeli military response means that there is no reasonable prospect of a two-state solution being reached in the short term. But to eradicate even the future possibility of a Palestinian state would be fuel to the jihadist fire. Again, it cannot be emphasized enough how much this conflict serves as a nuts-and-bolts terrorist recruitment tool for young Muslim men. In the same way, only a Palestinian state that provides a sense of dignity alongside opportunities for prosperity will be able to divert young Palestinians and other Muslims away from terrorism. Other moral considerations notwithstanding, that concern is reason enough for why former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and first-term Donald Trump all attempted to pursue a two-state solution. Trump’s greatest moral impulse is his desire to secure historic peace agreements that break decades, if not centuries, of cycles of war. But the president’s plan to dislocate Palestinians from their home is both immoral and impractical. And it would cause grievous harm to U.S. interests.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T18:58:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3318161/many-problems-trump-gaza-plan/
Trump’s order on transgender procedures is a win for religious liberty,"At every turn, young people are told that if they want to change their God-given gender, they can do so with a snap of their fingers and with sweeping permission from our nation’s highest leaders. But it does not take policy expertise or a medical degree to know that sterilization and puberty-blocking drugs are not authentic medical care. Fortunately, President Donald Trump issued an executive order putting a stop to child mutilation and the confusion that has taken hold of countless hospitals, including private Catholic hospitals once committed to respecting the dignity of every person. His effort should be applauded as an important first step toward protecting young people. FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT Trump’s executive order is unapologetic. Going forward, it reads, the U.S. government “will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.” It outlines what children and young teenagers frequently experience after attempting to surgically change their physical characteristics. They eventually realize, for example , that “they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding” or soon discover that they are “trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.” It is a great tragedy of our time that so many young people are being told that these harmful procedures will make their lives better. Trump’s executive order begins to undo countless actions taken by the Biden administration to force-feed reasonable Americans the notion that sex-change surgery is the compassionate way to “treat” people questioning their gender, when the very opposite is true. Trump explicitly calls on HHS to end the Biden administration’s harmful redefinition and application of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Intent on imposing a destructive gender ideology on the American people, the Biden administration in 2024 amended rules pertaining to Section 1557 to force people of faith to fund abortion and transgender surgeries through their health insurance plans. Section 1557 reinterpreted the definition of “on the basis of sex” to include “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy.” Revising the act delivered a forceful blow to American Christians, who make up nearly 70 % of the U.S. population, not to mention countless others who disagree with this redefinition. But Biden’s HHS went a step further. In a blatant attack on religious liberty, the administration required religious doctors and other medical professionals to perform gender-transition procedures no matter their own personal beliefs about doing so, while denying them the opportunity to opt out even for religious reasons. The policy from the Biden HHS department forced Catholic hospitals into a difficult choice: either comply with the order or shut down and cut off entire communities from healthcare. As a direct result of the Biden administration’s policies, far too many children have been put through the physical and mental agony caused by gender ideology in places where it should never exist. Nearly 150 Catholic hospitals across the country have given vulnerable children hormone therapy or performed gender-transition surgeries between 2019 and 2023. Out of more than 520 minors who received treatments in these Catholic hospitals, “more than 150 had surgeries to alter their appearances to resemble the opposite sex, while more than 380 children were given puberty blockers or hormone therapies,” according to a recent study from Do No Harm, an organization devoted to keeping politics out of medicine. Catholic hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers have no business engaging in any of these activities, which run counter not only to good medicine but the teachings of their faith, too. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has affirmed that transgender interventions are opposed to Catholic moral teaching and voted to move forward with updating its guidance for Catholic healthcare institutions, insisting that these institutions must not perform any such interventions. Thanks to the president’s executive order, it is my hope that soon families will once again have access to life-affirming care, free from harmful political agendas that damage or destroy patients’ health and well-being. For now, Trump’s executive order will help Catholic medical institutions — and many others — adhere to the highest standards of authentic medicine as well as Catholic social and moral teachings. Faithful Americans must continue to reject the dangerous, life-altering, and irreversible experiments on children that are happening across our nation in the very institutions that should be protecting them. Let us join hands in setting a high standard of care for every patient that affirms their inherent dignity and worth.

Journalists discover the Constitution,"New talking points have gone out, and left-wing journalists and pundits have agreed that claiming the nation is in some sort of “ constitutional crisis ” is the soundest strategy to aid their beloved Democrats in their time of need. You could be forgiven if you believed members of the corporate press are just now discovering the Constitution , considering that they display profound ignorance of the nation’s founding documents at any available opportunity. But the shift in language from “Republicans are Hitler” to “save the founders’ legacy” is likely more malicious than it is mindless. People like the Constitution and the natural rights it safeguards. Journalists understand this, and they are likely hoping their audiences forget the press has led the charge to destroy constitutionality, namely the First and Second amendments, for decades. Unfortunately for the media, the “ crisis ” that keeps them up at night, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and its mission to rid the federal government of waste, fraud, and abuse, is also quite popular with the public. The Left’s commitment to perverse ideologies has forced it to defend extremely unpopular positions since losing the 2024 election. As Musk and crew uncover one instance after another of reckless, wasteful misuse of tax dollars, Democrats and journalists find themselves defending positions wildly out of step with the vast majority of people. After the Federal Emergency Management Agency neglected the victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, it was caught red-handed funneling $59 million to New York City to fund luxury hotels for illegal aliens, according to Musk. To date, DOGE has saved taxpayers almost $38 billion, canceling wasteful contracts such as funding for an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the National Institutes of Health museum. (Perhaps the entire NIH museum could be on the chopping block next?) DEI programs have been eliminated across the federal government, and the nefarious, propagandistic work of the U.S. Agency for International Development is being clawed back. The people are just fine with those developments. Adding to the shamelessness of the press’s decision to declare that opposition to the Left is a constitutional crisis is the fact that these same journalists ignored a plethora of wildly unconstitutional acts by the Biden regime. Former President Joe Biden’s repeated attempts to undermine the Constitution via his illegal vote-buying student loan forgiveness scheme were praised by the corporate press, as was his decision to raid the home of his political opponent. Journalists covered up the former president’s senility at every turn until, of course, they couldn’t , and I struggle to think of a constitutional crisis greater than the leader of the free world revealed to be nothing more than a puppet for special interests and his own hard-left, ideology-obsessed staff. Aside from pardoning murderers, terrorists, and almost every member of his family, Biden’s focus in the waning days and hours of his presidency was to attempt to tweet an amendment to the Constitution into existence. Tell me more about the constitutional order, journalists. Congress last declared war in 1942 against Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and despite never declaring war since WWII, the U.S. has fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq (twice), and Afghanistan and has involved itself in civil wars and conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Lebanon, Libya, South Sudan, the Congo, Niger, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Grenada, just to name a few. The Patriot Act allowed unprecedented illegal spying on citizens, and as former President Barack Obama admitted , “We tortured some folks.” However, real crises like these leave journalists with the resting heart rate of an Olympic triathlete. Spare me if I don’t buy the press’s outrage over Musk and the gang’s attempt to get the nation’s fiscal house in order.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s pro-union stance makes her a poor choice for labor secretary,"There are only two pathways to greater economic growth: more people working or individuals producing more (or both). The new administration has proposed policies to grow the economy and increase U.S. manufacturing . It wants to get more people working and fewer watching by reducing the number of government employees so bureaucrats can enter the productive economy. It plans to leave minimum wage laws up to the states due to regional differences, so unskilled workers, especially teenagers, aren’t excluded from the labor pool, giving them a chance to gain valuable experience that will allow them to become more productive and command higher wages. More importantly, productivity must increase, something that big labor fights . We no longer pick corn by hand, the Bessemer converter allowed us to replace brittle cast iron with low-cost steel, and computers allow bookkeeping without physical books. In order to create an environment where companies can further innovate, the administration intends to reduce government regulations . Companies will be able to focus on technology and process improvements instead of filling out government forms. What doesn’t jibe with the administration’s policies is former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination for labor secretary. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, considers her nomination significant because Chavez-DeRemer supports “pro-union” policies such as the ProAct, which would replace secret ballots with a card check , making it easier for union bosses to harass people who don’t want to join a union, and eliminating right-to-work laws that prevent forced union membership. Being pro-union is not the same as being pro-worker. In fact, it is the opposite, which is why union membership has recently hit a record low. Growing up in the Mon Valley of Pittsburgh, I witnessed firsthand the destruction of many of the factories that, during WWII, were part of the arsenal of democracy. There are many factors responsible for the downfall of the U.S. steel industry, but unions resisting innovation are part of it. That is one reason U.S. Steel desperately needs investment today. Yet, although Nippon Steel wants to invest over $1 billion in Pittsburgh steel plants, the union says no — despite many rank-and-file steelworkers wanting it. Today , the longshor emen threaten to shut down the economy if automation is installed at U.S. ports, which are already the least productive in the industrialized world. What’s more, we cannot simply hide behind tariffs. If we cannot compete with the world, we will simply fall behind and become economically backwards. President Donald Trump wants to invigorate the economy and revitalize world-class manufacturing in the U.S., but Chavez-DeRemer’s pro-union stances may not be a good fit. Phillip S.

Democrats against democracy,"Democrats are anything but democratic. In the past, their idea of governance was overreach and abuse of power carried through unelected bureaucrats, intimidation attempts by radicalized mobs disguised as protesters, and a weaponized judicial system, especially rogue judges, to impose their will on the public. As a famous quote often attributed to Mark Twain goes, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Once again, the Democratic Party, when thwarted at the ballot box, has turned to judges to impose its will on the public. As many as 10 federal judges have recently ruled against President Donald Trump ‘s proposed budget cuts, spending freezes, transgender policies, and push to end birthright citizenship , as well as access to data by Trump-appointed auditors trying to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. This usurpation of the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government by the judicial branch, ideologically aligned with Democrats, should be considered dangerous, regardless of one’s political affiliation. It is an abuse of authority that the Founding Fathers recognized as a threat to the republic. Ironically, it was Elbridge Gerry — after whom the word “gerrymandering” was created and who was a Massachusetts delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 — who warned about judicial imposition. He voiced his concern about the “sophistry of the judges.” Authors of the Federalist Papers echoed similar sentiments in their writings. The ideas and words of those from the 18th century are applicable in 2025. For example, in Federalist 78 , Alexander Hamilton cautioned that judges might exercise their will instead of their judgment in interpreting laws. He also stressed the importance of judges remaining impartial, noting that the “independent spirit in the judges” was paramount to “a faithful performance of so arduous a duty.” Furthermore, consider Federalist 81 , in which Hamilton discussed the fears and concerns over judicial activism. Hamilton warned that if judges prioritized passion and politics over the law and construed it, then this would enable the judiciary to develop its own rules. “The power of construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will enable that court to mold them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body,” Hamilton argued . Hamilton’s words proved prescient. Activist courts have become more frequent as judges at the state and federal levels expropriate power assigned to the other two branches of government. Federal judges attempted to usurp executive branch authority in terrorist detainee cases during the Bush administration. They did so again during the first Trump administration when judges opposed Trump’s lawful orders to restrict people coming to the United States from nations where terrorists are active. In each case, judges interceded in nonjusticiable affairs, as was predicted in Federalist 78. Yet, this abuse can be traced back even further. One egregious example was during the last years of the Reagan administration. For example, in 1987, District Judge Russell Clark, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, ordered a 150% increase in property taxes and a 1.5% income tax to fund a desegregation plan for schools in Kansas City, Missouri. Clark decreed that Missouri was to pay the balance. Since when did the Constitution authorize a judge to order a tax increase? In other instances, judges have overreached their authority in the criminal justice system, issuing rulings related to incarcerated prisoners. For example, in some cities, such activist judges ordered criminals to be released from confinement for no reason other than jails and prisons were, in their opinion, “overcrowded.” Still, other judges have reversed referenda. Judge Thelton Henderson issued an injunction against California’s Proposition 209, which was aimed at dismantling state affirmative-action programs based on sex or race. Californians voted on Proposition 209 in 1996. However, Henderson, also a Carter appointee, thought his opinions were superior to those of the electorate. A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel subsequently overturned Henderson’s ruling. In his majority opinion, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain wrote, “A system which permits one judge to block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted to enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.” O’Scannlain’s sentiments exemplify how the judicial branch should work. He provided an honest and intelligent explanation to which all judges should adhere. Unfortunately, they don’t. If the country allows rogue, activist judges to continue their abuse of power and judicial overreach without any accountability, then we will no longer be a constitutional republic but instead a judiciocracy. It would behoove people of all political parties and ideologies to reject such advances. Moreover, people all along the ideological continuum must remember that the government is “of the people, by the people, for the people” — and not ruled by judges.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T15:24:37+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317675/democrats-activist-judges-against-democracy/
Fort Bragg’s latest name change is pure political appeasement,"The Pentagon has announced it is once again changing the name of one of its largest military bases, Fort Liberty, back to its original name, Fort Bragg, but with a twist. Instead of bearing the name of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, the home of the 82nd Airborne Division and U.S. Army Special Operations Command will now honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper who earned the Silver Star for his bravery during the Battle of the Bulge. Let’s be clear: There should never have been a military base named after Braxton Bragg in the first place. Beyond his role as a commander in an armed rebellion against the U.S. government, Bragg is widely regarded as one of the worst generals of the Civil War. His poor leadership and strategic failures were legendary even among his own troops. For this reason alone, the original decision to rename Fort Bragg was commendable. However, in typical fashion, the Biden administration chose the uninspired and overly generic “Fort Liberty,” a safe, watered-down option seemingly designed to appease a segment of the Left that finds offense in just about everything. Now, by rebranding Fort Bragg to honor a little-known WWII soldier, the Trump administration can claim to be restoring history erased by the Left’s insatiable appetite for faux outrage — all while sidestepping the awkwardness of celebrating a Confederate general who was both a notorious slave owner and an incompetent military leader. Yet, in doing so, it has fallen into the same trap of opting for political appeasement rather than seizing the opportunity to honor a genuinely deserving American hero: General James M. Gavin. As the highly decorated third commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II, Gavin was more than just a leader; he was a visionary and a soldier’s general. Nicknamed the “Jumping General,” Gavin personally participated in combat jumps alongside his troops in Sicily, in Italy, and during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. His leadership style exemplified courage, strategic brilliance, and an unwavering dedication to his men. At just 37 years old, he became the youngest divisional commander in the U.S. Army, leading the 82nd Airborne Division with unparalleled effectiveness. Gavin’s actions directly contributed to the success of key military campaigns during WWII, and his innovative thinking shaped airborne operations for decades to come. Gavin’s contributions extended far beyond WWII. In 1947, he incorporated the all-black 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion into the 82nd Airborne, making it the first integrated division in the U.S. Army. He also played a crucial role in shaping post-war military strategy, becoming one of the first senior officials to advocate a more agile and mobile fighting force. Gavin’s forward-thinking approach to logistics and rapid deployment, particularly using helicopters, was instrumental in developing the modern air cavalry. The renaming of Fort Liberty to Fort Gavin would not only have paid homage to his exemplary military service but also served as a reminder of the kind of leadership and moral clarity that should define America’s armed forces. Instead, the Pentagon chose to rename it Fort Roland L. Bragg, a name that has little connection to the installation’s rich history but conveniently aligns with an illusion of attempting to restore the past. Before becoming secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth declared, regarding the initial renaming to Fort Liberty, “We should change it back because legacy matters.” Yet, when given the opportunity to correct past mistakes, Hegseth failed to honor the man who best embodied the institution’s legacy and ethos. The 82nd Airborne Division has prided itself on its legacy of excellence, resilience, and innovation. Naming the base after Gavin would have been the perfect way to honor those principles. Unfortunately, by disregarding Gavin’s legacy, the current administration missed the chance to connect Fort Bragg’s new identity to the soldiers who made it legendary. General James M. Gavin was the embodiment of airborne excellence, a leader who defined the very institution Fort Bragg has housed for decades. By failing to recognize his contributions, the current administration has once again squandered an opportunity to tie the past, present, and future of one of the military’s most iconic bases to a leader who truly represented its values.

Trump must stop the UK’s dangerous surrender of the Chagos Islands,"Most Americans may not be familiar with the Chagos Islands, but they play a crucial role in U.S. national security . This remote Indian Ocean archipelago, which includes Diego Garcia, hosts one of the most strategically important American military bases in the world. The base has been a linchpin of U.S. military operations for decades, providing logistical support for missions in the Middle East , countering China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific, and serving as a critical hub for intelligence and surveillance. Despite its strategic significance, the United Kingdom, under the leadership of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is preparing to hand over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This decision is not based on security concerns or practical governance but on a misguided sense of legalism and postcolonial revisionism. The U.K. is willing to cede control despite the islands having little historical or cultural connection to Mauritius, which lies 1,400 miles away. Under the proposed deal, Britain would cede sovereignty while paying Mauritius 9 billion pounds over 99 years to lease back Diego Garcia, the key U.S. naval base in the region. The negotiations are being led by Starmer’s attorney general, Lord Richard Hermer, who has previously stated that “almost every element” of the British Empire was racist and has actively advocated reparations to be paid to those who were “victims” of the empire. This latest arrangement from Hermer is not only an unprecedented act of strategic self-sabotage by the U.K. but also a direct threat to U.S. interests in the region. Now back in office, President Donald Trump must urgently intervene to prevent this reckless handover, a move that would deal a devastating blow to U.S. national security and ultimately play into the hands of China. China has a well-documented track record of leveraging debt and infrastructure projects to entrench its influence across the developing world. From Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port to military installations in Djibouti, Beijing has perfected the art of turning economic partnerships into strategic footholds. Once Mauritius takes control of the Chagos Islands, it is only a matter of time before China offers lucrative investment deals in exchange for naval access. Given Mauritius’s economic dependence on China, resistance to such overtures would be difficult. For Washington, the consequences of a Chinese presence in Diego Garcia would be catastrophic. The island has been crucial to America’s power projection in the Indo-Pacific and serves as a counterweight to China’s growing military assertiveness. Allowing China to establish even a minimal footprint in the Chagos archipelago would dramatically shift the balance of power in the region and weaken U.S. deterrence. Trump must make it clear to the U.K. that this deal is unacceptable. The U.S. should leverage its diplomatic and economic influence to halt the transfer, emphasizing that British participation in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and other key defense agreements depends on London’s commitment to shared security interests. If necessary, Washington must also be prepared to negotiate a direct long-term lease with Mauritius, ensuring ironclad restrictions on any Chinese involvement. This is not a matter of decolonization or historical redress. It is a matter of strategic survival. The Chagos Islands are too important to be sacrificed on the altar of postcolonial revisionism. If Starmer’s government insists on this folly, Trump must step in and put an end to it before it is too late.

Shein and Temu must be restricted over slave labor,"The Chinese companies Shein and Temu have become wildly popular for their dirt-cheap clothes and gadgets. Hidden behind the trendy bargains, however, rests an ugly truth: these companies are profiting from slave labor. Mounting evidence ties their supply chains to forced labor by Uyghur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region. This isn’t a minor allegation; it’s part of what many countries recognize as an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people. President Donald Trump’s administration is reportedly weighing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security’s forced labor blacklist. As the Trump administration works to decouple the United States from reliance on Chinese goods, leveraging existing authority to prevent Shein and Temu from skirting U.S. law should be a priority. Kicking out forced-labor profiteers would protect our values and strengthen our resilience against a hostile foreign power. In 2021, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) to ensure that American commercial activity is not supporting forced labor. The UFLPA created a rebuttable presumption that any goods connected to Xinjiang are tainted by forced labor and barred from import unless proven otherwise. This law embodies a basic moral principle: no product of slave labor should reach American homes and businesses. Unfortunately, that principle is undermined every day when Americans purchase products from Shein and Temu. The allegations against Shein and Temu are not mere speculation. A 2022 report by Bloomberg used laboratory testing to confirm that Shein’s products contained cotton sourced from Xinjiang, the epicenter of China’s state-run forced labor program. While Shein claims it does not source from Xinjiang, the opacity of its supply chain raises serious concerns about its credibility. Similarly, Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is also complicit in the use of forced Uyghur labor. Temu’s rapid expansion into the U.S. market has come with almost no transparency about its sourcing practices. Unlike Amazon or Walmart, which have regulatory and compliance mechanisms in place to audit suppliers, Temu operates as a marketplace that allows Chinese manufacturers—many of whom may rely on Xinjiang supply chains—to sell directly to American consumers with little scrutiny. Banning Shein and Temu is not just a moral necessity; it is an economic imperative. The presence of these companies in the U.S. market undercuts American businesses that adhere to ethical labor practices. Such rock-bottom prices are subsidized by forced labor, lack of supply chain transparency, and regulatory arbitrage. This creates an unfair playing field for American retailers and manufacturers and exposes consumers to harmful products. By formally designating these companies as complicit in forced labor in Xinjiang, their imports could be blocked outright unless they prove no ties to slave labor — a high bar given the evidence. From a strategic perspective, allowing companies with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to dominate the U.S. e-commerce space poses national security risks. A 2023 report from the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the CCP identified Shein’s “aggressive data collection” on American consumers, similar to the concerns raised about TikTok. Given the CCP’s extensive history of using technology companies for intelligence gathering, continued access to U.S. consumers poses a direct risk. This move would be a significant escalation in holding China accountable and protecting U.S. consumers. It’s also a logical next step in Trump’s broader trade crackdown. Placing Shein and Temu on the UFLPA-covered list would send an unambiguous message: the United States will not be a dumping ground for goods made with slave labor. This approach offers a targeted solution that protects human rights without harming legitimate trade. By banishing Shein and Temu from our market, Trump would be standing up for the millions who cannot speak out, from Uyghur laborers to U.S. workers who deserve better than competing with slave labor.

Texas leads in securing the border,"In its coverage of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s recent trip to the White House, Fox News acknowledged the shift on display. Where the Biden administration threw open our borders, and fought Texas’s attempts to enforce the law, the Trump administration is embracing Abbott’s actions. Abbott’s deputizing the Texas National Guard to help the Border Patrol is just the next logical step. “It would be hard to find another governor who has done more to support, and help implement and endorse, Trump’s hardline border security and immigration agenda,” Fox News reported .” Texas, under Abbott’s leadership,” the article continued, “has spent billions of dollars on border security the past couple of years under Operation Lone Star. And this week, Abbott, in an unprecedented move, gave Texas National Guard soldiers the power to arrest undocumented immigrants in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.” Of course, Abbott’s decision to deputize the National Guard has come under fire from the party of open borders. “It’s likely to lead to harassment and racial profiling of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in South Texas and the border region,” claimed Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro . But here’s the reality: The Biden administration’s efforts to undermine the rule of law have left the Border Patrol undermanned and underfunded. Abbott’s actions are lawful—troops have been used at the border for decades. “Military forces have been on the border continuously since the establishment of JTF-6 in 1989 to help combat drug smuggling,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies explains . “The levels have varied depending on the perceived level of need, the availability of forces, and the politics of immigration but continued in both Republican and Democratic administrations.” What happens next? Some Democratic-run states and cities say they’ll remain “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants, including violent criminals. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy even claims he is thinking about housing an illegal immigrant in his garage apartment. As he put it, “good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her.” Not everyone is so recalcitrant. Out in Nevada, Attorney General Aaron Ford, a gubernatorial hopeful, once sponsored legislation to make Nevada a sanctuary state. Now he supports enforcing the law. “Keeping our communities safe is not a controversial statement,” Ford told the Las Vegas Review-Journal . “It is my job, and I intend to do that, and I support policies that do that.” Ford, a Democrat, knows he must change his tune on the border. Not only did President Trump win Nevada by three points, the state now has more registered Republicans than Democrats . What other sanctuary states and cities are missing is that this moment represents a great political sea-change. Trump was very clear about what he was running on, and securing the border was at the top of his list. Voters went for it. Sanctuary states and cities also can’t afford the illegal immigration crisis brought about by the Biden administration. Indeed, while President Joe Biden was in office, New York, Chicago, and Denver were all pleading for federal funds to help them pay for their own irresponsible policies. Gov. Abbott has set an example to follow. He has shown how states can come alongside and assist the federal government in enforcing the law. Many states such as Florida, Tennessee, and South Dakota have already sent their own National Guard troops to support Texas. It’s time for the others to step up.

Trump is right on birthright citizenship,"At the heart of the legal debate over President Donald Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause. While there are numerous practical hurdles to eliminating birthright citizenship as it’s been practiced, the president is on solid legal footing. The clause (“All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”) should not be interpreted as conferring automatic citizenship to children born of illegal immigrants . Setting aside constitutional interpretation, that just seems like common sense. But not everyone sees it this way, hence the controversy. According to two federal judges who have issued injunctions since the order was issued, the language of the clause should be read at its broadest, which would grant citizenship to any person born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S., regardless of the status of the parents. Proponents of this interpretation point to the Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) in which the court held that a child born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S. to temporary Chinese immigrants was a citizen. But the problems with this interpretation are manifold. For one, it misinterprets the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to apply to children born to foreign nationals who are not under full and exclusive allegiance to the U.S. Those who are born in the U.S. to parents who are here on business or vacation should also be denied citizenship on these grounds. While in America, they are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. but only in a limited and ephemeral sense. They could not, for example, be drafted into the military. Once they leave, they are not subject to U.S. laws, which is not the case with Americans. There are various ways in which illegal immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the same way citizens are. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson offered the following scenario: An infant is brought to the U.S. legally, is lawfully naturalized, and serves in the military but cannot run for president — but the child of a foreign tourist born in the U.S. can? The framers of the clause included it to ensure that citizenship would be conferred to the children of slaves who were brought here against their will. It is ludicrous to suggest that people who have traveled here of their own accord and entered the country unlawfully should be granted the same privilege. There are numerous practical hurdles that come with ending birthright citizenship that lawmakers will need to attend to should the Supreme Court eventually decide in Trump’s favor. Some have raised questions about the moral complexities of the move, suggesting that ending birthright citizenship could create an underclass of “stateless” children and result in family separations. It would also worsen the bureaucratic nightmare of our national recordkeeping systems. Lawmakers should do everything possible to mitigate these unintended consequences. But that doesn’t absolve the nation of the responsibility to enact sane immigration policy based on sound legal arguments. Trump’s executive order achieves this, and so it is to be hoped that the courts find this compatible with the Constitution.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T05:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3317408/trump-right-on-birthright-citizenship/
The Super Bowl rings in the return of Americana,"“Today we celebrate the urgency of now, the thrill of what’s next, the glory of this game , and we do it as one.” That sentiment is courtesy of Brad Pitt in a soaring prerecorded video on Fox right before the Super Bowl on Sunday night. Only rivaled by Thanksgiving and Christmas , there is no singular event that comes even close to bringing so many of us together — and on a night many of us have to work the next day, no less. A record-breaking 126 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch the Philadelphia Eagles pummel the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22. And while the game itself wasn’t memorable, outside of the Chiefs finally and deliciously being dethroned, the overall tone and mood of unbridled patriotism was. As a prime example, the Pitt video might as well have been a Trump ad, complete with clips of cowboys riding horseback carrying American flags, firefighters battling wildfires, U.S. Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima, etc. The message: American greatness only works when we huddle up and work together. Forget patriotism. This was downright jingoistic. Donald Trump himself also became the first president to attend the Super Bowl out of the 59 that have been played. It is unbelievable that not one, from Ronald Reagan to the Bushes to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, all sports fans, had attended, considering that it is such an easy political win to just show up. There’s nothing but upside to doing so. As you may have heard, Trump received a roaring reception from the crowd when shown on jumbo screens during a tremendous national anthem by Jon Batiste. Contrast that with former Vice President Kamala Harris attending a Los Angeles Lakers game earlier in the week, where the installed 2024 Democratic nominee was barely acknowledged by the fans in her home state. And in what was the ultimate irony, while Trump was applauded in New Orleans, the once-untouchable Taylor Swift was roundly booed moments later. The president, of course, could not let that fact pass without weighing in. “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump trolled on Truth Social. “She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!” The culture shift compared to Trump’s first term is nothing short of extraordinary. After his first victory in 2016, Trump voters largely kept their support on mute, especially in the workplace, all out of fear of being ostracized or seeing career prospects going sideways. This time around, the Trump dance is openly being celebrated by everyone from NFL players to LPGA golfers. Corporations, one by one, have been doing away with DEI programs. Hostages are being released by Hamas, a reaction to Trump’s threat of “all hell breaking out” if they continue to stall. Violent gangs of illegal immigrants are being shipped back to their home countries or Guantanamo Bay. And the NCAA announced recently that it would no longer allow biological men to compete against biological women following Trump’s executive order that banned transgender athletes from female competition. The optimism felt during the Super Bowl is reflected in polls that have been exceptional for Trump, especially considering that most of the legacy media has continued its onslaught of unhinged negative coverage of him and his policies, which, after nearly 10 years since announcing his first presidential run, has become beyond tedious and predictable. CBS News has Trump’s approval at 53%, easily his highest ever while occupying the Oval Office. But the crosstabs tell an even rosier story. For example, when voters were asked if Trump was keeping his campaign promises, 70% said yes. What that tells us is that not only are Republicans happy with the president’s dizzying first three weeks of action, but independents and some Democrats are as well. Other highlights: Six-in-10 people support mass deportations for more than just criminals in the country illegally. Nearly two-thirds, 64%, support sending U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. And here are the four top words that voters would use to describe Trump most: 69% say tough, 63% say energetic — ya think? — 60% say focused, and 58% say effective. This is the Arctic polar opposite of the way former President Joe Biden was described. Voters thought he was old, outdated, elderly, aging, senile, demented, slow, confused, idiotic, ignorant, sleepy, gaffe-prone, and bumbling. Trump’s approval among black and Latino voters also blows away anything we’ve seen from a Republican president in the modern era, with 33% of blacks and 49% of Latinos approving of his performance. If these levels are maintained or even increased, it’s hard to see how Democrats can win any presidential elections moving forward. This is especially true if MAGA-approved JD Vance is the nominee four years from now. Young voters are also giving Trump a big thumbs up, with 55% under 30 approving. This voting bloc, like Latinos and blacks, is supposed to be owned by the Democratic Party. But in another poll from CBS News last month, a whopping 67% of adults aged 18-29 said they are optimistic about Trump’s second term, easily the highest of any age group. And while the president is riding relatively high, Democrats are melting down before our eyes. The confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet nominees were largely a display of cheesy performance art. Their behavior may have driven Republicans on the fence about confirming the more controversial candidates into Trump’s corner. And then there were stunts such as the one led by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) at the Education Department, where the 86-year-old led other House Democratss to attempt to enter the building but were denied by an unarmed security guard with cameras rolling. “What’s your name?” Waters demanded. “Tell us your name. Give me that ID again.” “I’m not giving you the ID,” the guard replied without emotion. “I showed it to you.” “Say what?” Waters asked incredulously. “I showed you the ID,” he replied. “Could you let me see the ID again?” she pressed. “No,” he replied. “Huh?” a flummoxed Waters responded. “No,” he reiterated. And that was it, basically. “The Democrats have lost their minds, and they’ve lost their confidence,” Trump told Senate Republicans at Mar-a-Lago afterward. “They looked foolish today. They tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go in and check the books.” As for other opportunities in his second term to play the patriotism card, check out this Triple Crown: The country will celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2026. The U.S. will also host the World Cup the same year. And in 2028, the Olympics return to Los Angeles. Much like attending the Super Bowl, Trump will be front and center for these events while the world looks on. “I’m going to be here for the Olympics and the World Cup,” Trump mused earlier this month. “God works in mysterious ways.” Fixing the economy after Bidenomics crippled it is a top priority, no question. As is fixing the border, improving our horrible test scores in education, drastically cutting government waste, and ending the Russia-Ukraine war. But winning the culture war is also important. It plays to voters’ emotions in a way policy cannot. Over the next four years, Trump has an opportunity to be seen as a beacon of optimism and an embracer of all things Americana. All in contrast to his opponents, who haven’t offered an inspiring vision for America in a long, long time.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T01:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3316988/super-bowl-rings-in-return-americana/
The war on plastic straws highlights Democrats’ shoddy ‘science’,"President Donald Trump ‘s executive order ending the federal government’s push to transition to paper straws is a good reminder that environmentally-obsessed Democrats regularly botch “The Science.” This is especially true when it comes to their climate policies. Trump’s executive order naturally earned a response from climate groups such as Oceana, whose “plastics campaign director” warned that “the world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.” Plastic straws, we were told, are a massive environmental threat. That’s why multiple Democratic states and cities have banned or restricted them. However, the idea to ban plastic straws stemmed from a study that found that Americans use 500 million plastic straws per day. That “study,” though, was an estimate from a 9-year-old child. It became gospel truth around 2018 among liberal media outlets, politicians in California and Hawaii, and environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club. In reality, however, the United States is hardly a global player when it comes to plastic pollution. The U.S. is responsible for less than 1% of global mismanaged plastic waste, with plastic straws making up a fraction of that share. China, in comparison, is responsible for more than 20% of global mismanaged plastic waste. Meanwhile, on the straw question specifically, a real study from Belgium found that paper straws have a higher concentration of “forever chemicals” than the plastic straws they are replacing. This is how it so often goes for Democrats trying to “save the planet” with their heavy-handed restrictions. Bans on single-use plastics, including plastic bags, led to New Jersey residents tripling their plastic consumption and using reusable grocery bags that are worse for the environment. California’s fast-approaching ban on gas-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles has several drawbacks for the environment, as does the state’s insistence on banning nuclear energy as part of its carbon-free energy grid. The Democratic Party’s junk science on environmental matters makes the environment worse and life more inconvenient for people. Nothing shows that better than the bizarre panic over plastic straws. It is a statistically insignificant portion of global plastic pollution that rose to prominence based on a “study” from a third grader, which managed to make it all the way to the desk of the president.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T23:05:24+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317019/war-plastic-straws-highlights-democrats-shoddy-science/
A beloved Pennsylvanian returns home from a Russian prison,"BUTLER, Pennsylvania — “He’s coming home, he’s coming home.” Those were the words of Malphine Fogel, the mother of Marc Fogel, a western Pennsylvania teacher who was arrested in Russia in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in a hard labor camp in 2022. He was imprisoned there until Tuesday, when President Donald Trump ‘s administration secured his release. Sean Parnell, a western Pennsylvania native who was recently named assistant secretary of defense by Trump, recalled being with Malphine Fogel when she met with the president ahead of his July 13 rally in her family’s hometown of Butler. He promised her at the end of the meeting, “We will get your son back.” After earning Trump’s promise, Parnell said Malphine Fogel exited the meeting and joined the crowd dancing to Kid Rock’s “American Badass, “which was pretty awesome to see a 90-year-old woman do.” Mike Kelly, the Butler County Republican congressman who has been a constant in trying to secure Marc Fogel’s release, marveled at his mother’s optimism after her meeting with Trump. “Malphine was given the gift of hope and purpose that day, and she held on to it,” said Kelly, who has known the Fogel family for decades. Kelly praised the Pennsylvania delegation for working together for the family and the upper chamber of the Senate, which in June passed a bipartisan resolution calling for Marc Fogel’s release. Since he graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Marc Fogel has spent his career teaching the children of American diplomats around the world in places such as Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Venezuela, and Russia. He was sentenced in 2022 after he was arrested on charges of possessing medical marijuana, which was prescribed by a doctor in the United States for back pain. After missing so much time with his sons, Marc Fogel’s mother filed a lawsuit against then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken last June, saying he failed to designate her son as “wrongfully detained.” That designation finally came in the waning days of the Biden administration on Dec. 26, 2024, when it was moved to the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs within the State Department. Sen. David McCormick (R-PA), who has hosted Malphine Fogel at his home and even sat beside her at the July 13 rally in Butler, said, like the rest of the delegation, Marc Fogel’s release has been a top priority. “It was one of the questions I asked Marco Rubio when he was seeking confirmation as secretary of state and something we have discussed since then,” he said. U.S. Envoy for Hostages Ambassador Adam Boehler posted a photo on X of Marc Fogel in a grey sweatshirt, holding a plate of fruit and cheese, his passport, and what everyone hoped was a stiff drink in his glass. Sen. John Fetterman (PA), a Braddock Democrat, said on X, “Marc Fogel’s return home is long overdue and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family will be welcoming him back.” Twenty-two days after being sworn in, Trump kept the promise he made to Malphine Fogel. McCormick said, “Isn’t that something.” Kelly added, “After everything that happened that day, he never forgot. It is providential.”",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:56:20+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317377/beloved-pennsylvanian-returns-home-russian-prison/
Trump can make this a global golden age for religious liberty,"The United States is a beacon for religious freedom . That’s a regrettably rare thing around the world. Pew Research’s 2022 Report on Government Restrictions on Religion showed that restrictions in 198 countries and territories peaked in 2022. President Donald Trump’s second term thus presents a unique opportunity to cement his legacy in championing global religious freedom. “You shouldn’t have to leave your faith at the door of your people’s government, and under President Trump’s leadership, you won’t have to,” Vice President JD Vance said during the International Religious Freedom Summit last week in Washington. Protection of religious freedom was a core tenet of Trump’s first-term foreign policy. In his remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019, he reaffirmed that “religious freedom is a fundamental right”. His efforts received bipartisan support in Congress. The first Trump administration built on the foundation set by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and launched a series of unprecedented initiatives to support persecuted religious minorities, advocate religious freedom in international forums, and maintain a strong stance against religious persecution in countries such as China and Iran. In 2018, for example, the State Department established the International Religious Freedom Ministerial and held the historic and first Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. The event was followed by ministerial meetings held in 2019, 2020, and 2022. These were designed to bring together religious leaders, advocates, and government officials from around the world to discuss and promote religious freedom. They served to elevate the importance of religious freedom on the global stage and reinforce U.S. leadership in defending this fundamental human right. Congress also acted. One of the most prominent bipartisan legislative actions was the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in 2020. This act aimed to address China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, including forced labor, surveillance, and mass detentions. The legislation introduced sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses. Also in 2020, the Falun Gong Protection Act was introduced in Congress to highlight concerns over China’s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The bill had bipartisan backing, with lawmakers advocating action over the Chinese government’s human rights violations. In addition, several U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have expressed support for Shen Yun Performing Arts. Shen Yun is not just an arts group tied to the Falun Gong. According to its leaders, it is also a living artistic expression of a spiritual and cultural heritage that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to eradicate. Other examples abound. The Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act was bipartisan and passed with wide support in 2018. It aimed to hold the Iranian government accountable for human rights abuses, including the persecution of the Baha’i community, religious minorities, and others. In 2019, Congress passed the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, which aimed to strengthen U.S. efforts to prevent genocide and other atrocities. The law had broad bipartisan support and was particularly focused on protecting religious and ethnic minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, Sunni minority groups, Shia minority groups, Alawites, Bahai’s, and Jews in areas including Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Building on these remarkable achievements, the new Trump administration could continue to advance global religious freedom and take further steps in supporting religious minorities around the world. The political change in Syria, for instance, requires the U.S. to ensure that minority faith groups — Alawites, Christians, Shiites, and others — finally enjoy religious freedom. In addition, the Trump administration should redouble efforts to protect Christians in North Korea, other religious minorities in Iran, and Christians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, or Buddhists in China. A comprehensive strategy to combat religious persecution and defend religious freedom abroad, ensuring that U.S. foreign aid, diplomacy, and other international efforts prioritize the protection of religious freedoms will advance global peace and stability, strengthen democratic principles, and counter extremism. It will also cement Trump’s legacy of global religious freedom champion.

The Biden economic hangover,"THE BIDEN ECONOMIC HANGOVER. Former President Joe Biden left a terrible legacy: the border catastrophe, chaos and disorder abroad, increased crime, oppressive wokeness. But for today’s purposes, consider the damage done by Biden’s economic policies. Inflation took away 20% of people’s purchasing power in a short period of time. Even when the rate of inflation slowed, it is still, right now, rising faster than economists — or anybody else — are comfortable with. This week there will be new numbers for inflation in January, and the message again will be that Biden brought inflation on but was unable to fully get rid of it. Now that is President Donald Trump’s job. Meanwhile, recent reports have brought word of what the New York Times called an “unusually large” downward revision in the number of jobs we thought were created in Biden’s final year, since March 2024. The bottom line is that about 600,000 fewer jobs were created in that period than we were told at the time through monthly jobs reports. “The Biden jobs market was way worse than markets thought,” Trump White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said recently. “There’s a lot of cleaning up to do.” Then there is federal spending. Biden and his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill went crazy with spending. Coming off the already-high emergency COVID spending of the final year of the first Trump administration, Biden and congressional Democrats poured trillions of dollars unnecessarily into the economy. First, Congress passed a $900 billion “COVID relief” bill just after Christmas 2020, as Trump was heading out the door. Biden, then president-elect, strongly supported it. Once Biden was in the White House, he pushed Democrats to pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March 2021. One-point-nine trillion dollars. Did the economy really need a stimulus of that size? It was pretty clear, even at the time, that it did not. A month before it was passed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote that, given the $900 billion stimulus that had already been passed, “the gap between actual and potential output [of the economy] will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed [American Rescue Plan] stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month. … That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.” Biden and the Democratic Party decided to pass the bill anyway, spending $150 billion a month to fix a $20 billion a month problem. That much money flooding the economy was going to worsen inflation. But Biden, who fantasized about being a new Franklin Delano Roosevelt, did not stop there. Later in 2021, he signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill — this one made possible in part by a minority of House and Senate Republicans who joined Democrats in supporting it. And then Biden took aim at what would be the biggest spending extravaganza ever — the proposed $2.2 trillion Build Back Better Act. It would spend on everything: climate change, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid, everything. By the time the House passed a version of the bill , in November 2021, inflation had already reached 6.8%. (It would hit 9.1% in June 2022.) Some Senate Democrats got nervous about Biden’s reckless spending and forced reductions in the Build Back Better Act. It was downsized to $750 billion, including about $370 billion for climate spending and the rest for healthcare and other expenses. Then Biden gave it a new name: the Inflation Reduction Act. With inflation raging, still going up, and millions suffering, it was an act of supreme cynicism to call a bill that would make things worse the Inflation Reduction Act. But that is what Biden and his Democratic allies did, passing the bill in August 2022. Only now are we learning the true damage the Inflation Reduction Act did. Look at this from the Cato Institute : “The Inflation Reduction Act was initially touted as a deficit-neutral bill, with its ten-year energy and climate-related provisions projected to cost about $370 billion, offset with tax increases. However, in an upcoming Cato policy analysis, Travis Fisher and Joshua Loucks estimate that the [Inflation Reduction Act] will cost between $936 billion and $1.97 trillion over the next ten years and up to $4.67 trillion by 2050 (and perhaps even more in later years because the subsidies are uncapped.)” In other words, with the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden and Democratic lawmakers created a perpetual spending machine. It’s possible some of them didn’t even know what they were doing. “If I’m being cynical, they may have been misled by advocates who knew how to game the scoring,” Cato’s Travis Fisher told me in an email exchange. “Even some policy analysts who should know better were fooled by this one.” So were millions of people, of course. And in the end, they didn’t get what their trillions of dollars were supposed to buy. In the infrastructure bill, for example, there was $42 billion that was supposed to bring high-speed internet to people in hard-to-reach areas. More than three years later, it has not connected a single person. There was also $7.5 billion to build tens of thousands of electric vehicle chargers. More than three years later, only a few dozen have been built. That makes sense; Biden and Democrats passed money faster than anyone could possibly use it, and even though they raced to shovel cash out the door in December and January, many billions remain unspent. Trump has put a freeze on Inflation Reduction Act funds, and there could be a fight over it in Congress. But none of that changes the final conclusion . Joe Biden, imagining himself to be FDR, did enormous damage to people’s standard of living. They will be suffering a Biden hangover for a long time to come.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:48:06+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3317404/biden-economic-hangover/
"If there’s a ‘constitutional crisis,’ blame Democrats","When a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from accessing Treasury Department information this week, Vice President JD Vance noted that “judges aren’t allowed to control” the president’s “legitimate power.” This, we are told by hysterics, has plunged the United States into a “constitutional crisis.” However, Vance is, of course, entirely correct that it’s illegitimate for activist judges to dictate how the executive branch governs itself. It’s certainly not a constitutional crisis for an administration to seek emergency relief from a partisan injunction. Presidents have done it on numerous occasions. And any higher court that takes the Constitution seriously will smack down these assaults on separation of power by judges, tout de suite . If none do, then we have ourselves a constitutional crisis. Then again, if the Left’s alarms were legitimate and genuine, it has zero moral authority to decry abuse after spending nearly two decades deliberately trashing the separation of power. The Democratic Party has been a walking constitutional crisis. Take the New York Times , which is leading the charge on the “constitutional crisis.” The outlet has spent years running columns championing the need to “reform” or trash our antiquated Constitution. Now, the paper is demanding courts suddenly uphold the founders’ vision of governance? Well, I assure you not one of them envisioned a federal government agency funding a “transgender comic book” in Peru or dictating the kind of straw one can use. It was only a few weeks ago that former President Joe Biden tried to post an amendment to the Constitution. Instead of mocking a failed president’s break with reality, Democratic senators and an array of left-wing groups, including the American Bar Association, praised him. The same ABA, incidentally, just wrote a scathing letter criticizing the Trump administration’s “dismantling” of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of the people who feigned horror at the president auditing departments under his purview were quite happy when former President Barack Obama ignored Congress and unilaterally bestowed millions of illegal immigrants with amnesty. Obama also ignored Congress and SCOTUS on immigration law, and then repeatedly ignored the courts on his signature law, Obamacare, as well as on recess appointments. “When Congress won’t act, this president will,” one of his aides famously bragged. It was Obama-era Democrats who normalized the modern imperial presidency. And today, many voters, seem convinced that a nonexistent “popular vote” empowers presidents with nonexistent ”mandates” to rule as a king. Thanks, Obama. Remember when Harvard constitutional law professor Mark Tushnet offered the faux legal rationalization for the Biden administration to ignore the “MAGA court” and implement “popular constitutionalism?” Does Trump also have a license to do anything he pleases because he won the “popular vote?” Democrats now contend an activist district court judge should be able to micromanage the White House’s hiring decisions. Only recently, though, they were pushing Biden to ignore the Supreme Court and “forgive” billions of dollars in existing loans by decree. He did. “The Supreme Court blocked it, but that didn’t stop me,” Biden bragged . Not one Democrat, as far as I can tell, decried this flagrant circumvention of separation of powers. Then again, the Left has spent the better part of two decades destroying the legitimacy of the “unelected” Supreme Court, the only institution in American life that is more or less still functioning properly. It began with Obama’s unprecedented public disparagement of the court for upholding the First Amendment in Citizens United . Soon, the Left was engaged in a concerted big-dollar “dark-money” effort not to only smear justices but to convince a large swath of constituents that the institution was a threat to “democracy.” (They say it like it’s a bad thing.) By 2024, the mainstream Left had embraced the authoritarian idea of court packing. What happened to the campaign to add justices, by the way? What happened to the Democrats’ efforts to “reform” the filibuster? I guess we’ll have to wait until the next time a Democrat wins the White House to hear about how the procedure is a relic of Jim Crow. Because the Left’s newfound respect of separation of powers is also a matter over consequentialism, not constitutionalism. It was only a few years ago that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, now extraordinarily alarmed about the constitutionality of DOGE, was imploring Biden to take emergency powers over climate change and hand the entire economy over to an unelected administrative state. So, spare us your fake indignation. For decades, the threat of mutually assured political destruction led both parties to guard governing norms to some extent. Once the Left had control of the administrative state, it believed no matter what norm it broke, federal agencies would continue the mission, even if Republican presidents won. Today we’re supposed to be horrified that Elon Musk wasn’t elected directly by the people. There is virtually no aspect of life that unelected heads of the administrative state agencies haven’t tried to control over the past few years. Your cars. Your stoves. Your school bathrooms. And that’s really why Democrats are so freaked about USAID being audited and scaled back. Their power is vested in these institutions. Now, even if you believe that USAID — or whatever agency is next in line — does some good work, as I do, there’s little doubt it was also a slush fund for parasitic non-governmental organizations that spread progressive social science quackery. If all this activity was above board and supported by voters and Congress — and democratic — the place wouldn’t be run with the secrecy of the CIA. There’s nothing unconstitutional about the president firing executive branch employees who serve at his pleasure, creating more transparency, or cutting spending that isn’t explicitly authorized by Congress. And, in fact, presidents have promised to do as much for decades and failed. Though, Republicans should remember that any countermarch through the institutions will only stick long-term if Congress passes laws that limit the power or shut down agencies such as USAID or the Department of Education — and hopefully others. MAGA likes to point out that USAID was created by an executive order, which is true. However, Congress has passed numerous bills since funding the agency. The Department of Education wasn’t created by Jimmy Carter, as people often contend, but by a law signed by the president. It should be undone the same way, or the next Democrat administration will quickly reactivate the leviathan. As for Democrats, it’s the easiest thing imaginable to stand up against executive abuses (real or imagined) when you’re out of power. No one believes you. And if there’s a genuine constitutional crisis in the next few years, you will deserve plenty of the blame.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T21:32:13+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3315442/constitutional-crisis-blame-democrats/
The dumbest immigration policy in the world,"Vice President JD Vance told the truth with characteristic bluntness recently when he said, “Just because we were founded by immigrants doesn’t mean that 240 years later, we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world.” He was speaking on CBS’s Sunday talk show Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan about birthright citizenship and President Donald Trump’s order that federal agencies cease issuing citizenship papers to children of illegal immigrants or other foreigners temporarily in the United States. The issue of birthright citizenship is not clear cut and will doubtless go to the Supreme Court for a clarifying decision. There is a strong case for birthright citizenship but also a strong one against it . As Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson argued in the Wall Street Journal , granting birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants contains a constitutional absurdity; because only born citizens may run for president, it would mean the highest office was open to children of illegal immigrants but blocked to children brought here legally, naturalized, and raised in America, who might even have served in the U.S. military. How can it make sense that such citizens are treated as subordinate, with fewer rights than children born to foreign women with no connection to America other than that they arrived nine months pregnant, broke the law to cross the border, and gave birth? The legal controversy over birthright citizenship is based on interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was adopted to entrench the abolition of slavery and ensure that former slaves were always in future recognized as American citizens with all the rights and protections that this status confers on others. But proponents of birthright citizenship often tellingly argue less over the precise and debatable meaning of the 14th Amendment and more on the vaguer, more emotional, less legalistic ground that, as Brennan said, “this is a country founded by immigrants.” It was this statement that Vance was answering when he talked of the dumbest immigration policy in the world. The fact that Americans all descend from immigrants is cited by the Left’s open borders crowd as a sort of talisman with the magical power to make all complexities and reasonable questions on the subject disappear in a puff of self-righteousness. Noting that we are a nation of immigrants is deployed like the accusation of racism to silence anyone who suggests there is room for debate. It is this simplistic sentiment that inspires, if that is not too flattering a word, a limitless number of dreary cartoons depicting the Statue of Liberty altered and unfeelingly denying entry to the world’s poor. The cartoonists intend these to deliver an acid rebuke to those who believe immigration is a nuanced issue and that current citizens should have a say in limiting the flow of foreigners into the country. Those who argue for the dumbest immigration policy want the acceptable limit of polite conversation to exclude suggestions that some immigrants are less desirable than others. They often remind you that during the great immigration surge early in the 20th century, xenophobes said arrivals from southern Europe were undesirable. The implication and often the explicit accusation is that it is racist today to regard mass immigration from the Muslim nations of Africa and the Middle East, for example, as unwelcome and ripe for restriction. Such arguments are coupled to the assertion that the U.S. is not a blood and soil nation but a country founded on universal principles to which all people can subscribe. This does not, however, fit well into the rest of the Left’s agenda, for it also insists that people arriving from different cultures should not have to integrate or accept those universal principles — should not agree to live by America’s traditional values but should retain their own. The Left angrily rejects the old-fashioned notion that such people should be stirred into the melting pot and “become” Americans. They insist, against all the evidence, that diversity is our strength. “Diversity” here is a deceptive term that erases the huge difference between diversity of race and diversity of culture and values. There would be no problem if America’s people were only racially diverse but united by a common culture. But that is not the case. The Left encourages immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cling to their alien cultures, which are often hostile to America’s foundational ideas. The Left denigrates the host nation and its values to which the foreigners have migrated. It is often noted on the separate subject of government spending that a nation can have a generous welfare state or an open immigration policy but cannot have both together without courting financial ruin. Likewise, America can have mass immigration or unlimited cultural diversity, but it cannot have both at the same time without inviting division and national decline.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T20:45:48+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317163/dumbest-immigration-policy-in-world/
Trump runs defense for deep state with Mark Zaid clearance revocation,"President Donald Trump is heavily focused on dismantling what he regards as a so-called “deep state” of government agencies that work for their own partisan agendas. This concern is especially important when it comes to the intelligence and security agencies, where if malfeasance occurs, it undermines our democratic society. However, if Trump wants to take on the deep state, why is he taking one of its most successful challengers off the field? Namely, Mark Zaid. A longtime national security attorney based in Washington, Zaid has held a high-level Top Secret-SCI government security clearance for more than 20 years. This clearance has allowed Zaid to represent members of the intelligence community whose concerns relate to highly classified information. Trump revoked Zaid’s clearance last week. The president’s apparent motive for the revocation is Zaid’s role in representing a whistleblower who alleged that Trump improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call between the two leaders during Trump’s first term in office. If so, this is a silly rationale for revocation. Zaid is an attorney. His job is to represent clients whether or not he shares their political views. And Zaid is hardly an anti-Trump agitator. He has previously represented numerous Trump administration or aligned officials. Zaid previously worked closely with former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) in relation to the Benghazi terrorist attack investigation. John Solomon reported that Zaid was the first attorney to represent a key IRS whistleblower who alleged misconduct in the Justice Department’s investigation of Hunter Biden for tax fraud. Does that sound like the work of a deep state Democratic partisan to you? Zaid told the Washington Examiner why he believes Trump made a misjudgment here. “In reality,” he said, “this decision hurts his administration more than it does me because it will preclude my ability to represent his own people, as I did during his first administration, who face employment and security concerns, as well as defending them in investigations.” Zaid’s clearance revocation will also perversely help both Biden administration officials and Russia. Zaid represented numerous former and active intelligence officers in relation to the so-called “Havana Syndrome” or “Anomalous Health Incidents” concern. The Biden administration facilitated the intelligence community’s cover-up of Russia’s responsibility for causing many Havana Syndrome incidents. Zaid observed, “This action truly hurts my AHI clients. I was regularly bringing AHI whistleblowers to [the Congressional intelligence oversight committees] for classified interviews and giving them protection because of my clearance. That was to show the Biden administration was covering up the truth. And I was doing it pro bono.” Trump has some legitimate concerns over politicization within the deep state. However, if he wants to take on deep state malfeasance, the very worst thing he could do is remove the security clearance of lawyers such as Zaid. That path helps only those who are interested in cover-ups and setting their own agendas outside of effective oversight. After all, the government imposes strict conditions on how whistleblowers are supposed to disclose their concerns. If a whistleblower breaks these conditions, they will likely quickly find themselves facing a visit from the FBI. Even if prosecution and prison time don’t follow, suspension of a security clearance and dismissal are likely. For individuals who have spent their careers in the shadows and who have yet to put their children through college, this concern means that staying quiet about a deep state problem is often personally preferable to speaking out about it. Individuals such as Zaid are thus crucial in supporting democratic transparency by shielding those who want the truth to set Americans free. Put another way, Trump is further flooding the swamp rather than draining it with this decision. The president should reconsider.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T19:45:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3316191/trump-runs-defense-deep-state-mark-zaid-clearance-revocation/
Vance’s trip shows confidence for Gabbard and RFK Jr. confirmations,"Vice President JD Vance is in Europe this week for an AI summit in Paris and a security conference in Munich. Amid looming confirmation votes for Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this may seem like a poor time for Vance, who would be required to cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate, to travel out of the country. Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, is set for a full Senate vote Tuesday. Kennedy, Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, will undergo a Senate cloture vote as soon as Gabbard’s vote finishes. Vance has already had to rescue one of Trump’s nominees, casting the tiebreaking vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after three Republicans broke ranks. Indeed, both Gabbard’s and Kennedy’s committee votes passed along party lines, indicating close upcoming votes in the Senate. And with Vance in Europe, Gabbard and Kennedy can only afford to lose two Republican votes to ensure confirmation. Gabbard has already cleared one major hurdle on the path to confirmation, passing a Senate cloture vote 52-46 yesterday. Kennedy’s fate, however, is more of an unknown. He won over previous skeptics such as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) during his committee hearings and passed a procedural vote along party lines, suggesting future success. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted against the Hegseth confirmation and is seen as a swing vote, also said she would vote for Kennedy. Vance’s trip indicates that Trump has likely secured enough Senate votes to confirm both nominees. After the procedural votes for both candidates, there are indications that both will receive the necessary votes for confirmation. The president would be unlikely to send his VP to overseas conferences if there were any doubt in the confirmation votes. Democrats’ continued delay regarding the votes also indicates that Gabbard and Kennedy have enough support. If Vance were the key vote in the process, Democrats would likely want to push the vote through before he returns. Vance’s sudden visit to Europe may be a source of worry to some, given the weight of Gabbard’s and Kennedy’s confirmations. The trip, however, reflects an increased confidence that Trump has sufficient Senate votes to confirm both nominees by Wednesday evening.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T17:07:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3316603/jd-vance-trip-shows-confidence-tulsi-gabbard-rfk-jr-confirmation/
