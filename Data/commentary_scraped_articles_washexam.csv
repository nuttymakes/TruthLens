Why were hopes of the 1990s dashed?,"As one who shared the hope, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, that representative government , guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections would spread across the globe, I naturally look back over the intervening long generation and ask what went wrong. In the 1990s, it seemed to many that the vision of Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man would prevail. Not that bad things would never happen again. Fukuyama's more subtle thesis was that after the debacle of communism, there was no intellectually viable alternative to some combination of political democracy and market capitalism as the means to a decent society. But the past three decades have seen the vitality of politically viable alternatives -- China's dictatorial and Russia's authoritarian state-directed capitalism, the oppressive clerical regimes of Shiite Iran, and various Sunni Muslim states. By Freedom House's sophisticated measures , 2004 saw a high point in global freedom, which has been in decline ever since. How to explain this trend, the opposite of what I hoped for and predicted? As I have reflected on this question, I've fallen back on an article I wrote in 1993 for Irving Kristol's Public Interest , in which I identified four types of political parties. Two were based on European conflicts over religion: Religious parties favored established churches, and liberal parties favored the separation of church and state. Two others, socialist and nationalist, had their beginnings in attempts to rally the masses in the failed European revolutions of 1848, appealing to their working-class interests or their folk national yearnings. Structural features -- the Electoral College, the single-member House and Senate seats -- push American politics into a two-party system in which both are incentivized to amass 50% majorities in what has always been a culturally and economically diverse nation. So, America's political parties, operating in a unique republican framework and under democratic rules that predated Europe's, have partaken of each of these four impulses in varying degrees. In my Public Interest article, I argued that religious parties tend to fade out in nations with no majority faith, liberal parties tend to collapse as their characteristic skepticism leaves them yielding to violent opposition parties, and socialist parties tend to peter out because, at some point, socialism fails to work. Parties that endure, I argued, were, in some major respect, nationalist. American politics over the past 30 years provides some confirmation. The market-respecting liberalism of former President Bill Clinton's Democratic Party yielded to the woke socialism of former Presidents Barack Obama's and Joe Biden's. The religious emphasis and market economics of the Reagan-Bush Republican Party yielded to the demotic nationalism of President Donald Trump's. And Trump won, despite lawfare persecution, a significant and possibly enduring victory over the Democrats' woke socialism last November. My conclusion in 1993 and, tentatively, now is that nationalism is the glue that holds parties and nations together. The republican nationalism of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, the democratic nationalism of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and the nationalism of the two Roosevelt presidents, who remain vivid figures 116 and 80 years after leaving office. The problem we have encountered over the last 30 years is that other countries' nationalisms are not like America's. It turns out that neither the leaders nor the masses in Muslim nations have much interest in electoral democracy, market capitalism, or the rule of law. It turns out that the leaders of Western Europe, traumatized by the horrifying wars of the first half of the 20th century, seek a transnational harmony that overrules nations' democratic electorates and smothers market capitalism with regulations. In reaction, Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, as the formerly (under Tony Blair) liberal Labour Party split into socialist and Scottish National parties and the long-dominant Conservatives into high-education Conservatives and the Trumpish Reform UK party. In the 1990s, there was reason to hope that Russia was moving toward democracy and that China, despite the Tiananmen Square massacre, would move away from repression and toward convergence with rules-based market economies. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed power from the flailing Boris Yeltsin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping jailed one rival and abolished his predecessors' term limits. Putin has been in power for 25 years, almost as long as Joseph Stalin's 29, while Xi has been in power for 13 years, about half as long as Mao Zedong's 27. Putin has been following a nationalist policy that dates back not only to Stalin but also to the czars, expanding Russia's power outward from Muscovy in every direction -- though not as far in Ukraine as he hoped and expected. Xi evidently sees China as its emperors did for 2,000 years, as the greatest nation in the world, unfortunately recovering from a hundred years of humiliation by Western powers and Japan. Something similar has been happening in Mexico. Economic integration with Mexico and replacement of its one-party authoritarian rule by democratic rotation in office and the rule of law was the goal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, pushed in the 1990s by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who grew up on a ranch facing the Lower Rio Grande. NAFTA was ratified, the economies converged, and, as I witnessed, the opposition party ended 71 years of PRI party rule in July 2000. But former Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected in 2018, reinstalled one-party rule and government control of the economy, and his handpicked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected with 61% of the vote. AMLO, as Obrador is universally known, managed to reach accommodations with Trump, and Sheinbaum has as well. But Mexico remains culturally distant, with uncertain property rights and opaque governance despite its geographic proximity. One lesson seems to be that national character matters and that it is more a product of deep-seated history than of recent American policy initiatives. It pops up even when you don't expect it and can't be transformed by paper guarantees. Another lesson is that America, with its unique Constitution, fashioned in 1787 and revised in 1865-70 and, arguably, again in 1937-41, is indeed exceptional -- and that American exceptionalism is a wine that does not travel. A third lesson is that the hopes of the 1990s were not totally dashed. Eighty-five years ago, in 1940, a time when some current leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), were living, Adolf Hitler and Stalin were allies in command of or with their allies holding most of the landmass of Eurasia, opposed actively only by Great Britain, whose air force and navy were stretched to the limit. Representative government, guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections are much better off today than they were then, thanks in large part to the leadership at the time of the British nationalist Winston Churchill, the American nationalist Franklin Roosevelt, and the French nationalist Charles de Gaulle -- something to keep in mind as we bewail our current discontents.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T19:43:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318333/why-were-hopes-1990s-dashed/
Texas leads in securing the border,"In its coverage of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's recent trip to the White House, Fox News acknowledged the shift on display. Where the Biden administration threw open our borders, and fought Texas's attempts to enforce the law, the Trump administration is embracing Abbott's actions. Abbott's deputizing the Texas National Guard to help the Border Patrol is just the next logical step. ""It would be hard to find another governor who has done more to support, and help implement and endorse, Trump's hardline border security and immigration agenda,"" Fox News reported ."" Texas, under Abbott's leadership,"" the article continued, ""has spent billions of dollars on border security the past couple of years under Operation Lone Star. And this week, Abbott, in an unprecedented move, gave Texas National Guard soldiers the power to arrest undocumented immigrants in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection."" Of course, Abbott's decision to deputize the National Guard has come under fire from the party of open borders. ""It's likely to lead to harassment and racial profiling of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in South Texas and the border region,"" claimed Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro . But here's the reality: The Biden administration's efforts to undermine the rule of law have left the Border Patrol undermanned and underfunded. Abbott's actions are lawful--troops have been used at the border for decades. ""Military forces have been on the border continuously since the establishment of JTF-6 in 1989 to help combat drug smuggling,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies explains . ""The levels have varied depending on the perceived level of need, the availability of forces, and the politics of immigration but continued in both Republican and Democratic administrations."" What happens next? Some Democratic-run states and cities say they'll remain ""sanctuaries"" for illegal immigrants, including violent criminals. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy even claims he is thinking about housing an illegal immigrant in his garage apartment. As he put it, ""good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her."" Not everyone is so recalcitrant. Out in Nevada, Attorney General Aaron Ford, a gubernatorial hopeful, once sponsored legislation to make Nevada a sanctuary state. Now he supports enforcing the law. ""Keeping our communities safe is not a controversial statement,"" Ford told the Las Vegas Review-Journal . ""It is my job, and I intend to do that, and I support policies that do that."" Ford, a Democrat, knows he must change his tune on the border. Not only did President Trump win Nevada by three points, the state now has more registered Republicans than Democrats . What other sanctuary states and cities are missing is that this moment represents a great political sea-change. Trump was very clear about what he was running on, and securing the border was at the top of his list. Voters went for it. Sanctuary states and cities also can't afford the illegal immigration crisis brought about by the Biden administration. Indeed, while President Joe Biden was in office, New York, Chicago, and Denver were all pleading for federal funds to help them pay for their own irresponsible policies. Gov. Abbott has set an example to follow. He has shown how states can come alongside and assist the federal government in enforcing the law. Many states such as Florida, Tennessee, and South Dakota have already sent their own National Guard troops to support Texas. It's time for the others to step up. The Honorable Robert Henneke is the Executive Director and General Counsel at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T10:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/3316984/wed-texas-leads-in-securing-the-border/
"Elon Musk, fatherhood, and the Democratic Party","With Elon Musk 's Department of Government Efficiency dominating headlines right now, do voters care that Musk is engaged in yet another custody dispute with one of the many women he has children with? Liberal author Zaid Jilani thinks they could. ""Democrats should make an issue out of how horrible of a dad, husband, and human Elon is,"" Jilani wrote on X. ""If Republicans have abandoned family values they are up there for the taking for someone else."" But does the Democratic Party really have the credibility to make this attack? I don't think so, which is why I wrote in response to Jilani, ""This might be more effective if the Democratic Party believed fathers were necessary or even good."" Some of the responses on X were informative, some were not, and a lot of people wrote something along the lines of , ""Are you seriously suggesting Biden and Obama are worse fathers than Trump?"" which is not what I was arguing at all. Others noted that Obama did promote fatherhood, which is true. Starting with a campaign speech in June 2008, Obama made almost annual speeches on the importance of fatherhood every Father's Day. Obama then followed this up, once elected, with his Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative with five goals, including promoting and creating positive opportunities for fathers to engage in the intellectual, emotional, and financial well-being of their children; supporting and sustaining stable and healthy environments for children and parents, particularly by strengthening the economic stability of low-income fathers and supporting healthy relationships between parents; strengthening and solidifying relationships among fathers, children, and families early in a child's life; supporting and encouraging disconnected fathers to reconnect with their children and families; and promoting the identification and use of evidence-based practices, as well as fostering high-quality research on fathers and fathering to support policy and program development. These all sound nice, but there is one big word missing from this list: marriage. Indeed, if you go back and read all of Obama's fatherhood speeches, he rarely mentions marriage at all. This is because, since Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 report on the black family , the Democratic Party has been committed to denying the negative effects of the decline of marriage on children. Just look at how Democrats treat this 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on fatherly involvement with children. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) claims the study found that black fathers are ""more involved in their children's lives compared to other racial groups."" New York Times columnists Charles Blow and Kenrya Rankin Naasel make similar claims, with Blow writing that ""black fathers were the most involved with their children daily, on a number of measures, of any other group of fathers -- and in many cases, that was among fathers who didn't live with their children, as well as those who did ."" But that is not what the study found at all. Yes, black fathers who lived with their children were more likely to eat with (78%) or read to (35%) their children than white fathers who lived with their children (74% eat with and 30% read to). Black fathers who did not live with their children also ate with and read to their children more than white fathers who did not live with their children. However, fathers of all races who lived with their children were far more likely to do every activity with their children than fathers who did not live with their children. For example, just 16% of black fathers who did not live with their children played with them every day, compared to 83% of white fathers who did live with their children. As the same CDC report shows, white fathers are simply far more likely to live with their children (81%) than black fathers (58%). This is due almost entirely to the fact that white fathers are far more likely to be married to the mother of their children than black fathers are. One would hope that the Democratic Party would focus on making it easier for young men and women of all races to get and stay married, but instead, Democrats pursue the exact opposite: making it as easy as possible for women to have children without fathers. Just look at the Life of Julia slideshow to promote Obama's 2012 campaign and the Life of Linda slideshow to promote Biden's Build Back Better agenda. In both cases, voters are shown a single woman starting a family by herself with the help of Democratic Party programs. At no point is there ever a father, let alone a husband, pictured. Or take a look at where big Democratic donors such as Melinda Gates spend their money. Gates recently gave millions to help found the American Institute for Boys and Men , which may sound nice until you realize that its founder, Richard Reeves, is committed to promoting ""fatherhood"" as a social institution outside of marriage . ""There is no residency requirement for good fatherhood,"" Reeves writes. ""The relationship is what matters. Fatherhood matters just as much as ever in a world of women's economic independence, but necessarily in a reinvented form."" But this is just plain false. Studies show that the positive behavioral changes associated with fatherhood only occur in residential fathers. More importantly, marriage binds men and women into a long-term project of cooperative care that is absent outside of marriage. If fathers are not bound to the mothers of their children through marriage, what is stopping them from having multiple children with multiple women like Elon Musk does? Nothing. NO, THE AMERICAN FAMILY WAS NOT INVENTED IN THE 1950s This is exactly what is happening, and it is not just with Musk. As I write in my book Sex and the Citizen , ""Of men who father a child outside of marriage, 50 percent of them go on to have a child with another woman. Overall, about 15 percent of men and about 20 percent of women in the United States today have children with more than one partner. The United States is the world leader in this multipartner fertility statistic. No nation has more mothers with children from more than one father than us."" It would be great if we lived in a world where the Democratic Party was committed to promoting the institution of marriage and could credibly attack Musk for fathering children outside of marriage. Unfortunately, we do not live in that world.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T22:04:25+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3328663/elon-musk-fatherhood-democratic-party/
Journalists discover the Constitution,"New talking points have gone out, and left-wing journalists and pundits have agreed that claiming the nation is in some sort of "" constitutional crisis "" is the soundest strategy to aid their beloved Democrats in their time of need. You could be forgiven if you believed members of the corporate press are just now discovering the Constitution , considering that they display profound ignorance of the nation's founding documents at any available opportunity. But the shift in language from ""Republicans are Hitler"" to ""save the founders' legacy"" is likely more malicious than it is mindless. People like the Constitution and the natural rights it safeguards. Journalists understand this, and they are likely hoping their audiences forget the press has led the charge to destroy constitutionality, namely the First and Second amendments, for decades. Unfortunately for the media, the "" crisis "" that keeps them up at night, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and its mission to rid the federal government of waste, fraud, and abuse, is also quite popular with the public. The Left's commitment to perverse ideologies has forced it to defend extremely unpopular positions since losing the 2024 election. As Musk and crew uncover one instance after another of reckless, wasteful misuse of tax dollars, Democrats and journalists find themselves defending positions wildly out of step with the vast majority of people. After the Federal Emergency Management Agency neglected the victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, it was caught red-handed funneling $59 million to New York City to fund luxury hotels for illegal aliens, according to Musk. To date, DOGE has saved taxpayers almost $38 billion, canceling wasteful contracts such as funding for an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the National Institutes of Health museum. (Perhaps the entire NIH museum could be on the chopping block next?) DEI programs have been eliminated across the federal government, and the nefarious, propagandistic work of the U.S. Agency for International Development is being clawed back. The people are just fine with those developments. Adding to the shamelessness of the press's decision to declare that opposition to the Left is a constitutional crisis is the fact that these same journalists ignored a plethora of wildly unconstitutional acts by the Biden regime. Former President Joe Biden's repeated attempts to undermine the Constitution via his illegal vote-buying student loan forgiveness scheme were praised by the corporate press, as was his decision to raid the home of his political opponent. Journalists covered up the former president's senility at every turn until, of course, they couldn't , and I struggle to think of a constitutional crisis greater than the leader of the free world revealed to be nothing more than a puppet for special interests and his own hard-left, ideology-obsessed staff. Aside from pardoning murderers, terrorists, and almost every member of his family, Biden's focus in the waning days and hours of his presidency was to attempt to tweet an amendment to the Constitution into existence. Tell me more about the constitutional order, journalists. Congress last declared war in 1942 against Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and despite never declaring war since WWII, the U.S. has fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq (twice), and Afghanistan and has involved itself in civil wars and conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Lebanon, Libya, South Sudan, the Congo, Niger, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Grenada, just to name a few. The Patriot Act allowed unprecedented illegal spying on citizens, and as former President Barack Obama admitted , ""We tortured some folks."" However, real crises like these leave journalists with the resting heart rate of an Olympic triathlete. Spare me if I don't buy the press's outrage over Musk and the gang's attempt to get the nation's fiscal house in order.

The Super Bowl rings in the return of Americana,"""Today we celebrate the urgency of now, the thrill of what's next, the glory of this game , and we do it as one."" That sentiment is courtesy of Brad Pitt in a soaring prerecorded video on Fox right before the Super Bowl on Sunday night. Only rivaled by Thanksgiving and Christmas , there is no singular event that comes even close to bringing so many of us together -- and on a night many of us have to work the next day, no less. A record-breaking 126 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch the Philadelphia Eagles pummel the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22. And while the game itself wasn't memorable, outside of the Chiefs finally and deliciously being dethroned, the overall tone and mood of unbridled patriotism was. As a prime example, the Pitt video might as well have been a Trump ad, complete with clips of cowboys riding horseback carrying American flags, firefighters battling wildfires, U.S. Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima, etc. The message: American greatness only works when we huddle up and work together. Forget patriotism. This was downright jingoistic. Donald Trump himself also became the first president to attend the Super Bowl out of the 59 that have been played. It is unbelievable that not one, from Ronald Reagan to the Bushes to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, all sports fans, had attended, considering that it is such an easy political win to just show up. There's nothing but upside to doing so. As you may have heard, Trump received a roaring reception from the crowd when shown on jumbo screens during a tremendous national anthem by Jon Batiste. Contrast that with former Vice President Kamala Harris attending a Los Angeles Lakers game earlier in the week, where the installed 2024 Democratic nominee was barely acknowledged by the fans in her home state. And in what was the ultimate irony, while Trump was applauded in New Orleans, the once-untouchable Taylor Swift was roundly booed moments later. The president, of course, could not let that fact pass without weighing in. ""The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,"" Trump trolled on Truth Social. ""She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!"" The culture shift compared to Trump's first term is nothing short of extraordinary. After his first victory in 2016, Trump voters largely kept their support on mute, especially in the workplace, all out of fear of being ostracized or seeing career prospects going sideways. This time around, the Trump dance is openly being celebrated by everyone from NFL players to LPGA golfers. Corporations, one by one, have been doing away with DEI programs. Hostages are being released by Hamas, a reaction to Trump's threat of ""all hell breaking out"" if they continue to stall. Violent gangs of illegal immigrants are being shipped back to their home countries or Guantanamo Bay. And the NCAA announced recently that it would no longer allow biological men to compete against biological women following Trump's executive order that banned transgender athletes from female competition. The optimism felt during the Super Bowl is reflected in polls that have been exceptional for Trump, especially considering that most of the legacy media has continued its onslaught of unhinged negative coverage of him and his policies, which, after nearly 10 years since announcing his first presidential run, has become beyond tedious and predictable. CBS News has Trump's approval at 53%, easily his highest ever while occupying the Oval Office. But the crosstabs tell an even rosier story. For example, when voters were asked if Trump was keeping his campaign promises, 70% said yes. What that tells us is that not only are Republicans happy with the president's dizzying first three weeks of action, but independents and some Democrats are as well. Other highlights: Six-in-10 people support mass deportations for more than just criminals in the country illegally. Nearly two-thirds, 64%, support sending U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. And here are the four top words that voters would use to describe Trump most: 69% say tough, 63% say energetic -- ya think? -- 60% say focused, and 58% say effective. This is the Arctic polar opposite of the way former President Joe Biden was described. Voters thought he was old, outdated, elderly, aging, senile, demented, slow, confused, idiotic, ignorant, sleepy, gaffe-prone, and bumbling. Trump's approval among black and Latino voters also blows away anything we've seen from a Republican president in the modern era, with 33% of blacks and 49% of Latinos approving of his performance. If these levels are maintained or even increased, it's hard to see how Democrats can win any presidential elections moving forward. This is especially true if MAGA-approved JD Vance is the nominee four years from now. Young voters are also giving Trump a big thumbs up, with 55% under 30 approving. This voting bloc, like Latinos and blacks, is supposed to be owned by the Democratic Party. But in another poll from CBS News last month, a whopping 67% of adults aged 18-29 said they are optimistic about Trump's second term, easily the highest of any age group. And while the president is riding relatively high, Democrats are melting down before our eyes. The confirmation hearings for Trump's Cabinet nominees were largely a display of cheesy performance art. Their behavior may have driven Republicans on the fence about confirming the more controversial candidates into Trump's corner. And then there were stunts such as the one led by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) at the Education Department, where the 86-year-old led other House Democratss to attempt to enter the building but were denied by an unarmed security guard with cameras rolling. ""What's your name?"" Waters demanded. ""Tell us your name. Give me that ID again."" ""I'm not giving you the ID,"" the guard replied without emotion. ""I showed it to you."" ""Say what?"" Waters asked incredulously. ""I showed you the ID,"" he replied. ""Could you let me see the ID again?"" she pressed. ""No,"" he replied. ""Huh?"" a flummoxed Waters responded. ""No,"" he reiterated. And that was it, basically. ""The Democrats have lost their minds, and they've lost their confidence,"" Trump told Senate Republicans at Mar-a-Lago afterward. ""They looked foolish today. They tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go in and check the books."" As for other opportunities in his second term to play the patriotism card, check out this Triple Crown: The country will celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2026. The U.S. will also host the World Cup the same year. And in 2028, the Olympics return to Los Angeles. Much like attending the Super Bowl, Trump will be front and center for these events while the world looks on. ""I'm going to be here for the Olympics and the World Cup,"" Trump mused earlier this month. ""God works in mysterious ways."" Fixing the economy after Bidenomics crippled it is a top priority, no question. As is fixing the border, improving our horrible test scores in education, drastically cutting government waste, and ending the Russia-Ukraine war. But winning the culture war is also important. It plays to voters' emotions in a way policy cannot. Over the next four years, Trump has an opportunity to be seen as a beacon of optimism and an embracer of all things Americana. All in contrast to his opponents, who haven't offered an inspiring vision for America in a long, long time.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T01:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3316988/super-bowl-rings-in-return-americana/
"Chicago needs DOGE, not Brandon Johnson’s deferred disaster bonds","With Chicago facing a billion-dollar deficit this year and Mayor Brandon Johnson sporting a 6.6% approval rating, the Windy City has decided to quadruple down on its profligacy. By a 26-23 vote margin, the City Council approved $830 million in new borrowing through a truly bonkers bond scheme that would defer paying down interest for two years and principal for 20, after which the city would have to pay out $821 million, bringing the total cost of the plan to some $2 billion. This isn't a ""buy now, pay later"" loan -- it's buy now, pray later , as there's no way in hell that the city will ever be capable of paying back such a debt. Chicago doesn't need another Ponzi scheme that simply punts its debt problem to another decade; the city needs its own Department of Government Efficiency to start slashing spending. Chicago has spent more than $612 million on illegal immigrants in the past two years alone, with at least half a billion of that share allocated to just two companies that staff and establish migrant shanty towns. The city's overall outlays have surged 58% since before the pandemic to annual expenditures of $17 billion. More than a tenth of the increase is due to additional ""community services,"" and another quarter a product of increased pension costs. The city's plus-$51 billion pension debt is greater than that of 44 other states , with seven of its pensions cracking the nation's top 10 worst-funded pensions. Nearly half of the city's budget goes to retirement funds and servicing its already existing debt. The new bond boondoggle would compound the problem. Chicago already owes some $29 billion in outstanding bonds. The new bond program, which would compensate for failing to pay down any principal until 2045 with a more than 300% increase in principal payments after that, would pay well above a 6% effective yield over 40 years, much higher than the current 30-year Treasury yield of 4.6% or even the 40-year High Quality Market Corporate Bond yield of 5.5% to 5.9%. In other words, Chicago is offering an absurd risk premium (nearly $400 million in interest payments more than the 30-year Treasury) because it either knows it cannot pay investors back or worse, trusts that Springfield or Uncle Sam will eventually bail it out. TRUMP'S HEALTH INFLATION BLUNDER ON IVF In a microcosm of Washington, D.C.'s decadence but on steroids, Chicago doesn't have a revenue problem; it has a wasteful spending program. Its population, the city's lowest in over a century, has fallen by 4% just since 2020, yet the number of city government employees increased by a third in that time. The point of this scheme isn't to pay for supposed infrastructure investments or to reimburse lenders at all. Rather, the city government needs a cash infusion now to keep the grift going, and taxpayers, somehow, will be stuck with the bill. Already investors seem to expect that Chicago will default. Even before this vote, S&P Global downgraded Chicago's bond rating to BBB, just one tier above the lowest possible investment grade. The city government's latest gambit is so shameless and so forwardly fraudulent that it should shatter whatever veneer of plausible deniability Chicago's defenders could maintain. Lest the city's residents be able to kick the current government out, DOGE should set its sights on Chicago and try to work its way within.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T20:49:57+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3332482/chicago-needs-doge-not-brandon-johnson-deferred-disaster-bonds/
Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s pro-union stance makes her a poor choice for labor secretary,"There are only two pathways to greater economic growth: more people working or individuals producing more (or both). The new administration has proposed policies to grow the economy and increase U.S. manufacturing . It wants to get more people working and fewer watching by reducing the number of government employees so bureaucrats can enter the productive economy. It plans to leave minimum wage laws up to the states due to regional differences, so unskilled workers, especially teenagers, aren't excluded from the labor pool, giving them a chance to gain valuable experience that will allow them to become more productive and command higher wages. More importantly, productivity must increase, something that big labor fights . We no longer pick corn by hand, the Bessemer converter allowed us to replace brittle cast iron with low-cost steel, and computers allow bookkeeping without physical books. In order to create an environment where companies can further innovate, the administration intends to reduce government regulations . Companies will be able to focus on technology and process improvements instead of filling out government forms. What doesn't jibe with the administration's policies is former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer's nomination for labor secretary. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, considers her nomination significant because Chavez-DeRemer supports ""pro-union"" policies such as the Pro Act, which would replace secret ballots with a card check , making it easier for union bosses to harass people who don't want to join a union, and eliminating right-to-work laws that prevent forced union membership. Being pro-union is not the same as being pro-worker. In fact, it is the opposite, which is why union membership has recently hit a record low. Growing up in the Mon Valley of Pittsburgh, I witnessed firsthand the destruction of many of the factories that, during WWII, were part of the arsenal of democracy. There are many factors responsible for the downfall of the U.S. steel industry, but unions resisting innovation are part of it. That is one reason U.S. Steel desperately needs investment today. Yet, although Nippon Steel wants to invest over $1 billion in Pittsburgh steel plants, the union says no -- despite many rank-and-file steelworkers wanting it.

Maine disenfranchises voters to protect transgender activism,"Democrats warned that Donald Trump winning the 2024 election would be a threat to democracy. They didn't mention that the threat would be coming from them . Maine Democrats have banned a state representative from voting on bills or speaking on the floor of the state House. Maine Democrats want to extort a public apology from GOP state Rep. Laurel Libby for posting about the biological male athlete who won the high school Class B state championship in pole vault and clinched the overall girls' state championship for the school. They claim that Libby violated the ""bond of trust and respect"" between citizens and legislators by posting a picture of the transgender athlete and that Libby was ""attacking"" the athlete in the post. But Libby was attacking Maine's policies, not the athlete, for allowing a biological man to compete against and beat female athletes. Libby was simply highlighting that the obviously male athlete, who competed in boys' events just two years ago, should not be competing against girls because he is obviously a boy. For that, Maine Democrats have disenfranchised Libby's voters by preventing her from doing the job she was democratically elected to do. Maine Democrats are doing this to try to intimidate state Republicans and voters into staying silent on the issue. Maine got itself into a spat with Trump, who signed an executive order banning male athletes from women's and girls' sports, threatening to revoke federal funding for states that don't comply. Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME) promised to take Trump to court over the ban after Trump publicly called her out during a speech at the White House. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO MAINE AFTER HEATED EXCHANGE WITH GOVERNOR This is not a winning issue for Maine Democrats. A New York Times /Ipsos poll found that 79% of people oppose male athletes in women's and girls' sports, including 67% of Democrats. The Democrats who run Maine want to avoid having this debate because they know it is a debate they will lose, and so they chose to take away the representation of Libby's voters in the state House. This is the playbook for Democrats on the transgender issue, as even members of former President Joe Biden's administration showed. They know they can't win the debate, so they choose the most drastic forms of censorship they can come up with. In the process, Democrats are becoming more of a threat to democracy than anything they have warned about with Trump or any other Republican.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T19:26:58+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3331084/maine-disenfranchises-voters-protect-transgender-activism/
Trump undermines Ukraine deal by equivocating on British backstop,"President Donald Trump undermined his Ukraine peace agenda during meetings with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday. The two leaders shared warm pleasantries and suggested looming agreements on trade, tariffs, and the future status of a British territory in the Indian Ocean heavily relied upon by the U.S. military. However, there was no agreement on the most critical issue. Namely, the United Kingdom and France need Trump to assure that he will order U.S. military action in support of European troops deployed to secure a peace deal if Russia attacks them. Trump was repeatedly asked about this concern but did not respond with the declarative confirmation that America's closest ally needs. The president came closest when he made a joke about the historical skill of the British army, questioned whether the U.K. would even need a U.S. military backstop, then rather whimsically stated, ""If they need help, I'll always be with the British, OK, I'll always be with them. But they don't need help."" This might sound like enough of a backstop to the president. The problem is that those statements most certainly won't sound like anything near enough of a backstop to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin only respects deterrence and strength when they are delivered with eyeball-to-eyeball clarity. Trump misunderstands Putin, regarding him as a strong but respectful partner who seeks mutually beneficial compromise. Instead, Putin's personality, ideology, and appetite to establish a greater Russian imperium all drive him to view Trump as someone to be manipulated rather than respected. Putin may well be wrong that he can manipulate Trump, but that's how the Russian leader approaches his American counterpart. This brings us back to the peacekeepers. The U.K. and France are willing to lead a deployment of around 30,000 to 50,000 peacekeepers that would act as a ""trip wire"" to deter and delay any future Russian invasion of Ukraine in the event Trump gets a peace deal agreed. This force is the absolutely critical foundation of any successful peace deal for a simple reason. Because, whether regarding chemical weapons treaties , nuclear weapons treaties , or the Vienna conventions , Putin's word is about as reliable as swimming with saltwater crocodiles is conducive to one's health. This is not a debatable point. Putin has already breached his word concerning invading Ukraine. Under the 2014 Minsk II accords negotiated by the West's most overrated leader , former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin pledged not to invade Ukraine again. Eight years ago, he did so, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths in the worst European war since 1945. But this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the unreliability of Putin's word. Indeed, just six days before the start of Russia's Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine, Putin defended his massing of forces on Ukraine's borders as ""military exercises, drills, [which] are purely defensive and are not a threat to any other country."" Nor does Russia have any qualms about lying to America's face. Just two days before the invasion, Russia's then-ambassador to Washington told CBS News, ""There is no invasion, and there [are] no such plans."" It is no surprise, then, that Ukraine cannot and will not accept a peace deal without some kind of security guarantee such as that offered by a peacekeeping force. If America won't offer a direct guarantee, which it shouldn't, only the peacekeeping force can do so. Of course, it's for this same reason that the U.K. and other countries can't send troops to Ukraine without a U.S. backstop. They know that without American deterrent power at their back, Russia may well attack again in the future. To be clear, Trump is absolutely correct that the United States needs to refocus its military resources on the threat posed by China. However, the provision of U.S. Army brigades, Army aviation assets already in Europe, and limited fighter squadrons (some can be redeployed to the Pacific) would be sufficient to deter Russia from attacking a European peacekeeping force. Indeed, without American deterrent power as a backstop, Putin would be even more tempted to attack again in what he would perceive as the additive benefit of fundamentally breaking the trans-Atlantic alliance. And Putin would have good reason to attack again. He views Ukraine as a breakaway province that, like Chechnya, must ultimately be brought under the Kremlin's heel. Putin's military investments reflect this understanding. They are designed both to continue waging war on Ukraine and provide long-term means of threatening NATO's eastern flank. Putin is thinking about the long game. AMERICANS SHOULD BE 'A LITTLE IRRITATED' WITH EUROPE, ESPECIALLY GERMANY Ultimately, Trump will have to choose between securing a peace deal with both legs and teeth or walking away from the negotiating table because the Europeans won't walk there with him. Unless a U.S. military backstop is forthcoming and understood as such by Putin, peacekeepers won't be deployed, and Ukraine won't be able to cut a deal. If necessary, it will have to fight on without American support. Only Trump can deter Putin from restarting his bloody war, but only Trump can decide whether or not to show Putin who is the boss.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T22:37:26+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3332800/trump-undermines-ukraine-deal-equivocating-british-backstop/
Trump’s DEI slash provides people of color with an opportunity,"From Day One of his second administration, President Donald Trump made it clear that divisive diversity, equity, and inclusion policies throughout the government would be slashed. Many of the loudest voices you'll hear on TV say this approach is a threat to people of color. To be clear, DEI is not Civil Rights 2.0. It is a Trojan horse strategy, using the plight of black people to advance a socialist agenda. Ironically, when polled, black people were in favor of the Supreme Court's decision to eliminate racial preferences for college admissions. By a wide margin, they believe the federal government should incentivize two-parent families instead of single-parent homes. And lastly, black people are a demographic that widely supports school choice options due to poor-performing and violent public schools. Why the disconnect between activists for DEI in the media and the grassroots? That's because the activists are paid to advance an agenda, and the grassroots are eager to restore the black community to some form of normalcy. For years, institutions across the country have abandoned merit-based evaluations in favor of diversity-driven policies. Whether it's state bar exams, medical school admissions, or standardized testing in general, the push to lower academic and professional thresholds is being justified as a way to promote equity. But the real question is: At what cost, and is DEI a viable solution to the real problem? Black people will never reach a proportional level of professionalism in any field if we are not graduating high school students at proportional levels to their population (we are not), not to mention high school graduates who read at a sixth-grade level. Instead of addressing the root causes of educational disparities, such as poor schooling, lack of parental involvement, and K-12 teachers more focused on politics than education, institutions are taking the easy way out by simply changing the rules. We're seeing this mentality, one that we at Take Charge call the promotion of victimhood, take root in key industries around the nation. California and Delaware recently approved lowering the bar exam threshold to increase racial diversity among attorneys. In medical schools, approximately 40 institutions have either dropped or made standardized tests optional in the name of diversity. While the intent may be to diversify the legal field, it raises a critical question: Are we ensuring a competent legal workforce or merely inflating numbers for the sake of optics? Lowering admission standards in such critical fields is not just misguided. It's dangerous. Despite arguments from DEI advocates, there is clear evidence that lowering standards does, in fact, reduce overall competence. Take the discussion between commentator Don Lemon and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, in which Musk countered Lemon's claim that diversity policies do not lead to a decline in quality by pointing to data that say otherwise. Companies and institutions that prioritize DEI over merit-based hiring often struggle with efficiency and effectiveness. The data support what many people already know intuitively: When you remove objective benchmarks, performance suffers. If our goal as a nation is to ensure that more people of color succeed, the answer is not to make standards more lenient but instead to ensure that all students are equipped to meet them. The real solution lies in improving education at its foundation. Expanding access to high-quality schooling, providing choice in education, and investing in programs that provide opportunity to children in minority communities not only allow parents to choose the best learning environment for their children but also provide each child with the tools he or she needs to succeed from the start. If we take this approach, the majority of black Americans will support it. Unfortunately, these people are never interviewed by the legacy media. SUPREME COURT HEARS REVERSE DISCRIMINATION CASE WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR DEI When students have access to better schools and high expectations, they thrive. This has been proven time and again in states that have embraced school choice policies. In Florida, for example, minority students enrolled in school choice programs have consistently outperformed their peers in traditional public schools. If we change the way we view education from the traditional system that has failed black children for generations, we can see that students from all backgrounds can meet, and exceed, rigorous academic standards in the right setting. Instead of diverting resources toward DEI initiatives that lower expectations, we must show our leaders the value of investing in a new way of teaching our children, not beholden to unions more interested in politics, to set students up for long-term success. Education is the great equalizer, but only if we maintain rigorous standards and demand excellence. Equity should never come at the cost of competence. If we truly want to create a more just society, we must focus on fixing the pipeline, not weakening the final test.

US attorney for DC targets First Amendment instead of killer gangs,"While violent crime is trending down, Washington remains too dangerous. In significant part, this is the consequence of city politicians such as Brianne Nadeau and Charles Allen who play to far-left agendas that protect criminals over the interests of city residents. President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to bring law and order back to the fold. But is that really the case? We need to ask that question because Edward R. Martin Jr., Trump's pick to lead criminal prosecutions in the District of Columbia , seems determined to prioritize a war on the First Amendment instead of targeting violent criminals. Consider what the interim U.S. attorney for the district posted to X on Monday. This message references the Associated Press's lawsuit against the Trump administration over its restriction of the AP from entering the Oval Office and other areas. These restrictions follow the AP's refusal to adopt the Trump administration's preferred nomenclature of the ""Gulf of America"" in place of the ""Gulf of Mexico."" But its misplaced apostrophe notwithstanding, this message is a truly embarrassing one for a federal prosecutor to release. Indeed, the prosecutor's pledge to be ""vigilant"" in ""standing against"" a media outlet because said outlet is deemed not ""to put America first"" is prima facie un-American. The sacred principle of the First Amendment is the right of the people, media included, to speak free of undue government interference and sanction. Subjective opinion, such as the AP's choice over what to call the Gulf, receives special protection under the First Amendment. Failing to realize as much, Martin needs to go back to law school. After all, this explicit threat against a media outlet for its speech is plainly at odds with the Constitution and associated case law. It is a claim so devoid of legal merit that a first-year, first-semester law student would find it embarrassing. Sadly, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Martin's misplaced priorities. As the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression documents , Martin revels in efforts to harass people for practicing their First Amendment rights. Countering violent crime appears to be far less of a priority for Martin. Trump's appointee has already harmed that cause by firing 30 prosecutors who worked on cases related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Whatever you think of those specific prosecutions, considering that the district has a well-known shortage of prosecutors, Martin's action will only further delay the speedy trial of violent criminals and likely lead to a larger number of lenient plea bargains in order to clear court dockets. It will make city residents less safe. THE CHALLENGE AND NECESSITY OF PEACEKEEPING TROOPS FOR UKRAINE What we see here, then, is the chasm between Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric and his appointment of unqualified officials to important posts simply because of their skill in salivating at his feet. Whatever this is, it's not making Washington great again, and it's certainly not making America great again.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T22:13:39+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3328636/ed-martin-targets-first-amendment-instead-of-killer-gangs/
Trump can help prevent aviation disasters,"Last week saw the worst U.S. aviation disaster in nearly a quarter century when an Army helicopter collided in midair with an American Airlines passenger plane near Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport. None survived among the 64 passengers and crew onboard American Eagle flight 5342, nor did the helicopter's three soldiers. While investigation into the accident is ongoing, a tragedy such as Wednesday's was, sadly, a matter of time . Aviation safety has withered, reliant on outdated technology and a workforce weakened by progressive policies. Near collisions have generated concern in recent years following several high-profile incidents . From 2019-2024, almost 10,000 runway incursions were reported by the Federal Aviation Administration. It's perhaps impressive that more incidents don't occur: 45,000 flights take off on any given day, transporting over 10 million passengers annually -- that's an exponential increase from the 1970s, before deregulation made flight affordable for almost everyone. Technology to manage air traffic has not kept pace with air travel's democratization. Given astounding advancements like the internet, self-driving cars, and artificial intelligence, travelers could be forgiven for not realizing that air traffic controllers keep us safe with outdated tools that have been used since before World War II: binoculars and radar. Without modern technology, safety is contingent on humans prone to human error. And capacity to prevent, review, and learn from close calls is limited; post-incident reviews can be difficult to undertake and slow to complete. When video footage is available after the fact, it's unofficial -- typically from citizen plane spotters or passersby. Wednesday's collision was recorded by a Kennedy Center camera 4 miles from Reagan Airport, capturing only enough low-quality video to relay the already-known: Something went horribly wrong. Inadequate staffing exacerbates inadequate technology. A preliminary FAA report said that staffing at Reagan's air traffic control tower was ""not normal"" at the time of Wednesday's accident, with one controller assigned to do two jobs. Staffing problems more broadly are normal, however. A persistent shortage of air traffic controllers has contributed to several near-incursions, and FAA facilities are struggling to hire enough qualified personnel. President Donald Trump suggested that diversity, equity, and inclusion policies may have played a role in the collision. Air traffic controller shortages appear to be a factor here, so he's not far off. Shortages can be partially attributed to an older workforce -- many air traffic controllers are nearing or at retirement age -- but affirmative action-style policies have also affected the candidate pool. In 2013, the Obama administration implemented a biographical questionnaire as part of the air traffic controller hiring process in an effort to bring in more minorities. The questionnaire awarded higher points to applicants who indicated unemployment in the past three years, that science was one's lowest grade in high school, or gave other preferred responses on demographically skewed questions. Meanwhile, thousands of qualified candidates were turned away to mechanically induce a lower proportion of white staff. To be clear, air travel is still overwhelmingly safe. But challenges from dated technology and bad hiring practices make horrific incidents more likely to occur. The Trump administration can prevent future aviation disasters through straightforward, practical solutions. The newly confirmed secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy, and FAA acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau can expediently execute Trump's executive orders to rid their agencies of DEI programs and affirmative action language. Doing so will remove barriers for the best candidates to become air traffic controllers. ""One of the things we're advocating for is a total review of how the FAA hires and posts for ATCs,"" Nicholas Calio, CEO of the trade association representing major U.S. airlines, told Airlines Confidential Podcast in December. ""The system clearly isn't working."" The FAA should support this industry ask. Given the aging workforce, it's not enough to rely on staffing up alone. As DOGE rids federal agencies of wasteful spending on progressive pet issues, it could instead fund and implement innovative technologies at airports that help air traffic controllers do more with less. Better technology for safety exists: For one, a startup called Spotty Aerospace offers a network of smart cameras that can be inexpensively installed and scaled based on airport size, then used to augment human operations through greater situational awareness and predictive alerts. Popular tracking tools such as FlightAware and FlightRadar24 could also be approved by the FAA for air traffic control use as a supplement to radio communications with pilots. In 2023, air traffic controllers reported having to turn to a free version of FlightRadar24 when radio frequencies cut out at dangerous moments. The Spotty Aerospace startup was founded in Crystal City, Virginia -- where Wednesday's collision near Reagan National Airport occurred. A hopeful view in the wake of tragedy might consider that a sign: A modern approach to aviation safety is not only possible but very close. Accidents like this need not happen again. Carolyn D.

How Trump and DOGE should reform the Social Security Administration,"As President Donald Trump and his administration look to reduce wasteful government spending and improve federal government productivity, they can find low-hanging fruit at the Social Security Administration . In particular, the administration should undo Biden-era regulations that unnecessarily bloated spending on welfare and disability benefits. The president, working with the technology experts at Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, should also push for modernized information technology, including new digital features, to enhance accuracy and speed and help solve the agency's service crisis. Finally, to reduce administrative costs and better target spending to those most in need, Trump must simplify and modernize the basic regulatory rules for disability programs. The Trump administration and DOGE need to act positively and methodically within the law to serve and protect taxpayers and SSA beneficiaries. To begin with, the Trump administration should roll back the unnecessary expansion of eligibility for, and the level of, welfare disability benefits. The SSA issued these regulations, costing about $20 billion over 10 years, with no analysis of how they would help the most disadvantaged people. Another set of regulations, costing about $30 billion, says that disability claimants need to be evaluated based on only five years of work history - down from the requirement in recent rules of fifteen years. This change ignores clear research evidence showing that workers' skills from past jobs continue for at least ten years and often longer. Another set of administrative actions, costing about $10 billion, essentially forgives the collection of old overpayments made by SSA to beneficiaries. This gloss-over ignores the root cause of the problem - deficiencies in processing information on earnings, assets, and other items. The Biden administration stated that a major motivation for these changes was to reduce agency costs investigate the ability of disability claimants to work, or to see if they had other available resources of support. The aim was to help the agency at a time when it is failing to serve the public. SSA, however, is still failing to answer the phones promptly and accurately and is struggling to process changes in beneficiary status and condition. Furthermore, the agency has a massive backlog of claims for disability benefits. These changes abandoned the prudent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. By the faulty logic of the Biden administration, SSA could pay out on every disability claim made or forgive every overpayment, solving its backlog and service problems. That approach is easier than addressing the underlying sources of SSA's failures - manual processes, antiquated technologies, and programming languages that were once cutting edge in the 1960s but now are costly to maintain and difficult to integrate into more efficient technology. Indeed, there are still only a few services that the public can get from SSA entirely online, without needing to call or visit a field office. In addition to modernizing customer-facing IT, SSA needs to simplify and modernize its complex and costly disability program rules. The agency needs to use the new statistical data on occupational requirements in its program rules to adjudicate disability claims and continuing benefits. It cannot continue to rely on information last updated almost 50 years ago. Moreover, the new data must be integrated with a modern view of the labor market, less focused on physical work. In the 21st century, more and more people are employed at older ages, and new types of careers are available to more people of various educational backgrounds. Implementing these new rules through an automated tool would simplify and speed up the program administration and improve the consistency of adjudication. Compared to current vocational rules, some disability claimants would get benefits paid while others would not. The net effect would likely be a significant reduction in government spending, from a more accurate and current read of labor market realities. Other recommended changes include a simplification of the return-to-work rules for when disability benefits are cut off and making greater use of claimant attorneys to provide complete information to the agency when filing a claim for a client instead of relying on the agency to collect the required medical and vocational records. Finally, the agency should consider and publish a full analysis of whether all the many layers of appeals are needed and cost-effective for speed and fairness to claimants and to protect the taxpayer. The Trump administration has the opportunity to make policy changes and to use the DOGE in a productive and positive manner to make long overdue technology changes in how the federal government functions. Efficiency and fiscal responsibility are imperative goals - especially for SSA to protect taxpayers and best serve its beneficiaries. Mark J.

The HALT Fentanyl Act gives Americans hope,"The fentanyl crisis in America is an unnecessary story of anguish and despair, one that elicits pain and stifles hope. The story of 23-year-old college student Zach Cullen, who was preparing for life beyond college, is one of those stories of anguish. He spent four years delivering pizzas from Papa Johns and was interested in developing a technology company. Nine days after Cullen's birthday, his parents got painful news. They were informed by police that their son, the youngest of their three boys, died from fentanyl-related poisoning. Cullen's parents later testified before a House Energy and Commerce Committee roundtable demanding change. House Republicans then committed to preventing future tragedies such as Cullen's. We put pen to paper and worked on a bill to save lives and crack down on the fentanyl crisis: the HALT Fentanyl Act. In 2023, of the more than 107,000 overdose deaths in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that nearly 70% of those deaths involved a synthetic opioid, such as fentanyl. Part of the fentanyl crisis is driven by the rise in fentanyl analogs, which are fentanyl-related substances chemically altered to avoid being defined as fentanyl under the U.S. criminal code. This means the penalties for trafficking these substances are not as severe as those for traditional fentanyl. Drug cartels have even attempted to exploit this loophole to get away with trafficking the illicit substance into the country. A key component of the HALT Fentanyl Act would permanently classify fentanyl analogs as a Schedule I substance. This designation would equip our border patrol agents and law enforcement officials with the power to go after those who traffic fentanyl analogs into the country and throughout our communities. What makes this legislation even more timely is that the Schedule I designation for fentanyl analogs currently operates on a temporary basis and is set to expire at the end of next month. Failure of Congress to act soon could exacerbate the fentanyl crisis. It is important to note that this permanent designation does not prevent medical researchers from studying fentanyl analogs. The HALT Fentanyl Act would enable research into the possible medical uses of the roughly 4,800 fentanyl analogs that exist, and the bill would not impede medical providers from using fentanyl in medical practices when necessary. It's a win-win piece of legislation, and we wish it could have been law sooner. Almost two years ago, we passed the HALT Fentanyl Act out of the House. While the bill did garner bipartisan support, 132 House Democrats voted against it. In Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) Senate, Democrats refused to bring it up for a vote. This week, we are glad to see the House will be voting on the bill once again. House Republicans are ready to make our communities safer and enhance medical research to prevent future poisonings. This time around, we implore all Democrats to join us in advancing this commonsense bill. They have a chance to join us on legislation that may be one of the first things President Donald Trump signs into law. More than 100,000 overdose deaths should have been a wake-up call. Even one is too many. Every single life lost to the fentanyl crisis is more than just a statistic. We have not given up hope because families such as Cullen's should not have to experience the heartbreak of losing a child to fentanyl poisoning.

Chicago keeps electing Democrats to disastrous results,"The governing philosophy of voters in Democrat-run cities is that the liberal Democrat mayor they have is terrible, so they must replace them with another liberal Democrat. Unsurprisingly, doing the same thing over and over again hasn't produced different results. A new M3 Strategies poll puts Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson's approval rating at just under 7%. Nearly 80% of Chicago residents disapprove of Johnson's job performance, which has been defined by his pro-criminal rhetoric , a surge in illegal immigration that he invited with Chicago's sanctuary status, and his incessant race-baiting. Most recently, Johnson planned to put Chicago on the hook for $830 million in borrowed funds for a spending plan that would allow him to funnel funds to his teacher union buddies in the middle of a negotiation with Chicago Public Schools. The worst thing about Johnson's mayoral disaster is how predictable it was. Chicago tossed aside Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a liberal disaster in her own right, and turned to the even more liberal, even more race-obsessed Johnson. By February 2023, the month of the election, Lightfoot's approval sat at 27%. She didn't even make the top-two runoff, winning just under 17% of the vote. Chicago residents sat through Lightfoot's disastrous tenure full of failures born of her leftwing ideology. And then, they decided to elect someone further to the left. Lightfoot was the further left replacement of former Democratic Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who had been President Barack Obama's chief of staff. In December 2015, not even a year after his reelection, Emanuel's approval rating was at 18%. Chicago voters saw the disaster that was Emanuel's tenure and replaced him with the more left-wing Lightfoot in hopes of solving the city's problems. Are you beginning to see the pattern? CHICAGO MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON UNDER FIRE FOR ACCEPTING GIFTS 'ON BEHALF OF THE CITY' Chicago is a failing city defined by its homicides. Voters again and again go to the polls facing the failures of their Democratic leaders and elect a new set of Democratic leaders, typically ones who are even more committed to the destructive liberal ideology of the party. Chicago has been run by Democrats since 1931 and has progressively gotten worse, and yet voters are content to just slot in the next Democratic option to inevitably fail. Chicago voters have until 2027 to consider whether they want to actually change the city for the better or just want to promote another Democrat to run the same failed playbook. Chicago could shake its dismal reputation and become more livable for residents, but only if they quit choosing to run headfirst into the same wall every election cycle.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-25T20:30:28+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3329826/chicago-keeps-electing-democrats-disastrous-results/
Trump undermines America in UN prostration to Russia,"President Donald Trump rightly seeks a negotiated peace that ends Russia's war in Ukraine . Trump can secure this peace if he compels Russia to accept a European peacekeeping deployment that would preserve long-term peace. Trump is also right to demand greater support for European security from European nations . But how does it help ""Make America Great Again"" by joining a who's who of corrupt military juntas and dictatorships in order to excuse a brutal invasion of a sovereign democratic nation? That's exactly what Trump did by directing his United Nations diplomats to vote on Monday against a U.N. resolution condemning Russia for its Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. How does this assert America's keystone virtue and its status as history's greatest force for human freedom? The answer is that this action does nothing to make America great again. Instead, the United States appears delusional about standing for U.S. interests in preserving democratic peace and security around the world. It also appears utterly submissive to Russia. The U.S. didn't simply fail to join 93 countries, including every major U.S. ally except for Israel, in voting to condemn Russia. The U.S. actually voted against the resolution, preferring to sidestep the obviously preferable, if still flawed, option of abstaining. Why? Don't tell me it's because that vote was necessary to keep Russia engaged in diplomacy toward ending the war in Ukraine. That's an absurd argument. If Russia cuts a deal to secure peace, it will be because Russia views that deal either as manifestly beneficial to its interests or necessary to prevent even deeper harm to its interests. In that sense, however, this vote shows that Trump's sense of Vladimir Putin is deluded. The president evidently thinks this vote will earn him Putin's gratitude and favor, and thus his greater sincerity to negotiate in good faith. The opposite is true. Trump would understand this if he had read the history of the Ukraine war, even cursorily studied Russian and European history, or considered Putin's modus operandi and his views toward the U.S. The reality is that Putin hates the U.S. because he laments the Soviet Union's defeat in the Cold War. He hates the U.S.'s dominance of international affairs in a manner that has, until now, broadly obstructed Putin's imperialist ambitions. And Putin's ambitions in Ukraine are not about Russian security. Putin's own words prove that they are about the dream of a greater Russian imperium. Trump needs to reconsider who he is dealing with. After all, so unrestrained is Putin's anti-Americanism that he cannot resist insulting the machismo even of the American president who has shown the most respect to him. Recall how, at the two leaders' Helsinki summit in 2018, Putin saw Trump state his trust in the former KGB officer over the reporting of the U.S. intelligence community. Putin gifted Trump a soccer ball , a very Shakespearean message that the Russian leader saw his interlocutor as a foolish pretender ( unlike Shakespeare's Henry V , however, Trump simply grinned inanely at the insult). Making matters worse, Trump used a social media post on Monday to pledge that ""Major Economic Development transactions"" between Russia and the U.S. were underway. He further emphasized this message, and not the harder choices necessary for a just peace, in a later press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. The president's message: invade democracies and cause the largest, bloodiest war in Europe since 1945, and you'll be rewarded. Seeing, however, as Russia's only exports of value are mercenaries and energy supplies, it is unclear what beneficial transactions Trump thinks he can secure even in the event of a detente with Russia. American corporations will be hesitant to invest in Russia, for example, recognizing the extreme corruption and personal risk that comes with engagement in the country. And sanctions relief on the Russian energy industry will benefit Russian exporters at the expense of their American competitors. Will this make America Great Again? THE CHALLENGE AND NECESSITY OF PEACEKEEPING TROOPS FOR UKRAINE Trump has done himself and his otherwise honorable cause of peace no favors here. An American president should never defend a country that attacked a sovereign democracy for the simple reason that it wanted that country as its own. Imagine FDR defending Germany after its invasion of Poland. Trump has scared excellent U.S. allies such as Estonia and partners such as Taiwan, who fear they may one day share Ukraine's fate. At the same time, he has undermined decades of American moral leadership in standing against those who would see the freedom of others stolen.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T22:01:26+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3328188/trump-undermines-america-un-prostration-russia/
Slumping liberal media figures should take a few days off,"It's a truism in baseball that you can't swing your way out of a slump. Sometimes, it's best to take a few games off to clear your mind and reset your stance. That's the advice we'd give to a few prominent liberal news anchors: Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, Margaret Brennan of CBS News , and Kaitlan Collins of CNN. The trio have been whiffing badly on live television throughout the first month of President Donald Trump 's second term, and it's time for each to step away for a few games. That's because, despite our numerous ideological differences, a functional opposition press, or at least the appearance of such a thing, serves the best interest of the republic. The trio's lamentable performances in recent days show they are anything but functional right now. FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT Maddow began the rough stretch on her Feb. 12 broadcast by suggesting that a $400 million State Department contract for ""armored Teslas"" amounted to proof that Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency senior adviser Elon Musk was involved in ""self-dealing."" She then mocked the truck itself and accused Musk of leveraging his power in the new administration to secure the deal. ""Musk has convinced the government to spend $400 million on armored Teslas,"" Maddow asked. ""Definitely not corrupt and ripping us all off?"" The problem with this prejudiced theory is that the procurement plan was initiated by the Biden administration in December 2024, a month before Trump took office. Biden's State Department wanted to update its fleet of diplomatic security vehicles, and its move went unnoticed. Following blistering criticism online, Maddow issued a correction the next evening. But the damage was done -- a lie travels around the world before the truth has got its boots on -- and the original clip had gone viral. That's doubtless good for MSNBC viewership if not for its credibility, and it is certainly a disservice to credulous viewers who watch Maddow. For her part, Brennan leveled an even more embarrassingly misguided charge against a Trump administration official. Speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Face the Nation on Feb. 16 about Vice President JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference, Brennan suggested that the Nazis had ""weaponized"" free speech to conduct the Holocaust and that Vance's defense of free speech on German soil was therefore culpably unaware and in bad taste. Rubio pushed back against this decisively: ""Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. The genocide was conducted by an authoritarian Nazi regime. ... There was no free speech in Nazi Germany"" -- a look of unmistakable and deserved embarrassment swept over Brennan's face. She knew the clip was about to be distributed widely for all the wrong reasons. This came on the heels of another embarrassing moment, in her late-January interview with Vance, from which also came the vice president's viral comment, ""I don't really care, Margaret."" Brennan was unable to pin Vance down despite great effort -- and worse, she frequently appeared out of her depth on the substance of the subjects under discussion. The contrast with Vance, who commanded the issues, was stark. Collins's slump has not come from lack of effort. Following her promotion to chief White House correspondent in late 2024, she's been taking hacks at the Trump administration each day, occasionally finding herself on the wrong end of exchanges with the president himself. Many have noted that Collins appears to be stepping into the shoes of Jim Acosta, the recently humiliated CNN anchor who served as the network's chief Trump antagonist. But her hostility appears to be serving her as badly as it did Acosta. It also ill serves viewers and the country. Collins's national coverage reached new lows this week when she shared a donation link for the defense fund of the UnitedHealthcare CEO killer, Luigi Mangione. She later deleted the post without apologizing following an outcry, saying the fund was not an endorsement but reporting on a ""newsworthy"" item. The most charitable interpretation of the post is that Collins did not mean to raise money for a murderer and simply exercised poor judgment, but this suggests a few days off might be in order. Sometimes, the healthiest thing to do is step back and recollect. Clearly, swinging through the slump isn't working for some of the most high-profile liberal figures in the news business.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3326247/slumping-liberal-media-figures-should-take-a-few-days-off/
Undermining Trump in Ukraine,"UNDERMINING TRUMP IN UKRAINE. President Donald Trump is moving quickly with his plan to end the war in Ukraine. What, exactly, that plan involves is still not publicly known. But given the current status of the conflict, along with what Trump and others have said about it, the short version is that it appears likely Russia will keep some of the territory, roughly 20% of the country, that it seized after invading Ukraine three years ago, Ukraine will reclaim some of the territory it lost, there will be some provisions designed to prevent future conflicts, and the fighting will end. Many Democrats, along with their activist and media allies, and some Republicans too, would like to stop Trump. But the president has a broad constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs. That, of course, hasn't kept the opposition from trying. A recent podcast gave the public a peek into the opposition's thinking. The podcast is Talking Feds , hosted by Harry Litman, a law professor and senior Justice Department official during the Clinton years. In an episode about Ukraine, Michael McFaul, the Stanford University professor who was U.S. ambassador to Russia for a couple of years during the Obama administration and is a staunch supporter of the Ukrainian war effort, argued that Trump's plan to end the war, whatever it is, does not represent the will of U.S. voters. ""I just want to emphasize that the American people, they voted for the price of eggs, folks, they didn't say we want to abdicate to be the leader of the free world,"" McFaul said. ""They didn't say we want to get in bed with Putin. They didn't say we wanted to pull out of NATO."" Just for the record, you might remember that during the campaign, candidate Trump often discussed international affairs, including ending the war in Ukraine. He also talked about the U.S. relationship with NATO, remarks that sometimes caused controversy , and he talked about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now, McFaul said Trump is ""overreaching"" on a wide range of issues and will pay a political price at home. McFaul is helping the opposition prepare for that. ""I've been spending a lot of time with Democrats in the Congress over the last couple of weeks, and I think they have not got their act together yet,"" he said. ""But just last night, with a group out here in California -- and I won't name names, but we have some prominent people who have been in leadership positions from time to time out here -- their feeling is we just got to get the guy [Trump] down to below 45. And once he's below 45, then all of our feckless Republican friends who are just scared to death of doing anything might start pushing back."" By getting Trump below 45, McFaul was referring to the president's job approval rating, which stands at 49.3% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Some have argued that 49.3% is not particularly high for a president at this point in his term, which would be true if Trump were in his first term. Since Trump is in his second but nonconsecutive term, it's hard to compare, but according to Gallup, former President Barack Obama's approval rating was 49% at this point in his second term. So Trump's 49% is certainly not unprecedented. In any event, McFaul and the Democrats he is working with believe that if they can push Trump's job approval rating below 45%, some Republicans will stop supporting Trump's Ukraine policy. GOP lawmakers, according to this scenario, will be particularly nervous supporting Trump as the 2026 midterm elections approach. And that, apparently, is what McFaul told the Ukrainian officials he met last week at the Munich Security Conference -- be patient until Trump can be stopped. ""I kept saying to my European friends and my Ukrainian friends last week, you know, hang in there,"" McFaul said. ""We just got to get to the midterms, and then things will change. I'm not confident predicting that, but I'm trying to achieve that."" McFaul did not say specifically who those Ukrainian friends were, but at another point in the podcast, he noted that while in Munich, he talked to ""very senior Zelensky officials who were in the meeting with Vice President Vance."" Now, an influential American traveling abroad speaking with high-ranking foreign officials in an effort to undercut an American president's positions is not particularly admirable. But McFaul appears to have concluded that he and his colleagues speak for more American voters than does Trump, who, after all, was elected on the price of eggs. Trump's job now is clear, if not simple -- to come up with the best possible agreement to end the war. Make it stick. Then move on. None of that will be enough to satisfy his domestic political adversaries, who, if Democrats win in 2026, will try to undo Trump's work and, if they win the House, might well try (yet again) to remove him from office. Trump has seen all that before. His task in the area of international affairs is to stay focused on trying to restore some of the order in the world that collapsed in the years he was out of office.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T23:10:51+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3328882/undermining-trump-in-ukraine/
Ending plunder and grift at USAID,"Guatemalan transgender organizations scooped $2 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and oxymoronic diversity, equity, and inclusion ""scholarships"" in Burma took another $45 million. Advancing DEI in Serbian workplaces was financed with $1.5 million, and $47,000 was found for a transgender opera in Colombia. These and many other left-wing grifts are being brought to light by early Trump administration moves to get bloated federal spending under control. It is incontestable that such egregiously unnecessary programs richly deserve the chop. But there is a yawning abyss between the thousands, millions, and even billions of dollars wasted on them and the $2 trillion that Elon Musk wants to cut with the sharp edge of the Department of Government Efficiency. If the axman severed every USAID program and nothing else, it would save only $40 billion a year. Although taxpayers would applaud, the improvement to public finances would be almost undetectably small. America would keep hurtling toward insolvency. Doing easy things, taking a win, and walking away leaving really difficult stuff untouched will be tempting, but it is a temptation that must be resisted. Absurd programs draw disproportionate attention and invite justified outrage precisely because of their triviality. Where they are not pernicious, they are obviously frivolous. A well-governed nation, especially one living beyond its means as America is, would drop them without hesitation or a backward glance. But they are not the substantive danger to the nation's finances. That comes, rather, from massive entitlements such as Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and food stamps. Means-tested social welfare spending reached $1.6 trillion in 2023 and needs cutting immediately. Social Security and Medicare are dire problems that must be dealt with immediately afterward. Such programs have accumulated like financial snowfalls to form a glacier that is grinding down and gouging out the valley of public policy from a mountaintop of good intentions to a torpid ocean of fiscal ruin. To continue the metaphor, USAID programs being targeted for elimination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and lamented by vested interests are little ice pebbles on top of that glacier and contribute almost nothing to its weight and destructive power. Cutting entitlement programs is enormously difficult politically but is legally straightforward. The Supreme Court has ruled, for example, that Social Security payments are taxes, not insurance premiums conferring guaranteed benefits. So Congress and the executive are free in principle to cut payouts and raise the retirement age, as in prudence they should. But no president since George W. Bush has even suggested, let alone tried, touching this third rail of politics, with its potential to deliver a fatal electoral shock, and President Donald Trump has explicitly ruled it out. Having duly noted that Trump and DOGE need to go where the big money is, let us return to USAID boondoggles. Although they are minuscule in monetary value compared to America's overall fiscal dismay and incontinence, they should not be lightly passed over. They are symptomatic of a moral rot that must be cured as the first order of business in returning the nation to good governance fit for future generations. The premise of those who argue that a few million dollars here and there make no difference, even when they add up to $40 billion, are like those who argued for decades that America was so big and powerful that it could withstand every protest, slight, retreat, and humiliation. The truth, however, is that the drip, drip, drip of wasted dollars is similarly destructive to the drip, drip, drip of denigration. The former erodes the probity of those who have a duty of care in spending taxpayer money, just as the latter wears down our strength, patriotism, self-confidence, and international authority. America is big and rich, but not so big and rich that it can withstand either profligate spending or moral corrosion indefinitely. All but 3% of political donations from USAID employees went to the Democratic Party, and the agency has, for decades, been plundered to finance every conceivable work of left-wing propaganda. The agency became a sort of propaganda bank, from which career bureaucrats drew funds for work that was unnecessary at best and often destructive, sometimes deliberately so. USAID spread wokery to all corners of the globe, persuading the rest of the world that America represents a corpus of ideas and values that are, if truth be told, repellent to the majority of Americans as much as they are alien to overseas peoples on whom the money is spent. To acknowledge that is not to suggest all USAID work is worthless. It is not. But much of it is. And it is right that Rubio should sift through payments, save only what is right, and zero out what is left. Aid must, as he said, ""be aligned with American foreign policy.""",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T19:06:48+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/3310394/ending-plunder-grift-usaid/
The dumbest immigration policy in the world,"Vice President JD Vance told the truth with characteristic bluntness recently when he said, ""Just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that 240 years later, we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world."" He was speaking on CBS's Sunday talk show Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan about birthright citizenship and President Donald Trump's order that federal agencies cease issuing citizenship papers to children of illegal immigrants or other foreigners temporarily in the United States. The issue of birthright citizenship is not clear cut and will doubtless go to the Supreme Court for a clarifying decision. There is a strong case for birthright citizenship but also a strong one against it . As Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson argued in the Wall Street Journal , granting birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants contains a constitutional absurdity; because only born citizens may run for president, it would mean the highest office was open to children of illegal immigrants but blocked to children brought here legally, naturalized, and raised in America, who might even have served in the U.S. military. How can it make sense that such citizens are treated as subordinate, with fewer rights than children born to foreign women with no connection to America other than that they arrived nine months pregnant, broke the law to cross the border, and gave birth? The legal controversy over birthright citizenship is based on interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was adopted to entrench the abolition of slavery and ensure that former slaves were always in future recognized as American citizens with all the rights and protections that this status confers on others. But proponents of birthright citizenship often tellingly argue less over the precise and debatable meaning of the 14th Amendment and more on the vaguer, more emotional, less legalistic ground that, as Brennan said, ""this is a country founded by immigrants."" It was this statement that Vance was answering when he talked of the dumbest immigration policy in the world. The fact that Americans all descend from immigrants is cited by the Left's open borders crowd as a sort of talisman with the magical power to make all complexities and reasonable questions on the subject disappear in a puff of self-righteousness. Noting that we are a nation of immigrants is deployed like the accusation of racism to silence anyone who suggests there is room for debate. It is this simplistic sentiment that inspires, if that is not too flattering a word, a limitless number of dreary cartoons depicting the Statue of Liberty altered and unfeelingly denying entry to the world's poor. The cartoonists intend these to deliver an acid rebuke to those who believe immigration is a nuanced issue and that current citizens should have a say in limiting the flow of foreigners into the country. Those who argue for the dumbest immigration policy want the acceptable limit of polite conversation to exclude suggestions that some immigrants are less desirable than others. They often remind you that during the great immigration surge early in the 20th century, xenophobes said arrivals from southern Europe were undesirable. The implication and often the explicit accusation is that it is racist today to regard mass immigration from the Muslim nations of Africa and the Middle East, for example, as unwelcome and ripe for restriction. Such arguments are coupled to the assertion that the U.S. is not a blood and soil nation but a country founded on universal principles to which all people can subscribe. This does not, however, fit well into the rest of the Left's agenda, for it also insists that people arriving from different cultures should not have to integrate or accept those universal principles -- should not agree to live by America's traditional values but should retain their own. The Left angrily rejects the old-fashioned notion that such people should be stirred into the melting pot and ""become"" Americans. They insist, against all the evidence, that diversity is our strength. ""Diversity"" here is a deceptive term that erases the huge difference between diversity of race and diversity of culture and values. There would be no problem if America's people were only racially diverse but united by a common culture. But that is not the case. The Left encourages immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cling to their alien cultures, which are often hostile to America's foundational ideas. The Left denigrates the host nation and its values to which the foreigners have migrated. It is often noted on the separate subject of government spending that a nation can have a generous welfare state or an open immigration policy but cannot have both together without courting financial ruin. Likewise, America can have mass immigration or unlimited cultural diversity, but it cannot have both at the same time without inviting division and national decline.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T20:45:48+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317163/dumbest-immigration-policy-in-world/
"If there’s a ‘constitutional crisis,’ blame Democrats","When a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from accessing Treasury Department information this week, Vice President JD Vance noted that ""judges aren't allowed to control"" the president's ""legitimate power."" This, we are told by hysterics, has plunged the United States into a ""constitutional crisis."" However, Vance is, of course, entirely correct that it's illegitimate for activist judges to dictate how the executive branch governs itself. It's certainly not a constitutional crisis for an administration to seek emergency relief from a partisan injunction. Presidents have done it on numerous occasions. And any higher court that takes the Constitution seriously will smack down these assaults on separation of power by judges, tout de suite . If none do, then we have ourselves a constitutional crisis. Then again, if the Left's alarms were legitimate and genuine, it has zero moral authority to decry abuse after spending nearly two decades deliberately trashing the separation of power. The Democratic Party has been a walking constitutional crisis. Take the New York Times , which is leading the charge on the ""constitutional crisis."" The outlet has spent years running columns championing the need to ""reform"" or trash our antiquated Constitution. Now, the paper is demanding courts suddenly uphold the founders' vision of governance? Well, I assure you not one of them envisioned a federal government agency funding a ""transgender comic book"" in Peru or dictating the kind of straw one can use. It was only a few weeks ago that former President Joe Biden tried to post an amendment to the Constitution. Instead of mocking a failed president's break with reality, Democratic senators and an array of left-wing groups, including the American Bar Association, praised him. The same ABA, incidentally, just wrote a scathing letter criticizing the Trump administration's ""dismantling"" of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of the people who feigned horror at the president auditing departments under his purview were quite happy when former President Barack Obama ignored Congress and unilaterally bestowed millions of illegal immigrants with amnesty. Obama also ignored Congress and SCOTUS on immigration law, and then repeatedly ignored the courts on his signature law, Obamacare, as well as on recess appointments. ""When Congress won't act, this president will,"" one of his aides famously bragged. It was Obama-era Democrats who normalized the modern imperial presidency. And today, many voters, seem convinced that a nonexistent ""popular vote"" empowers presidents with nonexistent ""mandates"" to rule as a king. Thanks, Obama. Remember when Harvard constitutional law professor Mark Tushnet offered the faux legal rationalization for the Biden administration to ignore the ""MAGA court"" and implement ""popular constitutionalism?"" Does Trump also have a license to do anything he pleases because he won the ""popular vote?"" Democrats now contend an activist district court judge should be able to micromanage the White House's hiring decisions. Only recently, though, they were pushing Biden to ignore the Supreme Court and ""forgive"" billions of dollars in existing loans by decree. He did. ""The Supreme Court blocked it, but that didn't stop me,"" Biden bragged . Not one Democrat, as far as I can tell, decried this flagrant circumvention of separation of powers. Then again, the Left has spent the better part of two decades destroying the legitimacy of the ""unelected"" Supreme Court, the only institution in American life that is more or less still functioning properly. It began with Obama's unprecedented public disparagement of the court for upholding the First Amendment in Citizens United . Soon, the Left was engaged in a concerted big-dollar ""dark-money"" effort not to only smear justices but to convince a large swath of constituents that the institution was a threat to ""democracy."" (They say it like it's a bad thing.) By 2024, the mainstream Left had embraced the authoritarian idea of court packing. What happened to the campaign to add justices, by the way? What happened to the Democrats' efforts to ""reform"" the filibuster? I guess we'll have to wait until the next time a Democrat wins the White House to hear about how the procedure is a relic of Jim Crow. Because the Left's newfound respect of separation of powers is also a matter over consequentialism, not constitutionalism. It was only a few years ago that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, now extraordinarily alarmed about the constitutionality of DOGE, was imploring Biden to take emergency powers over climate change and hand the entire economy over to an unelected administrative state. So, spare us your fake indignation. For decades, the threat of mutually assured political destruction led both parties to guard governing norms to some extent. Once the Left had control of the administrative state, it believed no matter what norm it broke, federal agencies would continue the mission, even if Republican presidents won. Today we're supposed to be horrified that Elon Musk wasn't elected directly by the people. There is virtually no aspect of life that unelected heads of the administrative state agencies haven't tried to control over the past few years. Your cars. Your stoves. Your school bathrooms. And that's really why Democrats are so freaked about USAID being audited and scaled back. Their power is vested in these institutions. Now, even if you believe that USAID -- or whatever agency is next in line -- does some good work, as I do, there's little doubt it was also a slush fund for parasitic non-governmental organizations that spread progressive social science quackery. If all this activity was above board and supported by voters and Congress -- and democratic -- the place wouldn't be run with the secrecy of the CIA. There's nothing unconstitutional about the president firing executive branch employees who serve at his pleasure, creating more transparency, or cutting spending that isn't explicitly authorized by Congress. And, in fact, presidents have promised to do as much for decades and failed. Though, Republicans should remember that any countermarch through the institutions will only stick long-term if Congress passes laws that limit the power or shut down agencies such as USAID or the Department of Education -- and hopefully others. MAGA likes to point out that USAID was created by an executive order, which is true. However, Congress has passed numerous bills since funding the agency. The Department of Education wasn't created by Jimmy Carter, as people often contend, but by a law signed by the president. It should be undone the same way, or the next Democrat administration will quickly reactivate the leviathan. As for Democrats, it's the easiest thing imaginable to stand up against executive abuses (real or imagined) when you're out of power. No one believes you. And if there's a genuine constitutional crisis in the next few years, you will deserve plenty of the blame.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T21:32:13+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3315442/constitutional-crisis-blame-democrats/
German voters join anti-mass migration movement,"Vice President JD Vance warned European leaders in Munich earlier this month that their efforts to silence dissent over policies that have produced record-high levels of foreign-born, culturally recalcitrant migrants were undermining their security. Now, with this deep problem uppermost in their minds, German voters have defeated the center-left Social Democratic Party and turned to the center-right Christian Democrats, while the Alternative for Germany, which is further to the right, nearly doubled its support. According to exit polls , more German voters identified ""immigration"" as their nation's ""most pressing problem"" than any other issue. Concerns about migrants beat out the economy by 3 points, 37%-34%, while crushing worries about ""climate change,"" 13%, and ""inflation,"" 7%. More than 82% of eligible Germans voted last weekend, making this year's turnout the highest in more than 40 years. It was not just older voters who moved right. Among men between the ages of 18 and 24, support for the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany tripled from 8% to 24%, while support among women in that age group tripled from 5% to 15%. ""Of all the pressing challenges that the nations represented here face, I believe there is nothing more urgent than mass migration,"" Vance told Europe. ""Today, almost 1 in 5 people living in this country moved here from abroad. That is, of course, an all-time high. And we know the situation ... it didn't materialize in a vacuum. It's the result of a series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world over the span of a decade."" In recent years, the politicians who made those decisions to open their countries' borders to a flood of migrants have been getting pummeled when voters get the chance to express their views in elections. In Germany, Italy, Sweden, Canada, and the United States, parties of the Left have been voted out of power after failing to secure their nations' borders. In the United Kingdom, where a center-right government recently lost, it was solely because that party, too, failed to follow through on voter wishes to reduce immigration. Only in Denmark has a center-left government managed to retain power, and the Danish government, unlike its counterpart in Germany, took strong action to reduce immigration. In the U.S., in less than a month, and without any help from Congress, just by enforcing existing law, President Donald Trump has not only stopped more migrants from illegally entering the southern border but is also inducing migrants to return home. Just by shutting down former President Joe Biden's illegal CBP One parole program, Trump has created a ""reverse flow"" of migrants now heading south from the U.S. border back to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. Where smugglers once charged $250 a person for boat rides north past Panama's Darien Gap, they are now charging $250 a person for boat rides in the opposite direction. EUROPE CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH The Christian Democrats, who received 29% of the vote, have previously promised never to form a coalition government with Alternative for Germany, which received 21% of the vote. German law allows the government to spy on political parties it deems ""extreme,"" and the German government has been spying on Alternative for Germany for years now. If the Christian Democrats insist on isolating Alternative for Germany, they will have no choice but to work with the party they just defeated, the Social Democrats. Forming coalition governments is always difficult, but if Christian Democrats want to build on their recent electoral success, they should make sure the Social Democrats responsible for Germany's current immigration policies are kept out of power.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-25T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3328313/german-voters-join-anti-mass-migration-movement/
Thin House margins delaying Stefanik confirmation in Senate,"The U.S. House of Representatives passed its budget plan on Feb. 25. The vote was 217-215, with all Democrats voting against the bill along with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY). With the nominations and subsequent resignations of former Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Mike Waltz (R-FL), Republicans have their smallest House majority since 1931. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) is currently President Donald Trump's nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations. Stefanik passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30 by a 19-3 vote. The confirmation process has stalled, however, not because of Democrats dragging their feet, but because Stefanik represents a key vote in the Republican House. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) needed her vote to pass Tuesday's budget plan, as a one-vote change would have resulted in a tie. The bill is key to Trump's policy plans, which include border security and tax cuts. While Trump may still need Stefanik in the House until the April 1 special elections to replace Gaetz and Waltz, it seems the most important part of Trump's congressional agenda is complete. The Senate's actions in the next week will indicate whether Stefanik was likely held back to help pass the budget bill. It would not be surprising to see the Senate hold off until early April, but the door has reopened for the possibility of a confirmation vote in the next few weeks. If Stefanik left the House before April, Republicans would hold a razor-thin 217-215 majority. A single defector would spell doom for any Republican bill. Republicans must choose whether they want to pass more legislation before April or finish confirming Trump's Cabinet as soon as possible. Given the ease with which she passed her committee vote, Stefanik should not have trouble passing a floor vote when the time comes.

A beloved Pennsylvanian returns home from a Russian prison,"BUTLER, Pennsylvania -- ""He's coming home, he's coming home."" Those were the words of Malphine Fogel, the mother of Marc Fogel, a western Pennsylvania teacher who was arrested in Russia in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in a hard labor camp in 2022. He was imprisoned there until Tuesday, when President Donald Trump 's administration secured his release. Sean Parnell, a western Pennsylvania native who was recently named assistant secretary of defense by Trump, recalled being with Malphine Fogel when she met with the president ahead of his July 13 rally in her family's hometown of Butler. He promised her at the end of the meeting, ""We will get your son back."" After earning Trump's promise, Parnell said Malphine Fogel exited the meeting and joined the crowd dancing to Kid Rock's ""American Badass, ""which was pretty awesome to see a 90-year-old woman do."" Mike Kelly, the Butler County Republican congressman who has been a constant in trying to secure Marc Fogel's release, marveled at his mother's optimism after her meeting with Trump. ""Malphine was given the gift of hope and purpose that day, and she held on to it,"" said Kelly, who has known the Fogel family for decades. Kelly praised the Pennsylvania delegation for working together for the family and the upper chamber of the Senate, which in June passed a bipartisan resolution calling for Marc Fogel's release. Since he graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Marc Fogel has spent his career teaching the children of American diplomats around the world in places such as Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Venezuela, and Russia. He was sentenced in 2022 after he was arrested on charges of possessing medical marijuana, which was prescribed by a doctor in the United States for back pain. After missing so much time with his sons, Marc Fogel's mother filed a lawsuit against then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken last June, saying he failed to designate her son as ""wrongfully detained."" That designation finally came in the waning days of the Biden administration on Dec. 26, 2024, when it was moved to the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs within the State Department. Sen. David McCormick (R-PA), who has hosted Malphine Fogel at his home and even sat beside her at the July 13 rally in Butler, said, like the rest of the delegation, Marc Fogel's release has been a top priority. ""It was one of the questions I asked Marco Rubio when he was seeking confirmation as secretary of state and something we have discussed since then,"" he said. U.S. Envoy for Hostages Ambassador Adam Boehler posted a photo on X of Marc Fogel in a grey sweatshirt, holding a plate of fruit and cheese, his passport, and what everyone hoped was a stiff drink in his glass. Sen. John Fetterman (PA), a Braddock Democrat, said on X, ""Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family will be welcoming him back."" Twenty-two days after being sworn in, Trump kept the promise he made to Malphine Fogel. McCormick said, ""Isn't that something."" Kelly added, ""After everything that happened that day, he never forgot. It is providential.""",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:56:20+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317377/beloved-pennsylvanian-returns-home-russian-prison/
Ramaswamy has a good shot at the Ohio governorship,"Businessman and former 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy will likely announce his candidacy for Ohio governor at a Cincinnati rally today. Ramaswamy, originally connected to President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk, left DOGE on Jan. 20, presumably to pursue elected office in Ohio. When the term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) appointed his Lieutenant Gov., Jon Husted, to fill Vice President JD Vance's Senate seat, it became almost certain that Ramaswamy would pursue the governorship. In a post on X yesterday, Ramaswamy hinted at his intentions, writing, ""Big announcement tomorrow, starting in the heart of America: Butler County."" It is unlikely that Ramaswamy means anything other than his intent to run for governor. Ohio generally has a history of choosing political insiders in statewide elections. Ohio's two most recent governors, DeWine and John Kasich, had years of congressional service before leading the state. The Buckeye State's bias toward insiders started to shift in 2016 when Trump carried the state by more than eight points. Recent senatorial elections also indicate a shift, as both Vance and Sen. Bernie Moreno, a Republican, won their seats without previously holding elected office. Ramaswamy, like Moreno, is a successful businessman without much previous political experience. He experienced a meteoric rise from being relatively unknown in 2022 to becoming a household name during the 2024 campaign. If he runs, Ramaswamy will face Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and former Morgan County School Board President Heather Hill in the primary. Even though his announcement is not official yet, Ramaswamy has already racked up some endorsements, including from Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rick Scott (R-FL). If Ramaswamy wins his primary, he will likely face former Health Department Director Amy Acton in the general election. Ramaswamy has been an outspoken supporter of Trump. This should play in his favor in a state that Trump won by large margins all three times he ran. In the past few cycles, Ohio has gone from a conservative-leaning swing state to a Republican stronghold. If he announces his candidacy, Ramaswamy will enter the race as the favorite. Given the political climate in Ohio, Ramaswamy has a very good chance of winning the office two years after launching his career in politics.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T19:35:30+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3327946/vivek-good-shot-ohio-governorship/
MSNBC hasn’t learned its lesson. That’s a good thing,"Joy Reid was, by far, the worst on-air personality at MSNBC. Her show's dwindling popularity was rivaled only by its lack of honesty, amounting to nothing but a nightly screech-fest against white people, fascism, President Donald Trump , and white people. Rachel Maddow , who pushes the same conspiratorial nonsense as Reid with slightly more subtly and far more elitist arrogance, was supposedly appalled by Reid's unseating at the network, taking time on Monday evening to address the ""changes"" at MSNBC. ""I am 51 years old. I have been gainfully employed since I was 12. And I have had so many different kinds of jobs, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. But in all of the jobs I have had, in all of the years I have been alive, there is no colleague for whom I have had more affection and more respect than Joy Reid,"" she said. ""I love everything about her. I have learned so much from her. I have so much more to learn from her."" ""I do not want to lose her as a colleague here at MSNBC, and personally, I think it is a bad mistake to let her walk out the door,"" she continued. ""It is not my call, and I understand that, but that's what I think."" Maddow went on to describe the network's cancellation of shows of ""two non-white hosts"" as ""unnerving."" ""That feels indefensible, and I do not defend it,"" she said. Given her outrage, did the oh-so-principled Rachel Maddow offer her resignation in protest of the indefensible racism that has infected the halls of MSNBC ? Of course not. I guess $25 million a year just tastes too good. Despite the shameless virtue-signaling of Maddow as she accepts tens of millions of dollars from the same people she has now labeled as indefensible racists, the truth about Reid's ouster is simple: She was fired because she is an unpopular and irrational commentator who happens to be a black woman . Unpopular and irrational people don't have a God-given right to media fame and fortune simply because of their skin color, and only racists believe otherwise. Beyond Reid's much-deserved descent into irrelevance, there's another cause for celebration here: These journalists still haven't learned their lesson. Even as MSNBC hemorrhages viewers like they're dollars in the United States's Social Security fund, it is sticking to the one strategy that got it here: an out-of-touch obsession with race. Trump's victory in November's election should have been a wake-up call to left-wing media that people have moved on from the post-2020 cult-like attitude toward the various -isms that caused former President Joe Biden and his administration to crash and burn. It's hardly a subtle indication that has been missed by other institutions. MSNBC'S CHRIS HAYES MOURNS 'DEVASTATING' FIRING OF JOY REID AMID NETWORK SHAKE-UP Jeff Bezos certainly got the message, announcing that the Washington Post's opinion pages will support and defend personal liberties and free markets. How times have changed. But as long as hacks such as Rachel Maddow and her network of pro-communist, pro-terrorist, and anti-freedom propagandists refuse to catch up with the rest of the country, their precipitous decline will continue.

Did you know about Biden’s mental decline? Jake Tapper didn’t,"Former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline was obvious during his presidency to anyone who watched him, except apparently to liberal journalists such as CNN's Jake Tapper. Tapper is releasing a book coauthored with Axios's Alex Thompson called Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. The press release for the book says, ""What you will learn makes President Biden's decision to run for reelection seem shockingly narcissistic, self-delusional, and reckless -- a desperate bet that went bust -- and part of a larger act of extended public deception that has few precedents."" Except you, dear reader, will probably not learn that. Chances are you already know that. To most of us with eyes, we could see that Biden was not up to the job and his brain was slipping. He spent the 2020 campaign hiding in his basement to avoid unscripted interactions. The few times he emerged, he was either married to his teleprompter or offering such wisdom as ""We have to take care of the cure. That will make the problem worse no matter what."" Just two months into the job, Biden couldn't even remember the name of his defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. ""I want to thank Sec-... the ... the former general ... I keep calling him 'General ... My ... My uhh ... The guy who runs that outfit over there."" It only got worse from there, as Biden called out to dead people at speeches, sounded increasingly incoherent off-teleprompter, and claimed he had cancer in addition to claiming that his administration ""ended cancer as we know it,"" among multiple other brain lapses. Everyone knew Biden couldn't function. Democrats and their activist celebrities admitted behind the scenes that Biden's brain was fried. Robert Hur's report detailed that Biden's memory was gone, saying he couldn't remember when he was vice president, what year his son died, or details about the Afghanistan withdrawal of which he was in charge. The Justice Department even buried the audio of that interview with the special counsel to avoid further scrutiny. PALESTINE'S PROPAGANDA PARTNERS Jake Tapper was apparently one of the only people who didn't know. With righteous indignation, he attacked Lara Trump for pointing out Biden's decline, claiming Biden just had a stutter that hadn't presented itself his entire public life and that she should be ashamed for making children who stutter feel bad. Tapper apparently only discovered Biden's mental decline when Thompson brought him on to help sell the book. During the election, Tapper was a cog in the media machine covering up Biden's decline. We don't need a pretentious book from liberal media acting as if they suddenly discovered the cover-up of Biden's health because we sat through their participation in it. Tapper is five years too late for the party and is only here conveniently after the 2024 elections so he can try and win conservative goodwill with no real consequences to his network and his Democratic Party team.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T20:25:10+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3332587/biden-mental-decline-jake-tapper-new-book/
Trump can make this a global golden age for religious liberty,"The United States is a beacon for religious freedom . That's a regrettably rare thing around the world. Pew Research's 2022 Report on Government Restrictions on Religion showed that restrictions in 198 countries and territories peaked in 2022. President Donald Trump's second term thus presents a unique opportunity to cement his legacy in championing global religious freedom. ""You shouldn't have to leave your faith at the door of your people's government, and under President Trump's leadership, you won't have to,"" Vice President JD Vance said during the International Religious Freedom Summit last week in Washington. Protection of religious freedom was a core tenet of Trump's first-term foreign policy. In his remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019, he reaffirmed that ""religious freedom is a fundamental right"". His efforts received bipartisan support in Congress. The first Trump administration built on the foundation set by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and launched a series of unprecedented initiatives to support persecuted religious minorities, advocate religious freedom in international forums, and maintain a strong stance against religious persecution in countries such as China and Iran. In 2018, for example, the State Department established the International Religious Freedom Ministerial and held the historic and first Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. The event was followed by ministerial meetings held in 2019, 2020, and 2022. These were designed to bring together religious leaders, advocates, and government officials from around the world to discuss and promote religious freedom. They served to elevate the importance of religious freedom on the global stage and reinforce U.S. leadership in defending this fundamental human right. Congress also acted. One of the most prominent bipartisan legislative actions was the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in 2020. This act aimed to address China's treatment of Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, including forced labor, surveillance, and mass detentions. The legislation introduced sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses. Also in 2020, the Falun Gong Protection Act was introduced in Congress to highlight concerns over China's persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The bill had bipartisan backing, with lawmakers advocating action over the Chinese government's human rights violations. In addition, several U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have expressed support for Shen Yun Performing Arts. Shen Yun is not just an arts group tied to the Falun Gong. According to its leaders, it is also a living artistic expression of a spiritual and cultural heritage that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to eradicate. Other examples abound. The Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act was bipartisan and passed with wide support in 2018. It aimed to hold the Iranian government accountable for human rights abuses, including the persecution of the Baha'i community, religious minorities, and others. In 2019, Congress passed the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, which aimed to strengthen U.S. efforts to prevent genocide and other atrocities. The law had broad bipartisan support and was particularly focused on protecting religious and ethnic minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, Sunni minority groups, Shia minority groups, Alawites, Bahai's, and Jews in areas including Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Building on these remarkable achievements, the new Trump administration could continue to advance global religious freedom and take further steps in supporting religious minorities around the world. The political change in Syria, for instance, requires the U.S. to ensure that minority faith groups -- Alawites, Christians, Shiites, and others -- finally enjoy religious freedom. In addition, the Trump administration should redouble efforts to protect Christians in North Korea, other religious minorities in Iran, and Christians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, or Buddhists in China. A comprehensive strategy to combat religious persecution and defend religious freedom abroad, ensuring that U.S. foreign aid, diplomacy, and other international efforts prioritize the protection of religious freedoms will advance global peace and stability, strengthen democratic principles, and counter extremism. It will also cement Trump's legacy of global religious freedom champion.

The path to China deterrance,"In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump cast a bold vision for a moonshot that received too little attention: ending global conflict. He said America will achieve ""peace through strength"" via deterrence, making the U.S. military the strongest and most capable fighting force in the world. He also made clear that our primary object of deterrence is China . Certainly, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are already on a winning trajectory when it comes to personnel readiness. Recruiting numbers in January hit a 15-year high, proof that their ""warrior over woke"" cultural transition is working. But when it comes to realigning our capabilities to our adversaries' threats and overhauling the defense industrial base, we are dangerously behind. We are losing the economics of conflict. With rare exceptions, history rewards nations that master the economics of conflict and punishes those that do not. A clear example of this is the contrast between our 1980s intervention in Afghanistan against the Soviets and our involvement in the global war on terror. In the 1980s, we sent $8,500 Stinger missiles to the Mujahadeen, who used them to destroy Soviet aircraft worth millions. This was an incredible return on investment, one Congress gladly made again and again. Over time, the Soviets lost their Afghan war. Shortly thereafter, they lost their country. In contrast, during the global war on terror, the United States deployed exquisite million-dollar armored vehicles across the Middle East, only to see our adversaries defeat them with repurposed explosives and $20 worth of farm supplies. Throughout the last year in the Red Sea, the U.S. Navy has fired $2 million missiles at $50,000 drones launched by the Houthis. The math is broken, and our ability to sustain these costs rests solely on the United States' control over the world's reserve currency. Despite this advantage, our adversaries see the United States losing the economics of future conflict. Our country is $36.3 trillion in debt and runs a $1.8 trillion annual deficit. Our interest payments alone match the entire defense budget, and our annual deficit is double it. While our debt to gross domestic product ratio has hit a historic high of 123%, we only spend 2.9% of GDP on defense, the lowest since World War II. We find ourselves in a historic defense squeeze amid unprecedented fiscal constraints. At the same time, our capabilities are getting more expensive while our enemies' threats are getting cheaper. And history reminds us that cheap and capable beats exquisite and expensive -- every time, over time. As technology gaps shrink, our ability to win short-term conflict decisively is eroding. The United States needs a fundamental shift in how we think about defense. Our adversaries do not need aircraft carriers and battleships to sink ours. Cheap drones can cripple $100 million aircraft sitting on our tarmacs, sink the ships in our harbors or at sea, and even take down our electrical grid and pipeline infrastructure. Let us not forget that Ukraine crippled Russia's entire Black Sea fleet without a navy of its own. Americans have always looked at aircraft carriers in their harbors as a source of national pride and strength -- unparalleled capabilities to project force in times of need. In this new era, they may be liabilities. The United States has never operated in such a paradigm. If we fail to adjust, we risk spending ourselves into the oblivion of the Soviet Union that President Ronald Reagan so meticulously orchestrated, but now presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia orchestrate against us. Today, we are spending billions to sustain and purchase equipment that has not helped us win the last 30 years of war and will not help us deter or win the next one. So, how do we achieve Trump's objective of modern deterrence through winning the economics of war? First, we must recognize that we can either continue to fund the military we have today or invest in the military we need to deter and defeat China tomorrow. We cannot do both. The military's budget is bleeding from the operational and maintenance costs of outdated platforms and real estate, and that means we need to be ruthless in deciding which capabilities and platforms remain operational. Many in Congress will resist these cuts, but our national security demands honest assessment and hard action. We must butcher military pork like the conservative welfare that it is. Second, we must focus on exquisite capabilities that deliver decisive dominance. If a weapon provides an overwhelming strategic advantage against China, we keep it. If it falls short, we stop buying it and return to the drawing board. For exquisite capabilities in development, contracts must guarantee real battlefield supremacy, not just incremental improvement. We cannot afford to spend billions simply keeping up with China. We must unleash the full potential of American ingenuity to deter it. MISSION-CAPABILITY RATES FOR AIR FORCE FLEETS AT 'LOWEST LEVELS' IN OVER TWO DECADES Third, we must mass-produce our low-cost, high-impact capabilities that construct the foundation of both conventional and future asymmetric warfare. This includes energetics and explosives, munitions, artillery, surface-to-air and anti-tank missiles, rocket motors, and jet engines. We must fund new technologies and software at the speed of innovation and invest heavily in the military's organic capability to produce small drones at a significant scale. A general rule: Unless it achieves strategic dominance, if the cost to produce our capability exceeds what our enemies spend to produce their threat, we shouldn't buy it. Follow this rule, and we'll drive innovation, increase competition, and cut costs and Trump will keep us out of war with China. Ending global conflict? That could be a bonus.

Can the FTC stop big tech censorship?,"The Federal Trade Commission is requesting public comments on "" technology platform censorship ,"" a long-standing gripe for conservatives who believe social media companies have been censoring them and their ideas. To date, courts have rejected cases alleging censorship by the so-called Big Tech platforms on grounds that the plaintiffs failed to show ""state action"" on the part of government agents. But ever since the Twitter files were released in late 2022 and early 2023, Congress, the courts, and the executive branch have all been forced to grapple with how social media companies may have been pressured or cajoled by government officials to censor disfavored individuals and ideas. The FTC's inquiry suggests that it is looking for legal ways to address this alleged censorship. The FTC is, for now, just seeking to gather more information on the scope and scale of the alleged censorship. While it is good to know more about pressure campaigns from government officials in particular, the request also aims to know more about how technology platforms ""censor"" users on their own. The commission will ultimately have to weigh how the First Amendment limits what legal tools may be applied to them. The Supreme Court's decision last year in Moody v. NetChoice made clear that social media platforms have a First Amendment interest in how they curate and display third-party content, the output of which constitutes a distinctive ""expressive product."" Overriding their expressive choices impinges on their right to editorial discretion. Moreover, the government has no valid interest in ""improving, or better balancing, the marketplace of ideas."" These constitutional principles directly apply to possible consumer protection or antitrust claims that the FTC might bring. The courts wouldn't grant an injunction requiring platforms to carry particular speech or speakers. In the context of antitrust law, this goes back to the 1945 decision in Associated Press v. United States , where the Supreme Court noted that the government could not ""compel AP or its members to permit publication of anything which their 'reason' tells them should not be published."" The FTC could exercise its consumer-protection jurisdiction to allege the tech platforms were engaged in ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" if they violated their own content moderation policies or other representations made to consumers. It's even possible that the commission could legally require the platforms to grant more transparency about their moderation decisions. But the First Amendment protects platforms' ability to set and change their own policies as they see fit in order to create their own ""expressive product."" In other words, the FTC couldn't do much about a tech platform explicitly deciding to ""censor"" speech it doesn't like since it is a private party. The FTC could also allege collusion, whether among technology platforms or among advertisers, that led to similar moderation policies and decisions. Assuming that the FTC could make out such a case (which is by no means obvious), the First Amendment protects not only platforms' right to make their own editorial decisions but also advertisers' right to decide whether to buy ads on particular platforms. While antitrust laws can apply to speech platforms' economic conduct, remedies may not extend to forced carriage or funding of any particular speech or speaker. There are good reasons to be wary of platform censorship. Last year's Murthy v. Missouri decision limited individuals' ability to bring claims of backdoor government censorship. Further action by Congress or the executive branch may, therefore, be needed to encourage transparency and limit government pressure campaigns. But any such changes would need to recognize that the First Amendment protects tech platforms as private actors with a right to editorial discretion over their ""expressive products.""

Rubio’s good start blunting Chinese influence in Panama,"The selection of former Sen. Marco Rubio to become the nation's secretary of state sent the message that shoring up Latin America will be a top priority for the new administration. Early returns suggest the selection is paying off. Rubio's trip to Panama, his first stop as the nation's most senior Cabinet member, delivered a significant concession from the Panamanian government. Following his meeting with Rubio, President Jose Raul Mulino, after months of denying President Donald Trump's claims that China controlled the Panama Canal, announced that his country will not renew a 2017 infrastructure funding agreement with China. As a result, Panama will cease participating in China's Belt and Road Initiative once the current agreement expires in 2027. Mulino even expressed openness to ending the agreement beforehand. While Panama's exit from the BRI will not directly involve operations or control of the canal, it is significant on a number of fronts. For the United States, the Panama Canal is critically important for national security because of its location for commercial and military traffic. China's partnership with the Panamanian government raised concerns about its influence over the canal, which would enable them to disrupt U.S. commerce, influence toll rates and ship prioritization, and provide economic leverage for China to make strategic gains in the region. Mulino's concession not only keeps the canal from falling under Chinese control but also broadly blunts Chinese expansionism in Latin America. In recent years, China has invested heavily in the region on infrastructure projects and increased trade. Chinese development banks have provided substantial loans to Latin American countries for infrastructure deals or resource-backed loans. This has stoked U.S. fears of ""debt trap diplomacy,"" in which high levels of debt would give China control over key assets. The case of Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port is instructive. Completed in 2010, the port, which is positioned on major shipping routes in the Indian Ocean, was built by the China Harbour Engineering Company and funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. However, it quickly became apparent that the port was not generating enough revenue. Debt repayment problems caused Sri Lanka to lease the port in 2017 to China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited for 99 years. Today, China controls the port. While Rubio's success in convincing Panama not to renew its participation in the BRI is a positive step in countering Chinese influence in Panama, there is still plenty of work to be done in the region. For instance, countries such as Panama must agree to accept more deportees, as well as increase their cooperation in curbing the flow of migrants to the U.S., especially by way of the perilous Darien Gap. It is part of the Pan-American Highway that was never completed and is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world. Mulino has vowed to ""close"" the gap -- and he must be held to his word. Panama must also clamp down on organized crime, which exacerbates migration to the U.S. and causes regional instability generally. The U.S. Embassy's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement has provided $12 million in recent years to help Panama fight organized crime, which includes drug trafficking in the country that serves as a transit point for drugs that eventually arrive in North America. To win this battle, Mulino must also tackle deep-seated corruption in the Panamanian government, which is no small task. Increased security cooperation and enhanced economic ties between the U.S. and Panama are crucial components of maintaining U.S. leadership in the Western hemisphere and beyond. Rubio's mission to achieve this is a good start, but the real work has only just begun.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3310152/rubio-good-start-blunting-chinese-influence-panama/
Kelly Loeffler is the champion small businesses need,"In Iowa and across the country, Main Street is in trouble. Small businesses are the lifeblood of communities, but under former President Joe Biden's administration, they were crushed by bureaucratic overreach. After four years of price hikes and dismay, optimism on Main Street recently surged to its highest level since 2018 because job creators are eager for Republicans and the Trump administration to revitalize the small business economy. That starts with fixing the broken Small Business Administration , which has become a bloated bureaucratic mess. Change starts at the top, and we need a proven business leader as SBA administrator to gut the red tape and refocus the agency on serving Main Street. As an accomplished businesswoman, Kelly Loeffler is the perfect person for the job. Throughout her career, she rose through the ranks at multiple companies due to her determination and grit. She also started many businesses and knows what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. Most importantly, she knows what it means to be overrun by Washington's bureaucratic overreach -- and that the government must instead get out of the way so businesses can thrive. I believe substantial reforms must be made to get the SBA back in shape, and that will require strong leadership. While the SBA once may have been characterized as a smaller agency, COVID-19-era small business programs made the agency a household name, as it received $1.1 trillion in taxpayer funding to assist small businesses during the pandemic. With that funding came big responsibilities, and I remain concerned that the SBA has too often failed to live up to its mission. The Biden administration decided to turn a blind eye to COVID-19 fraud and delinquencies, refusing to properly collect outstanding debt and fraudulent funds, which has huge implications for the taxpayer. Reports have indicated the SBA charged about $18.6 billion worth of economic injury disaster loans in fiscal 2024. The agency has also been unable to provide an accounting of its loans receivable and loan guarantees, which means the Government Accountability Office hasn't been able to even issue a financial audit of the agency since fiscal 2020. The SBA also mismanaged and misinformed Congress last year regarding its disaster loan account, resulting in a shortfall that lasted 66 days -- an unacceptable failure for the disaster victims in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and Florida. On top of this, it also appears the agency's workforce continues to stay home, while its more than 246,000-square-foot Washington headquarters sits empty . The GAO found that even if everyone did show up to work in person, the SBA's building space would still only be 67% utilized . That is why I introduced a bill to relocate 30% of the headquarters workforce to the SBA district offices across the country and cut 30% of office space. Not only will this save taxpayers money, but it will bring SBA employees closer to the people they serve.

Trump must stop the UK’s dangerous surrender of the Chagos Islands,"Most Americans may not be familiar with the Chagos Islands, but they play a crucial role in U.S. national security . This remote Indian Ocean archipelago, which includes Diego Garcia, hosts one of the most strategically important American military bases in the world. The base has been a linchpin of U.S. military operations for decades, providing logistical support for missions in the Middle East , countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific, and serving as a critical hub for intelligence and surveillance. Despite its strategic significance, the United Kingdom, under the leadership of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is preparing to hand over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This decision is not based on security concerns or practical governance but on a misguided sense of legalism and postcolonial revisionism. The U.K. is willing to cede control despite the islands having little historical or cultural connection to Mauritius, which lies 1,400 miles away. Under the proposed deal, Britain would cede sovereignty while paying Mauritius 9 billion pounds over 99 years to lease back Diego Garcia, the key U.S. naval base in the region. The negotiations are being led by Starmer's attorney general, Lord Richard Hermer, who has previously stated that ""almost every element"" of the British Empire was racist and has actively advocated reparations to be paid to those who were ""victims"" of the empire. This latest arrangement from Hermer is not only an unprecedented act of strategic self-sabotage by the U.K. but also a direct threat to U.S. interests in the region. Now back in office, President Donald Trump must urgently intervene to prevent this reckless handover, a move that would deal a devastating blow to U.S. national security and ultimately play into the hands of China. China has a well-documented track record of leveraging debt and infrastructure projects to entrench its influence across the developing world. From Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port to military installations in Djibouti, Beijing has perfected the art of turning economic partnerships into strategic footholds. Once Mauritius takes control of the Chagos Islands, it is only a matter of time before China offers lucrative investment deals in exchange for naval access. Given Mauritius's economic dependence on China, resistance to such overtures would be difficult. For Washington, the consequences of a Chinese presence in Diego Garcia would be catastrophic. The island has been crucial to America's power projection in the Indo-Pacific and serves as a counterweight to China's growing military assertiveness. Allowing China to establish even a minimal footprint in the Chagos archipelago would dramatically shift the balance of power in the region and weaken U.S. deterrence. Trump must make it clear to the U.K. that this deal is unacceptable. The U.S. should leverage its diplomatic and economic influence to halt the transfer, emphasizing that British participation in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and other key defense agreements depends on London's commitment to shared security interests. If necessary, Washington must also be prepared to negotiate a direct long-term lease with Mauritius, ensuring ironclad restrictions on any Chinese involvement. This is not a matter of decolonization or historical redress. It is a matter of strategic survival. The Chagos Islands are too important to be sacrificed on the altar of postcolonial revisionism. If Starmer's government insists on this folly, Trump must step in and put an end to it before it is too late.

Trump runs defense for deep state with Mark Zaid clearance revocation,"President Donald Trump is heavily focused on dismantling what he regards as a so-called ""deep state"" of government agencies that work for their own partisan agendas. This concern is especially important when it comes to the intelligence and security agencies, where if malfeasance occurs, it undermines our democratic society. However, if Trump wants to take on the deep state, why is he taking one of its most successful challengers off the field? Namely, Mark Zaid. A longtime national security attorney based in Washington, Zaid has held a high-level Top Secret-SCI government security clearance for more than 20 years. This clearance has allowed Zaid to represent members of the intelligence community whose concerns relate to highly classified information. Trump revoked Zaid's clearance last week. The president's apparent motive for the revocation is Zaid's role in representing a whistleblower who alleged that Trump improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call between the two leaders during Trump's first term in office. If so, this is a silly rationale for revocation. Zaid is an attorney. His job is to represent clients whether or not he shares their political views. And Zaid is hardly an anti-Trump agitator. He has previously represented numerous Trump administration or aligned officials. Zaid previously worked closely with former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) in relation to the Benghazi terrorist attack investigation. John Solomon reported that Zaid was the first attorney to represent a key IRS whistleblower who alleged misconduct in the Justice Department's investigation of Hunter Biden for tax fraud. Does that sound like the work of a deep state Democratic partisan to you? Zaid told the Washington Examiner why he believes Trump made a misjudgment here. ""In reality,"" he said, ""this decision hurts his administration more than it does me because it will preclude my ability to represent his own people, as I did during his first administration, who face employment and security concerns, as well as defending them in investigations."" Zaid's clearance revocation will also perversely help both Biden administration officials and Russia. Zaid represented numerous former and active intelligence officers in relation to the so-called ""Havana Syndrome"" or ""Anomalous Health Incidents"" concern. The Biden administration facilitated the intelligence community's cover-up of Russia's responsibility for causing many Havana Syndrome incidents. Zaid observed, ""This action truly hurts my AHI clients. I was regularly bringing AHI whistleblowers to [the Congressional intelligence oversight committees] for classified interviews and giving them protection because of my clearance. That was to show the Biden administration was covering up the truth. And I was doing it pro bono."" Trump has some legitimate concerns over politicization within the deep state. However, if he wants to take on deep state malfeasance, the very worst thing he could do is remove the security clearance of lawyers such as Zaid. That path helps only those who are interested in cover-ups and setting their own agendas outside of effective oversight. After all, the government imposes strict conditions on how whistleblowers are supposed to disclose their concerns. If a whistleblower breaks these conditions, they will likely quickly find themselves facing a visit from the FBI. Even if prosecution and prison time don't follow, suspension of a security clearance and dismissal are likely. For individuals who have spent their careers in the shadows and who have yet to put their children through college, this concern means that staying quiet about a deep state problem is often personally preferable to speaking out about it. Individuals such as Zaid are thus crucial in supporting democratic transparency by shielding those who want the truth to set Americans free. Put another way, Trump is further flooding the swamp rather than draining it with this decision. The president should reconsider.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T19:45:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3316191/trump-runs-defense-deep-state-mark-zaid-clearance-revocation/
Sean Parnell once again answers the call to serve,"PITTSBURGH -- Western Pennsylvania native Sean Parnell said he is humbled and honored to once again serve his country, this time not on the battlefield, but as the chief Pentagon spokesman for the Trump administration . Parnell told the Washington Examiner the call to duty feels amazing. ""I accept the position with great humility. One of the things I wish I understood when I joined the military at the age of 23 was that we were standing on the shoulders of giants. That we had inherited an extraordinary legacy of everyone who came before us,"" he said. President Donald Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social that he was pleased to announce Parnell's new roles as chief Pentagon spokesman and assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs. ""Sean is a fearless Combat Veteran, who led one of the most decorated units in the Afghanistan War. He earned two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart while his platoon achieved an incredible record of eliminating over 350 enemy fighters,"" said Trump, adding that during his first term, Parnell was instrumental in helping to pass the MISSION Act, ""the biggest VA reform in history."" As he accepted the position, Parnell said he could not help but think of the men and women who came before him. ""All of those who sacrificed their lives for this country, I work for them, for the men and women in uniform then, for the men and women in uniform today, and for the men and women who don the uniform in the future,"" he said. His 14-year-old daughter Emma, who was with him when he got the news, said she is so proud of her dad right now, ""Plus, I get to go to see him at the Pentagon."" Born in Pittsburgh and raised in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, where he attended Greensburg Central Catholic, Parnell went on to study elementary education at Clarion University. He said he struggled to find his purpose on Sept. 11, 2001. ""I woke that morning lying flat on my back on this beat-down couch in my living room, turned on the television, and in that moment, was shaken to my core,"" he said, recounting how most of the United States felt that horrific day. What caught his attention more than anything else was how ordinary people responded. ""Police officers and firefighters ran into the flames to save people they didn't even know. In many cases, people who ran into the flames that day never came out again,"" he said. It was when he observed these acts of selflessness that he decided he needed to serve something greater than himself. He transferred to a university that had an ROTC program, became an officer, and was on the ground in December 2006. He said he found his purpose and why God had placed him on this Earth. Parnell went on to spend 485 days in heavy combat, where he earned two Bronze Stars, one for valor, and a Purple Heart. In one of those battles, he suffered a skull fracture in three places and received a medical discharge after being diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and PTSD. When he got out of the military, he shifted from defense of the country to capturing and preserving the legacy of his soldiers. This led the Army combat veteran to write the New York Times bestseller Outlaw Platoon and Man of War . Parnell, who has known Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth since their military days, thanked him for the opportunity. Hegseth said on X that Parnell exudes courageous leadership and selfless service. Parnell ran for office in 2020 against incumbent Democrat Conor Lamb, narrowly losing the House seat in Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District. He ran briefly for a Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2021 but withdrew when concerns for his children unfolded during a court battle. Parnell was in the stands in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 after giving a speech ahead of Trump's remarks when Thomas Matthew Crooks shots rang out at the Butler Farm Show Complex, wounding Trump and two other supporters and killing retired fire chief Corey Comperatore. Parnell's battlefield composure took over in the aftermath, immediately calming and evacuating people from the scene.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T17:32:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3310165/sean-parnell-once-again-answers-call-serve/
Shein and Temu must be restricted over slave labor,"The Chinese companies Shein and Temu have become wildly popular for their dirt-cheap clothes and gadgets. Hidden behind the trendy bargains, however, rests an ugly truth: these companies are profiting from slave labor. Mounting evidence ties their supply chains to forced labor by Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. This isn't a minor allegation; it's part of what many countries recognize as an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people. President Donald Trump's administration is reportedly weighing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security's forced labor blacklist. As the Trump administration works to decouple the United States from reliance on Chinese goods, leveraging existing authority to prevent Shein and Temu from skirting U.S. law should be a priority. Kicking out forced-labor profiteers would protect our values and strengthen our resilience against a hostile foreign power. In 2021, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) to ensure that American commercial activity is not supporting forced labor. The UFLPA created a rebuttable presumption that any goods connected to Xinjiang are tainted by forced labor and barred from import unless proven otherwise. This law embodies a basic moral principle: no product of slave labor should reach American homes and businesses. Unfortunately, that principle is undermined every day when Americans purchase products from Shein and Temu. The allegations against Shein and Temu are not mere speculation. A 2022 report by Bloomberg used laboratory testing to confirm that Shein's products contained cotton sourced from Xinjiang, the epicenter of China's state-run forced labor program. While Shein claims it does not source from Xinjiang, the opacity of its supply chain raises serious concerns about its credibility. Similarly, Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is also complicit in the use of forced Uyghur labor. Temu's rapid expansion into the U.S. market has come with almost no transparency about its sourcing practices. Unlike Amazon or Walmart, which have regulatory and compliance mechanisms in place to audit suppliers, Temu operates as a marketplace that allows Chinese manufacturers--many of whom may rely on Xinjiang supply chains--to sell directly to American consumers with little scrutiny. Banning Shein and Temu is not just a moral necessity; it is an economic imperative. The presence of these companies in the U.S. market undercuts American businesses that adhere to ethical labor practices. Such rock-bottom prices are subsidized by forced labor, lack of supply chain transparency, and regulatory arbitrage. This creates an unfair playing field for American retailers and manufacturers and exposes consumers to harmful products. By formally designating these companies as complicit in forced labor in Xinjiang, their imports could be blocked outright unless they prove no ties to slave labor -- a high bar given the evidence. From a strategic perspective, allowing companies with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to dominate the U.S. e-commerce space poses national security risks. A 2023 report from the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the CCP identified Shein's ""aggressive data collection"" on American consumers, similar to the concerns raised about TikTok. Given the CCP's extensive history of using technology companies for intelligence gathering, continued access to U.S. consumers poses a direct risk. This move would be a significant escalation in holding China accountable and protecting U.S. consumers. It's also a logical next step in Trump's broader trade crackdown. Placing Shein and Temu on the UFLPA-covered list would send an unambiguous message: the United States will not be a dumping ground for goods made with slave labor. This approach offers a targeted solution that protects human rights without harming legitimate trade. By banishing Shein and Temu from our market, Trump would be standing up for the millions who cannot speak out, from Uyghur laborers to U.S. workers who deserve better than competing with slave labor.

How Trump can support homeschool families,"President Donald Trump has begun his second term with an energetic flurry of action . As he continues his relentless pace, it is worth remembering that before his election last November, he expressed support for homeschooling as a great educational option. He's right. The freedom to homeschool enjoyed by Americans is indeed a unique one that we should not take for granted. It was not long ago that those freedoms were far more restricted than they are today. Many other countries still place onerous restrictions on or even outright prohibit homeschooling, making America's freedom to homeschool even more unique. TRUMP WANTS TO 'IMMEDIATELY' CLOSE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: 'BIG CON JOB' The freedom to homeschool enshrines and protects the important right for parents to direct the education of their own children in accordance with the values of their family. It plays an integral role in protecting the family nucleus that lies at the heart of American society. As president of the Home School Legal Defense Association, the nation's largest homeschooling advocacy organization, I am frequently asked, ""What can the federal government do for homeschoolers?"" Our response is always the same: We don't want government handouts. Instead, we want more freedom to choose homeschooling and fewer barriers for homeschooled children to enter the adult world. Our work to expand the boundaries of homeschool freedom is best left to the states. But there are some barriers getting in the way of homeschooled children that the federal government could help remove. In the early years of the modern homeschooling movement, the qualifications of homeschool graduates were viewed with suspicion by colleges, the military, trade schools, and some employers, especially state and local governments. The proven success of homeschooling graduates over the last few decades has helped lower or remove many of those barriers. Today, colleges from the Ivy League to local community colleges and all branches of the military actively recruit homeschool graduates. But a few enclaves stubbornly continue to discriminate. For example, trade licensing boards. We recently sued New Jersey's cosmetology board because it refused to license a homeschool graduate even though she had successfully completed all the coursework and had passed the test. Why? Because it did not recognize homeschooling as a valid high school education -- for her or any other homeschooler. While the board ultimately relented and issued the license, this scenario has popped up repeatedly. We have had frequent run-ins with the phlebotomy board in California, cosmetology boards around the country, sheriff's departments, and other public employers that have had blanket rules against recognizing homeschooled children as high school graduates. Sometimes, HSLDA can intervene, but more often, because litigation takes time, the young adult is forced to get a GED or associate's degree. They just want to get to work. The federal government could remove this barrier by requiring any recipient of federal funds to recognize homeschooling as a way to complete high school on par with public and private schools. This would apply whether they be educational institutions, trade schools, or public employers. A second barrier is hidden in the byzantine regulations of the Department of Labor. For 14- and 15-year-old teenagers to work, they must get a work permit, which is a state-administered process. But federal regulation 29 CFR 570.35(b), which affects certain employers, only permits hiring a teenager ""outside school hours,"" defined as ""the hours that the local public school district where the minor resides while employed is in session during the regularly scheduled school year."" In other words, a privately educated student's work hours are restricted by the public school schedule. Suppose a child attends a faith-based private school that takes Easter week as spring break, while the local public school does not. That child would not be permitted to work on any of those days until after the public school closes for the day. One of the great benefits of homeschooling is its flexibility. Homeschools are not required to follow the public school calendar or hours, so why should a homeschooled teenager's work opportunities be artificially restricted by public school schedules? That is especially true today as more young people are exploring apprenticeship options to enter high-paying blue-collar trades rather than taking on enormous college debt. This regulation should be revised to ensure that homeschooled and other privately educated students' work opportunities are linked to their own school schedule, not that of the public schools. Another barrier for families considering homeschooling can be the expense of privately educating a child. Homeschooling can be successfully pursued on a tight budget, but some parents need extra help. One of my organization's charitable missions is to provide financial help in obtaining curriculum for families who have lost a parent or been devastated by a disaster, such as Hurricane Helene or the Los Angeles wildfires. Generous donors have allowed us to help thousands of families over the years with millions of dollars in grants. While our donors may be eligible for a charitable gift deduction from their federal income tax, a bill currently before Congress would encourage similar private philanthropy on a much larger scale. Under the Educational Choice for Children Act, generous donors to nonprofit scholarship-granting organizations would receive a 100%, nonrefundable tax credit -- not just a deduction. The scholarship-granting organization would then help lower-income families afford to educate their children privately. TRUMP EDUCATION PLAN TO UNSHACKLE STATES, BOOST CHOICE, PRESERVE GI BILL, LOANS Using the federal tax code to encourage private philanthropy is a time-honored tradition. The ECCA would encourage those with plenty to help families with less to pursue the best private education for their children. That's a win-win we support. We believe that homeschooling is good for children, families, and society. If we remain vigilant, homeschooling can continue to flourish.

Fort Bragg’s latest name change is pure political appeasement,"The Pentagon has announced it is once again changing the name of one of its largest military bases, Fort Liberty, back to its original name, Fort Bragg, but with a twist. Instead of bearing the name of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, the home of the 82nd Airborne Division and U.S. Army Special Operations Command will now honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper who earned the Silver Star for his bravery during the Battle of the Bulge. Let's be clear: There should never have been a military base named after Braxton Bragg in the first place. Beyond his role as a commander in an armed rebellion against the U.S. government, Bragg is widely regarded as one of the worst generals of the Civil War. His poor leadership and strategic failures were legendary even among his own troops. For this reason alone, the original decision to rename Fort Bragg was commendable. However, in typical fashion, the Biden administration chose the uninspired and overly generic ""Fort Liberty,"" a safe, watered-down option seemingly designed to appease a segment of the Left that finds offense in just about everything. Now, by rebranding Fort Bragg to honor a little-known WWII soldier, the Trump administration can claim to be restoring history erased by the Left's insatiable appetite for faux outrage -- all while sidestepping the awkwardness of celebrating a Confederate general who was both a notorious slave owner and an incompetent military leader. Yet, in doing so, it has fallen into the same trap of opting for political appeasement rather than seizing the opportunity to honor a genuinely deserving American hero: General James M. Gavin. As the highly decorated third commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II, Gavin was more than just a leader; he was a visionary and a soldier's general. Nicknamed the ""Jumping General,"" Gavin personally participated in combat jumps alongside his troops in Sicily, in Italy, and during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. His leadership style exemplified courage, strategic brilliance, and an unwavering dedication to his men. At just 37 years old, he became the youngest divisional commander in the U.S. Army, leading the 82nd Airborne Division with unparalleled effectiveness. Gavin's actions directly contributed to the success of key military campaigns during WWII, and his innovative thinking shaped airborne operations for decades to come. Gavin's contributions extended far beyond WWII. In 1947, he incorporated the all-black 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion into the 82nd Airborne, making it the first integrated division in the U.S. Army. He also played a crucial role in shaping post-war military strategy, becoming one of the first senior officials to advocate a more agile and mobile fighting force. Gavin's forward-thinking approach to logistics and rapid deployment, particularly using helicopters, was instrumental in developing the modern air cavalry. The renaming of Fort Liberty to Fort Gavin would not only have paid homage to his exemplary military service but also served as a reminder of the kind of leadership and moral clarity that should define America's armed forces. Instead, the Pentagon chose to rename it Fort Roland L. Bragg, a name that has little connection to the installation's rich history but conveniently aligns with an illusion of attempting to restore the past. Before becoming secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth declared, regarding the initial renaming to Fort Liberty, ""We should change it back because legacy matters."" Yet, when given the opportunity to correct past mistakes, Hegseth failed to honor the man who best embodied the institution's legacy and ethos. The 82nd Airborne Division has prided itself on its legacy of excellence, resilience, and innovation. Naming the base after Gavin would have been the perfect way to honor those principles. Unfortunately, by disregarding Gavin's legacy, the current administration missed the chance to connect Fort Bragg's new identity to the soldiers who made it legendary. General James M. Gavin was the embodiment of airborne excellence, a leader who defined the very institution Fort Bragg has housed for decades. By failing to recognize his contributions, the current administration has once again squandered an opportunity to tie the past, present, and future of one of the military's most iconic bases to a leader who truly represented its values.

Trump needs to understand what evangelicals think about immigrants,"Like most evangelical Christians and the plurality of all Americans, I proudly voted for President Donald Trump in November. Washington needed to be shaken up by some commonsense, cost-cutting, old-fashioned conservative values, and Trump is following through on his Make America Great Again agenda. However, I'm concerned Trump may have misunderstood evangelical voters in some areas of immigration policy. I'm among the 90% of evangelical voters who believe our government must ensure secure national borders , according to a survey of evangelical voters conducted last month. But I'm also among the 70% of evangelical voters, including about two-thirds of fellow Trump-voting evangelicals, who believe the United States has a moral obligation to receive refugees -- individuals who enter the United States lawfully at the invitation of our government after proving overseas that they face a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons such as their Christian faith. Fully 86% of evangelicals believe legal immigration has been a good thing for the U.S., and Trump agrees. ""I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally,"" the president has said . While there may be wisdom in a temporary pause on refugee resettlement and other forms of legal immigration to ensure these programs are operating optimally and in the interests of Americans, I am confident this review will confirm that, as the Heritage Foundation reported , ""refugees undergo more vetting than any other immigrants to the U.S."" This review will also find that nearly 30,000 of the 100,000 refugees admitted last year were Christians from countries where religious persecution watchdog Open Doors said Christians face the most severe persecution. As many conservative evangelical leaders and Christians affirmed in a recent Christian Statement on Refugee Resettlement , ""sustaining legal opportunities for entry, particularly for those who have fled persecution, reduces the pressure on individuals to make their own way to the U.S.-Mexico border."" I also hope Trump ensures that our country keeps its commitment to refugees who have already been lawfully admitted into the U.S. and who our country has committed to providing with short-term housing for up to three months through faith-based organizations such as World Relief while they find work to cover their own rent. The remarkable ways that churches have stepped into the gap after the administration temporarily halted this support demonstrates just how strongly evangelical Christians feel about welcoming refugees. Our government should take note and follow through on its commitment to those who've already been resettled. Even as evangelicals celebrate rapid improvements to border security under Trump's leadership, we also want nuanced responses to those who may have come unlawfully many years or even decades ago. Precision with deportation efforts is especially important for those such as Ukrainians, Venezuelans, and Cubans who entered lawfully in recent years but whose temporary legal protections could be withdrawn, putting them at risk of inhumane deportations into humanitarian crises. A supermajority of evangelicals want the Trump administration to prioritize the deportation of those convicted of violent crimes, but less than one-fifth of evangelicals believe the same about those who were brought as children, are the parents or spouses of U.S citizens, or would be willing to pay a fine as restitution for unlawfully entering the country or overstaying a visa as their only offense. Indeed, more than three-quarters of evangelicals want Congress and the president to pursue legislation -- along the lines of the Dignity Act proposed in the last Congress by Rep. Maria Salazar (R-FL) -- that would simultaneously improve border security and allow immigrants in the country unlawfully to earn permanent legal status if they pay a fine as restitution and meet other appropriate requirements such as clearing a criminal background check. That's a better solution than pursuing indiscriminate deportations that catch not only the violent criminals who we all want to be removed but also hard-working, churchgoing Christians who are quietly providing for their families. The fear of such deportations is already having a chilling effect, depressing economic activity and frightening people from attending church. 'HUNDREDS' OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS STAND READY TO ARREST AND DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS If Trump believes his evangelical voting base wants secure borders, he is absolutely right. But if he also thinks that we want deportations of as many as 5 million parents of minor U.S. citizens would be deported, he's getting some bad guidance. If he thinks the Christian voters who propelled him to the White House again want him to suspend all refugee resettlement, the legal process by which our country welcomes persecuted Christians, he should reconsider. I pray Trump will heed the perspectives of evangelical voters such as me and secure our borders while celebrating the refugees and other immigrants eager to embrace the responsibilities of citizenship and help him restore this country to greatness.

Will Trump’s Justice Department restore public trust?,"President Donald Trump now has his full Justice Department team in place. But how will Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel pursue justice over the next four years? The first obvious opportunity is to follow through on Trump's promise to depoliticize the Justice Department. That should mean an end to warped DEI-related priority setting, an end to double standards in how Republicans and Democrats are treated by Justice Department investigations, an end to prejudicial government treatment of law-abiding people of faith, and a refocus on actions that bolster confidence in a bold but fair application of justice. With support from Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, there is reason to think that Bondi and Patel will succeed on many of these counts. Still, addressing DEI and ensuring propriety in investigations represent low-hanging fruit. The real test for Bondi and Patel will center on whether they can bring additional public safety, protect the nation from terrorist attacks and foreign spies, and bolster public faith in their most important department. Trump has made clear that a top priority will be reducing illegal drug flows across the U.S.-Mexico border. While the drug war cannot be won until the American shame of purchasing drugs that support vicious cartels becomes greater than the perceived pleasure of doing so, robust law enforcement action could drive up the price of drugs and impose greater consequences on their top-level purveyors. While the Drug Enforcement Agency will play the predominant role here, the FBI can leverage resources in its own bolstered counter-drugs effort. But Patel and Bondi will have to be bold in their appetite for ambition and risk if they want their efforts to have any significant effect. Working with the CIA, which Trump appears to have directed to engage in covert action against the Mexican cartels, Bondi and Patel could authorize the FBI and DEA to conduct more and riskier undercover operations. This is the best way to gain insight into the organization and operation of a cartel, and then dismantle it from the inside out. The problem? If undercover agents or confidential informants are caught, they will be tortured and executed. Courageous personnel and informants of the CIA and DEA have repeatedly found out as much. The Obama and Biden administrations had a low tolerance for risk in operations such as these. And while Bondi and Patel may want to alter that risk calculus, failure will risk their officers' lives and their own careers. There's another point to consider when it comes to bold action against the cartels. Namely, that dramatic operational successes also risk causing embarrassment and fury in the Mexican government. The ruling Morena party of President Claudia Sheinbaum has a close relationship with the powerful Sinaloa cartel, for example. When, in 2020, the United States arrested former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos on drug trafficking charges, Mexico threatened to suspend all cooperation with the U.S. unless it released him. Then, the first Trump administration blinked and released him. Will it do the same thing when a similar scenario inevitably occurs? Another challenge of great national importance will center on how the Justice Department tackles foreign espionage on U.S. soil. The political import and public concern attached to terrorism means that the FBI's counterterrorism efforts are almost certain to maintain their heavy resourcing provision. But it's not clear how Bondi and Patel aim to deal with foreign spies. The reality of FBI resourcing means that boosting resources from one investigative area means reducing resources in another. Eradicating DEI and headquarters bureaucracy positions might free up a few dozen agents to be reassigned to fieldwork, but this will only represent a drop in the ocean. The associated problem is that while deploying more agents into criminal investigations will help better confront gangs and other organized crime outfits, the ""spy catching"" counterintelligence mission remains a crucial one. China operates a vast apparatus of hundreds, if not thousands, of spies on U.S. soil at any one time. Its wide-ranging mission is to steal civilian and military technology, infiltrate government agencies and high-end research laboratories, and blackmail ethnic Chinese Americans into serving the Chinese Communist Party. Combined with China's rapacious cyberespionage campaign, these efforts cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost economic opportunity. This Chinese espionage also directly endangers the lives and mission success of the U.S. military personnel. After all, if China can learn how U.S. military technology works, it can either replicate that technology for its own military or undercut the U.S. military's utility in employing it. Put simply, pulling FBI agents from China counterintelligence work would be highly detrimental to national security. It's not just Chinese spies who pose a threat, however. Iranian spies working out of the United Nations Headquarters in New York will continue to gather targeting intelligence that could be used to carry out future attacks in the event of an American-Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, for example. The highly skilled Cuban intelligence service also poses a sustaining espionage threat. As do the intelligence services of some otherwise close allies such as France and Israel. All of these concerns must be monitored. Then there's Russia. While Russian intelligence operatives share China's interest in American technology and other secrets, they also work hard to penetrate U.S. political parties, think tanks, and other circles of perceived influence. With the U.S. and Russia set to restaff their respective embassies, a lot more Russian intelligence officers are set to arrive in Washington. This matters for various reasons, but few more so than in light of the highly compelling evidence to suggest that Russian spies have conducted highly aggressive radio-frequency and microwave-weapon attacks against U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. Like most of the intelligence community, the FBI has attempted to cover up Russia's culpability for these incidents. Will Patel fix this? Top line: Even if Trump somehow secures a semi-detente with Russia, Russian intelligence services will continue to operate with aggression on U.S. soil. They will do so because, like their forebears, they view the U.S. as their ""main enemy."" Bondi and Patel should also face scrutiny in how they approach public integrity concerns -- public corruption. Unfortunately, Bondi has given early indications that she does not consider public corruption to be a priority. Take the furor surrounding the Justice Department's decision to drop charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams. That decision has led numerous Justice Department prosecutors to resign in protest at what they assert is an unjust political favor to Adams in return for his support of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants. As Jason Willick notes , while it bungled the move to drop charges against Adams, the Trump Justice Department could have offered a more compelling legal argument for why the prosecution was misjudged. The problem is that the Justice Department appears disinterested in pursuing future public integrity investigations and prosecutions per se. As Justice Department chief of staff Chad Mizelle observed in an X thread last week, ""Additionally, the amount of resources it takes to bring a prosecution like this is incredible -- thousands and thousands of man hours. Those resources could better be used arresting violent criminals to keep New York safe or prosecuting gang and cartel members."" This may well be true in the case of Adams. But it is a weak and alarming argument to make in the context of public corruption generally. There are few more important American principles than the understanding that government officers, especially elected officials, should be held accountable for corruption. Public corruption often involves illicit payments in return for lucrative contracts or favors by government officials. Indeed, such corruption constitutes the deep state at its worst: public officials using the privilege bestowed on them by the people to enrich themselves or empower others contrary to the public interest. Heavily resourcing these investigations is thus crucial toward ensuring good government, improved public trust in government, and deterring corruption by others who might otherwise sense no risk and great prospective benefit in corruption. If Trump truly wants to ""drain the swamp,"" these investigations and ensuing prosecutions need more resources, not fewer. It will be equally important to bear close scrutiny as to whether the FBI and Justice Department make investigative or prosecutorial decisions on the basis of a person's perceived loyalty or disloyalty to the president. Any such activity will be anathema to good government and deserving of decisive congressional, judicial, and public riposte. US ATTORNEY FOR DC TARGETS FIRST AMENDMENT INSTEAD OF KILLER GANGS In short, Bondi and Patel have opportunities to go after criminals big and small who, for too long, have sensed impunity. The situation in many cities, not least Washington, where prolific offenders have too long been treated as a minor nuisance by prosecutors, and where politicians such as Brianne Nadeau ignore hardworking constituent victims of crime, is patently unacceptable. The Trump administration can earn bipartisan popular support by taking law and justice back to the honorable basics. But while Trump and his officers of state have legitimate grievances about the past four years, they will serve the people ill by weaponizing those grievances into their own politically motivated attacks on the imperative of equal and objective justice under the law.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T19:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3324320/will-trump-justice-department-restore-public-trust/
Trump’s most consequential national security meeting,"One month into President Donald Trump's term, many meetings could qualify for the distinction as the most consequential for national security . For starters, there was the meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which led the news cycle for weeks over the president's new Gaza proposal . The White House issued pages of promised joint initiatives after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to visit. Meanwhile, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the president's top advisers met with a Russian delegation for the first time since 2021 to discuss the possibility of peace with Ukraine. Yet, years from now, the meeting that may turn out to yield the greatest good for America's national security was a less-publicized roundtable on Jan. 31 in the Roosevelt Room, where the president gathered several governors, members of Congress, and leaders of education reform to push forward initiatives on school choice . Two days earlier, Trump issued a bold executive order commanding his lieutenants to redirect federal funding toward school choice programs. In short order, it will set in motion much-needed federal agency planning to support this work, but it also marks the beginning of a counteroffensive against the country's failing public education system, a crisis that is increasingly threatening national security. Public schools are crumbling under bureaucratic inertia, the teachers unions' death grip against reform, and deeply inefficient allocation of resources. At best, the Biden administration turned a blind eye to these failures. More often, it actively undermined educational advancement by supporting entrenched special interests over students and parents. Four years later, the results are in: Test scores for children plummeted , the achievement gap has widened , and students are ever more unprepared for the demands of the modern economy. Our K-12 education system is falling behind in the subjects core to our nation's economic and military strength. The latest Program for International Student Assessment rankings place the United States 31st in math, while China took the top spot. Meanwhile, China has doubled its Ph.D.s in STEM fields compared to the U.S., positioning itself to dominate the industries of the future, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and biotechnology. This did not happen overnight. It was the direct consequence of the Chinese Communist Party's investment policy and ""Made in China"" plan. While the most dire consequences of America's educational decline will be felt in the coming years, many of its effects are already upon us. The military is struggling to find recruits who meet basic math and literacy standards. U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department are reporting critical shortages in foreign language proficiency. The semiconductor industry, vital to national defense, faces a looming 300,000-engineer shortage by 2030, jeopardizing efforts to re-shore manufacturing as Congress intended when it passed the CHIPS and Science Act. Our educational deficiencies are quickly becoming a clear and present danger to our nation's geopolitical competitiveness. No single policy can remedy this crisis, but school choice is indispensable for reversing America's educational decline. The current system traps millions of students, particularly from the poorest families, in failing schools with no alternatives. By fostering competition, school choice forces schools to improve or lose students and their accompanying dollars. It breaks the monopoly of underperforming public schools, giving parents the power to select the best educational path for their children. These outcomes aren't speculative. Studies have overwhelmingly found significant gains in academic scores for states with stronger educational freedom. To put students first, the Trump administration should redouble efforts to expand school choice, prioritize STEM education, and modernize curricula to meet 21st-century demands. It should also push Congress to fund the remaining provisions of the CHIPS Act fully, investing in STEM workforce development from K-12 through higher education. We cannot afford to lose our students and top talent to bureaucratic red tape. REPUBLICANS EMBRACE TRUMP EDUCATION REFORMS AS DEMOCRATS PREPARE TO RESIST THEM Failure to act will have dire consequences. If current trends persist, China will surpass the U.S. in technological and economic power, weakening America's ability to lead on the world stage. The time for half measures is over. Policymakers at every level must follow the Trump administration's lead and put students, not teachers unions, first. ""Experts"" might not think a school choice roundtable was significant in the scope of history, but parents and the millions of children in failing school districts across the nation seeking to fulfill their dreams and aspirations might beg to differ -- our national security depends on it.

"Trump rides the vibes, for better or worse","After a flurry of activity -- the president's tariff threats and showdowns with Mexico and Canada, his expressions of interest in Greenland , the policy changes obtained by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's trips to Panama and El Salvador, the release of arrested Americans in Venezuela -- it seemed clear that the focus of Donald Trump's foreign policy would be the Western Hemisphere. And then, just a few days later, as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the first head of government to visit the White House, Trump announced that ""the United States will take over the Gaza Strip."" This is obviously in tension with Trump's and many Trump supporters' opposition to U.S. military actions and ""nation building"" in the Middle East, and while Greenland is arguably within the Western Hemisphere, Gaza clearly is not. Cleaning up and policing Gaza doesn't sound like a way for Americans to avoid endless wars and violence, as Trump says he wants. On the other hand, looking for outside-the-box solutions sometimes works. It had been gospel among Middle East specialists that Israel couldn't achieve diplomatic relations with Arab nations without sanctioning the establishment of a Palestinian state first. But the Abraham Accords that Trump negotiated between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and with Bahrain in 2020 did exactly that. As the Abraham Accords suggested, so Trump's proposal that the U.S. ""take over"" Gaza jogs the mind and, as Fox News's Brit Hume writes , moves people ""away from the endless pursuit of a 'two-state solution,' which has proved such a dead end."" Maybe in some better direction, though no one, including Trump, seems to have an idea of exactly what. In September 2016, the Pittsburgh-based reporter Salena Zito explained that while ""the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally."" To them, he signals the kind of ""make America great again"" change he seeks, even where his proposals, as on Gaza, seem ludicrous on their face. Almost 10 years later, economist Tyler Cowen advances a similar explanation. ""Trumpian policy,"" he argues , ""elevates cultural policy above all else."" The cultures of the foreign policy establishment, of great corporations, of public schools, of public health and scientific research -- none is in great shape. So whenever ""the policy or policy debate pushes culture in what you think is the right direction, just do it."" Assume that ""the cultural factors will, over some time horizon, surpass everything else in import."" Don't worry about other constraints, whether it's legal, whether it will persist. Much of it probably will. Democrats and journalists hope the courts will put the kibosh on Trump's initiatives. But at some point, this lawfare runs up against the first words of Article II of the Constitution : ""The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America."" His orders to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs have the backing of the large majority of people of all ethnicities and hues who oppose racial quotas and preferences -- and the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His termination of foreign aid programs that advance widely unpopular cultural stands, the hill Democrats are choosing to die on this week, are likely to stand as well. His threats to impose huge tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while economically ruinous if put into effect, prompted promises of increased border surveillance. His instant and massive retaliation against Colombia's refusal to accept deported immigrants resulted in immediate surrender there and a preemptive surrender by the Maduro government of Venezuela, whose legitimacy the United States and the European Parliament refuse to recognize . Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, confirmed by only a 51-50 Senate vote, is reporting that Army recruitment has had its ""best recruiting numbers "" in a dozen years in the two months since Trump was elected. A change in the culture resulting from Trump's abolition of DEI and Hegseth's emphasis on the "" warrior ethos ""? Not clear, but sort of looks like it. Whether Trump's tactics and unorthodox policy initiatives will produce his promised peace in Ukraine and deter China from attacking Taiwan is far from certain. Clearly, some of Trump's executive orders and policy directives are carefully vetted, while others -- the Gaza acquisition? -- are not. If one of his audacious bluffs gets called, the resulting damage could prove horrifying: Think seriously about the wreckage those 25% tariffs would have inflicted on auto supply chains. On foreign policy, matters of war and peace, damage could be orders of magnitude worse. After two weeks, Trump's job approval is hovering around 50% , higher than at any point in his first term, but still below that of all other incoming presidents since 1953. But the ""vibes,"" what John Maynard Keynes would have called ""animal spirits,"" of the nation seem to have shifted. The death of former President Jimmy Carter last December reminded us that some of his policies -- transportation deregulation and a defense buildup -- helped produce the accomplishment and morale boost of the 1980s. But in his ""malaise"" speech -- he never actually used the word -- he admitted that the nation's ""vibes"" were negative. They turned positive under his successor, Ronald Reagan, though he entered office with job approval not much above Trump's, with positive material consequences for America and the world. Could something like that happen again?",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T17:47:51+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3311520/trump-rides-the-vibes/
Another ‘debunked’ story Trump was right about,"CHARLEROI, Pennsylvania -- A western Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty in federal court to charges of harboring illegal immigrants for financial gain, acting U.S. Attorney Troy Rivetti announced Monday. Andy Ha, 28, of Belle Vernon, pleaded guilty to two counts before U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon. He was charged on Jan. 28, 2025 . This tiny Washington County borough, located on the banks of the Monongahela River, gained national attention ahead of last year's elections for two unrelated but very important reasons: the proposed closing of the Pyrex glass plant that has employed generations of residents here, and the influx of Haitian immigrants to a town struggling with resources. When then-candidate Donald Trump drew attention to the situation, the national press descended on the town immediately, pushing back on Trump's assertion that there were illegal immigrants in town. The New York Times wrote that the migrants had ""temporary authorization to live in the United States. "" It turns out, however, Trump wasn't as wrong as the national press narrative implied. That became crystal clear Monday after federal authorities finished their months-long investigation of Ha's temporary staffing agency called Prosperity Services Inc. The agency supplied immigrant workers to multiple companies in the region, including Fourth Street Foods, which makes prepared meals sold in national grocery store chains. David Barbe, the owner of Fourth Street Foods, said Prosperity Services was one of six different staffing agencies he has used and that he had no knowledge if any of the workers were illegal. ""Anybody that is working now here at the plant who works for any of the agencies has to be E-verified to have the legal right to work in the country,"" said Barbe in an interview with the Washington Examiner . Barbe said they currently employ a total of 700 immigrants from different 30 countries. In August 2024, federal investigators had already begun to build a case against Ha. Court records showed they had seized almost a million in cash from Prosperity Services. One of those seizures happened outside a building along state Route 88 where illegal immigrants received payments in cash. In October, Paul Van Osdol, an investigative reporter for the local ABC affiliate, reported the building where the workers picked up their cash was called ""Pay Now."" According to Rivetti, Ha's business paid for more than 25 workers who were not legally authorized to be in the United States to stay in a former hotel. And his business paid for vans to transport those workers to and from their work. The U.S. attorney's office said Ha provided Prosperity Services's tax return preparer with spreadsheets listing only workers who were legally authorized to work in the United States. That information, in turn, was reflected on the company's quarterly employment tax returns, representing less than 10% of the actual total number of workers employed by Prosperity Services. Ha then signed those returns, knowing them to be false and causing a tax loss of at least $3.1 million. ""The defendant broke the law by harboring and employing individuals not authorized to be in the United States,"" said Rivetti . ""In addition, defendant Ha cost the U.S. government millions of dollars through his failure to pay taxes related to his business. Our office and our law enforcement partners at all levels will continue to ensure that those who seek to profit from the employment of such workers, and who fail to pay taxes, face appropriate consequences under the law."" ""Business owners have a responsibility to file accurate quarterly employment tax returns and to timely remit withholding taxes for their employees to the Internal Revenue Service,"" said Yury Kruty, special agent in charge of the IRS-Criminal Investigation of the Philadelphia Field Office. ""The failure to do so is a serious offense."" ""This investigation highlights the commitment of HSI Pittsburgh to protecting our communities from those who seek to exploit undocumented workers for their personal gain,"" said Edward V. Owens, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations Philadelphia. ""Andy Ha and his business sought to profit off of the immigrant community. I commend the dedicated prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and our partners at the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation division and Pennsylvania State Police. Together, we will continue to work to ensure that such illegal activities are met with the full force of the law."" Charleroi is a beautiful little borough in the heart of the iconic Mon Valley. One hundred years ago it was the home of over 11,500 people, a robust business district that was known for its glass production, specifically Corning Glass which makes Pyrex products. Today, that population has sunk to 4,000 thanks almost exclusively to the decline in good manufacturing jobs since steel began declining in the Mon Valley over the past few decades. A town built on immigrants, it was the influx of Belgian migrants that founded this town in the 1880s, and it is now an influx of Haitian immigrants in the past five years that has kept the business district from declining. People here tend to rarely have a problem with legal immigrants. But they are deeply concerned with illegal migration that often exploits the most vulnerable. The other big news in this town is the uncertainty of what is going to happen to the iconic glass factory known for making Pyrex dishware. Its future has been uncertain for months, and losing Pyrex would be a deep economic blow, taking more than 300 jobs out of state to Ohio after more than a century of production in this town. Since last fall, Anchor Hocking, the parent company that owns the plant has announced and then delayed the plant closure several times. This has destabilized both the workers and the psyche of the community that has identified with glassmaking for almost all of its existence. The pain is hard to understand for those who have not identified with an industry and the camaraderie that has been developed through that identity. There are people who work at the plant whose entire families have worked there, often working shoulder-to-shoulder sons and daughters of someone their father or mother worked with. As for Ha, Judge Bissoon has scheduled sentencing for July 22, 2025. The law provides for a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gain from the offense or both on the tax charge and up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gain from the offense, or both on the harboring charge. The IRS-Criminal Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, and Pennsylvania State Police conducted the investigation that led to the prosecution of Ha.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T23:42:50+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3331671/another-debunked-story-trump-was-right-about/
The problem with the artificial womb,"""What if we changed one of the fundamental building blocks of life?"" That's the question posed in a new short animated video by TED-Ed, one of a five-part series about revolutionizing human life. The producers explain, ""This narrative follows the young library assistant Ada as she juggles two worlds: her daily mundane reality and the future she vividly imagines for all humanity. Traveling through her visions of potential futures, Ada grapples with the ethical and social implications of new technologies and how they could shape the world."" The fundamental building block Ada wants to eliminate in this video? Pregnancy . Ada participates in a thought experiment, considering if women would have more freedom or less if they weren't the ones physically giving birth. She begins by explaining why the artificial womb is appealing: because birth isn't. She says she's not sure she wants to have children , especially given how pregnancy is sold. ""I definitely don't want to be pregnant. If you listen to the way people casually describe pregnancy and birth! 'Oh, nothing out of the ordinary, just puked every day for months.' 'It was a routine delivery, just a standard tearing of the genitals,'"" she says. ""'With modern medicine, hardly anyone dies!' How is everyone just shrugging and just saying that's the way it is? Like, excuse me? Am I the only one who thinks that this activity is not suitable for civilians?"" Exasperated, she sighs, ""It's so unfair!"" As someone who has done it six times, I'm not going to sit here and sugarcoat pregnancy. I did, in fact, puke every day for months. I'm not a fan, and my dread about pregnancy did make me think long and hard about whether I felt like I could physically and emotionally handle it again before taking the plunge. It was much easier to make that decision the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth times, though, because, after my first, I realized that even though my pregnancies might not be easy, they were going to be worth it. I never realized before I had a child that for how not great pregnancy is, the child you get on the other end is going to make up for it. This is something deeply wrong with how we've depicted motherhood for young people: We're accentuating the negative and completely neglecting the positive. Women don't hear about how empowering birth can be or how transformative the entire experience is. It's a rite of passage, not one to be circumvented because of physical and emotional discomfort. However, just as we're not teaching women and girls that there's a profound upside to pregnancy, we're also not imbuing in them a sense of resilience or pride in resilience. ""Nothing that's worth having in life comes easy"" is not a message a generation who received participation trophies often heard. In the TED-Ed video featuring Ada, we also meet her grandmother, who reminds her she's not getting any younger and encourages her to make the decision to have children before her biological clock makes the decision for her. Ada takes this urging as a challenge to figure out how to outsmart and circumvent Mother Nature (have none of these people seen Jurassic Park ?) instead of just considering that maybe Grandma possesses some generational wisdom worth heeding. Unsurprisingly, the TED-Ed video then takes a turn in the direction of abortion, with Ada worrying that if artificial wombs are created, there won't be an excuse for women to abort babies any longer. The only thing more horrible than pregnancy to Ada is the idea that someone may view an unborn baby as deserving of life and give her the ability to survive outside of her mother's womb if her mother does not wish to carry her to term. Instead of seeing an artificial womb as a way to eliminate the supposed need for abortion, Ada is concerned that women will no longer be able to terminate the lives of their unborn children if artificial wombs are created as a viable alternative. The video series is a reminder of how far the Left is moving away from biological reality with every passing day. For all of its protestations that ""in this house we believe in science,"" there's no understanding or desire to learn about the critically important biological and emotional bonds that take place during pregnancy between mother and baby, not to mention fetal development. The future that TED-Ed's Ada imagines of artificial wombs is truly dystopian to its core, artificial in every way. Bethany Mandel ( @bethanyshondark ) is a homeschooling mother of six and a writer.

Elon Musk’s big warning on the AI ‘singularity’,"Elon Musk issued a warning Sunday on X when he posted, ""We are on the event horizon of the singularity."" The ""singularity,"" according to Musk, is the point at which artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. Musk, a co-founder of Neuralink, touted the advancements in his technology in his interview with President Donald Trump on Fox News. ""We've implanted Neuralink in three patients so far, who are quadriplegics, and it allows them to directly control their phone and computer just by using their minds,"" Musk said. ""The next step would be to add a second Neuralink implant past the point where the neurons are damaged so that somebody can walk again and they can have full-body functionality restored."" Still, Musk acknowledges the dangers of fully embracing AI. In a 2023 interview with Tucker Carlson, Musk warned about the dangers of AI exceeding human limits. ""It's very difficult to predict what will happen in that circumstance,"" Musk said. ""I think we should be cautious with AI and I think there should be some government oversight because it's a danger to the public."" Carlson questioned Musk on the likelihood of AI systems taking over from humans. ""It has the potential, however small one may regard that probability, but it is nontrivial,"" Musk said. ""It has the potential of civilizational destruction. Regulations are really only put into place after something terrible has happened. If that's the case for AI and we only put in regulations after something terrible has happened, it may be too late to actually put the regulations in place. The AI would be in control at that point."" It is interesting that Musk called for more regulations, especially since most of his work with the Department of Government Efficiency focuses on reducing the size of government. AI is a relatively new and unknown technology. It is possible that Musk merely wants to analyze the possible effects of powerful AI systems before fully embracing them. Musk's X post comes shortly after Vice President JD Vance praised the advancements in AI at the 2025 Artificial Intelligence Action Summit. In what appears to be a contrast to Musk's statement, Vance said, ""When conferences like this convene to discuss cutting-edge technology, oftentimes, I think, our response is to be too self-conscious, too risk-averse."" While it is good to encourage innovation, one must still be conscious of the risks posed by superhuman AI. AI is much more advanced than five years ago. The world will never go back to a pre-ChatGPT state, but it should take care when embracing brand-new and powerful technology that could exceed human capabilities.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-25T16:02:53+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3328455/elon-musk-warning-ai-singularity/
The idea of DOGE is at the root of American values,"The federal government is very good at creating acronyms. However, what the federal government is terrible at doing is accounting for the money it spends. Despite spending nearly $2 billion on government-spending watchdog alphabet agencies, such as the OIG, or Office of the Inspector General, and GAO, or the Government Accountability Office, it took President Donald Trump 's creation of an independent nonaligned auditor called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , to identify wasteful and possibly corrupt federal expenditures. It is headed by the technical and business genius Elon Musk . Democrats in Congress have become apoplectic at the idea that Trump has engaged the services of an independent person to conduct an audit of federal expenditures. The reasons for this have become quite obvious in recent days. Spending tax dollars is the engine that powers the Democratic Party's political machine. Anything that jeopardizes this engine jeopardizes their power. Not surprisingly, it took very little time for Musk to find billions of taxpayer dollars being spent extravagantly, frivolously, wastefully -- and, possibly, even corruptly. He informed Trump of this, and Trump ordered a freeze on spending. This drove House and Senate Democrats off a cliff. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led a group of Democratic politicians and a crowd of presumably government employees, whose livelihoods depend on government spending, in a protest. The demonstration quickly degenerated into calls by left-wing politicians for violent mob action. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) wanted the mob to ""get into the faces"" of Republicans. There were chants to shut down the Senate. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) called for Democrats to fight in the streets -- just like their ideological ancestors, the socialists and communists, did. And it happened about a week after a lunatic planned to murder congressional Republicans with Molotov cocktails. The battle lines are now clearly drawn. On one side is the radical Democratic Left. It represents those who lust for government power, the party whose very existence depends on increasing the size and scope of government and whose members depend on government largesse for their livelihood. They are the people who fly flags with the sickle and hammer. They are the people who riot and destroy everything from urban communities to college campuses. They support socialism and neo-Marxism, the tenets of which are critical race theory, transgender ideology, hatred of Western civilization and American culture, and antipathy toward religion. On the other side are the Republicans, who believe the government serves the people. They are the party that believes, as Founding Father James Madison did, that the interests of men must be connected with constitutional rights. They support the ideals that emphasize the notion that government is a reflection of human nature. As Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers , ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary."" The problem is that one ""must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."" The Republican Party represents Main Street, the Forgotten Person, social conservatism, fiscal responsibility, freedom from fear, freedom from poverty, freedom to worship, and freedom from war. It reveres the triumphs of Western civilization and American culture, accomplishments of human civilization that have improved the quality of life for all. Simply put, DOGE is the latest manifestation of one political party's efforts to prevent the other from using America's treasure to spread its toxic ideals while pursuing greater influence and power. The idea of DOGE is at the root of cherished American values. Madison would be happy.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-07T15:02:20+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3313825/doge-root-american-values/
Mexican cartels killed my sister. It’s time to call them all terrorist organizations,"In late October 2019, I spoke with my sister, Maria, affectionately called ""Rhonita"" by those who were close to her. Our conversation was full of love, gratitude, and reflections on the joys of motherhood and how blessed we were to be raising our children and navigating this chapter of life together. I cherish that conversation with her, and I had no idea it would be my last. Just days later, we received the devastating news : Rhonita's car, found about 70 miles south of the U.S.- Mexico border , had been riddled with bullets and set on fire. Her four children -- Howie, 12, Krystal, 10, and 8-month-old twins Titus and Tiana -- were in that car. We learned that they had been slaughtered by Mexican drug cartels . Since then, it has been my family's mission to do everything in our power to prevent others from experiencing the same pain and loss. The Mexican drug cartels are ruthless, evil organizations with no regard for human life. Rhonita and her children weren't just victims of senseless gunfire; they were burned alive . The cartels doused their car with gasoline and set it ablaze, leaving them to suffer an unimaginable horror in their final moments -- hearing, seeing, and feeling each other die in the flames. When President Donald Trump learned of this massacre, he boldly called for the recognition of Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Without that designation, it is almost impossible for families like mine to seek justice, to hold these evildoers accountable for their atrocities. We were so grateful to him for standing up and speaking out. However, after he left office, our fight for justice seemed to vanish from the national conversation. Trump's reelection gave us hope, especially after he made clear on his first day in office that he would direct Secretary of State Marco Rubio to designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Last week, the Trump administration gave eight cartels this designation. I'm so grateful Trump has taken this important first step to call these criminals into account. But the list does not include the cartel primarily responsible for the massacre of Rhonita and her children. The powerful Juarez cartel, and its armed wing La Linea, working closely in conjunction with the Sinaloa cartel, are directly responsible for the deaths of three beautiful mothers and six wonderful children whom I think about and fight for every day. My family now fears we may be left behind and forgotten again. As Trump acknowledged in the aftermath of the tragedy, the cartel massacre in 2019 was an act of terrorism. We ask you, President Trump, to please remember our family and designate the Juarez Cartel, and its armed wing La Linea, as foreign terrorist organizations. My family painstakingly collected what remained of Rhonita and her children, bones and ashes from the burned car, and carefully laid them out on white sheets in our home. Reconstructing their remains felt like a twisted jigsaw puzzle. It was a painful, agonizing act, but it was our only way of honoring them. This was not grotesque; it was an act of love in the face of unfathomable loss. It was our final chance to care for them, to show them the respect and love they so richly deserved. Even now, I am haunted by the images of my sister and her children, those remains, constantly reminding me of the life that was violently taken from them. But despite the pain, we knew our fight for justice was far from over. We will not stop. And so, today, I stand here again, pleading for action. This fight is not just about my family; it's about every American victimized by the cartels. RUBIO NAMES EIGHT LATIN CARTELS AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS We know Trump is serious about stopping cartel terrorism, and we are grateful for his efforts. For the State Department to fulfill the spirit of his executive order, it must be comprehensive and retroactive, so that families such as mine, and countless others, can finally seek justice and be compensated for the unimaginable suffering we've endured. President Trump, you are the only leader with the strength, courage, and vision to change the horrific reality that these cartels impose on innocent lives. You are the only one who can keep your promise to make America safe again, ensure that no family is left behind, and send the unequivocal message to the cartels that murdering Americans never has been, and never will be, tolerated. We know you can designate the Juarez Cartel and La Linea to the foreign terrorist organizations list. We need you in this fight, and we are forever grateful that you have made this cause yours.

Defunding the teacher trainers,"Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Education eliminated two major teacher-training programs: the $70 million -a-year Teacher Quality Partnerships program and the $80 million -a-year Supporting Effective Educator Development grants. This is terrific news, not just for the budgetary savings but because it strikes an emphatic blow at training that has promoted dubious dogmas and politicized classrooms. The move was met with predictable outrage in the nation's schools of education and the ranks of left-leaning education associations. But it was a welcome and overdue correction, one that deserves to be celebrated. The Department of Education noted that many of the teacher preparation and training programs featured social justice activism, a hyper-fixation on race, and recruiting strategies ""implicitly and explicitly based on race."" Grant proposals included programs that instruct teachers to address ""systemic forms of oppression and inequity"" and pressure trainees to use ""abolitionist pedagogies and issues of diversity in classroom management."" Putting an end to federal support for this stuff is a big deal. After all, it's a mistake to blame the nation's teachers for the toxic DEI and gender dogmas that took root in so many schools in recent years. In fact, while I've worked with educators for decades, I've known precious few elementary teachers eager to discuss gender or make children fill out privilege worksheets. In fact, even when diversity, equity, and inclusion were flying high in 2022, most teachers said they opposed teaching ""the idea of critical race theory."" In truth, much of the blame for the toxic agendas that have cropped up in schools should be reserved for the education professors, consultants, and bureaucrats who train (and bully) the nation's teachers. Unlike teachers, who actually live in their communities, know their students, and interact with parents, these academics and consultants run campus trainings or do fly-bys in which they promote their personal agendas and then scoot out of town with a paycheck. While teacher training has long been a subject of concern, a wave of Freedom of Information Act requests in recent years have shone a bright light on the problem. The Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia hired trainers from ""The Equity Collaborative"" to teach educators that ""independence,"" ""individual achievement,"" ""individual thinking,"" and ""self-expression"" are racist hallmarks of ""white individualism."" Trainers in Seattle taught teachers that we live in a ""race-based white-supremacist society,"" that schools commit ""spirit murder"" against black children, and that white teachers must ""bankrupt [their] privilege in acknowledgment of [their] thieved inheritance."" In Buffalo, New York, trainers designed a curriculum requiring schools to embrace ""Black Lives Matter principles."" Teachers were told to promote ""queer-affirming network[s] where heteronormative thinking no longer exists"" and ""the disruption of Western nuclear family dynamics."" Kindergarten teachers were directed to discuss ""racist police and state-sanctioned violence."" Trainers in Davis, California, taught teachers how to ""decolonize their language and deconstruct that which they've been taught about gender."" In Eau Claire, Wisconsin, teachers were told that ""parents are not entitled to know their kids' [gender] identities."" The trainers who deliver these sessions don't see the practical consequences for students and families. They treat students as abstractions and schools as laboratories. And educators, fearful of being labeled bigots or racists, have been bullied into playing along. It's good news that the Department of Education is going to stop underwriting a lot of this. State officials and local school boards would do well to follow suit. But this rapid-fire approach to eliminating teacher training programs raises questions. Is zeroing out these programs an excessive response? Isn't it more sensible to take a scalpel to the troubling stuff while protecting the useful training? Here's the thing: There's hardly any evidence that teacher training actually improves teaching. A massive 2014 meta-analysis by the federal Institute of Education Sciences, for instance, evaluated 643 studies of professional development in K-12 math instruction. Of those, only 32 even asked whether professional development caused student improvement, and just two found evidence of positive, reliable results. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHES INVESTIGATION INTO MAINE AFTER HEATED EXCHANGE WITH GOVERNOR Linda Darling-Hammond, former president of the American Education Research Association, has acknowledged that the ""training [educators] receive is episodic, myopic, and often meaningless."" As the Brookings Institution's Tom Loveless has politely put it , ""In a nutshell, the scientific basis for PD is extremely weak."" Instead of spending resources on useless training programs, schools should focus on making sure that teachers know the substance of what they're going to teach and then give them practical support at tasks such as curricular planning and classroom management. Meanwhile, the billions spent on teacher training could be put to better use. The funds could be targeted to provide big pay bumps for educators who do exceptional work, teach high-need subjects, or mentor young colleagues. Ultimately, defunding teacher training isn't much of a trade-off after all. Frederick M. Hess is director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-25T12:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/equality-not-elitism/3328504/defunding-teacher-trainers/
Connecticut thinks 12 years is enough for murder and cannibalism,"The lax attitude toward crime in blue states hasn't faded even as the country has shifted away from the crime-tolerant attitude of 2020 progressives. This means blue states are still putting residents at risk from dangerous people. Connecticut just released a man who killed someone with a hatchet and ate part of the victim's brain and an eyeball. That man, Tyree Smith, was found not guilty by reason of insanity due to schizophrenia and alcohol and drug disorders. In 2013, he was ordered to be confined for 60 years to the state's only maximum-security psychiatric hospital, which seems reasonable enough. Connecticut's Psychiatric Security Review Board has now granted Smith supervised release from the hospital, meaning Smith will be able to return to society just 12 years after he was sentenced for hacking a man to death and taking his body parts to a graveyard for a picnic. The review board had already let Smith spend the last nine months in a community facility. According to its 2023 report , he denied hearing voices, hallucinating, or having homicidal thoughts. According to the report, Smith ""denied experiencing cravings, but stated that if they were to arise, he would reach out to his hospital and community supports and providers."" Evidently, we have no choice but to trust the schizophrenic cannibal ax murderer when he claims he isn't craving human flesh anymore and that he will ""reach out"" if those cravings come back. ARLINGTON MOTHER WARNS 'LOOPHOLE' ALLOWED SEX OFFENDER IN WOMEN'S LOCKER ROOM In 2023, Connecticut legislators considered a bill that would remove the review board and criminal courts from the process of extending the stays for patients. In other words, Connecticut's concern has been that the Psychiatric Security Review Board is too tough when it comes to evaluating patients. Meanwhile, a murderous cannibal is deemed rehabilitated after 12 years. In fact, according to one psychiatrist, ""he is a joy"" and ""a really calming presence for other patients."" Smith likely won't be a calming presence for Connecticut residents as the state grants him more and more freedom. People's lives are worth more than 12 years in a psychiatric hospital, which is why he was sentenced to 60 years in the first place. But Connecticut is a Democratic haven, which means the soft-on-crime mindset of the Democratic Party is allowed to blossom unchecked, no matter how dangerous it is for residents of the state.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T19:02:31+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3328309/connecticut-release-tyree-smith-murder-cannibalism/
Could psychiatric institutions solve the mental health crisis?,"At a recent rally, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy stood on an Ohio gubernatorial platform that includes reopening mental institutions. Ramaswamy has said as much before, arguing as he campaigned for president in 2023 that the ""No. 1 psychiatric institution today"" is jail. He echoes the same sentiment now, that ""we are going to bring back the psychiatric institutions that were wrongfully shuttered."" We are also going to see pushback from the Left, but it will conveniently avoid the reality that the ideology has created: Impressions of American mental health are deeply distorted. That reality issues from a youth population condemned to perpetually online life. Young people's mental health has plummeted in the last 15 years, due in large part to social media activity. A combination of screen time, sleep deprivation, content exposure, and negative relational effects is one explanation from only a few likely factors. The boom of smartphone technology caught most parents unawares -- but now, as conservatives push to regulate the internet, left-leaning advocates obscure morality and dismiss parents. Social media and its counterparts contribute to the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and other behavioral disorders. Today, it keeps them more relatable than ever. Mental illness is as ubiquitous as researchers tell us, and knowledge of that fact is unavoidable for a young person who scrolls through the countless TikTok and Instagram posts voicing personal experience. The pattern makes for a crisis associated with paranoia, but not with the sense of imminence that should accompany it. Most mental illnesses are thus leveled to the noise of social media. Minor, more simply solved conditions are amplified, while debilitating, psychiatric ones -- such as would belong to the realm of the institution -- are reduced to the sphere of online sharing. When people actually come across them in people living on the streets, they do not know what to do: Onlookers either are numb to the spectacle or jarred by its severity. The more ""minor"" conditions certainly can be severe as well. Especially as they manifest themselves in young women, they are some of the worst. However severe, severity is the new normal. Part of that has to do with ubiquity, as explained, but much of it is intentional disillusionment. For years, the Left has turned on an effort to make no one feel bad for being different, even more to make no one know that they are wrong. Gender dysphoria is the premier example of our day. Terrible conditions are even further suppressed, until, again, they are level with normalcy. TRUMP WANTS TO DISMANTLE THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT. HERE'S HOW IT WOULD WORK Of course, this does not work. Societal unrest springs up in favor of the truth, whether or not its inhabitants aim for it. We see this happen most saliently with the epidemic of disintegrated homeless people , many of whom are severely mentally ill. They can, and should, find solace in the mental institution. Abuse and corruption warranted calls for their shutdown in the first place, but it is ""indefensible"" to claim that they cannot be corrected and used for good. The problem is that the path of reform is increasingly unimaginable to generations who know the institution only as a nonentity. Progressive politickers shout that mental institutions, nursing homes , and the like are mere travesty. They are the same group of people who advocate, with every fiber of their ideology, against the family .",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T14:44:58+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3330152/could-psychiatric-institutions-solve-the-mental-health-crisis/
Violent climate action is not free speech,"As the Trump administration pursues a mission to develop America's fossil fuel resources, people must unfortunately brace for the impending countermovements from environmental activists who increasingly deploy destructive tactics to gain attention and spread their message. While the Biden administration was largely friendly to environmental causes, it was not immune to disruptive and confrontational protests against its officials. Protesters chanting ""Petro Pete"" chased former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg offstage at a Maryland policy forum in 2023. Roughly 100 activists attempted to blockade former President Joe Biden's Department of Energy last December. Biden even found himself interrupted by a climate protester during a speech honoring the late Sen. John McCain. If this is how the environmental movement treats its friends, one can only imagine the lengths it will go against President Donald Trump, who has vowed to ""drill, baby, drill."" People should be concerned because environmental activists aren't just protesting. They are vandalizing works of art and culture. In the past year alone, they have put adhesive stickers on a Monet painting, thrown tomato soup on the works of Van Gogh and the Mona Lisa , and sprayed orange paint on Stonehenge. Protesters are also actively interfering with commerce, upending the lives of ordinary citizens. Last May, climate activists glued themselves to the runway of a busy German airport, leading to flight cancellations and delays. In April, protesters blocked traffic during rush hour in Boston, a tactic they had previously employed over multiple days in Washington, D.C., provoking angry responses from commuters unable to get to work. If the day-to-day concerns of the working class don't resonate with these environmental protesters, perhaps it's because so few of them come from it. A recent Brookings Institution paper found that the most radical flank of environmentalists are overwhelmingly white (93%), middle-aged (average age of 52), and highly educated, with 91% having completed college and one-third having an advanced degree. These highly educated, what they would deem ""privileged,"" groups care far more about the opinions of wealthy progressive groups such as the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace, which keeps a global tracker of climate protests and their outcomes. They are also cheered on by bureaucrats at the United Nations, who issued a report calling for countries to listen to these disruptive protesters rather than enforce the multiple laws they are breaking. This is just one of many issues the United Nations gets wrong. When environmental protesters break the law, they should be prosecuted just like any other people. To do otherwise sends a dangerous message that their cause puts them above the law. An impending court case in North Dakota could help deliver that message. In 2016, Greenpeace helped organize and sustain ""protests"" against a lawful pipeline project in the state. The Greenpeace-backed protesters destroyed property, set fires, and engaged in violent riots. The broader movement also targeted banks and financial institutions thought to be financing the project. In one case, a Denver bank had its windows smashed and was graffitied with anti-pipeline rhetoric. Ultimately, after protests turned violent, six banks pulled their financing for the project. While the pipeline was ultimately built, a University of Colorado study found that the environmental terrorism campaign cost the energy company and its partners constructing the pipeline an estimated $7.5 billion. The company is now suing Greenpeace, alleging the group helped organize and fund the costly and damaging demonstrations. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech and protest, but it does not give organizations or individuals the right to engage in violence and destruction. When laws are broken and property is destroyed, there must be consequences. ""Climate action"" is not a defense to illegal action. As the Trump administration delivers on its energy development promises, outraged radical environmental activists deserve to have their say. But while protecting their rights, the justice system must also protect the rights of the rest of society by holding accountable any activists, as well as their Big Green backers, who go beyond vitriol and engage in vandalism and violence to bully those with whom they disagree. The decisions made in the North Dakota case will set the tone for whether, in the future, activist groups are permitted to fund and perpetuate crimes when their arguments fail to persuade the majority.

Racial lawlessness and Ronald Reagan National Airport,"The tragic aircraft collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29 was personally devastating. Not because I knew any of the 67 souls lost that night or the first responders but because of the senselessness of it and the painful conclusion that it was predictable and preventable. I believe that because of efforts I undertook nearly 10 years earlier. In early 2015, former Fox Business reporter Adam Shapiro uncovered, in a three-part expose , former President Barack Obama's plan "" to transform the Federal Aviation Administration into a more diverse and inclusive workplace that reflects, understands, and relates to the diverse customers we serve ,"" by selecting air traffic controllers based on race. I was horrified, not only because of my concern for the safety of 2.9 million passengers aboard 45,000 daily flights across some 29 million square miles of airspace but also because, 20 years earlier, my Colorado client prevailed before the Supreme Court in a landmark ruling that barred the federal government from making race-based decisions. Using Shapiro's articles, which named brave, whistleblowing, and passed-over would-be ATCs, I reached out to disappointed young Americans, many seeking to fulfill a life-long dream. In the process, I encountered an Arizona lawyer, a former ATC, who was doing the same. Over a lengthy meal in Phoenix, Michael Pearson briefed me on the workings of the FAA, the calamity that was Obama's plan to racialize one of the country's most demanding jobs, and the likely catastrophe if an unqualified diversity hire got through 12-16 weeks of training and manned a microphone in a busy control tower. We decided to team up, represent clients discriminated against by the FAA, and file a federal lawsuit. Our client was Andrew Brigida, who was born and raised in Mahopac, New York. Later, his family moved to Arizona, where he attended Arizona State University. He enrolled as an ATC major. In May 2013, he earned two aviation-related Bachelor of Science degrees and took the demanding, eight-hour computer-based Air Traffic Selection and Training exam. He scored 100%. ASU sent his name to the FAA with a recommendation that he be hired. Thanks to Obama's diversity program, Brigida and 2,000 to 3,000 other highly qualified applicants were rejected. On Dec. 30, 2015, I appeared with Brigida on After the Bell , hosted by David Asman on Fox Business , to announce the filing of our lawsuit in federal district court in Arizona. To my knowledge, our Fox Business appearance was the filing's only national news. The next week, my op-ed on it appeared in the New York Post . In August 2016, after Congress failed to kill Obama's plan, I wrote of the matter for Fox News . After that, other than an appearance by Pearson on Tucker Carlson, news of what Obama was doing to the FAA, the repercussions for traveling Americans, and the response of those whose civil rights were violated disappeared. Meanwhile, the lawsuit continued through the federal courts. Dismissed in an Arizona federal district court, it was reinstated in the District of Columbia, where it survived efforts by deep state attorneys to have it dismissed as it progressed through lengthy discovery and motions practice. On Feb. 1, 2022, long after I withdrew as Brigida's counsel and joined the Trump administration, Pearson and his co-counsels prevailed. The district court certified Brigida's lawsuit for class action status for as many as 1,000 "" non-African American[s] "" rejected by the FAA. All this passed unnoticed by the national media. That changed on Jan. 30. President Donald Trump was courageously the first to mention what was on the minds of those who knew about Obama's plan and the lawsuit: DEI . After opening with a moment of silence and prayer for those lost and noting, ""It's all under investigation,"" Trump said, in response to a question about his reasoning, ""I have common sense."" Days later, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed him . WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE SUIT AGAINST THE FAA'S DEI POLICIES Although the investigation continues, knowledgeable observers believe a decade-plus of the FAA lowering hiring standards, easing testing requirements, and overlooking unsatisfactory performance in pursuit of ""a more diverse and inclusive workplace"" has cost the nation dearly. Whether it contributed to the DCA crash is unknown, but the dangers posed and the risks raised by recruiting, hiring, and retaining people unqualified to be ATCs are too great to continue.

Trump endangers American interests with Gaza ownership plan,"President Donald Trump stated his interest in seeing the United States take ownership of the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. At a White House press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump argued that American ownership of Gaza would lead to the Palestinian territory being transformed from a Hamas-dominated dystopia to a place of prosperity and peace. Asked whether he would order U.S. military forces to secure Gaza, Trump responded, ""We'll do what's necessary."" The president added that he wanted the U.S. to take a ""long-term ownership"" interest in Gaza that would see both Palestinians and the ""people of the world"" living there. Trump reemphasized his plan for most of the Palestinians now living in Gaza to be relocated to neighboring countries. Trump's aspirations for a durable Israeli-Palestinian peace are moral. But his policy as presented is one of self-immolation. It is plainly at odds with U.S. security interests. Contrary to the president's claims, the forcible relocation of Palestinians out of Gaza and/or the American abandonment of Palestinian interests in any sense of statehood is a nonstarter for U.S. regional allies. It would lead to a breach in U.S. relations with key security partner Jordan and greatly undermine U.S. relations with the Sunni Arab monarchies. Moreover, a move to assert U.S. ownership over Gaza would make the U.S. a direct party to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It would catalyze organized jihadist recruitment, mobilization, and action against U.S. interests. It would also greatly encourage increased jihadist terrorism against the U.S. by so-called lone wolf attackers and other ""inspired"" small group actors. This is not a debatable point. Their many disagreements and hatreds with and toward one another notwithstanding, a unifying raison d'etre of the leaders of Salafi-Jihadist, Shia-Khomeneist, and most other preeminent Islamic extremist terrorist movements is the subversion of secular democratic individualism with Islamic law. They despise America as the world's foremost democracy. Still, the primary ground-level cause for jihadist recruitment against America is rooted in two other factors: first, the perception of unjust American military occupations in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and second, the perception of unjust American military and political support for Israel. To be sure, these perceptions are not cause for American foreign policy changes to placate jihadists. Israel has a right to exist, and America should support the defense of the Middle East's only true democracy. And as the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, 2023, so plainly illustrated, to yield to these terrorists is to invite atrocities against innocents. But alongside Trump's simultaneous suggestion on Tuesday that the U.S. will soon recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entirety of the West Bank, it is clear that the president is adopting a far more antagonistic stance against even the most moderate Palestinian and Arab allied political agendas. In turn, Trump's suggestion of taking ownership of land that does not, in any historic or politically legitimate sense, belong to America is a grand gift for jihadist propaganda. If effected in any sense, it will inspire violence and antipathy by Muslims against America, and it will cost a large number of American military and civilian lives. Again, Trump is basically talking about replacing the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza with the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. This is not a recipe for prosperity and peace, it is a recipe for brutal, prolonged urban warfare -- oh, and in an environment unlike that in cities in 2003-2011 Iraq, where there was at least some resident support for U.S. efforts to counter terrorists. Trump's Gaza deployment would make the ill-fated early 1980s U.S. military deployment to Lebanon look like a cakewalk in comparison. The better course for Trump is to endorse Israeli efforts to exert pressure on Hamas, secure remaining Israeli hostages, and secure regional buy-in for a post-Hamas governing structure in Gaza -- a structure that matches Israeli security needs to the longer-term interest of a Palestinian territory defined by growing prosperity and hope rather than one defined by corruption and fanatical despair. But pitting the U.S. as an occupying force against Palestinian identity and global Muslim sentiment is not in America's favor, nor, in any sense, is it compatible with Trump's oft-stated interest in avoiding ""stupid wars.""",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T01:12:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310965/trump-endangers-american-interests-gaza-ownership-plan/
Can Jeff Bezos save the Hindenburg?,"Jeff Bezos , the billionaire Amazon founder and owner of the Washington Post , made waves this week when he announced the paper's editorial page will be taking a new direction. ""We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,"" Bezos said in a note sent to staff on Wednesday. ""We'll cover other topics too, of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others."" Like most legacy media outlets, the Washington Post had devolved into a hard-left propaganda pamphlet in service of the Democratic Party long before Bezos bought the company in 2013. Time and time again, the Washington Post covered itself in shame with its wildly one-sided coverage of both foreign and domestic issues. The paper's left-wing audience became so accustomed to the lies and propaganda that 200,000 Democrats canceled their Washington Post subscriptions after Bezos made the decision not to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. David Shipley, former Washington Post opinion editor, resigned upon hearing the news that his boss likes capitalism, and it is likely that many of the paper's opinion writers will follow suit. ""I am of America and for America, and proud to be so,"" Bezos posted on X. ""Our country did not get here by being typical. And a big part of America's success has been freedom in the economic realm and everywhere else. Freedom is ethical -- it minimizes coercion -- and practical -- it drives creativity, invention, and prosperity."" Obviously, the decision to remove the vitriolic hatred of half of the American people from the Washington Post's opinion page is a positive development, but it might be too little, too late. Conservatives wisely ignore the Washington Post. The paper spent the better part of the last decade breathlessly attempting to destroy President Donald Trump and obstruct anything and everything Republicans aimed to accomplish in Washington. In recent years, the Washington Post promoted every anti-Trump conspiracy theory while protecting Democrats from scrutiny, and it even eulogized the dead terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, calling the former ISIS head an ""austere religious scholar."" Right-wingers are unlikely to respect anything that comes from the Washington Post unless the paper spends the next several years painstakingly attempting to regain its credibility. And its left-wing audience has been trained, by corporate media outlets such as the Washington Post itself, to oppose free markets and individual liberty at all costs. WASHINGTON POST OP-ED EDITOR EXITS AS JEFF BEZOS UNVEILS 'FREE MARKET' FOCUS Most journalists and opinion writers won't want to write in favor of freedom and individual liberty since the vast majority of them despise the nation's founding principles. And if the reaction to the 2024 presidential election by both journalists and Democratic Party bosses is any indication, leftists are not yet ready to examine their priors and begin absorbing reasonable news coverage. The decision by Bezos is admirable and should be celebrated, but with little to no right-wing audience, and a mission that sounds like nails on a chalkboard to the Left, it is hard to envision a scenario where the Washington Post returns to its former glory, in reputation or fiscal viability. Bezos built Amazon, one of the most influential and groundbreaking companies in generations, from the ground up, and if he wants to play a major role in the news business, a wiser investment would be to build something new and leave the Washington Post in the dustbin of history where it belongs.

Democrats against democracy,"Democrats are anything but democratic. In the past, their idea of governance was overreach and abuse of power carried through unelected bureaucrats, intimidation attempts by radicalized mobs disguised as protesters, and a weaponized judicial system, especially rogue judges, to impose their will on the public. As a famous quote often attributed to Mark Twain goes, ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."" Once again, the Democratic Party, when thwarted at the ballot box, has turned to judges to impose its will on the public. As many as 10 federal judges have recently ruled against President Donald Trump 's proposed budget cuts, spending freezes, transgender policies, and push to end birthright citizenship , as well as access to data by Trump-appointed auditors trying to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. This usurpation of the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government by the judicial branch, ideologically aligned with Democrats, should be considered dangerous, regardless of one's political affiliation. It is an abuse of authority that the Founding Fathers recognized as a threat to the republic. Ironically, it was Elbridge Gerry -- after whom the word ""gerrymandering"" was created and who was a Massachusetts delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 -- who warned about judicial imposition. He voiced his concern about the ""sophistry of the judges."" Authors of the Federalist Papers echoed similar sentiments in their writings. The ideas and words of those from the 18th century are applicable in 2025. For example, in Federalist 78 , Alexander Hamilton cautioned that judges might exercise their will instead of their judgment in interpreting laws. He also stressed the importance of judges remaining impartial, noting that the ""independent spirit in the judges"" was paramount to ""a faithful performance of so arduous a duty."" Furthermore, consider Federalist 81 , in which Hamilton discussed the fears and concerns over judicial activism. Hamilton warned that if judges prioritized passion and politics over the law and construed it, then this would enable the judiciary to develop its own rules. ""The power of construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will enable that court to mold them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body,"" Hamilton argued . Hamilton's words proved prescient. Activist courts have become more frequent as judges at the state and federal levels expropriate power assigned to the other two branches of government. Federal judges attempted to usurp executive branch authority in terrorist detainee cases during the Bush administration. They did so again during the first Trump administration when judges opposed Trump's lawful orders to restrict people coming to the United States from nations where terrorists are active. In each case, judges interceded in nonjusticiable affairs, as was predicted in Federalist 78. Yet, this abuse can be traced back even further. One egregious example was during the last years of the Reagan administration. For example, in 1987, District Judge Russell Clark, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, ordered a 150% increase in property taxes and a 1.5% income tax to fund a desegregation plan for schools in Kansas City, Missouri. Clark decreed that Missouri was to pay the balance. Since when did the Constitution authorize a judge to order a tax increase? In other instances, judges have overreached their authority in the criminal justice system, issuing rulings related to incarcerated prisoners. For example, in some cities, such activist judges ordered criminals to be released from confinement for no reason other than jails and prisons were, in their opinion, ""overcrowded."" Still, other judges have reversed referenda. Judge Thelton Henderson issued an injunction against California's Proposition 209, which was aimed at dismantling state affirmative-action programs based on sex or race. Californians voted on Proposition 209 in 1996. However, Henderson, also a Carter appointee, thought his opinions were superior to those of the electorate. A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel subsequently overturned Henderson's ruling. In his majority opinion, Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote, ""A system which permits one judge to block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted to enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy."" O'Scannlain's sentiments exemplify how the judicial branch should work. He provided an honest and intelligent explanation to which all judges should adhere. Unfortunately, they don't. If the country allows rogue, activist judges to continue their abuse of power and judicial overreach without any accountability, then we will no longer be a constitutional republic but instead a judiciocracy. It would behoove people of all political parties and ideologies to reject such advances. Moreover, people all along the ideological continuum must remember that the government is ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" -- and not ruled by judges.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T15:24:37+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317675/democrats-activist-judges-against-democracy/
Trump should help save the SS United States,"In its heyday, the SS United States was a glorious ocean liner, a modern marvel of the world, and a prodigious example of U.S. shipbuilding and manufacturing at a time when U.S. manufacturing was arguably at its zenith. It was built during the Cold War in 1951 and is the country's largest ocean liner ever constructed, a behemoth that is 100 feet larger than the Titanic. It set a record for the fastest ocean liner ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean during its maiden voyage in 1952, which still stands today. It is a cherished piece of American innovation and history and a stunning example of engineering ingenuity. However, now, the SS United States needs the help of President Donald Trump. Otherwise, its fate awaits a final resting place at the bottom of the Gulf of America, formerly the Gulf of Mexico, as an artificial reef. However, if Trump has shown anything over his political career, it is his ability to turn the seemingly impossible into a reality. Since 1996, the ship has been largely forgotten, docked at a pier in south Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In August, a judge ruled it could no longer stay there and gave the deadline of Sept. 12 to find it a new home. In October 2024, Okaloosa County, Florida, purchased the vessel for $10 million, with plans to turn the iconic ocean liner into an artificial reef . The ship was supposed to be transferred several times from Philadelphia to Florida before a stop in Alabama, but there have been multiple delays. It's almost as if divine intervention is preventing the ship from meeting its fate. Now, there needs to be a presidential intervention. Trump would have to act fast, as the ship's voyage to its final destination has been delayed yet again, with the departure date now scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 19 . Admittedly, it could be too little, too late, but through the Antiquities Act of 1906, Trump would seemingly have the authority to declare the SS United States a protected historical landmark. The Antiquities Act typically focuses on designations on federal lands. However, ships have been designated as national historic landmarks in years past, including the USS Olympia , a ship from the Spanish-American War, located just a few miles from where the SS United States is currently docked in Philadelphia. The National Historic Preservation Act permanently established this ship's historical importance. Trump should use that as a precedent to give the SS United States the same designation. And, if neither of the aforementioned acts is sufficient legislation to save the vessel, something should still be done to preserve it. If there is a way for Trump or any U.S. legislator to save the legendary ocean liner, it should be done. Furthermore, Trump has shown a great fondness and appreciation for U.S. history. He has regularly stressed the importance of defending the country's history and the significance of the nation's historical artifacts, landmarks, and monuments. In 2020, he created a task force to build a National Garden of American Heroes . Although an ocean liner, the construction of the SS United States was heroic. It is an example of the American mind and the brilliance of engineering. It's a first-of-its-kind ocean liner that wowed the world with its size and speed. The nautical icon should be recognized for its historical importance and legacy.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-18T03:46:50+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3322085/trump-should-help-save-ss-united-states/
National anthem enthusiasm and the speed of wokeness,"Even if most people had not heard of the 4 Nations hockey tournament that concluded this week, they were thrilled by the national anthem faceoff that accompanied the matches. Part of this was catharsis: For a while, one would be hard pressed to find a crowd singing along in full to the U.S. National Anthem five years ago. Such a move was socially unacceptable. Kneeling, too, was a prominent reaction. After all, 2020 was not all that long ago: With real patriotism on the rise, it feels like a different world. Five years prior, the country's most prominent concerns were Black Lives Matter riots and efforts to impeach President Donald Trump. COVID-19, of course, colored every impression of everything, and usual left-wing sexuality interests dominated the societal landscape. Democrats moved dizzyingly fast into all this, and now, we can be a little bit grateful for it. Sure, gay and transgender items have been in steady incline over many decades. But the LGBT movement is distinct from its actual effects, in that each advance has confused society's relationship with the concept more and more. ""Marriage"" rights once catapulted from non-existent to undeniable. The year 2016 is when most people can remember the beginning of transgender advocacy, at which point in-group and out-group dynamics placed instant pressure on conformists. It has only become crazier, as we well know in the present. The transformation was quick, but its quickness was able to stay somewhat under the surface. Not so with racial matters: It erupted, literally, with George Floyd's death in May of 2020 after building since Trayvon Martin's death in 2012. The violence was one aspect of the riots, and deep shame followed. White liberals reacted instantly with shows of anti-racist intent, almost as instantly as black liberals called out the perceived injustice. We are in the process of undoing a left-wing normal these days. It highlights just how recent were the events of 2020, how ever-changing it all is -- and much of that has to do with how open to transformation the Left was in the first place. CANADA WASN'T READY FOR TRUMP Of course, the same applies to the Right: We are snapping back, currently on an election high. That is just how political reactions work. Yet for some reason, Democrats are clinging to what helped them lose. As former Vice President Kamala Harris polls best among Democratic frontrunners for the next election, it seems that her party of progress wants no leftward slow-down. Such speed landed them in a disaster most recently, and conservatives can be glad it all went by pretty quickly. Hopefully, the same result will occur, and keep occurring, until it is safe to calm things down.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-21T23:21:36+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3326513/national-anthem-enthusiasm-and-the-speed-of-wokeness/
Trump’s health inflation blunder on IVF,"President Donald Trump promised to lower costs and make it easier for young Americans to start families. However, the in vitro fertilization executive order he signed this week will not accomplish either of those things, and it will also inflame complex ethical matters and divide public opinion. Trump's order, "" Expanding Access to In Vitro Fertilization ,"" and an accompanying Fact Sheet helpfully stress ""the importance of family formation"" and the need for public policy to ""make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children."" These are important goals that Trump is already furthering through other policy priorities, such as reducing illegal immigration, reforming permitting, and extending the child tax credit. The Fact Sheet goes on to note correctly that ""the general U.S. fertility rate is at another historic low,"" which is a public policy matter that normally does not get enough attention from party leaders. Unfortunately, Trump seems to believe that expanding ""access"" to IVF procedures will solve the problem. However, ""access"" is the same weasel word the Democratic Party used to dupe the public on Obamacare's health insurance mandates. What expanding healthcare ""access"" means in practice is that millions of people are forced to pay premiums for what they don't need or want. Health insurance mandates are why insurance costs spiked for millions of people after Obamacare's regulations became law. If Trump mandates private health insurance plans to cover IVF, premiums will spike again, and it will be his fault. The executive order does mention ""easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens"" on the IVF industry, but America's current IVF industry is the least regulated in the world. Not only are IVF customers allowed to create and destroy human embryos for purely aesthetic or any other reason, but the standard of care for storing and handling human embryos in the United States is extremely lax compared to other countries. If anything, the IVF industry needs more federal regulation, not less. To the extent that fertility is declining, and it is, IVF is not the answer. Japan has one of the world's highest rates of IVF use, far higher than the U.S., and yet its fertility is below ours and also falling faster. The answer to falling fertility is to make it easier for young adults to get married and stay married. The fall in birth rates is entirely caused by a decline and delay in marriage. Married couples have more children than single women do, and couples who get married earlier in life have more babies than couples who marry later. Contrary to what Democrats claim, it would not take a return to the 1950s for America to reverse its native population decline. All that's needed is to return to the average marriage rates and the average age of the 1990s, and our native population will grow again. In 1990, 56% of all households included a married couple compared to 46% today, while the average age at first marriage for women was 24 years old in 1990 compared to 28 years old today (in both decades, the average man was two years older than his bride in a first marriage). Trump is already pursuing policies that make it easier for young people to get and stay married. Marriage has declined most among low-income men. Raising wages by decreasing the number of illegal immigrants willing to work for less money will make it easier for low-income women to find suitable husbands. High housing prices have also been a marriage killer. Cities with high housing costs have lower marriage rates and smaller families than cities with low housing costs. Reforming federal permitting will make it easier and cheaper for developers to build homes, thus making it easier for young families to buy their first homes and start a family. TRUMP IS MAKING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS GREAT AGAIN If Trump really wants to boost fertility by raising the marriage rate, he could also eliminate the many marriage penalties in the federal government's social safety net. Virtually every means-tested federal government program, from the Earned Income Tax Credit to Food Stamps to Medicaid, punishes poor women who want to marry the father of their children. Over a trillion dollars is spent by state and federal governments on programs that punish marriage. Before we subsidize the IVF industry, we should eliminate these marriage penalties. Infertility is painful. However, there are other ways to form a family. There are hundreds of thousands of foster children waiting for loving homes. If someone prefers to pursue IVF, they are free to do so. However, taxpayers and everyone now paying healthcare premiums should not be forced to cover the extra costs. Trump should be doing everything he can to lower costs. IVF insurance mandates would do the opposite.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-23T05:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3326236/trump-health-inflation-blunder-ivf/
Universities need more change than neutrality,"Institutional neutrality policies, such as those adopted by Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania , are good steps for hyperpoliticized universities . They also could prove entirely inconsequential. Each school has published a statement of its own explaining the policy and what it aims to accomplish. Universities taking official positions on sociopolitical events has become commonplace and even expected occurrences. The neutrality policy declares these schools will now refrain from doing so, in an effort instead to support the ""creativity and academic freedom"" of students and faculty, UPenn officials wrote. They still will issue statements on matters that directly affect the university. The conflict between Israel and Palestinians, for example, no matter how imminent college protesters' theatrics want to make it appear, does not have any bearing on university functions. It is likely that these student demands were a primary catalyst for the schools' final movements toward neutrality. The rest of the policy's reasoning is that an institution cannot possibly represent the views of the diverse communities found on a college campus and that it will enhance future expression of free speech. Members will engage in debate without the burdens of political bias and self-censorship. These are benefits we can all hope eventually will take effect on campuses. As it is, though, the policy will change little of the substance that comes from these universities. Universities house mostly left-wing professors. A certain flavor of messaging and education comes out of these institutions as a result and becomes what is effectively the official position of a given school. Unless they hire more conservative professors, universities will strike no neutrality in their politics. Unfortunately, that sounds a lot like diversity hiring, but discrimination is the name of the game for liberal institutions that strive for balanced representation. Aside from that, encountering professors of varying political persuasions opens up a world of study for students. It only deepens their academic interests, provided professors are committed to a similar level of neutrality in the classroom. For their part, conservative professors have been practicing careful neutrality for years. The learning curve of this policy rests on liberal faculty. Without action that intentionally changes the university environment, high-up institutional policies will end up as passive maintenance for the leftism that already controls the school. Neutrality is a good hope, but it wants pairing with substantive measures.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T15:11:14+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3154264/universities-need-more-change-than-neutrality/
Europe can’t yet handle the truth,"Sometimes a friend needs to hear the truth, even or perhaps especially if it hurts. Europe is a case in point. Vice President JD Vance delivered the painful truth at the Munich Security Conference, and the fact that it made his German hosts literally cry underscores both the veracity of his message and the state of denial to which our trans-Atlantic friends have sunk. ""This conference started as a trans-Atlantic conference,"" Chairman Christoph Heusgen said at the event's closing. ""After the speech of Vice President Vance on Friday, we have to fear that our common value base is not that common anymore."" He then burst into tears. What did Vance say to make Heusgen weep? He said plainly that European nations should allow their citizens to speak freely, even on contentious issues such as abortion and mass migration, and that they should honor the outcome of free and fair elections. For Europe's governing class, such a vigorous defense of democratic values was shocking. Before becoming the Munich Security Conference chairman in 2022, Heusgen served as Germany's ambassador to the United Nations, at which he infamously laughed at President Donald Trump's suggestion that Germany's national security has been compromised by its dependence on Russian energy. Trump has since been completely vindicated by Germany's economic weakness after Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Before that, Heusgen served as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's undersecretary for foreign and security policy, overseeing Merkel's disastrous open-border migrant policies. He is the epitome of an arrogant European oligarch whose naive energy and immigration policies weaken and divide Europe's great powers. When Vance said, ""The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,"" Heusgen was the type of leader the vice president was talking about. After detailing how the governments of Romania, Sweden, Britain, Scotland, and even the United States suppress speech they disagree with, Vance warned, ""What no democracy, American, German, or European, will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered."" Unfortunately, Vance's message is needed here at home as much as across the Atlantic Ocean. On Face the Nation on Feb. 16, host Margaret Brennan attacked Vance's defense of free speech, claiming, ""he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide."" It is difficult to imagine a more ignorant statement or one that better elucidates the threat that the cadres of such people as Brennan and Heusgen pose to democracy across the Western world. The Weimar Republic did not have free speech. While Article 118 of the German constitution of 1919 forbade censorship, Article 48 of the same document empowered the state to ""temporarily suspend"" freedom of speech and other ""basic rights,"" whenever ""public order and security are seriously disturbed or threatened."" Weimar Germany routinely shut down newspapers, forbade certain people from speaking, and arrested those they deemed a threat. Not a single Jew was killed during World War II by words. They were murdered by physical violence inflicted by a tyrannical regime that, like today's German government, frequently prosecuted citizens for expressing disfavored opinions. Government suppression of speech is inconsistent with democratic values except in very limited wartime circumstances and is especially antidemocratic when the suppressed speech relates to issues of political, ideological, philosophical, religious, or cultural importance, such as when life begins or who and how many people should be let into a political community and from where. The Heusgens and Brennans are still not ready to listen to people who say things they don't like. They arrogantly assume they know best. So expect more tears.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-18T05:01:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3321826/europe-cannot-handle-truth-free-speech/
The war on plastic straws highlights Democrats’ shoddy ‘science’,"President Donald Trump 's executive order ending the federal government's push to transition to paper straws is a good reminder that environmentally-obsessed Democrats regularly botch ""The Science."" This is especially true when it comes to their climate policies. Trump's executive order naturally earned a response from climate groups such as Oceana, whose ""plastics campaign director"" warned that ""the world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today."" Plastic straws, we were told, are a massive environmental threat. That's why multiple Democratic states and cities have banned or restricted them. However, the idea to ban plastic straws stemmed from a study that found that Americans use 500 million plastic straws per day. That ""study,"" though, was an estimate from a 9-year-old child. It became gospel truth around 2018 among liberal media outlets, politicians in California and Hawaii, and environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club. In reality, however, the United States is hardly a global player when it comes to plastic pollution. The U.S. is responsible for less than 1% of global mismanaged plastic waste, with plastic straws making up a fraction of that share. China, in comparison, is responsible for more than 20% of global mismanaged plastic waste. Meanwhile, on the straw question specifically, a real study from Belgium found that paper straws have a higher concentration of ""forever chemicals"" than the plastic straws they are replacing. This is how it so often goes for Democrats trying to ""save the planet"" with their heavy-handed restrictions. Bans on single-use plastics, including plastic bags, led to New Jersey residents tripling their plastic consumption and using reusable grocery bags that are worse for the environment. California's fast-approaching ban on gas-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles has several drawbacks for the environment, as does the state's insistence on banning nuclear energy as part of its carbon-free energy grid. The Democratic Party's junk science on environmental matters makes the environment worse and life more inconvenient for people. Nothing shows that better than the bizarre panic over plastic straws. It is a statistically insignificant portion of global plastic pollution that rose to prominence based on a ""study"" from a third grader, which managed to make it all the way to the desk of the president.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T23:05:24+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317019/war-plastic-straws-highlights-democrats-shoddy-science/
Elon Musk cast Iron Mountain into the spotlight. Its story is complex,"BOYERS, Pennsylvania -- People around here are used to the trucks that deliver paperwork to the old Pennsylvania limestone mine. Here, over 700 locals work as employees of the Office of Personnel Management processing the retirement papers of federal government workers. Everyone around here knows of its existence. In fact, a lot of people around here either work there or have a family member who works there. Once upon a time, the mines and quarries around Boyers were filled with limestone and coal, which powered and built the country, like hundreds of places across Pennsylvania. Work in those mines provided families with a decent wage and a reason to stay rooted in the region. In the 1950s, as these mines emptied of their natural resources, local elected officials across the state, and across the country for that matter, looked for ways to utilize them so that people wouldn't lose their jobs and have to relocate. In 1951, during the early, fear-driven days of the Cold War, the city council in Scranton, Pennsylvania, proposed using former mines to construct underground parking lots. The argument was that they could serve as bomb shelters in the event of an enemy atomic attack. In 1960, the Cleveland Plain Dealer detailed the use of a worked-out limestone mine in Western Pennsylvania that National City Bank used as a bank storage vault. It was constructed as part of a detailed plan to ensure the continuity of their banking operation in the event of a catastrophe, including a nuclear attack. That bank became one of the few financial institutions in the United States to obtain underground bomb-proof storage facilities. They were to use the same mine located in Butler County, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh. At that time, the mine was operated by the National Storage Company , which already had other similar clients. Many of them were major, blue-ribbon industrial corporations in the Pittsburgh area and other sections of the eastern U.S. Today, that former limestone mine is Iron Mountain, which merged with the longtime owner of the National Storage Company or National Underground in 1998 . The facility is located right off of state route 308 in Boyers, a Butler County village located 20 miles from the Butler Farm Show Complex where President Donald Trump was shot on July 13, 2024. The Butler Farm Show Complex is the same place where Elon Musk took the stage with Trump for the first time to voice his support for the president. On Tuesday, Musk, the owner of X and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, brought attention to the facility during an appearance with Trump in the Oval Office. His comments implied that this mine might need examining. ""All that retirement paperwork is manual on paper,"" Musk said in a rare public appearance in his role as an adviser to the president. ""It's manually calculated. They're written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down a mine and, like, what do you mean a mine? Like, yeah, there's a limestone mine where we store all the retirement paperwork."" Musk is not the first person to beg that question. Both the Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama administrations questioned the efficiency and lack of automation in processing thousands of case files, moving them from cavern to cavern, one line at a time. As one local, who asked for their name not to be used because half of their family works at the mine, noted, ""Back in the '50s, the concern was nuclear attack. Today, the concern is cyberattack. It is all about the protection and preservation of these documents."" Some consider the place an oddity. And of course, there is the always-entertaining speculation that a bunker for the president has been located deep within it since the Cold War -- a speculation without evidence. There are locals who also say there are ghosts within the massive series of vaults and mines, which is common local lore. When Musk posted on X about the existence of a mine full of paperwork, the social media platform lit up in reaction. Its existence around here is as commonly known, the same as who makes the best pizza in the area. The jobs they hold at the facility do more than just provide an income -- they also keep generations of families intact who are deeply rooted in the area. That, in turn, provides a tax base for the school district and the local townships, keeping the rural region thriving. ""There are 700 jobs here, around 300 of them are OPM, but the rest are government contract jobs that revolve around OPM, with the overwhelming majority of those jobs held by citizens of small towns in Butler County,"" the longtime resident said. ""If this place is nixed and 70% of the jobs are gone, it will devastate both northern Butler County and southern Butler County,"" he said. ""We have no comparable jobs."" For those who are hoping this will pull Trump supporters away from him because of the mention of the mine, there is no evidence of that yet. ""I think Mr. Musk is misinformed because the workers tell me they don't just deal in manila envelopes. A lot of their work is digitalized, no question,"" he said, adding, ""I think the job of DOGE is to be skeptical about everything, and in the end, they will find that this facility isn't a place of excess."" Trump won Butler County by a whopping 65 percentage points. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), of Butler County, who has toured the mine several times, said he, too, believes this will all work out in the end. ""Once there is more nuance and context provided as to what exactly is done here and why it is done the way it is done,"" Kelly said in an interview with the Washington Examiner . ""The space is utilized not just for its size, but the process is also for safety and security,"" Kelly said. ""During the Cold War, it was considered safe from external attacks. Now, during the digital age, it keeps important government documents safe and preserved if there was a cyberattack."" Kelly said he understands that the move now is to do everything online. ""Everything has to be digitalized. Everything has to be done quickly. All I'm saying is, you know what? There's a reason why things have a long lifespan in something like the mine. That is a very safe storage space for these documents."" On Tuesday, Musk bluntly admitted he would get things wrong from time to time. ""Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected, so nobody can bat 1.000,"" he said, promising to swiftly correct errors, with the same going for the Department of Government Efficiency. ""We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we'll also fix the mistakes very quickly,"" Musk said. Kelly says the root of what Musk is doing is good, old-fashioned getting to the root of what is the federal bloated bureaucracy. ""That is not what is happening at Iron Mountain, but you don't know that until you ask,"" Kelly said. The limestone excavated here was owned and used by U.S. Steel from 1902 to 1952. It was used in the then-booming steel mills located all around Pittsburgh. When it regained new life as a storage facility in the late 1950s, the stone walls of the Boyers mine were painted silver and the floor was blacktopped with wide corridors as armored trucks drove through the miles of underground roadway to each individual vault. The Times-Tribune wrote in 1960 that the mine was entirely air-conditioned and had electric heaters, humidity-controlled equipment, and generators for producing power. They also wrote that it contained escape hatches and alternate entrances and exits, but their locations were kept secret. The Center for Land Use Interpretation , a research and education organization, recently reported that Iron Mountain expanded its data center, known as WPA-1, inside the mine.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T22:59:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318785/complicated-story-iron-mountain/
Don’t believe the story about the Philadelphia Eagles skipping a White House visit,"A story went viral Sunday about the Philadelphia Eagles skipping an invite to attend a special ceremony at the White House because of their Super Bowl victory in February. However, people should approach the story with extreme skepticism. As someone born and raised in Philadelphia, a stone's throw from the stadium where the Eagles play, I was dismayed at the news. It was not altogether surprising, given they did not attend the White House after their Super Bowl victory in February 2018. Nevertheless, it was disappointing to read. Then, I started researching the claim. It may have been a rush to judgment based on outdated information from an anonymous source. Upon further review, the claim is based on an article published in the Sun on Feb. 6, 2025, and updated on Feb. 9. The story also cites an anonymous Eagles player saying the team wouldn't attend. ""We represent a city and a state that is pushing for equal rights, respect, and values that respect every human being,"" the player said. ""We won't forget what happened and the criticism we received for taking a stand against racism, and we won't back down from our values of respect, integrity, and equality."" There have been no official statements, posts, or information about the Eagles' decision or any invitation from the White House about the team visiting. I contacted the Eagles on Monday morning to verify their position on visiting the White House. The inquiries went unanswered at the time of this publication. THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES ARE AMERICA'S TEAM The story about the team skipping a visit to the White House is an example of misinformation aggressively spreading on social media. Now, the Eagles may ultimately decide to skip a visit to the White House. It is believed that Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie is not a Republican or a supporter of President Donald Trump, so the team's not attending could very well still happen. And, understandably, that would draw disappointment and resentment from many of the team's fans. However, as of this very moment, it is unknown. Regardless of what happens, trusting an anonymous source from an article over two weeks old and inexplicably recycled on social media on Sunday should not be considered a reliable source.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-24T18:52:58+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3328076/dont-believe-story-philadelphia-eagles-skipping-white-house-visit/
Iran is stealing sensitive US intellectual property and using it to kill Americans,"Iran is conducting a campaign to extract sensitive U.S. data and use it to harm Americans and our allies, and policymakers are not doing enough to stop it. President Donald Trump 's Feb. 4 executive order ordering the government to start a robust campaign against Iran's intellectual property theft is a good start, drawing attention to a serious and long-overlooked problem. Yet, Congress and relevant agencies need to build on this momentum and do more to caution industry about the critical threat of Iranian IP extraction, explaining how to identify it, protect against it, and stop it. As China's high-profile efforts to surveil Americans via TikTok demonstrate, foreign enemies continuously seek to use America's openness and societal freedoms to their own advantage. Less prominent but just as dangerous, Iran is stealing U.S. high-tech data and using it in the projectiles targeting Americans and our allies on the battlefield. A December 2023 indictment alleged a dual U.S.-Iranian national stole sensitive data and components from his U.S. employer and sent them to Iran's Sanat Danesh Rahpuyan Aflak, an Iranian defense firm building drone navigation systems. These components precisely guide Iranian drones to their targets, including a January 2024 drone attack that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan. This attack underscores a broader problem: Iran's data theft helps close the capability gap at little cost to Tehran, threatening U.S. and ally mission success. As one senior U.S. official put it , ""Iranian drones we're recovering on the battlefield in Ukraine and throughout the Middle East are found to have sensitive U.S. communications systems and microelectronics."" Iran and its proxies regularly use drones with U.S. components to target Americans -- including in many of the 200-plus attacks on U.S. troops in the Middle East in the past 16 months. Iranian IP theft expands beyond drone navigation systems to include the extraction and theft of sensitive data on U.S. airspace, military aircraft components from U.S. defense contractors, and confidential technical data and prototypes with applications in missile research. In every case, the actions could lead to "" catastrophic "" consequences without any guarantee this sensitive data remained in Iranian hands since both China and Russia have been beneficiaries of Iran's thievery in the past. The United States must not accept Iran's IP theft as a fait accompli. The U.S. needs to go on offense against the broader Iranian problem set, including greater financial and military pressure against the regime. In addition to changing the calculus of Iran's presently high-reward, low-risk data theft, policymakers need to shift more attention to defending against Iran's efforts. The primary interagency IP theft entity, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force, has unsealed charges against over 35 defendants in at least 25 cases in its two-year history, but this task force's batting average is likely far lower than it could be. Cracking down on Iranian IP theft will require Congress to use its subpoena powers to investigate how Iran extracted critical information from sensitive U.S. sectors in the first place. Lawmakers should hold hearings and closed-door briefings with officials in the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State to learn how Iranian agents gained employment eligibility in sensitive U.S. sectors and, in some cases, security clearances. Only by gaining a better understanding of these security lapses can lawmakers prevent a recurrence. Iranian IP theft's sophisticated nature requires Congress to push relevant federal agencies, namely the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Justice, to improve their cooperation with and guidance to the private sector. Though the federal government issues cyberattack guidance to industry, it should issue clear, parallel guidelines about insider threats, including indicators of suspicious behavior and how to compartmentalize sensitive information. The DTSF should also establish an anonymous tip line, like the FBI's cyber division tip line, for suspected adversary theft. TRUMP CRACKS DOWN ON IRAN'S 'SHADOW FLEET' WITH NEW SANCTIONS To help industry cope with this growing threat, Congress should revive stalled legislation requiring the Commerce Department to better publicize IP threats to U.S. companies and to make it easier for firms to request an interagency federal IP theft investigation. Congress must adequately fund the DTSF's component agencies, the Departments of Commerce and Justice, to ensure they are sufficiently capable of combatting this growing threat. U.S. policymakers must take urgent action to address the rampant threat against our intellectual property by foreign adversaries or risk seeing it used against us on the battlefield. Retired Lt. Gen.

"IRS contractor Charles Littlejohn leaked Trump’s tax returns, but we’re now learning how much damage he really did","IRS CONTRACTOR CHARLES LITTLEJOHN LEAKED DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS. BUT WE'RE JUST NOW LEARNING HOW MUCH DAMAGE HE REALLY DID. For much of President Donald Trump 's first term in office, the coalition of Democrats, activists, and media figures known collectively as the Resistance believed that obtaining Trump's tax returns would be the key to bringing down the president. Finally, on Sept. 27, 2020, at the height of Trump's reelection campaign, the New York Times reported that it had ""obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organization, including detailed information from his first two years in office."" The paper published several long articles based on the information. Voila! The Holy Grail of the Resistance! The problem was the stories came and went and did not become the huge, earthshaking scandal the anti-Trumpers had hoped. The long-awaited bombshells weren't really bombshells, and the political world moved on. The New York Times did not reveal, of course, how it had obtained the information. That did not happen until Sept. 29, 2023, when the Justice Department charged a man named Charles Edward Littlejohn with unauthorized disclosure of tax returns. Littlejohn was not an employee of the IRS. He worked for the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which worked under contract for the IRS. According to the Justice Department , between 2008 and 2013, Littlejohn worked ""intermittently"" for Booz Allen Hamilton. He then left, but in 2017, he sought to return to the company, this time with ""the intention of accessing and disclosing tax returns."" The returns he planned to disclose were Trump's. The Justice Department said Littlejohn viewed the president as ""dangerous and a threat to democracy."" Littlejohn got the job, which gave him access to ""vast amounts of unmasked taxpayer data, including tax returns and return information,"" according to the Justice Department. That included Trump's tax returns and those of his many companies. Littlejohn came up with a ""sophisticated, detailed"" scheme to conceal what he was doing. The work took months. In May 2019, according to the Justice Department, Littlejohn got in touch with the New York Times . Between August and October 2019, with the election year approaching, he gave the paper Trump's information. Littlejohn then went back to the well, got more Trump information, and gave that to the New York Times , too. About five weeks before Election Day, New York Times reporters published their first story based on the stolen information Littlejohn had given them. Littlejohn was not finished, though. He broadened his sights to target billionaires and millionaires around the country, as well as the billionaire in the White House. ""In or about July and August 2020,"" the Justice Department said, Littlejohn ""accessed unmasked IRS data associated with thousands of the nation's wealthiest people, including returns and return information dating back over 15 years."" Littlejohn gave that trove to the left-wing media organization ProPublica . And these were not just 1040 forms. From the Justice Department: ""Defendant did not merely disclose tax returns. He disclosed information that included income and taxes as well as investments, stock trades, gambling winnings, audit determinations, and many other types of financial material. One of defendant's purposes in leaking the tax returns and return information to [ ProPublica ] was to catch the attention of the public with more salacious details than mere tax returns might provide."" On June 8, 2021, ProPublica published ""The Secret IRS Files: Trove of Never-Before-Seen Records Reveal How the Wealthiest Avoid Income Tax."" ProPublica reported that it had ""obtained a vast cache of IRS information"" covering billionaires Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, George Soros, Kenneth Griffin, and others. The data, with all the private information like investments and audits, ""provides an unprecedented look inside [their] financial lives,"" ProPublica said. After Littlejohn was caught, Republicans on Capitol Hill tried to discover how much damage he did. For example, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) asked the IRS for the number of taxpayers and other entities whose private taxpayer information Littlejohn stole and then leaked. In May of last year, an IRS spokesman said the number was ""more than 70,000."" But now, in a new response to Jordan , the IRS said it has ""mailed notifications to 405,427 taxpayers whose taxpayer information was inappropriately disclosed by Mr. Littlejohn."" The IRS added that approximately 89% of those taxpayers were business entities. But even if that is the case, that means more than 40,000 of the taxpayers were individuals. That is a lot of privacy to violate. Littlejohn pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax information. It was a pretty good deal, considering what he had done. If Alvin Bragg, the Democratic district attorney who prosecuted Trump, were handling the case, he might have charged Littlejohn with 405,427 counts of disclosure, one for every person or financial entity he violated. As it was, after pleading guilty to that single count, Littlejohn was sentenced to five years in prison, which was the maximum for that offense. So now we know just how far-reaching Littlejohn's crime was. The key fact, of course, is that his primary target was Donald Trump. Like so many Resistance talking heads in Washington and elsewhere, Littlejohn believed that Trump posed a danger to democracy, and that meeting that danger justified breaking the law. And now, with Trump again in the White House, the question is, is there another Charles Littlejohn out there somewhere in the deep recesses of the federal bureaucracy?",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T21:17:09+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3331409/irs-contractor-charles-littlejohn-leaked-trump-tax-returns-but-now-learning-damage-he-did/
The pro-life paradox of Trump and Vance,"Republican politicians have faced the same fundamental dilemma for decades: how to make pro-life voters cheer while giving them next to nothing? President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance mastered the move -- and it accounts for no small part of their larger political dominance. Consider the events of last week. On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order expanding access to in vitro fertilization. In fulfillment of a campaign promise, the order made IVF more affordable and accessible. The pro-life movement, which holds that life begins at conception, stands firmly opposed to IVF because the process destroys, discards, and, in some cases, freezes human life indefinitely. Then, only two days later, at CPAC, Vance discoursed eloquently about many conservative values, including the need to defend life at all stages. ""We've got to persuade our fellow citizens to stop thinking about babies as inconveniences to be discarded,"" he told the adoring crowd. ""We've got to start thinking about them as blessings to cherish."" The CPAC crowd, presumably filled with pro-lifers, erupted in applause and chanted, ""JD! JD JD!"" Prominent pro-life figures erupted similarly on X. ""Vance nailed it -- calling life sacred and tying it to faith is exactly what the movement needs to hear from leadership,"" wrote Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. LifeNews wrote, ""Love this pro-life leadership!"" Esteemed Catholic academic Patrick Deneen lent his considerable gravitas to gloss over the contradiction, ""Vance at CPAC: 'Every child is sacred.' This is not just politics--it's a moral anthropology we've lost. Good to hear from a Catholic VP."" Of course, not all pro-life reactions were as eagerly forgiving. But Vance's ability to make the pro-life world cheer only 48 hours removed from the IVF order spoke volumes. Not long ago, a Republican politician would have paid a hefty price for crossing pro-life so brazenly. But Trump and Vance always seem to get a standing applause no matter what they do. It's far from the first time Trump and Vance have suffered no consequences for promoting anti-life causes. In August, Vance promised CBS's Margaret Brennan (yes, that Margaret) that he and Trump wouldn't block access to the abortion pill, saying , ""Of course want to make sure that any medicine is safe, and it's prescribed in the right way, and so forth."" That same month, Trump said he was "" against"" Florida's abortion law, saying , ""I think the six-week (ban) is too short -- it has to be more time. I told them I want more weeks."" Weeks later, Trump even adopted the euphemisms of the pro-abort movement, pledging his administration would be ""great for women and their reproductive rights ."" Of course, there is a delicate balancing act to play in promoting the cause of life. There's a difference between speaking the truth and convincing people. And now more than ever, the pro-life movement needs to be making converts. That's because the cause of life isn't experiencing a golden age, as some might have you believe. It's in the midst of a dark age. In addition to the Trump-Vance administration's full embrace of IVF, the pro-life movement has been beaten soundly at the polls. There have been 17 state ballot measures on abortion voted on since Dobbs v. Jackson returned the matter to the people, and the pro-life cause has lost 15 of them -- 16 if you count Florida's Amendment 4, which failed despite winning 56% of the vote in a state that required 60% to enshrine abortion rights into the Constitution. Vance's larger point that we must work to persuade the culture is well taken, but that doesn't give his administration license to advocate a ""medical procedure"" that destroys life. Many would defend Vance here by insisting he is ""playing the long game"" on abortion and that his heart is in the right place. I hope that's true. On Friday, he will speak at the Catholic Prayer Breakfast, which he was invited to despite accusing the U.S Conference of Catholic Bishops of bolstering its ""bottom line"" through its Refugee and Migration services. Here's a prediction: He will make a beautiful case for life, the family, and other core tenets of Western civilization because that's what he does. And conservative pundits will stand and cheer because that's what they do. But what of the lives discarded through the procedure his administration now promotes? What of the babies killed by the abortion pill? Where are they in all of this?",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T21:42:09+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3332529/pro-life-paradox-trump-vance/
Salutes left and right signal men’s agitation,"There has been an unfortunate uptick in public displays of the Roman salute, among men specifically. But the fact of the matter is that young, online men have been at this for a while: Their veiled and unveiled interest in Hitler has not likely decreased but has not likely increased. It is more obvious but not more dangerous. As such, the breadth of the matter is not the problem now. The push and pull between the Left and the Right is what keeps the joke alive and provocative. If Roman salutes are becoming more common, overt Nazism, thankfully, is not -- at least on the Right. The gesture is an older military salute on which the Nazis, and other fascist regimes, modeled their own. Our present phenomenon makes conservatives look plain amoral, but more than anything else, it reveals a political balancing act. Barring Elon Musk 's foray into the controversy, the men whom the media have accused of performing the salute probably did mean to do so. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon gave one at the end of his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, as did Mexican actor Eduardo Verastegui in the same setting. The jury is still out on Anglican minister Calvin Robinson. Their version of the salute is one that mimics Musk's innocent one rather than an authentic Nazi tribute. This intentional ambiguity is the difficulty: It is a type of trolling that leans into the Left's incessant smears of fascism on right-wing men. Before an empathetic audience, it is coy and self-aware. Such empathy is the domain of male CPAC attendees, whom Vice President JD Vance addressed with encouragement against ""a culture that sends a message to young men that you should suppress every masculine urge."" He is correct: The Democratic Party has a man problem . And in large part, its ridicule of masculinity is where this strain of men's reactionary politics, this trend of half-hearted Roman salutes for the sake of the polemic, stems. FOLLOWING 2024 DISASTER, DEMOCRATS LOOK TO RECLAIM STATUS AS 'PARTY OF THE WORKER' For every conservative speaker giving a supposed Roman salute, there is at least one all-in leftist buying into the bit. Respondents accuse what they see and advocate further suppression. The thing is, both sides are buying into the other. That much should be clear by now: When right-wing men take the accusation to bat again and again, left-wing commentators rush to the catch. It is a feedback loop of willingness to play a part. Obstinacy and stagnation accompany it, but no threat to the established order.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-25T16:00:54+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3328787/salutes-left-right-signal-men-agitation/
Partners can help the US thwart the Russia-Iran axis,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington on Tuesday can be a significant step forward for the Trump administration to stabilize the Middle East. Despite its loss of Syria and setbacks to its Hamas and Hezbollah proxies, Iran remains the key disruptive actor in the region. Tehran's nuclear ambitions are very close to realization, and its quests for dominance in the Middle East and the destruction of Israel and America remain unchanged. Further aggravating this scenario, Iran just signed a mutual defense pact with Russia. The United States and Israel can undermine Iranian-Russian objectives on two fronts. An Israeli-American partnership has emerged to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russian missiles and Iranian drones. The U.S. military has transferred about 90 decommissioned Patriot air defense interceptors from storage in Israel to Poland for delivery to Ukraine. This is the most significant supply of weapons from Israel to Ukraine since the Russian invasion. It demonstrates that Jerusalem calculates that Ukraine's military resistance impedes Moscow's capabilities to assist Iran. In the Middle East, President Donald Trump has stated that his policy will focus on expanding the 2020 Abraham Accords , normalizing relations between Israel and America's Arab allies. With the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and a new government in Lebanon vowing to limit the influence of Iran's proxy Hezbollah, Washington has a unique opportunity to put Tehran in check. Trump can reinstate all sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the Biden administration, limit its energy exports, prevent its nuclear program from reaching weaponization, and help eliminate its terrorist proxies. Taking such critical steps to restrain Iran will also bolster the confidence of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other moderate states to join the Abraham Accords. Washington must also deepen its engagement with nearby pro-Western Muslim countries such as Azerbaijan, which oppose Tehran's ambitions. Azerbaijan is a secular, Shia Muslim-majority state and the largest country in the South Caucasus by territory, population, economy, and military capability. It is a growing contributor to Europe's energy security, supplying oil and gas to European Union countries and Israel, an alternative to Russia, and a transportation hub between Europe and Central Asia. Azerbaijan has developed more far-reaching ties with Israel than any other Muslim state, including a 30-year military and strategic partnership. Israel sided with Azerbaijan when it reclaimed the territory of Karabakh from Armenia in a brief military operation in September 2020, while Iran supported Armenia. Following the war, disputes intensified between Iran and Azerbaijan over transportation routes across the South Caucasus. Leaders of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee stated at a December 2024 meeting with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev that Washington had not fully appreciated Baku's support for Israel. Azerbaijan has been key for Israel's energy security, has been its largest oil supplier, and boosted its oil exports during Israel's 2024 war against Hamas. Azerbaijan has also been a leading purchaser of Israeli military equipment . A new military agreement was signed in September 2024 that will boost Baku's engagement in projects critical to Israel's security. Azerbaijan's positive regional role is also evident in efforts to mediate relations between Israel and Turkey, which have deteriorated since the war against Hamas. Aliyev has participated in previous efforts and is prepared for a similar role, while also mediating between Israel and other Muslim states. Azerbaijan and Israel have also developed close ties between their intelligence agencies , especially in monitoring Iran, as both countries view the ayatollah regime as an existential threat. Working with Israel, the Abraham Accords countries, and other partners willing to challenge the Iranian and Russian agendas in the Black Sea basin, the Caucasus, and the greater Middle East will enable the Trump administration to undercut terror and war without having to do all of the heavy lifting.

Trump should follow the Florida and Virginia models on criminal justice reform,"Criminal justice reform has been a key priority for President Donald Trump, and there is a prime opportunity to enact changes that emphasize rehabilitation, reduce recidivism, and provide second chances for those willing to improve their lives. While states such as Virginia have made strides, Florida's successful implementation of reform measures offers a powerful example of how policies can incentivize personal growth and reintegration into society while also promoting public safety. Florida's version of criminal justice reform is centered on a transformative approach, focusing on giving people on supervision a real chance to earn their way out of the system. Gov. Ron DeSantis, supported by key figures such as now-U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, signed a reform bill that mirrors this idea: individuals on supervision can reduce their term of supervision in the community by engaging in rehabilitative actions such as educational programs, job training, mental health treatment, and securing stable housing. These policies not only reward proactive efforts but also foster a system of personal accountability, giving individuals a clearer path to rebuilding their lives. This approach works because it targets rehabilitation, offering those who have served their time the opportunity to prove they have changed while still maintaining accountability. In Florida, the ability to earn probation credits is a clear motivator, offering individuals an incentive to demonstrate their commitment to self-improvement. This system shows that the state isn't simply letting people off the hook but is instead offering them the tools to be successful and reintegrate into the community. Florida's success with this model has proven its effectiveness. By focusing on rehabilitation over punitive measures, the state has reduced its caseloads, cut costs, and created a more efficient system that helps people reintegrate rather than cycling through incarceration and supervision. Additionally, the reform helps keep dangerous offenders off the streets by prioritizing resources for those who pose a greater risk to society. For individuals who show genuine progress, this system allows them the opportunity to move beyond their past mistakes and return to productive, law-abiding lives. Moreover, Florida's reforms have garnered broad support across political lines, proving that criminal justice reform doesn't need to be a partisan issue. There is increasing recognition, both from Republicans and Democrats, that costly and ineffective prolonged supervision is not the solution. By focusing on reducing recidivism through rehabilitative measures, Florida has shown that justice and personal growth can coexist--ultimately benefiting taxpayers, communities, and individuals who are seeking a fresh start. Virginia, under Gov. Glenn Youngkin, has also embraced a forward-thinking approach to criminal justice reform. Youngkin's "" Stand Tall, Stay Strong, Succeed Together "" Reentry Initiative mirrors Florida's emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration. The executive order strengthens Virginia's commitment to supporting successful reentry for individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system. The initiative focuses on collaboration between government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and local communities to provide the tools and resources necessary for successful reintegration, such as education, job training, and mental health services. Youngkin's initiative aligns with Florida's model by prioritizing rehabilitation over punishment and ensuring individuals who have served their time are provided the support they need to successfully reenter society. Like Florida's reform efforts, Virginia's approach is designed to reduce recidivism and help individuals avoid returning to the criminal justice system. Additionally, proposed legislation in Virginia, namely House Bill 2252 and Senate Bill 936, will bring the state's probation system in line with Youngkin's executive order but also with Florida's successful model. These bills would allow individuals on supervision in Virginia to reduce their terms based on participation in rehabilitation programs, much like the system in Florida that incentivizes positive actions such as job training and educational involvement. This approach is designed to encourage self-improvement while reducing the burden on probation officers and the state's resources. By adopting these reforms, Virginia can mirror the success Florida has seen, making the justice system more efficient, cost-effective, and focused on rehabilitation rather than prolonged supervision. The success of Florida's reforms, combined with Virginia's proactive steps under the executive order and proposed legislation such as HB 2252 and SB 936, serves as a model for other states. Both states have demonstrated that criminal justice reform doesn't have to be an either/or between punishment and rehabilitation. Instead, they have shown that a smart, compassionate approach can help reduce crime, lower costs, and create safer communities while offering individuals a chance to rebuild their lives. For Trump and lawmakers in Congress, Florida's success offers a blueprint for how reform can work, advancing a system that offers not just punishment but a real opportunity for redemption. By looking to Florida and Virginia as examples, lawmakers can enact reforms that align with the president's agenda while making a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals who are working to turn things around.

Trump should call for new elections in Georgia,"On Nov. 28, 2024, Georgia's ruling Georgian Dream party announced the suspension of the country's European Union accession process until 2028 -- a move widely viewed as a betrayal of the nation's long-standing aspirations to join Western alliances. Within an hour of the announcement, protesters flooded Tbilisi's central thoroughfare in defiance of what they saw as a dangerous pivot away from the country's pro-Western trajectory. In response, the United States suspended its Strategic Partnership with Georgia, with the State Department warning that the decision made the country more vulnerable to Kremlin influence. However, Washington's reaction was largely symbolic, failing to deter the Georgian government. This marked a failure of deterrence on the part of the Biden administration, which, despite repeated warnings, failed to impose meaningful consequences on Georgian Dream's leadership. For years, Georgia has stood out as a pro-American stronghold in a region increasingly contested by Russian and Chinese influence. The Georgian people have consistently demonstrated their commitment to Western values -- through their overwhelming support for NATO membership, participation in U.S.-led military missions, and rejection of authoritarianism. Yet, despite this reservoir of goodwill, Washington has been unable to prevent Georgia's leadership from steering the country toward Moscow and Beijing. Now, President Donald Trump has a critical opportunity to correct this course -- if he chooses to leverage U.S. influence wisely. Under Georgian Dream, the country has drifted from its pro-Western orientation, embracing policies that align with the Kremlin's interests rather than the will of its people. Crackdowns on media freedom, intimidation of opposition figures, and the passage of Russia-style ""foreign agent"" laws signal a troubling regression. Meanwhile, Georgia has deepened economic and security ties with China, which views the country as a critical transit hub for its Belt and Road Initiative. The ruling party has granted major infrastructure contracts to Chinese companies, including plans for a Chinese state-affiliated company to construct the strategic Anaklia Deep Sea Port -- deliberately excluding U.S. involvement despite high-level interest from Trump's first administration. The implications of this shift are severe. Georgia's strategic importance cannot be overstated. Just an hour's flight from Tehran, it has served as a key location for U.S. military and intelligence operations in the region. Georgia has previously offered its territory for American military purposes, underscoring its value as an ally. Allowing the country to fall into Russia and China's sphere of influence would weaken U.S. security interests in the Caucasus, the Middle East, and Europe. Georgian Dream's shift away from the West has sparked massive protests across the country. Instead of engaging with domestic and international concerns, the ruling party has opted for violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators, mass arrests of activists and journalists, and an intensification of anti-U.S. and anti-Western rhetoric. New repressive measures, including laws prohibiting protesters from wearing masks and new media restrictions, highlight the government's desperation to maintain power at any cost. The party's conspiratorial rhetoric has only grown more extreme. In the lead-up to the contested October elections, widely viewed as neither free nor fair, Georgian Dream framed the country's political crisis as the work of a mythical ""global war party"" allegedly plotting revolution and seeking to open a second front against Russia. According to this narrative, billionaire oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, the party's founder and de facto ruler, stands as the sole force resisting these supposed global actors. Having built his fortune in Russia, Ivanishvili has since consolidated his grip over Georgia's political system. Following Trump's victory, Georgian Dream began invoking the term ""deep state"" in an apparent attempt to align itself with Trump's worldview. This is a cynical ploy to secure his administration's favor while continuing policies that contradict U.S. interests. In reality, it has transformed Georgian institutions into a kleptocratic ""deep state"" where the judiciary and state institutions are controlled by loyalists. The party's anti-Western orientation was further exposed when Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze attended the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian alongside Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was later assassinated in Tehran. Meanwhile, Georgia has strengthened economic and political ties with China, signing a free trade agreement and a strategic partnership with Beijing, endorsing China's vision of a restructured world order. Georgia's informal ruler, Ivanishvili, now hopes that the Trump administration will shield it from international criticism and legitimize its authoritarian practices. One of the most concerning examples of this is the party's handling of the strategic Anaklia Deep Sea Port project. Despite high-level U.S. interest in developing the port as a crucial transit hub, Georgian Dream instead granted major infrastructure contracts to Chinese companies, allowing Beijing to expand its influence in the region. The decision not only undermines Georgia's strategic relationship with the West but also places a critical infrastructure project under the sway of China's Belt and Road Initiative, further entrenching Chinese economic control in the region. If the Trump administration provides even tacit approval of Georgian Dream's actions, it would legitimize the party's authoritarian trajectory and effectively cede Georgia to Russian and Chinese influence. This would be a devastating betrayal for a country that has long resisted Russian aggression -- from Soviet occupation to the 2008 war. It would also undermine decades of U.S. efforts to support Georgia's independence and sovereignty. Instead, the U.S. must take a firm stance against the Georgian Dream's growing authoritarianism. The Republican-led Non-Recognition Act, currently in Congress, outlines key measures that could shape Washington's response. These should include targeted sanctions against regime figures, increased support for Georgian people, calls for the immediate release of political prisoners, and, most importantly, pressure for new free and fair elections. The Georgian people have made their aspirations clear: They seek to be part of Western civilization. Washington must ensure that their voices are heard -- and that authoritarian backsliding does not go unchallenged. Trump must recognize that the Georgian Dream is not an ally -- it is a Trojan horse for Russia and China in the South Caucasus.

Trump is right on birthright citizenship,"At the heart of the legal debate over President Donald Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. While there are numerous practical hurdles to eliminating birthright citizenship as it's been practiced, the president is on solid legal footing. The clause (""All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof"") should not be interpreted as conferring automatic citizenship to children born of illegal immigrants . Setting aside constitutional interpretation, that just seems like common sense. But not everyone sees it this way, hence the controversy. According to two federal judges who have issued injunctions since the order was issued, the language of the clause should be read at its broadest, which would grant citizenship to any person born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S., regardless of the status of the parents. Proponents of this interpretation point to the Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) in which the court held that a child born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S. to temporary Chinese immigrants was a citizen. But the problems with this interpretation are manifold. For one, it misinterprets the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" to apply to children born to foreign nationals who are not under full and exclusive allegiance to the U.S. Those who are born in the U.S. to parents who are here on business or vacation should also be denied citizenship on these grounds. While in America, they are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. but only in a limited and ephemeral sense. They could not, for example, be drafted into the military. Once they leave, they are not subject to U.S. laws, which is not the case with Americans. There are various ways in which illegal immigrants are not ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" in the same way citizens are. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson offered the following scenario: An infant is brought to the U.S. legally, is lawfully naturalized, and serves in the military but cannot run for president -- but the child of a foreign tourist born in the U.S. can? The framers of the clause included it to ensure that citizenship would be conferred to the children of slaves who were brought here against their will. It is ludicrous to suggest that people who have traveled here of their own accord and entered the country unlawfully should be granted the same privilege. There are numerous practical hurdles that come with ending birthright citizenship that lawmakers will need to attend to should the Supreme Court eventually decide in Trump's favor. Some have raised questions about the moral complexities of the move, suggesting that ending birthright citizenship could create an underclass of ""stateless"" children and result in family separations. It would also worsen the bureaucratic nightmare of our national recordkeeping systems. Lawmakers should do everything possible to mitigate these unintended consequences. But that doesn't absolve the nation of the responsibility to enact sane immigration policy based on sound legal arguments. Trump's executive order achieves this, and so it is to be hoped that the courts find this compatible with the Constitution.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T05:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3317408/trump-right-on-birthright-citizenship/
Ignore Trump’s Gaza distraction. Focus on Iran,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with President Donald Trump , the first post-inaugural White House visit by a foreign leader, could shape the Middle East for generations. Pre-meeting speculation centered on how the leaders would handle the Hamas-Israel war. Stunningly, Trump's comments just before and then after his meeting with Netanyahu focused on the U.S. taking control of the Gaza Strip while Gaza's residents are resettled elsewhere in the Middle East. There is little point in commenting seriously on this ""idea,"" which appears to be entirely Trump's own. The most important strategic issue in the real Middle East remains Iran's existential threat to Israel. Tehran's ayatollahs can only be delighted if the Trump administration expends any time and effort at all on the Gaza idea rather than addressing their nuclear weapons program. Restoring the ""maximum pressure"" campaign from Trump's first term is a sound decision, but still only the beginning of an effective strategy. Since Hamas's barbaric Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Israel, with U.S. assistance, has dealt Iran and its ""ring of fire"" strategy major blows. Hamas and Hezbollah have been decimated but not destroyed. Iran's ballistic missile production facilities and its sophisticated, Russian-supplied, S-300 air-defense systems have been all but eliminated. Syria's Iran-friendly Assad regime has fallen, and its S-300 systems and other military assets have been destroyed. Unfortunately, the Houthis in Yemen, West Bank terrorists, and Iranian-controlled Shia militias in Iraq are only wounded, and not severely. The job is unfinished, but enormous progress has been made to diminish Iran's overall threat, especially its terrorist surrogates. The existential danger remains: Its nuclear program is essentially intact, with only one location, the Parchin weaponization facility, attacked . Looking ahead, the central issue remains how to destroy Tehran's nuclear weapons efforts, which threaten not only Israel but also constitute a major proliferation threat to America and the world. Eliminating this menace is Netanyahu's real top priority, but it should not be solely Jerusalem's responsibility. The United States is the only country that can stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (chemical and biological as well as nuclear). For America and Israel, there has never been a better time to do just that, using carefully targeted force against Iran's nuclear arms facilities. Accordingly, Israeli-American objectives should be victory against both Iran's nuclear and terrorist threats. In World War II, Prime Minister Winston Churchill explained to his countrymen why this was the only acceptable outcome: ""victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival."" The real debate is between those advocating victory and those advocating the Obama-Biden approach: endless negotiations on an elusive deal to return Iran's government to civilized behavior. There are certainly legitimate questions about the timing of striking Tehran's nuclear facilities. Most important is reducing Iran's capacity to retaliate against Israel, friendly Gulf Arab states, and deployed U.S. forces in the region. In Lebanon, Hezbollah likely retains tens of thousands of Iranian-supplied missiles, and Iran itself still has significant numbers of missiles and drones. The clock is running. Tehran is racing to repair the production facilities Israel leveled in October 2024 to replenish its missile stockpiles. Another mutual priority is achieving Israel's objective of eliminating the political and military capabilities of Hamas and Hezbollah, as Netanyahu stressed yesterday. Although Israel has enjoyed remarkable success in Gaza and Lebanon, the recent Gaza hostage releases were staged to portray Hamas as a viable fighting force, with considerable support among Gaza's civilians. Yet under former President Joe Biden's ceasefire deal, which Trump's pre-inaugural pressure on Netanyahu ironically brought to fruition, Israeli negotiations with Hamas over Gaza's future are due to start. Yet this is precisely what Netanyahu wanted to avoid and why Biden failed for seven months to close the deal. Just because it is now Trump's deal does not improve it substantively. Hamas can have no part in any future Gaza, whatever it looks like, nor can Hezbollah have any future in Lebanon. Only by removing these cancers can Gazans and Lebanese have any prospect of normality. And so long as the ayatollahs rule in Tehran, they will do their best to rearm their terrorist proxies, even under ""maximum pressure"" against Iran. Following their summit, Netanyahu and Trump must demonstrate the resolve to persevere, as Churchill said, however long and hard the road may be. Watch what happens on Iran. John Bolton served as national security adviser to then-President Donald Trump between 2018 and 2019. Between 2005 and 2006, he served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T16:08:03+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3311291/ignore-trumps-gaza-distraction-focus-iran/
The organizations willingly participating in Hamas propaganda,"Hamas slaughtered 1,200 Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 and then ran to gullible left-wingers across the globe to whine about Israel daring to retaliate. Now, Hamas is launching propaganda rallies as it hands over live and murdered hostages while Palestinians celebrate murdered babies. Through it all, countless Western politicians, media outlets, and global organizations have dutifully served as useful idiots for Palestinian propaganda, whether that be from the fabricated ""genocide"" in Gaza to Hamas's attempted show of strength in parading tortured hostages and children's corpses on their way back to Israel. Each and every one of the people and organizations who portrayed the Palestinians as anything other than genocidal aggressors has participated in their propaganda operations. The International Committee of the Red Cross is one such example. The ICRC has become part of Hamas's hostage ""victory"" parade, present as Hamas perp walks Israeli civilians before a crowd of bloodthirsty Palestinians. Hamas forces them to wave and show grace to their captors and brings Israeli hostages to watch as others are finally given their freedom. All the while, the ICRC has its staff sit there and lend legitimacy to this grand propaganda show. This all came to a head with the transfer of remains for the Bibas family. Shiri Bibas and her two children, 9-month-old Kfir and 4-year-old Ariel, were murdered by Hamas in captivity. Their corpses were handed over in coffins, which Hamas paraded in front of a crowd as trophies and posed with in front of a mural depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a vampire. Music blared as if it were a festival. The ICRC was a part of all this. It did not even bother to confirm that the bodies of the murdered hostages were really them, as Hamas initially handed over a different body that it tried to pass off as Shiri. The ICRC did nothing, just like it did nothing when Hamas prevented it from visiting the Israeli hostages the terrorist group was holding. In a piece for the Washington Examiner , the spokesman for the ICRC stated that the organization can't visit hostages or stop grand hostage celebration ceremonies because Hamas calls the shots. Instead, he touted the ICRC's ""neutrality"" and said, ""Our role is not to make moral judgments but to work with warring parties to ensure that the fundamental rules of war, the humane treatment of prisoners and the protection of civilians, are upheld by all sides."" And yet, the ICRC can't ""ensure"" that. Its ""neutrality"" extends to referring to Palestinian terrorists being exchanged by Israel as ""detainees."" The ICRC, in these hostage-for-terrorist prisoner exchanges, has served as nothing more than a glorified taxi service, aiding Palestinian propaganda in the process while wanting a pat on the back for its sanctimonious ""neutrality"" stance. This ""neutrality"" has been a problem in liberal media as well. Claims from the Gaza Health Ministry (i.e. Hamas) are regularly presented as fact, or at least as defensible claims, without any of the ""without evidence"" snark that so often follows liberal media reports about conservative politicians. For example, the New York Times , the Associated Press , and the BBC (among others) pushed the claim that Israel launched an air strike on a hospital in Gaza, killing 500 civilians. As it turned out, the ""hospital"" that was bombed was actually a parking lot, 500 people were not killed, and the rocket came from Palestinian terrorists, not the Israeli military. This ""neutrality"" has played out similarly during the coverage of the Bibas murders. BBC correspondent Jon Donnison said , ""The propaganda efforts by both Hamas and Israel over the hostage release are pretty nauseating,"" comparing terrorists celebrating dead babies with Israel objecting to that celebration. The BBC called terrorists giving a random corpse back to Israel instead of Shiri a ""mix-up,"" giving the terrorists the benefit of the doubt. The Associated Press , meanwhile, painted as fact Hamas's claim that Israel killed 48,000 Palestinians while adding that ""without evidence"" snark to Israel's claim that it has killed 17,000 Hamas combatants. The outlet similarly parroted Hamas's claim that the Bibas family was killed by Israeli airstrikes. Much of the American education system has similarly positioned itself on the side of Hamas terrorists. The Chicago Teachers Union has repeatedly inserted itself to complain about Israel daring to defend itself against genocidal terrorists. Multiple universities have fostered antisemitic campus environments that have led to throngs of students launching illegal protests in support of terrorists. As of last November, 170 universities have chapters of ""Faculty for Justice in Palestine,"" and multiple universities had to move on from presidents or administrators who either coddled antisemites on campus or mocked Jewish students and leaders for being concerned about these antisemitic displays. Then there are the American politicians who have positioned themselves on the side of Hamas. Chief among them is Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). She launched into a crying fit while repeating the false story that Israel bombed a hospital. She has claimed Israel is committing ""ethnic cleansing,"" one of the many lies she spouts that give tacit support for the terrorists' actions. (After all, if Israel is committing ""ethnic cleansing,"" Hamas should logically ""defend itself""). Tlaib is joined by the rest of her progressive, antisemitic ""Squad,"" including Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who has repeatedly insinuated that Jewish money explains American support for Israel, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a self-professed non-expert on the issue who nonetheless lies about Israeli ""occupation"" and wishes Israel didn't have the Iron Dome missile defense system to protect itself from terrorist rockets. Senators on the Left have similarly shifted this way, whether it is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wanting to cut off military aid to Israel completely as it fights for its survival or Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), who has rigorously defended the United Nations agency that covers for, and had employees who took part in, Hamas terrorist activities. The International Criminal Court has similarly become a global promoter of antisemitism, and Senate Democrats have defended it. All of these people and organizations have made themselves willing participants in Hamas propaganda. Global organizations, media outlets, universities, teachers unions, and American politicians have all become Hamas propagandists by trying to pretend this conflict is anything but one of good against evil. On the one side is a democracy trying to protect its people from being slaughtered as they were on Oct. 7. On the other is a genocidal terrorist group parading dead babies in coffins to crowds of bloodthirsty civilians who helped hold Israelis hostage. MIKE WALTZ DEMANDS HAMAS CHANGE ITS 'UNACCEPTABLE' HANDLING OF CEASEFIRE DEAL Any person or organization lending the terrorists legitimacy through their presence or rhetoric is putting themselves on the side of Hamas. That includes the ICRC, letting itself be used in Hamas propaganda rallies parading dead babies. It includes every politician and ""journalist"" drawing a moral equivalence between Hamas and Israel. It includes everyone reporting ""Gaza Health Ministry"" claims as fact and anyone peddling lies that Israel is committing genocide, that Gaza is being ethnically cleansed, or that Israel is committing ""war crimes."" Anything other than the recognition that Hamas terrorists start every conflict, that the ""genocide in Gaza"" is a fraud, and that Israel conducts itself in a far more restrained manner than it should because of international pressure is morally bankrupt. You are either on the side of the babies who were abducted and murdered or on the side of their murderers.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T13:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3328578/international-organizations-participating-hamas-propaganda/
The Trump-endorsed blueprint to make America great again,"The House Budget Committee has taken a decisive first step in advancing President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda. By pursuing the 2025 budget resolution, we have launched one of the most conservative pieces of legislation in modern history and possibly the last chance to fix the broken transfer payment programs, root out the massive waste and fraud in the federal government, and right the fiscal ship before it hits the sand. This resolution is a battle plan to reverse the reckless spending spree of the Biden-Harris administration and return to foundational principles of economic freedom and fiscal responsibility that gave birth to the most powerful, prosperous, and generous nation in the history of the world. The resolution directs congressional committees to draft legislation that will: Bend the curve on mandatory spending that is driving our unsustainable debt. Lock in tax cuts for hardworking families and small businesses crushed by a cost-of-living crisis and rising healthcare costs. Open up domestic energy production and drive costs down for consumers. Release the regulatory stranglehold that is choking our job creators and compromising economic freedom. Bolster investment in a secure border and a strong defense. In short, this budget resolution is the key to unlocking American prosperity and security for the next decade and beyond. A cornerstone of this plan is the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts plus new provisions for hardworking people and eliminating taxes on tips. Failure to act will trigger a 22% tax hike on the average taxpayer; that's nearly a $1,700 tax increase on a family of four making the median income in the United States. Our budget blueprint also confronts two of the greatest threats to American prosperity: excessive regulation and out-of-control deficit spending. By avoiding tax increases, slashing regulations, and reining in government bloat and debt, we will supercharge the economy, benefiting every family and worker. The Congressional Budget Office projects that stabilizing the debt by reducing spending would create even greater economic velocity than tax cuts, boosting gross domestic product by a tenth of a percent. Faster growth is essential to counter the exponential increase in cumulative debt and the snowballing interest expenses to service it. This bleak fiscal outlook is a big reason for CBO's projection of just 1.8% in gross domestic product growth in the coming years. With the right economic policies and some spending restraint, we know America can do much better. Despite inheriting former President Barack Obama's sluggish 1.8% annual growth rate, during Trump's first term in office, excluding the year of the COVID pandemic, the United States saw 2.7% average growth. And since World War II, America has experienced an average GDP growth of 3.1%. Our budget includes a reasonable 2.6% annual growth assumption, a benchmark the Trump economy will undoubtedly exceed. Achieving this level of growth will reduce the deficit by over two and a half trillion dollars. Economic growth alone, however, cannot avert the looming fiscal crisis ahead. People recognize that wartime-level indebtedness of $36 trillion, pandemic-level deficits exceeding $2 trillion, and annual interest payments on the debt surpassing the total spent on national defense will take more than pro-growth policies to resolve. What is the single largest driver of this crisis, dollar for dollar? Automatic, unchecked mandatory spending -- expenditures Congress does not vote on annually and rarely even reviews. Our plan mandates at least $1.5 trillion in savings from these programs over the next decade, with a goal of saving even more. Much of the spending in these programs is lost to waste, fraud, and improper payments -- projected to be an astonishing $2.7 trillion over the next decade. Democrats are trying to scare the nation by casting aspersions on the Department of Government Efficiency as if the boogeyman is coming for obligated benefits. In reality, DOGE is uncovering fraud and outrageous theft occurring with hard-earned taxpayer dollars, which if not stopped, will jeopardize those whom these programs are intended to help. Our plan empowers congressional committees to implement DOGE's recommendations, ensuring that U.S. tax dollars are spent responsibly -- and that the people's government works efficiently and effectively. If we fail to meet this moment, we risk a full-scale sovereign debt crisis. As debt and interest payments soar, investors, both foreign and domestic, are demanding higher and higher returns before extending any more credit to the U.S. government. Higher interest rates mean ballooning debt service costs, trapping us in a vicious cycle of economic and fiscal decline. Think of it like a homeowner with an adjustable-rate mortgage whose crushing payments keep rising. Eventually, the burden becomes unsustainable, and the homeowner loses everything. America cannot afford to walk down this path any longer. The 2025 budget resolution is more than numbers on a ledger; it is a blueprint for restoring America's security, prosperity, and global leadership. It repudiates the failed Biden-Harris agenda of radical drift and decline and charts a bold course to reclaim the American dream: To preserve the land of liberty and opportunity by reining in the destructive cycle of taxing, borrowing, spending, and regulating that is crushing the American spirit. HAS DOGE REALLY SAVED $55 BILLION? Every generation to come before us has inherently understood their moral obligation not to leave the next generation, as George Washington described in his farewell address, with ""a burden which we ourselves ought to bear."" Every generation stepped up, sacrificed, and exercised the courage needed to fight for the future of our children and grandchildren. Now, it's our turn, and the stakes have never been higher. If we fail, we will be the first generation to leave our country worse off than we found it. If we succeed, under Trump's leadership, we will secure American global dominance for generations to come.

Vance’s trip shows confidence for Gabbard and RFK Jr. confirmations,"Vice President JD Vance is in Europe this week for an AI summit in Paris and a security conference in Munich. Amid looming confirmation votes for Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this may seem like a poor time for Vance, who would be required to cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate, to travel out of the country. Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence, is set for a full Senate vote Tuesday. Kennedy, Trump's nominee for secretary of health and human services, will undergo a Senate cloture vote as soon as Gabbard's vote finishes. Vance has already had to rescue one of Trump's nominees, casting the tiebreaking vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after three Republicans broke ranks. Indeed, both Gabbard's and Kennedy's committee votes passed along party lines, indicating close upcoming votes in the Senate. And with Vance in Europe, Gabbard and Kennedy can only afford to lose two Republican votes to ensure confirmation. Gabbard has already cleared one major hurdle on the path to confirmation, passing a Senate cloture vote 52-46 yesterday. Kennedy's fate, however, is more of an unknown. He won over previous skeptics such as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) during his committee hearings and passed a procedural vote along party lines, suggesting future success. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted against the Hegseth confirmation and is seen as a swing vote, also said she would vote for Kennedy. Vance's trip indicates that Trump has likely secured enough Senate votes to confirm both nominees. After the procedural votes for both candidates, there are indications that both will receive the necessary votes for confirmation. The president would be unlikely to send his VP to overseas conferences if there were any doubt in the confirmation votes. Democrats' continued delay regarding the votes also indicates that Gabbard and Kennedy have enough support. If Vance were the key vote in the process, Democrats would likely want to push the vote through before he returns. Vance's sudden visit to Europe may be a source of worry to some, given the weight of Gabbard's and Kennedy's confirmations. The trip, however, reflects an increased confidence that Trump has sufficient Senate votes to confirm both nominees by Wednesday evening.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T17:07:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3316603/jd-vance-trip-shows-confidence-tulsi-gabbard-rfk-jr-confirmation/
Getting to Denmark,"Sooner or later, the New York Times catches on to the news. In the case of immigration policy, the news that it has caught up with mass immigration , legal and illegal , from less developed countries is politically toxic. That news was relayed on a Feb. 24 article and thread on X by reporter David Leonhardt, a writer of center-left sympathies and a keen analyst of statistics -- and the human realities to which they are useful clues. ""The left has lost power in the U.S., Germany, Italy and Sweden,"" Leonhardt writes. ""Canada and Australia may be next. And the far right is growing across the west. But there is one European country where the left has won re-election and marginalized the far right: Denmark. Why?"" His answer seems, once you think about it, glaringly obvious. ""Danish progressives listened to working class voters on immigration -- and reduced immigration levels."" It's an answer that is entirely congruent with a psephological observation in JD Vance's much resented (among European elites) Feb. 14 speech at the Munich Security Conference. ""No voter on this continent,"" Vance said, ""went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants."" Politicians in Denmark, unlike those in neighboring Sweden and Germany, paid attention to that. Denmark has long been known for its high taxes and generous welfare state, as well as for its democratic norms and opposition to bigotry, as shown by its citizens' ferrying of almost all its Jews to neutral Sweden during the Nazi occupation . In his book The Origins of Political Order , Francis Fukuyama wrote that a nation developing a competent state, the rule of law and public accountability was ""getting to Denmark."" Denmark's national identity goes back a thousand years and it has long ranked high among nations in trust of government and large institutions. And as the political scientist Robert Putnam discovered (but suppressed his finding for years) a large influx of culturally diverse immigrants, as in Los Angeles circa 2000, sharply reduces levels of trust. Which is one reason free market economist Milton Friedman concluded , as Denmark's Social Democrats have, that heavy immigration and a generous welfare state are incompatible. Danes trust that other Danes won't cheat or freeload; about the Muslim immigrants they see across the Kattegat in Sweden, they're not so sure. It's noteworthy that in Munich Vance was careful to say ""no voter on this continent,"" for voters on another continent, North America, voted for opening the floodgates to unvetted immigrants in 2020 and (in Canada) 2021. Joe Biden and the Democrats made no secret that they would undo Donald Trump's relatively effective (after a few rough months) immigration law enforcement. But perhaps many didn't expect that the Biden administration would usher in perhaps five, perhaps seven million illegal immigrants (or that Justin Trudeau would vastly expand Canada's previously successful policy). In retrospect, it seems a clear example of TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) or a logical extrapolation for those ""in this house we believe ... no human is illegal"" signs. For many Americans, any restriction on migration evokes memories of their own forebears from eastern and southern Europe who arrived in the Ellis Island years (1892-1914, 1919-24), and especially for those whose ancestors might otherwise have been murdered in the Holocaust. Interestingly, the post-Civil War surge of 30 million immigrants to the North occurred while only about 1 million blacks and 1 million whites moved from South to North. The wounds of the war had not healed, and employers in the booming industrial North who couldn't attract culturally diverse Southerners were willing to hire culturally diverse Italians, Poles and Jews instead. And in those days the people running America's public schools did a crackerjack job of Americanizing their children. Denmark, by the way, contributed some notable immigrants, including William Knudsen who rose to be president of General Motors and then resigned to accept a $1 a year assignment from FDR to get other industrial leaders to make America the arsenal of democracy even before Pearl Harbor. More recently, notable Danish-American politicians have included patriotic Democrats Sen. and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Today, it's not plain that the United States or European nations need and can assimilate all the millions they have been coming in, a population disproportionately of unattached, low-skill young men from low-trust Muslim or Latin cultures. Unfortunately, today's public sector institutions here and in Europe seem disproportionately staffed by people who believe that assimilation is oppression. Plainly there is some erosion of trust. The Biden open-border policy has tilted the immigrant flow toward law-breakers and violent young men whose crimes Donald Trump has been highlighting. German voters in recent months have watched as Muslim immigrants stabbed three people to death in Solingen in August, killed six driving a car into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, stabbed a baby and passerby to death in Aschaffenburg in January, and, two days before the Feb. 23 election, stabbed a Spanish tourist at the Holocaust Museum in Berlin. Those crimes pretty much cover the German map, and every region saw gains for the AfD party, despite its roots in Communist East Germany and some of Nazi apologist members. The result was a stinging defeat for Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democratic party, founded in 1875 (during the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm I, born in 1797), and for the same reasons as the July 2024 defeat, after failing to stop the inflow, of Britain's Conservative party, founded in 1846 (during the reign of Queen Victoria, born in 1819). Both parties have noble heritages of opposing Nazis and prosecuting the Cold War but have been brought low. The Social Democrats won just 19% , their lowest percentage since 1945. Britain's Conservatives, the world's most electorally successful party, won just 24% in July, and in current polling is now running third with 22% . Meanwhile, as voters saw the results of their open-door immigration policy, America's Democrats, the world's oldest political party, saw their nominee's vote total fall 6 million below 2020, while Donald Trump's total was up 3 million . The case against immigration can be overstated. In daily life native-born Americans mix with Latino immigrants and native-born Europeans mix with Muslim immigrants in shopping malls and fast-food restaurants routinely and politely. But mass immigration of culturally diverse people tends to produce economic stress and erode the trust levels. Traditions of assimilation are weak in Europe and weaker in America than during the Ellis Island era. It's difficult to get the balance right between the benefits and detriments of immigration. What voters have been concluding is that European and American elites have botched the job and that their task now should be ""getting to Denmark.""",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T21:37:59+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3331432/getting-to-denmark/
Stop the Medicaid provider tax grift,"House Republicans are calling for $1.5 trillion in spending cuts next year. Medicaid , the joint federal-state health plan established in 1965 to provide publicly funded health coverage to the poor and disabled, is reportedly where they'll find much of that money. Eliminating so-called ""provider taxes,"" which allow states to game Medicaid's rules to extract more dollars from the federal government, is a great place for Republican reformers to start. Medicaid is long overdue for paring. In recent years, it has swelled to cover nearly 1 in 5 people. Total Medicaid spending exceeded $870 billion in 2023 alone. States run their own Medicaid programs, but much of the funding comes from the federal government. In fact, states receive at least $1 from Washington for every dollar they devote to Medicaid. States receive a whopping $9 for every $10 they spend covering Obamacare's ""expansion"" population -- able-bodied adults earning up to 138% of the poverty level. Forty states and Washington, D.C., have expanded Medicaid eligibility to able-bodied adults. The federal government's promise to match every dollar a state spends on Medicaid and then some has prompted some states to engage in elaborate fiscal gamesmanship to unlock additional federal money. For example, some states levy taxes on healthcare providers and use the revenue to raise what they'll pay those same providers. Those additional payments attract matching federal funds from the United States government. Both states and providers enjoy a payday. Only the federal government loses out. No wonder Brian Blase of the Paragon Health Institute calls provider taxes a form of money laundering. Provider taxes have grown popular. Every state but Alaska has one . In 2022, provider taxes and other ""gimmicks"" produced over a quarter of state Medicaid funding, according to the Cato Institute -- up from 9% three decades ago. MEDICAID CUTS PUT GOP ON COLLISION COURSE IN RACE TO PASS TRUMP BUDGET California's Medicaid program, dubbed ""Medi-Cal"" in the state, provides a prominent example of the provider tax grift. The Golden State first implemented its provider tax in 2005 . Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) expanded the tax to generate an estimated $11 billion for his state through the end of fiscal 2026. Limiting provider taxes could save the U.S. $175 billion over 10 years, according to the House Budget Committee. These handouts from the federal government need to end. Sally C.

Trump’s Latin America realignment puts America first,"It's simple: if you care about problems such as drugs, crime, and illegal migration, you must care about what's happening in Latin America. But for a long time, the region has taken a backseat in U.S. foreign policy. Until now. For the first time in nearly 50 years, the United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has made Latin America the top priority of U.S. foreign policy. One of the most important signals the administration sent was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make his first international trip to Latin America. There, he successfully negotiated with Panama to curb China's influence over the Panama Canal, leading Panama to rescind its agreement with China's Belt and Road Initiative. He also secured an agreement with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for the Central American country to receive criminal deportees to alleviate the U.S. system. Trump has also made it clear that he will not allow socialist puppets of Cuba and Venezuela to undermine American security interests. He confronted Colombia's failed socialist president, Gustavo Petro, demanding that Colombia accept two flights of illegal migrants being repatriated from the United States--and Petro paid for it. Trump demonstrated American resolve and embarrassed Petro on the world stage. The administration has also delivered on its promise to use tariffs to ensure fair treatment from other nations in the Western Hemisphere. After threatening a 25% tariff on Mexican imports, Trump forced Mexico's socialist president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to deploy Mexican national guard troops to our southern border to curb the flow of fentanyl. These things matter because they have an impact on the everyday life of Americans -- and what a great thing that Trump knows and understands that. The actions our partners in the western hemisphere take, or the actions they don't, directly correlate to gang violence in our communities, such as Tren de Aragua members wreaking havoc in Colorado. It goes hand-in-hand with violent criminals who should never have been here taking the lives of our loved ones, heartbreaking scenarios that are very real to people such as Laken Riley's family. It's tied to the kitchen table, where an empty seat marks the loss of a loved one to an entirely preventable fentanyl-related death. Trump promised the people he would address the root causes of migration, drug flows, and illegal migration. Promises made, promises kept. This has been the core motto of the administration's foreign policy toward Latin America--and it's a motto well-earned. The first 100 days of any presidency set the tone for the entire term. We didn't need even a month to see Trump assert that this hemisphere is our sphere of influence and we will not allow our adversaries to take it from us. Not now, not ever. As Chairwoman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am working alongside the president to strengthen relationships with our Latin American partners, establish common ground for mutual benefit with countries that may be skeptical of the U.S., and dismantle the destructive influence of our enemies in the region. To our allies across the hemisphere--from the courageous democratic movement in Venezuela to the Christians in Nicaragua resisting the regime of Daniel Ortega to the brave freedom fighters confronting the repressive apparatus of the Castro/Diaz-Canel dictatorship in Cuba --know this: the United States stands by your side. We are fighting for you and doing the hard work necessary to create the conditions for freedom and democracy to flourish. To those who stand in the way of freedom, who aid and abet cartels, terrorists, and human traffickers, or who ally with China, Russia, and Iran, know this: your days are numbered. A golden age in America will lead to a golden age for the world. No matter what, liberty and prosperity will prevail.

How the Trump administration can take a responsible step toward women’s safety,"The fight over abortion has long been framed as a political battle, but at its core, it is a matter of life and death -- for both mothers and their unborn children. President Donald Trump's decision to call for a study on the safety of abortion pills is a commonsense and necessary step in putting women's health above abortion industry profits. At Heartbeat International, we manage the Abortion Pill Rescue Network and are the world's largest pregnancy help network. Every day, we hear firsthand stories from women who regret taking the abortion pill, with some experiencing physical complications and emotional distress. Many, if not most, of these women express being misled into believing that the abortion pill would be a quick and easy fix, only to find themselves alone, afraid, and suffering the consequences of an industry designed to prioritize profit over protection. Scientific evidence has long shown that the abortion pill regimen, mifepristone followed by misoprostol, carries serious risks, including hemorrhaging, infection, and even death for women taking this chemical concoction. Studies indicate that chemical abortion has a complication rate four times higher than that of surgical abortion, yet instead of strengthening safeguards, the Food and Drug Administration eliminated them. Under the previous administration, even critical in-person medical oversight was removed , leaving women to face these dangers alone with less care. This wasn't a decision based on science or health; it was a reckless move to expand abortion access at any cost, all at the behest of Big Abortion. The abortion industry misrepresents these drugs as safe and effective, all while dismissing the very real stories of women harmed by them. But the facts tell a different story. By removing long-standing safeguards, the last administration opened the floodgates for dangerous, mail-order abortions that put more women in crisis situations with no support and no recourse. This is not progress; it's a dereliction of duty when it comes to women's health and safety. Women deserve better. They deserve real, compassionate medical care, informed consent, and the opportunity to change their minds if they regret their decision. Thousands of women have sought abortion pill reversal, desperate to undo the effects of a decision they felt pressured into making. Their stories , stories the abortion industry refuses even to acknowledge, underscore the reality that the abortion pill is not the risk-free, consequence-free solution it is marketed to be. ABORTION PILLS ENTAIL WORSE PAIN AND BLEEDING THAN SURGICAL ABORTION, STUDY FINDS Trump's willingness to take a hard look at these drugs stands in stark contrast to the blind deregulation we've seen in recent years. A rigorous, unbiased study must be done because women deserve to know the truth, and policymakers must have the courage to act in their best interest. Public servants, elected and appointed, should be first concerned with protecting the public. This is especially true in protecting women from an industry that persistently and perniciously prioritizes its bottom line over the well-being of women facing an unintended pregnancy. Heartbeat International urges the Trump administration to restore the commonsense safeguards recklessly abandoned by the last administration and to ensure that every woman is given the care, support, and medical oversight she truly deserves.

"To get peace, Trump must view Putin’s war for what it is","The United States failed to live up to its best history, values, and long-term interests when it voted against a U.N. resolution on Monday to condemn Russia lightly on the third anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine . President Donald Trump rightly wants to secure a lasting peace that ends this war. It has taken hundreds of thousands of lives and destabilized Europe. But the president must understand that a just peace won't be delivered by hat-tips to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the United Nations. Aside from Israel (which voted in solidarity with the U.S.), every major American ally voted for the General Assembly vote. America's embarrassing allies in the voting ""no"" camp were Russia and a who's who of tyrannies and autocracies -- North Korea, Belarus, and Russian mercenary-dominated Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Even China and Iran voted to abstain. It speaks poorly of Trump's understanding of Putin that he was unwilling even to abstain on this vote. Better is Trump's demand that Europe do more for Ukraine. The president's outlined minerals deal with Ukraine is also a welcome achievement. That agreement will see the U.S. and Ukraine invest cooperatively in Ukraine's energy and mineral resources. This should also consolidate a longer term relationship, which is itself a factor in Ukraine's security. Although this deal should serve U.S. economic interests, it should not be a protocol to strip the benighted nation of its wealth in return for undetermined provisions of future aid. That would amount to extortionist diplomacy natural to Russia and China, not the U.S. But America's vote at the U.N. is concerning. It sought simply to condemn the perpetrator of the largest and bloodiest land war in Europe since 1945. Ukraine's only provocation for Russia's invasion was its refusal to give away its sovereignty. Putin's prewar demand was that President Volodymyr Zelensky make Ukraine a Russian rump state in which any decision over foreign or economic policy had to go through the Kremlin. Of all peoples, Americans should understand why this was unacceptable. Ukrainians want to live free. It is true that the General Assembly is often used, at Russia's behest, to embarrass or otherwise make the U.S. uncomfortable. But moral authority and political credibility must go hand in hand if Trump's peace effort is to succeed. He has revealed to American allies, partners, and aspirational partners that the U.S. can no longer be relied on to call out outrageous state aggression. This undermines Trump's ability to secure the international support necessary for any peace deal. This is especially important as the United Kingdom and France consider whether to take risk deploying peacekeeping forces to enforce any deal Trump secures. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss this concern. But he and French President Emmanuel Macron understandably will not protect any future deal with their troops unless Trump makes clear that America will have their back. Did Trump order the U.S. vote? He clearly believed it would earn the Russian president's respect and favor. Putin may be grateful, but he won't reciprocate Trump. He was taught in a very different school of diplomacy. Trump is a businessman who values personal relationships and the exchange of symbolic favors to grease great deals. But Putin is a former KGB officer, a former lieutenant colonel for the feared Soviet intelligence service, trained to understand that great deals are forged by hard-headed unilateral interest and manipulation. He cares as much for symbolic favors as he cares for his political opponents. More problematic is Trump's apparent belief that Ukraine invited Russia's attack. Allegations that Russia legitimately went to war because it feared Ukraine's accession to NATO are absurd. Russia's military posture along NATO borders is not designed to defend Russia's own territory. Nor was there any agreement within NATO for Ukraine to join the alliance even in the medium-long term. TRUMP MUST STARE DOWN PUTIN OVER UKRAINE PEACEKEEPERS Similarly facile are the claims that Zelensky and former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson prevented an early end to the war by sabotaging 2022 peace talks with Russia. Russia's demand in those talks was unchanged -- the sacrifice of Ukrainian democratic choices to the authority of the Kremlin kleptocracy. Americans would never accept a deal that would make Americans subjects of a foreign power. Ukrainians had the same right. Peace can come if American action persuades Ukraine to make painful territorial concessions in return for surety it will not be invaded again. It will also come only if American action persuades Russia to make its own territorial concessions and accept structures that prevent a future Russian invasion. These fundamentals of peace are what Zelensky and Putin care about in their own way. They are what Trump must leverage to the maximum.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T05:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3329880/to-get-peace-trump-must-view-putin-war-for-what-it-is/
"Mike Johnson’s big, beautiful win","There is still a lot of work to be done, but House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) scored a major victory on Feb. 25 when the House narrowly advanced a budget resolution that was necessary for final passage of President Donald Trump 's legislative agenda. The victory was not an easy one. Johnson spent the day hosting meetings in his office with Republican holdouts, pushing them to advance the top-line numbers to the proper committees of jurisdiction, which will now turn those instructions into actual legislative text. The top-line budget numbers call for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, the details of which will be determined by the House Ways and Means Committee, and $2 trillion in spending cuts. These are spread among several committees, including the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been charged with finding $880 million in cuts that are expected to come largely from Medicaid. By 6:30 p.m. that night, Johnson and his lieutenants thought they had the votes lined up for final passage, but when a trio of Democrats who missed votes earlier in the day suddenly materialized to vote against the budget resolution, Johnson did what good leaders do and recalibrated. The votes weren't there. Johnson had to stop the vote that was already in progress. But he didn't panic. Instead, he called in help from Trump, who secured the final three votes to get the resolution to the 217 needed to advance. ""There's no quid pro quo, but the president assured me that he would work toward cuts, and he's never lied to me,"" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), one of the last holdouts, told reporters. ""He's always been honest about it."" Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) also credited Trump's last-minute intervention, noting his ""personal"" commitment to ""save healthcare and make it better for physical and fiscal health for all Americans."" Being the good team player that he is, Johnson was eager to share credit for the win with the president. ""He was a big help, as always,"" Johnson said with a smile as he left the House floor after the vote. ""Trump helped us with a number of members,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) added. ""Trump has been an incredible ally in this whole process."" This is the way the House should be run by Republicans when the margin for control is so razor-thin. Johnson did a fantastic job listening to members, incorporating their views into the legislative strategy, and moving the ball down the field to where victory was in sight. One sticking point throughout the debate among the Republican caucus was the extent to which Medicaid cuts would be used to reach the spending reduction goals demanded by fiscal hawks and the White House. Johnson finally settled on not using the word ""Medicaid"" in the final resolution while still assigning the size of the cuts expected from Medicaid to the proper committee. This political relief valve apparently enabled several centrists to vote for the bill. By bringing the resolution to the goal line, just three votes away from victory, Johnson was able to call the president in to finish the job, which he did ably. Trump does not have the time or aptitude, and his talents would be wasted overseeing the day-to-day legislative process in the House. That is Johnson's job. But Trump also has tremendous political power he can wield within the party, and Johnson was wise to tap that power when needed. The House budget resolution now heads to the Senate, where it will face some headwinds from Republicans who insist tax cuts in the final legislation should be large enough to be made permanent. As mentioned, the House budget calls for just $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while the Congressional Budget Office placed the price tag of making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent at $4.6 trillion last May. That price has almost certainly gone up to at least $5 trillion, and that is before any of Trump's other campaign promises, such as no taxes on tips, are thrown into the deal. The Senate passed its own budget resolution, one that increases spending on immigration enforcement and defense. These are essential items that need to be funded. But passing them by themselves would reduce the leverage Johnson and Trump need to secure passage in the House. Going with the Senate two-bill strategy could turn out to be the legislative equivalent of having candy before dinner. Johnson knows what is needed to secure his conference, and tax legislation is not going to get the job done. Trump wants one ""big, beautiful bill,"" and Senate Republicans should work with their House colleagues to make it happen. TRUMP IS MAKING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS GREAT AGAIN House speaker is never an easy job, especially when margins are thin and a significant portion of your caucus seems more interested in scoring political points than actually governing. It is nearly impossible when the opposing party controls the White House, making conservative governing outcomes impossible. But Trump is in the White House now. The possibility for real conservative progress to be made on several matters, including cutting government spending, is now very real. Johnson has seen that opportunity, and with Trump's help, he is seizing it. Conservatives everywhere should be thankful that he is where he is to get the job done.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T17:24:19+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3330871/mike-johnsons-big-beautiful-win/
The Biden economic hangover,"THE BIDEN ECONOMIC HANGOVER. Former President Joe Biden left a terrible legacy: the border catastrophe, chaos and disorder abroad, increased crime, oppressive wokeness. But for today's purposes, consider the damage done by Biden's economic policies. Inflation took away 20% of people's purchasing power in a short period of time. Even when the rate of inflation slowed, it is still, right now, rising faster than economists -- or anybody else -- are comfortable with. This week there will be new numbers for inflation in January, and the message again will be that Biden brought inflation on but was unable to fully get rid of it. Now that is President Donald Trump's job. Meanwhile, recent reports have brought word of what the New York Times called an ""unusually large"" downward revision in the number of jobs we thought were created in Biden's final year, since March 2024. The bottom line is that about 600,000 fewer jobs were created in that period than we were told at the time through monthly jobs reports. ""The Biden jobs market was way worse than markets thought,"" Trump White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said recently. ""There's a lot of cleaning up to do."" Then there is federal spending. Biden and his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill went crazy with spending. Coming off the already-high emergency COVID spending of the final year of the first Trump administration, Biden and congressional Democrats poured trillions of dollars unnecessarily into the economy. First, Congress passed a $900 billion ""COVID relief"" bill just after Christmas 2020, as Trump was heading out the door. Biden, then president-elect, strongly supported it. Once Biden was in the White House, he pushed Democrats to pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March 2021. One-point-nine trillion dollars. Did the economy really need a stimulus of that size? It was pretty clear, even at the time, that it did not. A month before it was passed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote that, given the $900 billion stimulus that had already been passed, ""the gap between actual and potential output [of the economy] will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed [American Rescue Plan] stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month. ... That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall."" Biden and the Democratic Party decided to pass the bill anyway, spending $150 billion a month to fix a $20 billion a month problem. That much money flooding the economy was going to worsen inflation. But Biden, who fantasized about being a new Franklin Delano Roosevelt, did not stop there. Later in 2021, he signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill -- this one made possible in part by a minority of House and Senate Republicans who joined Democrats in supporting it. And then Biden took aim at what would be the biggest spending extravaganza ever -- the proposed $2.2 trillion Build Back Better Act. It would spend on everything: climate change, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid, everything. By the time the House passed a version of the bill , in November 2021, inflation had already reached 6.8%. (It would hit 9.1% in June 2022.) Some Senate Democrats got nervous about Biden's reckless spending and forced reductions in the Build Back Better Act. It was downsized to $750 billion, including about $370 billion for climate spending and the rest for healthcare and other expenses. Then Biden gave it a new name: the Inflation Reduction Act. With inflation raging, still going up, and millions suffering, it was an act of supreme cynicism to call a bill that would make things worse the Inflation Reduction Act. But that is what Biden and his Democratic allies did, passing the bill in August 2022. Only now are we learning the true damage the Inflation Reduction Act did. Look at this from the Cato Institute : ""The Inflation Reduction Act was initially touted as a deficit-neutral bill, with its ten-year energy and climate-related provisions projected to cost about $370 billion, offset with tax increases. However, in an upcoming Cato policy analysis, Travis Fisher and Joshua Loucks estimate that the [Inflation Reduction Act] will cost between $936 billion and $1.97 trillion over the next ten years and up to $4.67 trillion by 2050 (and perhaps even more in later years because the subsidies are uncapped.)"" In other words, with the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden and Democratic lawmakers created a perpetual spending machine. It's possible some of them didn't even know what they were doing. ""If I'm being cynical, they may have been misled by advocates who knew how to game the scoring,"" Cato's Travis Fisher told me in an email exchange. ""Even some policy analysts who should know better were fooled by this one."" So were millions of people, of course. And in the end, they didn't get what their trillions of dollars were supposed to buy. In the infrastructure bill, for example, there was $42 billion that was supposed to bring high-speed internet to people in hard-to-reach areas. More than three years later, it has not connected a single person. There was also $7.5 billion to build tens of thousands of electric vehicle chargers. More than three years later, only a few dozen have been built. That makes sense; Biden and Democrats passed money faster than anyone could possibly use it, and even though they raced to shovel cash out the door in December and January, many billions remain unspent. Trump has put a freeze on Inflation Reduction Act funds, and there could be a fight over it in Congress. But none of that changes the final conclusion . Joe Biden, imagining himself to be FDR, did enormous damage to people's standard of living. They will be suffering a Biden hangover for a long time to come.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:48:06+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3317404/biden-economic-hangover/
‘Conception begins at erection’: The absurd theater of the Left,"Ohio Democrats proposed a bill earlier this month to prohibit the discharge of semen except with the intent to fertilize any embryo. Titled the Conception Begins at Erection Act, this Saturday Night Live skit posing as legislation is proof that the remaining leftists in Ohio are neither serious nor likely to find their way out of the political wilderness anytime soon. This is clearly much ado about nothing. The bill has no bipartisan sponsors in a legislature that is dominated by the GOP. It will go nowhere and will get there in record time. However, the two Democratic legislators are hijacking the most essential process of self-government for absurd leftist theater. According to a report from the Statehouse News Bureau , the bill contains exceptions for masturbation, using a condom, and ""the LGBTQ community."" The two sponsors said their bill was designed to ""regulate the reproductive rights of men,"" according to the outlet. The effect of the bill would be to prevent any heterosexual couple, but no one else, from engaging in sex unless they want to have a baby. There is no assertion as to why this outcome would produce any benefit whatsoever, and legacy media outlets have not pressed the question. Nor did they ask whether taking a law of general application and leaving out a group of people who cannot be objectively defined would be constitutional, much less desirable public policy. One might as well propose a bill that regulates car sales but excludes vegans. The sponsors did explain vaguely that they were reacting to past pro-life legislation that only applied to women, although in what appeared to be a concession that there are only two sexes, state Rep. Anita Somani, an OB-GYN, said, ""We need to look at it from the broader perspective of regulating one sex and not the other."" Since her bill does precisely that, the only logical conclusion is that she is abusing her privilege as a legislator to make a partisan political statement with a proposed law that she has no intention of passing. Neither the Democratic sponsors nor the media discussed the serious question of why this legislation was timely or even needed in a state that has enshrined a broader-than- Roe v. Wade right to abortion in its state constitution. No matter. The bit of absurdity provided a rare opportunity to use the word ""erection"" in a headline, and the politicians and media collaborative got to share a clickbait giggle. Dave Yost is Ohio's 51st attorney general, serving his second term. He is a candidate for governor.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-18T11:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3321972/conception-begins-at-erection-absurd-theater-left/
Rubio must reverse the Biden administration’s designations of US allies,"One year ago, Marco Rubio and seven other senators penned a letter to then-President Joe Biden expressing concerns over Secretary of State Antony Blinken's misuse of sanctions in Latin America and the Caribbean. ""Since January 2021, the overwhelming majority of public designations made under Section 7031(c) have targeted officials in Latin American and Caribbean governments that have cooperated with the United States on strategic diplomatic and national security interests,"" the senators pressed. The senators expressed deep concerns about politicizing the sanction process and seemingly targeting politicians on the Right and ignoring ""egregious actions in the region by others."" They urged Biden that the administration ""must immediately explain the process and criteria it has used since January 2021 to designate individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean under Section 7031(c)."" This may seem like an American, right-wing, or human rights concern. Still, as stated in the letter from the Republican senators, it is not just a U.S. problem and especially not just a concern of Latin America and the Caribbean. Among the eight, Rubio is acting as President Donald Trump's secretary of state. By expressing concerns over U.S. allies' designations and demanding the Democratic administration review and reverse them, Rubio has set a clear precedent. He must now uphold it. Enter Sali Berisha, a former president and prime minister of Albania who visited the White House twice in the early '90s and was received by Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton. In 2007, Berisha welcomed the first and only U.S. president to visit Albania, George W. Bush. Berisha was and is a staunch ally of the United States, aligning with American interests on everything from the Middle East to Russia, from NATO expansion to the war on terrorism. Berisha's fall from grace came in May 2021 when Blinken designated him for ""undermining democracy"" and ""significant corruption."" Ironically, Blinken himself, while a senior adviser to Vice President Biden, lauded Berisha and his government's anti-corruption efforts. Other U.S. Democrats once felt similarly. In 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a speech in Albania's parliament, when Berisha was prime minister, stating that ""if one wants to see democracy in motion, one should come to Albania."" Berisha blames billionaire George Soros and his cronies in the U.S. for his designation. Case in point, George's son Alex Soros has been a mainstay in Albanian and Balkan politics since Prime Minister Edi Rama came to power. Former chief of the FBI's New York counterintelligence office Charles McGonigal's involvement in Albanian affairs should not be brushed aside. He was sentenced to 28 months in prison by a Washington, D.C., court for this involvement, accepting bribes from Albanian individuals set in motion by Rama's office, according to the Justice Department file, and pushing the FBI to open an investigation into Berisha's right-wing Democratic Party. Now that Rubio is in charge and Blinken is out, will Rubio reverse Blinken's policies and condemnations of right-wing U.S. allies, not only in Latin America and the Caribbean but also in southeastern Europe? Many in Albania think Rubio will do so. Some point to an interesting reason: Being a descendant of anti-communist Cuban immigrants, he knows what communism is. Albania and his grandparents' country have one thing in common: having suffered dearly under the communist joke. Berisha's designation is nothing less than a new international Left trying to expunge its right-wing rivals. Alfred Lela is a U.S. citizen and director of press and communication for Albania's right-wing Democratic Party.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T11:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3311024/rubio-must-reverse-the-biden-administrations-designations-of-us-allies/
An early look at the Virginia governor’s race,"In the next set of off-year elections , the Virginia governor's race will likely be the most contested. Since Virginia governors can't run for consecutive terms, Republicans will need to find a candidate to replace current Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA). Youngkin won the 2021 governor's race over Terry McAuliffe by about two points in a state that former President Joe Biden carried by over nine points against President Donald Trump in 2020. During his election, Youngkin successfully walked the line of appealing both to Trump supporters and never-Trump voters. Youngkin's victory proved that Republicans can still win a statewide election in Virginia, even though the state has moved left over the last two decades. Youngkin has enjoyed positive approval ratings throughout his term and some polls indicate that he is one of the more popular governors in the nation. His name was floated in vice president considerations before Trump picked JD Vance. Although there is no incumbency advantage in the race, the fact that Virginia has a popular Republican governor may be helpful to other Republican candidates looking to win in November. Two Republicans and one Democrat have declared their candidacy. Current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R-VA) will face investigative reporter Merle Rutledge in the Republican primary, and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is currently running unopposed in the Democrat primary. However, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA) is considering a run and could challenge Spanberger for the nomination. The most likely matchup currently looks to be Earle-Sears against Spanberger, who represented Virginia's 7th Congressional District from 2019-2025 until she decided to step down from her seat to run for governor. Earle-Sears's path to nomination got easier after Youngkin gave her his endorsement, and current Attorney General Jason Miyares sought to run for reelection rather than challenge her for the nomination. The primary elections for both parties will take place on June 17. Early polling indicates a small lead for Democrats. Spanberger currently leads Earle-Sears by between one and five points. Democrats will also be running on a high after they took control of the House of Delegates in the 2023 midterm elections. However, Republicans have reason to be optimistic. First, Earle-Sears proved that she could win a statewide race when she won the lieutenant governorship in 2021. Second, voting numbers in the state indicate a shift to the right. Although Biden beat Trump by nine points in 2020, former Vice President Kamala Harris only carried the state by five points. Harris was more unpopular than Biden was in 2020, which may account for the difference, but the numbers indicate a path for Earle-Sears. Also, although the polls show Spanberger leading, most feature a high percentage of undecided voters. When those voters begin to break, there will be a clearer picture of where this race is heading. The Virginia governor's race is currently a toss-up. Democrats will be looking to ride the trend from the last midterm elections, as well as historical state trends, while Republicans will be looking to bank off Younkin's popularity to elevate Earle-Sears to the governorship.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T22:07:53+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3310524/early-look-virginia-governor-race/
Is Disney back to putting families over politics?,"One of the hopes from the 2024 elections is that major corporations such as Disney would reevaluate to whom they are trying to appeal. It appears that the House of Mouse is finally starting that self-reflection. In the aftermath of the election, Disney has changed course on some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The changes are modest, but they include reorienting performance factors for executive compensation away from diversity and inclusion and toward values that promote business success. Disney is also taking off the condescending trigger warnings from the beginning of classic films such as Peter Pan and Dumbo , instead exiling them to the details sections of those films. Disney is also reportedly reevaluating the costs at its Disney parks, with the percentage of people planning return trips to Disney parks dropping. In Anaheim, California, the cheapest tickets start at $104 per day for just one of the two parks, Disneyland or Disney California Adventure, with tickets often going past $200. That is the cost for just one adult, with the total cost of tickets for the whole family, as well as food costs in the parks, making visiting Disney a one-time experience for many families. These changes show that Disney is at least looking to appeal again to the majority of normal people who aren't obsessed with race and to families who simply want to be able to afford what Disney is offering. Even before the 2024 elections, there were signs that Disney was coming around. The company stood down from the political fight it picked with Florida Republicans, and Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted that the quality of Disney's entertainment was declining. It is a welcome shift from the woke corporate posturing that plagued the 2010s and was amplified in 2020. Google, McDonald's, Target, and Walmart are among the major corporations that have been reevaluating and removing their DEI policies. But none has the influence over children and families that Disney has through its entertainment offerings. For Disney to be focused on eliminating divisive DEI policies and on making itself more affordable for families is a massive step in the right direction. Disney never had to make itself a soldier in the political Left's culture war. By exiting that culture war and focusing on appealing to families, Disney can once again be the family-friendly entertainment company it used to be remembered as, so long as it continues to stay out of the racially divisive DEI movement moving forward.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T21:38:46+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3318406/disney-families-over-politics/
Can the nones be converted?,"New York Times columnist Ross Douthat did not write his new book Believe for me personally (that honor appears to belong to The Atlantic 's Derek Thompson, who is mentioned in the introduction), but it is at least written for people like me. ""I am a believing Christian,"" Douthat says, explaining his motive for writing the book, ""but I am not attempting a wholesale defense of Christianity ... I think our moment could use something more basic, an argument that tries to lay a general foundation for religious interest and belief, to persuade skeptical readers that it's worth becoming a seeker in the first place, and to provide guideposts and suggestions for people whose journeys begin in different places or take them in different directions."" Douthat appears to be speaking to a relatively new group of Americans, the ""nones,"" although he does not use that term in the book (he has in his columns, though). This category of nones includes atheists and agnostics, but these nonbelievers are actually a minority within a minority. Most nones believe in God. They just don't identify as belonging to any organized religion. And this unorganized believing mass actually outnumbers any one church. At 28% of all adults, nones now outnumber evangelical Protestants (24%) and Catholics (23%). As one might expect, the youngest generations are the most likely to identify with the nones. Some 42% of Generation Z belong to the group as opposed to just 21% of the Silent Generation. Unlike atheists, who are overwhelmingly male, college-educated, wealthy, and urban, the nones are more evenly balanced between genders, are not college-educated, and are less likely to vote or volunteer in their communities. ""There are 80 million nones in America today,"" political scientist Ryan Burge writes in his book The Nones: Where They Came From, Who They Are, and Where They Are Going , ""and they all got there by a different path."" Like a growing number of nones, I was raised without any religion at all. My mother was actually a novitiate when she left the Catholic Church years before she met my father in the summer of 1968. Neither of them attended church when they met, nor did they start attending one after they had me 10 years later. It's not that they spoke ill of any particular religion. They were both liberal Democrats who hated Republicans generally and Ronald Reagan specifically, but they did so entirely on secular grounds. If anything, they often encouraged me to attend services with believing family friends, so I would have the experience of what religion was like. I mostly enjoyed these services, but I could never shake the feeling of being a tourist. Mostly, religion never came up, and I rarely thought about it until my father finally lost a long battle with cancer during my freshmen year in high school. At that point, I sought out more spiritually themed material, ultimately coming to the conclusion that God must exist since the direction of both evolution (from single-celled organisms to us) and human civilization (from hunter-gatherer tribes to global empires) revealed an ever-growing complexity that pointed to some higher power that humans, as of now, cannot explain. Douthat's first argument for the existence of God makes a similar case, although he stresses evidence that the universe was made for humans specifically more than I feel is necessary or warranted. His later arguments for the existence of God -- consciousness can't be explained through science, nor can the supernatural experiences of other people -- may move others toward belief, but they left me wanting. (Dogs and snakes are conscious, too; how does that prove God exists? It's nice that other people have experienced the supernatural, but that doesn't help me believe anything.) Douthat then pushes the reader to move beyond mere belief in God and into a specific religion, arguing that ""the idea that you are better off putting together a religious worldview entirely of your own ... presumes a lot upon the strength your individual intellect and moral compass, to say nothing of more supernatural questions."" It's better to choose one of the older, bigger traditions that have proven through their age and popularity that they represent ""an advancement, a convergence, toward a truer picture of reality."" A good place to start, Douthat argues, is ""whatever religious tradition seems to have been placed before you, whether through familial inheritance or social connections or political and cultural affinities, and hope that God placed it there for some good reason."" Fair enough. My parents were raised Catholic. Most of my conservative colleagues are Catholic. I just wrote a book arguing that the Catholic Church's teachings on sexual ethics were essential for the birth of democracy . Catholicism seemed like a good place to start. And, to be honest, there is much to love about Catholicism. ""So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."" Matthew 7:12. ""Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all."" Mark 10:44. ""For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does."" Corinthians 7:4. But as much as I may want to believe all of the Catholic teachings, I just can't. The genealogies in Matthew and Luke are different. The last words of Jesus on the cross are different in Mark, Luke, and John. Who first goes to Jesus's tomb, what they see, and what they are told are different in all four Gospels. There are explanations that smooth over these contradictions. I've read them. I don't find them convincing. I want to believe. I just can't. There is a moment in Douthat's book when he recounts a late-night debate with the author and famous atheist Christopher Hitchens, who asked Douthat, ""Suppose that Jesus of Nazareth really did rise from the dead ... Well, then what exactly would that really prove?"" For me, it would prove a lot. But I want to flip that question back on Douthat. Suppose that Jesus did not rise from the dead. What would that prove? Would the beatitudes be any less true? Would the sexual ethics of the church suddenly be false? Would the parable of the Sheep and Goats be any less of a compelling guide for moral behavior? If Christianity is a map of reality (an analogy Douthat uses for all religions in the book), is the map worthless without the resurrection? I truly don't wish to disaffect anyone's faith. It is precious. Treasure it. Pass it down to your children. If anything, I am writing to reinforce how hard religious belief can be regained once lost. After growing for decades, the percentage of nones seems to have leveled off at about 30% . This is good because organized religion does have many benefits for society, including engendering trust among strangers, encouraging civic participation, and supporting young men and women who want to get and stay married. ELON MUSK, FATHERHOOD, AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY And I do hope Douthat and his colleagues are successful in bringing back more into the fold. I just have my doubts.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-27T16:33:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3331985/can-nones-be-converted/
Democrats backed DOGE for years — until Trump took over,"The United States is $36 trillion in debt , and Washington, D.C., continues to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars. Instead of efficiency, people have gotten an ever-growing bureaucracy that wastes taxpayer dollars and is unaccountable to the public. This is exactly why President Donald Trump's initiative to implement the Department of Government Efficiency represents a bold step toward draining the bureaucratic swamp, forcing federal agencies to streamline, modernize, and justify their spending. But the biggest irony of the backlash against DOGE is who is leading the resistance. DOGE is actually the new name for the United States Digital Service, which then-President Barack Obama created in 2014 . For years, Democrats praised it. They had no problem when Obama and Joe Biden's USDS embedded Silicon Valley insiders deep in our federal agencies, including giving engineers access to Medicare's mainframe , which processes billions of dollars in payments every year. USDS ballooned into a bureaucratic mess with little accountability, but because its politics aligned with the Democratic Party, its access to sensitive government systems was never questioned. But now that Trump has renamed the USDS the DOGE and enlisted one of the most brilliant innovators of our time, Elon Musk, to reform our bloated bureaucracy, the same people who cheered USDS are trying to incite a riot outside the Treasury Department. The same people who let USDS tinker with Medicare's billion-dollar payment system now want to block Trump from cutting waste. Under Obama and Biden, employees of the USDS were described as ""idealistic tech workers,"" while Musk is described as an ""oligarch"" and his team labeled as ""young"" and ""inexperienced."" The hypocrisy is nonsensical. Contrary to reports, members of the DOGE team do not have access to people's sensitive details or information, and they cannot stop payments. As they work to audit federal agencies, they are monitored by agency officials. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was confirmed by the Senate, granted the DOGE team access to the Treasury's payment system in a read-only capacity to review the overall efficiency of the system. But government reform shouldn't be a partisan issue. DOGE represents a turning point in how our government operates. For decades, despite my attempts to get reforms, Washington's default solution to inefficiency has been to throw more money at the problem. But Trump knows better -- real reform means cutting waste, not feeding it. If Democrats were truly serious about responsible governance, they would be applauding Trump. Instead, they're doing what they do best: protecting the bloated status quo. I made a pledge to my constituents to stop the spigot of spending, and with Trump back in the White House, we will not accept the status quo. We are committed to cutting waste, reining in spending, and building the golden age of America.

White MSNBC hosts should offer their jobs to Joy Reid,"Diversity is the country's biggest strength. Diversity is what makes the country great. Diversity makes us stronger. Left-wing political talk show hosts often parrot these statements. It's a contemporary dogma at the epicenter of the Left's ideological beliefs and political agendas. It fuels their race-based obsessions. As loyalists to their cause, liberal Democrats , particularly affluent, white liberal Democrats, emphasize the importance of diversity and regularly explain why it is needed. This is usually followed by a cult-like devotion to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and programs. They advocate the hiring of non-white and non-Asian people for economic and academic opportunities throughout the country, often at the expense of white people. They routinely call for a great cultural revolution and societal restructuring. They complain about jobs, academia, award shows, and various other cultural elements as being ""too white."" That is, unless it involves their own jobs. Look no further than MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow 's meltdown Tuesday night regarding the network canceling the show of Joy Reid , a miserable, deceitful, dishonest, and manipulative commentator with absurdly poor ratings. Maddow went so far as to insinuate that MSNBC was racist for canceling a show that was among the network's least-watched. It was another example of how race is the only thing that matters to left-wingers like Maddow. Performance doesn't matter, only skin color. ""In all of the jobs I have had in all of the years I have been alive there is no colleague for whom I have had more affection and more respect than Joy Reid,"" Maddow said. ""I love everything about her. I have so much more to learn from her. I do not want to lose her as a colleague here at MSNBC, and personally, I think it is a bad mistake to let her walk out the door. It is not my call, and I understand that, but that's what I think."" Another white MSNBC host, Chris Hayes echoed similar sentiments. ""It was a really devastating blow that Joy Reid's show ended last night and that she's leaving MSNBC altogether,"" said Hayes. ""I really am going to miss her enormously,"" Hayes said. ""I'm also completely, absolutely confident she's going to continue to be a central voice in American politics at this critical time, particularly at a time when media is expanding in all sorts of amazing ways, and people are doing all kinds of new things."" However, if Maddow and Hayes are so dismayed, I propose a simple solution: they should give Reid their job. Likewise with every other white host on MSNBC who championed diversity in recent years and was critical of Reid's show being canceled. It would align with all the calls for diversity that they all preached for years. What better way to show a commitment to a political cause than to do the very thing left-wingers have been asking everyone else to do for years now? If diversity makes us stronger, then let Rachel Maddow, or any white liberal talking head at MSNBC, show the country their immense strength and offer their job to Joy Reid. MSNBC HOSTS SWARM TO SUPPORT JOY REID AND CONDEMN NETWORK THAT FIRED HER But Maddow won't do this, of course, and neither will Hayes or any of their white colleagues. These people have no problem calling for other white people to lose their jobs under the guise and deception of diversity, having done so for years. They only care about diversity causes and initiatives when they are protected from its consequences and ramifications. They do not want to practice what they preach. They want to preach and others to practice it.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T20:14:25+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3330618/white-msnbc-hosts-should-offer-their-jobs-joy-reid/
Democrats’ abortion cult is getting even more morbid,"The Democratic Party is so obsessed with promoting abortions that the New York government is going to the mat for a doctor who helped kill a teenager's unborn child against her will in a different state where abortion is illegal. The legal feud playing out between Louisiana and New York shows just how committed the Democratic Party is to its sacrament of abortion. In January, officers received a 911 call from a girl under 18 who was apparently dealing with a miscarriage, according to West Baton Rouge District Attorney Tony Clayton. It was determined at the hospital that she had taken abortion medication, which is illegal in Louisiana. According to Clayton, the teenager had apparently planned a gender reveal party and did not want to get an abortion. The teen's mother, who allegedly ordered abortion pills from New York and gave them to her daughter, has been charged with violating the state's abortion ban. Louisiana also charged the doctor who provided the pills with ""criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs."" Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) and Attorney General Letitia James are both boasting that the doctor will not face consequences for knowingly sending illegal abortion pills to Louisiana and having a baby killed against the will of the mother. Hochul, in fact, has vowed to ""do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential."" New York has ""shield laws"" in place that allow its doctors to send abortion pills to states where the pills are banned under the protection of the New York government. Not content with widespread legal killings of unborn children in its own state, New York's legal regime protects doctors who outsource these killings to states with abortion bans. It does not matter in this case that the mother of the child did not want an abortion, nor that these abortion drugs are dangerous if their usage isn't monitored by a professional, as was clear with the death of Amber Thurman in Georgia. The Democratic Party's obsession with abortion has no limiting principles and takes a back seat to nothing. Hochul and New York Democrats are enthusiastically cheering the exportation of abortion to states that have banned it and to women who don't even want it. And they will continue to do so as long as these ""shield"" laws are allowed to stand by the Supreme Court.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T18:50:59+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310324/democrats-abortion-cult-getting-more-morbid/
Trump’s order on transgender procedures is a win for religious liberty,"At every turn, young people are told that if they want to change their God-given gender, they can do so with a snap of their fingers and with sweeping permission from our nation's highest leaders. But it does not take policy expertise or a medical degree to know that sterilization and puberty-blocking drugs are not authentic medical care. Fortunately, President Donald Trump issued an executive order putting a stop to child mutilation and the confusion that has taken hold of countless hospitals, including private Catholic hospitals once committed to respecting the dignity of every person. His effort should be applauded as an important first step toward protecting young people. FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT Trump's executive order is unapologetic. Going forward, it reads, the U.S. government ""will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures."" It outlines what children and young teenagers frequently experience after attempting to surgically change their physical characteristics. They eventually realize, for example , that ""they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding"" or soon discover that they are ""trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization."" It is a great tragedy of our time that so many young people are being told that these harmful procedures will make their lives better. Trump's executive order begins to undo countless actions taken by the Biden administration to force-feed reasonable Americans the notion that sex-change surgery is the compassionate way to ""treat"" people questioning their gender, when the very opposite is true. Trump explicitly calls on HHS to end the Biden administration's harmful redefinition and application of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Intent on imposing a destructive gender ideology on the American people, the Biden administration in 2024 amended rules pertaining to Section 1557 to force people of faith to fund abortion and transgender surgeries through their health insurance plans. Section 1557 reinterpreted the definition of ""on the basis of sex"" to include ""gender identity"" and ""termination of pregnancy."" Revising the act delivered a forceful blow to American Christians, who make up nearly 70 % of the U.S. population, not to mention countless others who disagree with this redefinition. But Biden's HHS went a step further. In a blatant attack on religious liberty, the administration required religious doctors and other medical professionals to perform gender-transition procedures no matter their own personal beliefs about doing so, while denying them the opportunity to opt out even for religious reasons. The policy from the Biden HHS department forced Catholic hospitals into a difficult choice: either comply with the order or shut down and cut off entire communities from healthcare. As a direct result of the Biden administration's policies, far too many children have been put through the physical and mental agony caused by gender ideology in places where it should never exist. Nearly 150 Catholic hospitals across the country have given vulnerable children hormone therapy or performed gender-transition surgeries between 2019 and 2023. Out of more than 520 minors who received treatments in these Catholic hospitals, ""more than 150 had surgeries to alter their appearances to resemble the opposite sex, while more than 380 children were given puberty blockers or hormone therapies,"" according to a recent study from Do No Harm, an organization devoted to keeping politics out of medicine. Catholic hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers have no business engaging in any of these activities, which run counter not only to good medicine but the teachings of their faith, too. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has affirmed that transgender interventions are opposed to Catholic moral teaching and voted to move forward with updating its guidance for Catholic healthcare institutions, insisting that these institutions must not perform any such interventions. Thanks to the president's executive order, it is my hope that soon families will once again have access to life-affirming care, free from harmful political agendas that damage or destroy patients' health and well-being. For now, Trump's executive order will help Catholic medical institutions -- and many others -- adhere to the highest standards of authentic medicine as well as Catholic social and moral teachings. Faithful Americans must continue to reject the dangerous, life-altering, and irreversible experiments on children that are happening across our nation in the very institutions that should be protecting them. Let us join hands in setting a high standard of care for every patient that affirms their inherent dignity and worth. Chris Faddis is president of Solidarity HealthShare , a health care sharing ministry guided by the moral teachings of the Catholic Church that negotiates directly with providers to ensure delivery of high-quality and affordable, life-affirming health care for the more than 46,000 members it has served since 2016.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T17:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/3317773/trump-transgender-order-win-for-religious-liberty/
Contrived controversy: The Left attacks Vance and Musk,"Jerry Seinfeld's old joke about the Chinese ""really hangin' in there"" with the chopsticks, more than 1,500 years after the advent of the fork, applies well to the Democrats and their liberal lapdogs in the media : They are really hanging in there with the Nazi card. The latest effort came in the embittered response by Democrats to the rousing speech our newly elected Vice President JD Vance delivered to stunned European leaders at the 61st Munich Security Conference in Germany. Vance warned the crowd that Russia and China are less worrisome than ""the threat from within,"" as governments in the United Kingdom and across Europe rein in free speech and punish their citizens for posting supposed hate speech on X and other platforms. This was a courageous defense of the God-given, First Amendment-guaranteed human right to freedom of speech that is the bedrock of the United States. Yet Democrats acted as if our vice president had burped in church. ""The mood ... was one of absolute shock,"" Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA), who was in the audience, told MSNBC's Ari Melber. Americans who were present were ""embarrassed,"" he said, adding , ""And what's most dangerous about this is what one Republican adviser told me after the speech. ... He said to me, 'Seth, if you listen, listen carefully. It's actually much deeper and darker.' He was talking about 'the enemy within.' This is some of the same language that Hitler used to justify the Holocaust."" In fact, the specific sound bite, ""the enemy within,"" is sometimes associated with the Holocaust but was also used by the discredited demagogue Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s to perpetrate the Red Scare. Robert F. Kennedy Sr. released a book with the same title in 1960, using it to describe organized crime and the Teamsters. Unembarrassed by this bad-faith attack, Moulton went for the JD jugular: ""Just after the speech, Vice President Vance went to the old Nazi Party headquarters in Munich to meet with the leader of the modern-day neo-Nazi Party in Germany. So what was bad at Munich could actually get worse. This is a very, very dangerous administration."" The truth is much more mundane: Vance met with the leader of the Alternative for Germany party at the Westin Grand hotel. The German government has labeled this opposition party as a ""suspected extremist"" organization, but the Biden administration demonized MAGA in a similar vein, leaving one to guess that this extremism may be greatly exaggerated. The Democrats and their media acolytes were similarly feckless in trying to play the Nazi card against Department of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk, accusing him of offering up a ""Heil Hitler!"" salute onstage at a Trump rally after the inauguration. Cue contrived controversy from the media ( see CNN anchor Erin Burnett) and dimwit Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Musk wore a medallion around his neck for over a year in honor of the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas. He met twice with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called for the annihilation of the terrorist group. Musk has said he is pro-Jewish, with a Jewish name (in Hebrew, ""Elon"" means ""oak tree""). MARCO RUBIO DEFENDS JD VANCE'S LECTURE ON FREE SPEECH Thus, Musk responded to this fake flap with derision, posting on X: ""It was astonishing how insanely hard legacy media tried to cancel me for saying 'my heart goes out to you' and moving my hand from my heart to the audience. In the end, this deception will just be another nail in the coffin of legacy media."" Score that 1-0 for Musk. In the rough and tumble on social media, Musk gives as good as he gets. Playing the Nazi card against Team Trump is losing all of its power. The Democrats, oddly, have yet to learn this.

Has Trump greenlit aggression on Armenia?,"During their campaign, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance both cultivated the Armenian community and promised to right the wrongs inflicted on Armenians during the Biden administration. Writing on Truth Social on Oct. 23, 2024, Trump pledged, ""I will protect persecuted Christians, I will work to stop the violence and ethnic cleansing, and we will restore PEACE between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" Later that day, Vance echoed this commitment. ""The United States should fight against the persecution of Christians all over the world."" Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also sided with Armenia against external aggression. The betrayal looming for Armenians may surpass that of the previous administration, which swore that the U.S. would not tolerate ethnic cleansing only to culminate with U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Mark Libby symbolically celebrating it by participating in an Azerbaijan-sponsored propaganda tour of towns cleansed of their Armenians. The problem is Russia. Beyond the Baltic States, no country other than Ukraine has pivoted further to the West than Armenia. In the 1990s, as Armenia first sought to detach itself from Russian diplomatic domination, a Russian-backed terrorist attack decapitated the government, killing the reform-minded Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan, National Assembly Speaker Karen Demirchyan, two deputy speakers, a minister, and three members of Parliament. In 2018, Armenians again pivoted away from Russia as protests against Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan's third term culminated in a popular revolution. One reason Russia betrayed Armenia in the face of Azerbaijani aggression against both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia proper was the Kremlin's cynical belief that Armenians would reject the post-2018 order and pivot back to Moscow. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan lost internal support, but Armenians continued to reject the status quo ante. Subsequent assassination and coup plots likewise backfired. Whenever Russia clumsily sought to interfere, the backlash drove a wedge further into Russia-Armenia ties. Pashinyan, meanwhile, antagonized Russian President Vladimir Putin further, embarrassing him at summits and tilting even further toward Washington. With Putin poised to seize the initiative and perhaps even win the Ukraine war, Russian power is resurgent. The problem for Armenia is that Putin, as a former KGB agent, has a mindset antagonistic to democracy and holds a grudge. Should Russia consolidate diplomatic, if not territorial, control over Ukraine, the outcome to which the Trump and Vance policies would lead, then pro-Western, democratic Armenia will be in the crosshairs. Perhaps the spark will be a false flag -- the assassination of a Russian diplomat or businessman in Yerevan, for example -- or perhaps Putin will dispense with any excuse to make the lesson stark. Either way, Armenians should expect the noose to tighten. Russia will cut off fuel deliveries, freezing Armenians and grinding industry to a halt. Armenian exports into Russia-dominated Georgia will end next. Then, as far as Putin is concerned, it will just be a waiting game until Armenians flee their country or accept Russian domination. TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT 'ETHNIC CLEANSING' LEAVE ARMENIANS 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' Perhaps France will help Armenians for a time, but Putin calculates this will be too little too late. If the U.S. is not willing to help the far more strategically significant Ukraine, under what logic would it risk Russian antagonism to help Armenia? What happens to Ukraine will not end in Ukraine. Trump, Vance, Gabbard, and others said all the right things during the campaign, but the time is now for them to explain whether they were treating Armenian Americans for fools or if they have some unknown or undefined strategy to prevent Armenia from becoming Putin's idea of Ukraine 2.0.

Trump continues to show that tariffs work,"The leaders of Canada and Mexico agreed to terms with President Donald Trump regarding border security on Monday. To combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, Trump issued an executive order Saturday imposing a 25% tariff on imports from both countries. The tariffs were to remain in effect until the end of the crisis. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was quick to agree to Trump's terms, sending 10,000 border patrol agents to stop the flow of illegal immigration. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also agreed to terms later the same day. ""I just had a good call with President Trump,"" Trudeau said in a Monday post on X. ""Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan -- reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border."" Trudeau said he would employ a ""fentanyl czar"" to stop the flow of the harmful drug across the border. As a result of the agreements, Trump delayed the implementation of the tariffs by 30 days in both countries, pending final agreements on the matter. ""I am very pleased with this initial outcome,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. ""The Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured."" Both leaders caved one week after Colombian President Gustavo Petro blocked U.S. aircraft carrying deported illegal immigrants from landing. Petro initially refused to take the migrants, claiming that the United States was not treating them with dignity and respect. Trump immediately promised a 25% tariff on Colombian goods, which would be raised to 50% the following week. Trump also threatened a travel ban on Colombian nationals and suspension of visas for Colombian government officials. After initially promising to retaliate with tariffs of his own, Petro stepped back and agreed to take deported illegal immigrants, even offering his presidential plane to help with deportations. The events of the past week showed that Trump's tariff policies have benefits in addition to generating government revenue. According to the World Bank, the U.S. is the biggest trade partner in exports from Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. With the U.S. a large part of their economies, a loss of business would be more costly to the countries than sending troops to defend the border. Trump has shown that for some countries, the mere idea of tariffs is enough to make them reconsider their immigration policies. Some politicians may doubt the efficacy of tariffs, but Trump has shown that, at least for immigration, it is far more effective than any policy the previous administration attempted.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-04T20:05:10+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3310112/trump-shows-tariffs-work/
The many problems with Trump’s Gaza plan,"President Donald Trump is standing firm on his plan to relocate ""permanently"" more than 2.1 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip to neighboring countries. Trump said the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop the territory to serve as prized real estate on the Mediterranean Sea. Trump told Fox News's Bret Baier that those living in Gaza would not be allowed to return. Some commentators say the president should not be taken literally. They argue that Trump is attempting to secure greater regional efforts to support Gaza's postwar development. That by dangling a deeply unpopular idea of displacing the Palestinians out of Gaza, America's Middle Eastern partners will have to offer better alternatives. What these arguments fail to recognize, however, is that Trump's rhetoric complicates rather than encourages greater regional support for efforts to stabilize Gaza and secure Israel. As a primary case in point, Saudi Arabia has already made clear that the potential for a peace agreement with Israel is being greatly undermined by Trump's proposal. And while it's true that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has other priorities than the plight of the Palestinians, his supplication to a forcible relocation is a nonstarter. It would fundamentally undermine the crown prince's key priority of establishing himself and Saudi Arabia as the rising global power of modern Islamic leadership. Similarly, while Jordan is heavily reliant on U.S. aid, King Abdullah II would risk imploding his rule were he to tolerate Trump's Gaza ownership plan. This would be a disaster for the U.S. both in terms of what might follow Abdullah's government and what its loss would mean for Washington. The Jordanian GID intelligence service is regarded by U.S. intelligence officers as the most reliable of all Middle Eastern intelligence partners in its service of U.S. security interests. The General Intelligence Department is viewed as even more reliable than the Israeli Mossad, which works to a distinctly Israeli agenda on Middle Eastern issues. This is not a peripheral concern. Alongside the Saudi intelligence services, the GID was instrumental in infiltrating the Islamic State during the heydays of the terrorist group's 2013-2017 caliphate. This infiltration cost the lives of many GID officers and agents but helped prevent numerous mass casualty attacks in Europe and against American targets. Allies like Jordan are hard earned and deserve American efforts to maintain their stability. This is especially important, bearing in mind the deep Arab affinity for personal honor and trust. Trump's Gaza plan serves the opposite interest. Trump's plan is impractical on paper and would cause great damage to U.S. and allied interests in practice. But Trump's very articulation of his idea is already causing damage to U.S. interests. Even if their regimes are autocratic in nature, the Saudis/Sunni Arab monarchies, Jordanians, and Egyptians now face escalating domestic populist pressures against their alliances with America. Trump is seen to be pushing a nakedly imperialist effort not simply to sidestep Palestinian aspirations but to crush them. Worse, Trump's ""America will own Gaza"" and ""Palestinians won't ever be able to return to Gaza"" rhetoric is a near pitch-perfect replication of exactly that which jihadist propagandists have long accused American policy in the Middle East of pursuing. Osama bin Laden, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei might have diverging ideologies and interests. Still, all of them have had great success in mobilizing young Muslim men to their otherwise perverse causes by falsely portraying the U.S. as an evil empire that is determined to dominate Muslim peoples. The crux of their arguments has been supposed American support for Israeli efforts to subjugate the Palestinians. It is for this reason that the overwhelming majority of U.S. counterterrorism specialists strongly oppose Trump's Gaza rhetoric. While some supporters of the president wish to portray these critics as delusional left-wing activists, they include a large number of Joint Special Operations Command and CIA counterterrorism officers who made their careers finding and killing Islamic terrorists without remorse. Put simply, the serious voices opposing Trump's Gaza plan cannot be characterized as Code Pink morons. Regardless, there's another glaring problem with Trump's proposal: Even if the U.S. were able to persuade allies to host Palestinians from Gaza, many Palestinians in Gaza would refuse to leave. A large number of Palestinians would likely even take up arms to defend their homes. Their number would include a great many not affiliated with terrorist organizations. This bears note in light of Trump's incomprehensible argument that the U.S. military would not be required to secure Gaza. The natural implication is thus either that the Israel Defense Forces will forcibly clear Gaza for the U.S. or that Palestinians in Gaza will suddenly somehow collectively decide they want to leave. Neither possibility is credible. The military costs of forcible relocation of Palestinians in Gaza would be very heavy for Israel, entailing street-to-street fighting and clashes with mixed groups of terrorists, armed civilians, and unarmed civilians. The diplomatic impact on Israel would be catastrophic. The moral impact would also be highly problematic for the Israeli psyche. After all, the forcible relocation of an ethnic group from its home would stir traumatic memories of the Jewish people's darkest days. That leaves the U.S. military option. Would Trump support such an action so utterly at odds with American moral authority and strategic interests? Doesn't Trump insist he wants to avoid ""stupid wars"" rather than start them? The heavy weight of evidence against Trump's plan leads its supporters to make somewhat outlandish claims in support of it. Trump's first-term ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, claims that Palestinians want to leave Gaza but then implicitly recognizes that many may not want to do so. He then excuses this not-so-insignificant truth by declaring that ""from a moral perspective, they have forfeited the right to the land which they have destroyed."" Friedman justifies this argument by pointing out that Palestinians in Gaza elected Hamas in 2006. And while this is true, Hamas has long wielded power through coercion, violence, and bribery. Opposing Hamas in Gaza is a recipe for death. In turn, a vote for Hamas does not justify the forced relocation of 2.1 million people from their homes. Indeed, I would argue that the collective punishment of ethnic cleansing is antithetical to Israeli and American moral values. What I suspect really motivates much of the Israeli-American support on the Right for Trump's plan is how it would affect the future of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy -- namely, by extinguishing even the longer-term prospect of a two-state solution, which led to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has further fueled the optimism of the anti-diplomacy movement by suggesting that he might soon recognize full Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, much of which includes Palestinian settlements. But in contrast to the anti-diplomatic movement, I would argue that it is in the U.S. national interest to maintain political space for a two-state solution, which carries with it hardened guardrails against future terrorism against Israel. Yes, Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, atrocity and the ensuing Israeli military response means that there is no reasonable prospect of a two-state solution being reached in the short term. But to eradicate even the future possibility of a Palestinian state would be fuel to the jihadist fire. Again, it cannot be emphasized enough how much this conflict serves as a nuts-and-bolts terrorist recruitment tool for young Muslim men. In the same way, only a Palestinian state that provides a sense of dignity alongside opportunities for prosperity will be able to divert young Palestinians and other Muslims away from terrorism. Other moral considerations notwithstanding, that concern is reason enough for why former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and first-term Donald Trump all attempted to pursue a two-state solution. Trump's greatest moral impulse is his desire to secure historic peace agreements that break decades, if not centuries, of cycles of war. But the president's plan to dislocate Palestinians from their home is both immoral and impractical. And it would cause grievous harm to U.S. interests.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T18:58:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3318161/many-problems-trump-gaza-plan/
The Resistance 2.0 power rankings,"The sudden power vacuum at the top of the Democratic Party has created a fresh competition to steer the Democratic ship through the political wilderness. A melange of contenders has emerged from across the Democratic sweep: Squad sisters, media mouths, graying senators , and motley liberal luminaries vie for the influence and notoriety that come with being ""the face"" of the party. To be sure, there was no shortage of signs that the Democratic Party's coalition was fraying in the Biden era. The party's activist base split with Democratic leadership on a number of fronts: over arms deals with Israel, the merit of law enforcement and borders, and the depth of commitment to gender ideology and the Green New Deal. Before President Donald Trump's decisive victory in November, only a shared hatred for him and love for abortion seemed to unite them. But Trump's win shredded the glue that kept the party together, delegitimizing establishment leadership in the process. The various ""houses"" that have controlled the Democratic Party this century have all fallen to Trump's sword. Team Obama failed to deliver the White House after commandeering the Kamala Harris campaign. The Clinton faction has moved into the private sector or aged out, with James Carville the lone surviving figure of political relevance. The Biden team, cast aside in humiliating fashion last summer, never had a tight grip on the party to begin with. These power rankings hope to accurately capture the state of the race to lead the Resistance 2.0. Here is the board as it stands today: 10: Boss Hogg David Hogg, the newly elected vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, has come a long way since first gaining notoriety as a student activist following the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Busting into the inner sanctum of Democratic politics less than two years removed from college is no small feat, though it isn't clear if his rise has more to do with the party's disarray than his political talent. He'd be higher if not for recent headlines, including reports that he's been using the DNC's phone list to solicit donations for his personal political action committee. But if you ask me, that just proves he knows how to play politics like a true donkey. 9: Chuckles This might be low for a highly visible Senate minority leader, but Chuck Schumer's glow has never been duller. In the span of a month, he's been clowned by Jon Stewart and mocked by former Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) as ""depressing"" for chanting "" we will win "" with other senior citizens outside of the Treasury. He's also under investigation for blatantly threatening Supreme Court Justices at an abortion rights rally -- and indictment isn't unrealistic. Schumer only makes the rankings at all because of his considerable institutional power. But you have to think Schumer's twilight is looming. 8: The Nutty Professor Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is sizzling mad and wants you to know it. She's mad about DOGE dicing up her beloved Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s ability to sue drug companies, and Pete Hegseth prioritizing lethality over social justice in the armed forces. She's piping hot about the Disney-Fubo deal. In February, Warren stuck her angry mug in front of every camera she could find. Trump and Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk pop champagne each time. 7: Stephen A. Smith Smith, the frenzied sports commentator teasing a celebrity White House run, gets no nickname because he at least appears serious. So far, he's running the Trump 2016 playbook by leveling tough truths at his party, particularly on the transgender issue, and wielding the sort of unfiltered authenticity that voters currently crave. Last week, Carville, the ultimate party insider, warned Smith to ""stick to sports."" Not long ago, Republican insiders told Trump to stick to reality TV. Smith is already polling above household Democratic names such as Sen. Corey Booker (D-NJ) and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. 6: Princess Jasmine In February, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) said she's rooting for Canada and Mexico against the U.S., banning men from competing in women's sports ""doesn't protect women,"" and that Republicans are ""less educated folks."" On Tuesday, when asked outside the Capitol what she'd say to Elon Musk if they spoke directly, she brushed her hair from her eyes and said, ""F*** off."" In other words, Crockett has catapulted herself into the race to become the face of the party. Her penchant for virality has her arrow pointing up. 5: Pothole Pete Former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg is the Democrats' communicator par excellence. His preternatural calm and ability to make terrible ideas sound reasonable make him a valuable asset in these dark times. The gay and married war veteran was built in a Democratic candidate lab and fine-tuned at McKinsey and Co. So why hasn't Buttigieg taken the reins? Two reasons: 1. His record in government is abysmal, both as a mayor and a Transportation Secretary. 2. He's a non-human cyborg. Appearing at a forum at the University of Chicago this week, Buttigieg slammed the Democrats' approach to DEI for ""making people sit through a training that looks like something out of 'Portlandia.'"" It's a perfectly reasonable take, of course, and it's obviously good politics in this climate. The problem is that he's been one of DEI's biggest supporters. He frequently touted his commitment to ""equity"" during his run at Transportation and famously decried the ""racism"" built into our highway system. The sudden shift elicited ire from the Left and groaning from the Right. The episode distilled Buttigieg's struggle to grab the Democratic mantle despite looking and sounding the part. 4: Cuban? Billionaire Mark Cuban is one of only a handful of high-profile liberals outside the party establishment who commands headlines and a massive audience at will. And despite recently morphing into Rachel Maddow , he's emerged as a fierce party critic in recent weeks, sharing the same lane as Smith but with billions to back it up. Appearing at the Principles First Summit in Washington, D.C. last week, Cuban said 2024 taught him that ""Democrats can't sell worth s***"" and blasted their ""democracy is on the ballot"" pitch. ""Voters didn't give a f*** about J6 or abortion,"" he added. This immediately set the establishment press abuzz with 2028 speculation: Was Cuban implying that he was the party's best pitchman? ""Hell no. It's not going to happen,"" Politico reported him saying. But if he changed his mind, he'd shoot to the top in a hurry. 3: Bern, baby, Bern! Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) hasn't aged a day since his runs for president in 2016 and 2020, has he? I mean, he looked old back then, too. But he hasn't lost much on his fastball. Sanders has been liberated following the establishment's implosion. ""It should come as no surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,"" he stated the day after Kamala Harris's defeat. And he has every right to gloat: He read the Trump-era electorate accurately and saw this coming. They didn't. In late February, Sanders hit the road with his ""Fighting Oligarchy"" tour in Omaha, where he railed against wealth inequality and framed the current political struggle as between working families and billionaires like Elon Musk. It isn't a fresh take, but it has a better shot at meeting the needs than anything else Democrats are currently doing. And while Sanders is likely too old to lead the party, the fierce loyalty he still commands could make him the party's most sought-after kingmaker. 2. The Salad Spinner Did you know that Kamala is still out there talking about... something? About once a week, a video emerges of Harris attempting to connect a dot to a small crowd of loyalists who painfully nod along, hoping, waiting, please God, just make her stop. Here's what she said a couple of weeks ago backstage at a Broadway show: ""Look at what I mean this beautiful play and everything we know at the end... we have to be cleared-eyed. We're seeing a U-turn right now. For those rights to be maintained which means we have to be vigilant. It's just the nature of it. We have to be clear-eyed. And it doesn't mean we don't see the beauty in everything. These things all co-exist, but I believe we fight for something, not against."" Even her scripted remarks at the 2025 NAACP Image Awards last week were barely decipherable. And yet - and yet! - the early 2028 Democratic primary polls have her obliterating the field at this point. That alone is enough to put her at or near the top of these rankings -- for now. But in truth, it's impossible to predict her political future. So many divergent paths feel plausible, from making a strong push to recapture the Democratic nomination to accepting the presidency of a small liberal arts college. But as long as her polling remains high, she is in the top tier. 1: The Bronx Bomber Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) plays across Democratic factions -- the activists, the suburban lib-moms, the late-night talkers, and the rising podcasters -- better than any other figure. Her combination of youth (already a political veteran, she's only 35), magnetism, and political savvy has enabled her to maintain her broad appeal among Democrats despite near constant derision from the Right over the past six years. The Republican obsession with her boosts her already unmatched visibility in the same way the Democratic obsession with Trump keeps him perpetually in the headlines. And in this political environment, visibility is power. She knows that, and she knows how to wield it. In February, two of the rising Left's media gatekeepers, Mehdi Hasan and MSNBC's Jen Psaki, all but crowned her as the party's leader, the former praising her confrontation with Tom Homan, the latter scolding party elders for passing over the ""young, fearless, connected"" AOC to lead the House Oversight Committee. But the slight only further cemented her status as the face of the next generation of Democrats.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-26T20:55:53+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3331185/the-resistance-2-0-power-rankings/
A new day for border security and the rule of law,"Just one year ago, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 300,000 southwest border encounters in a single month -- a record. On Jan. 26, no southwest border sector experienced more than 200 border apprehensions. In fact, one of the busiest sectors along the southwest border, Del Rio, Texas, only recorded 60. Indeed, President Donald Trump has done more in the first 100 hours of his administration to secure our borders than former President Joe Biden did in his entire presidency. First, Trump took executive action to declare an emergency and surge resources to the southwest border, including mobilizing 1,500 additional active-duty troops to assist with border security operations. While these measures may seem drastic, it's important to remember how we got here. For four years, Biden, former Vice President and ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, and former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas refused to enforce our nation's laws or defend our sovereign borders, inflicting chaos and destruction on communities across this country. In just the first week of Trump's presidency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 2,373 illegal immigrants nationwide in targeted removal operations. Many of them had criminal histories, including murder, sexual assault, and even a connection to foreign terrorist organizations. These illegal immigrants never should've been given the opportunity to roam free in our communities in the first place. By the last summer of Biden's presidency, nearly 650,000 criminal illegal immigrants in the country were not in ICE detention, 35,000 of whom were convicted of or charged with either murder or sexual assault. This number includes both criminal immigrants encountered and released by CBP, immigrants released after committing crimes due to sanctuary city policies, and even some of the 2 million known ""gotaways"" who evaded apprehension at the border. While border encounters and releases rose to record highs, deportations of criminal immigrants dropped 74% under Biden compared to Trump's first term. ICE officers were significantly obstructed by the Biden administration from fulfilling their duty to remove criminal immigrants from our communities. Now, Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and ""border czar"" Tom Homan have sent the message that America will fully enforce the laws on the books, starting with removing dangerous criminal illegal immigrants. In 2023, Chief Border Patrol Agent John Modlin of the Tucson Sector told my committee that illegal immigrants had begun turning themselves in along the border ""because they believe they're going to stay in the United States."" With the stroke of a pen, Trump ended catch-and-release and empowered Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers to do their jobs -- both between and at ports of entry. In the last two years, a staggering 1.5 million inadmissible immigrants were unlawfully paroled into our communities, with insufficient vetting, at ports of entry nationwide under Biden's Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan and CBP One app mass-parole scheme. The committee learned in 2023 that for months, around 96% of the inadmissible immigrants who scheduled appointments via the CBP One app were released on parole -- not ""on a case-by-case basis,"" as the Immigration and Nationality Act requires. Even worse, the fraud in the CHNV program was so brazen that even the previous administration temporarily paused applications. In his first week, Trump ended this abuse of parole and reinforced ICE's authority to swiftly remove these inadmissible immigrants. The impact of the Trump administration's actions doesn't stop at the border. By securing our borders, the president is also dismantling the cartels' business model and weakening their influence in the U.S. In a 2023 transcribed interview with my committee, a Border Patrol sector chief confirmed that cartels consider Americans living near the border inside ""the theater of engagement."" It's no surprise -- the Biden administration's era of open borders and antienforcement policies gifted these cartels an estimated $14 million per day in profit from human smuggling alone. Now, Trump has set in motion the process to designate certain cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which would create a whole-of-government effort to combat their deadly human and drug smuggling operations. Even as threats from these desperate criminals continue, our front-line law enforcement can now breathe a sigh of relief with Trump back in the White House. Under Biden, Border Patrol agents were not just overworked but also prevented from accomplishing their true mission in the field. I spent time at the border with our CBP officers and agents. I saw their exhaustion and falling morale firsthand. I heard from their loved ones about the emotional and physical impacts of the Biden border crisis. Now, these agents know they have the support of their president as they carry out their sworn duty to protect Americans. If Trump's first week in office is any indication of the next four years, every American has reason to hope. The days of our sovereignty being taken for granted are over. Promise made. Promise kept.

Trump can ‘reset’ relations with Iran’s mullah regime,"Diplomatic resets have a bad name in Washington, D.C., these days, ever since former President Barack Obama promised one with Moscow in 2009, then oversaw the collapse of U.S.-Russian relations, including the never-ending Ukraine crisis and war. There's nothing wrong with resetting bad relations between rivals, so long as any reset is grounded in geopolitical reality rather than the naive wishes of the Obama-Biden foreign policy set, which birthed so many needless reversals in American power over the last two decades. President Donald Trump' s second administration offers the chance for a reset with Iran precisely because he was tough on the mullah regime during his first term. The last time he was in the Oval Office, Trump projected strength toward Tehran, including sanctions that limited Iran's ability to harm American allies and interests, plus scrapping Obama's cherished Iran deal on nuclear development. Moreover, Trump applied lethal force against Tehran in a limited but effective fashion. Cemeteries worldwide are filled with allegedly indispensable people, but occasionally, someone turns out to be irreplaceable. The death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020, at the hands of the U.S. Air Force, was a game-changing event for the Middle East. On Trump's orders, the Pentagon assassinated Soleimani, who, for more than two decades, was the top terrorist for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as the head of its special operations arm, the Quds Force. As the Quds Force boss, Soleimani directed what Tehran calls ""liberation movements"" across the Middle East, waging war on Israel and the West, especially the United States. A cagey strategist, Soleimani had more blood on his hands than Osama bin Laden, including hundreds of U.S. military personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan by Soleimani's militias. As the second most powerful man in Iran, behind only Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Soleimani had enormous influence over all of Tehran's interactions with the West. Soleimani was the architect of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance"" strategy to pressure Israel and America across the Middle East through proxies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, various militias in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Palestinian resistance groups, preeminently Hamas. Soleimani grasped that while Iran is a weakling in conventional military terms, with dilapidated armed forces incapable of confronting America and its allies on the field of battle, Tehran possesses powerful asymmetric tools to challenge Western might in the Middle East. What a difference five years make. The Guard vibrantly mourned Soleimani's death and threatened to avenge him with murder plots against Trump and top U.S. officials, but he hasn't been meaningfully replaced . Ever since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, with Iranian-supplied weapons, the Axis of Resistance has fallen apart. Gloves off, the Israel Defense Forces crushed one Iranian proxy after another. Hamas is more down than out, but Gaza has been shattered, and the Palestinian armed struggle against Israel hasn't been this weak in decades. Israel's assassination of Hamas political boss Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024, sent a pointed message to the mullahs. In Lebanon, IDF strikes decapitated Hezbollah and revealed that the group's military power, despite over 40 years of Guard investment in training and equipping Hezbollah, is distinctly limited. Then, the collapse of Syria's Bashar Assad regime, a key Iranian ally, unraveled Tehran's entire strategic position in the Levant. IDF conventional strikes on Iran, especially its nuclear program, were answered with Iranian missile barrages that were brusquely blunted by U.S. and Israeli cooperation with timely intelligence and anti-missile defenses. Tehran's massive investment in ballistic missiles, instead of more conventional airpower, was revealed to be a grand blunder. Simply put, Iran lacks any significant military capability against Israel, much less the U.S. Only the Houthis, in faraway Yemen, are keeping the Axis of Resistance alive, hurling Iranian missiles at Western shipping in the Red Sea, yet they have failed to cut off international trade routes. This strategic shift against Iran offers an opening for Trump if he wants one. There's worry in Tehran that the new administration may employ the U.S. military to attack Iran's nuclear development program directly, which is assessed by Western intelligence to be getting close to weaponization, after decades of fits and starts. Certainly, U.S. Central Command possesses precision strike capabilities, including deep-penetrating bombs and real-time intelligence, which the IDF can't dream of. Together, CENTCOM and the IDF might deliver Iran's nuclear ambitions a painful blow that would set them back into the next decade. Then again, they might not. The difficult truth is that if a kinetic solution to the Iranian nuclear dilemma could be assured to buy time -- several years, preferably a decade, of delay in atomic weaponization -- the Pentagon would have done this long ago. Such a comprehensive strike was considered not just during the last Trump term but during the presidency of George W. Bush. Every time, the political risks were not deemed acceptable, given the variables at play. Now that Tehran has concluded a mutual defense pact of sorts with Moscow, termed the ""comprehensive strategic partnership treaty,"" the threat of Russian response to any major U.S. interest must be considered. It would be wiser to give the mullahs a bloody nose not at home but against their last proxy standing that's seriously fighting the West. Yemen's Houthi rebels have proved a thorn in the side of global trade, forcing the U.S. Navy to deploy ships on station for months to keep international shipping lanes open. The Biden administration, in line with its broad policy of not challenging Tehran, even when it behaves badly, kept the Pentagon on a short leash against the Houthis. It's time to unleash the Pentagon against the Houthis. To date, CENTCOM strikes in Yemen against Houthi critical nodes have been restrained. Trump should take off the leash and let our Navy and Air Force take down Houthi bases, command posts, and logistical sites. Iranian shipments of weapons, especially missiles, to Houthi proxies should be interdicted harshly. That will send the mullahs a clear message without threatening Iran at home. Hit the Houthis hard, then seek parley with the mullah regime. Here, Trump possesses one clear advantage over his predecessors: His White House isn't penetrated by Iranian sympathizers as Obama's and Biden's were through three terms in office. The Democrats allowed suspected friends of Tehran, of dubious loyalty to the U.S., including known Israel-haters, to occupy top national security positions. Some of them can be plausibly termed Iranian agents. They're gone now. No longer can Tehran count on having its allies on the other side of the negotiating table in Washington. This changes the game in both intelligence and diplomatic terms. Tehran is already signaling that it's open to talking with the Trump administration. Last week, Khamenei criticized the White House while signaling that parley is possible despite tough rhetoric from regime-connected senior clerics. Moreover, another senior cleric who is deemed a decent bellwether for regime views, Mohsen Qara'ati, just compared discussions with Trump to a difficult divorce: ""Even when ending a relationship or in conflict, one shouldn't destroy all bridges at once,"" he explained . ""There should always be a path for return."" This week, Iran's foreign ministry denied that there's a diplomatic back channel forming between Tehran and Washington, which means that there probably is. It just can't be admitted yet. Trump is the master of making threats and showing strength to induce discussion and, if possible, then birth a deal that seemed unattainable before. If he confronts the mullahs with strength, a reset with Iran can come into focus. John R.

Biden’s EPA caught in blatant political corruption,"In 1905, George Washington Plunkitt made arguably the most famous defense of political graft in American history. ""Everybody is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft,"" the New York state senator and Tammany Hall member wrote, ""but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft."" Plunkitt was responding to The Shame of the Cities , a book by journalist Lincoln Steffens that exposed sweeping political corruption in U.S. cities. The ward boss's shameless defense of ""honest graft,"" which is still assigned to undergraduates a century after Plunkitt's death, comes to mind when looking at the fraud, waste, and abuse Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and others are uncovering. To take but one example, consider the billions of dollars in taxpayer funds the Environmental Protection Agency awarded last year to Power Forward Communities. If you've never heard of the nonprofit group, you're forgiven. Almost nobody has -- because it didn't exist until late 2023. Power Forward Communities had no footprint, online or otherwise, until October 2023, when it was announced as part of the Rewiring America program , an organization linked to former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, which says its mission is ""all about Rewiring America's values, people, and culture."" Less than a year after its creation, Power Forward Communities was awarded $2 billion via the EPA's National Clean Investment Fund -- even though it reported just $100 in revenue during its first three months of operation. The payment, which is slated to continue through June 2031, caught the attention of Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator. ""It's extremely concerning that an organization that reported just $100 in revenue in 2023 was chosen to receive $2 billion,"" Zeldin said . Indeed. It's graft on a scale the Tammany Hall charlatans couldn't have imagined. Historical sources say 19th-century politician Boss Tweed and his ring of cronies took in at least $50 million in corrupt money in backroom deals, kickbacks, and skimming before Tweed was convicted of larceny and forgery in 1873 and fled to Cuba, and later Spain. In 2025 dollars, that's about $1.3 billion -- considerably less than the single payoff former President Joe Biden's EPA awarded Power Forward Communities. People will contend that this type of graft, defined as the unethical use of a politician's authority for personal gain, differs from Tammany Hall's, and they're right. Political corruption changes from generation to generation, as do the laws that codify what types of graft are illegal and which are unethical. The line between the two is blurry, and nobody understood this better than the Tammany Hall ring, whose members built one of the most famous graft machines in U.S. history, one that continued well after Tweed's indictment and eventual death. Tammany Hall became an infamous symbol of political corruption in U.S. history, but it wasn't unique. Steffens, who published his book in 1904, traveled not just to New York but also to cities such as St. Louis, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis, documenting how local lawmakers misappropriated public funds and maintained power through bribery and patronage. The book galvanized an apathetic citizenry into action and led to state and federal reforms that cracked down on corruption, including regulations on how government contracts are awarded. For example, many states today require competitive bidding for contracts over certain thresholds, understanding that no-bid contracts are a recipe for political favoritism, nepotism, and backroom deals, not to mention inflated costs. The $2 billion handout to Power Forward Communities, a fly-by-night operation with political ties to the White House, is a textbook example of how politicians abuse power and waste scarce resources. If it's not unlawful, it's certainly unethical. Yet Plunkitt would no doubt approve. ""If I have a good thing to hand out in private life, I give it to a friend,"" Plunkitt innocently wrote. ""Why shouldn't I do the same in public life?"" The obvious answer is that the funds are not Plunkitt's to give. Still, his candid quip exposes the progressive mind, which sees ""honest graft"" as no different from the entrepreneur who uses his own capital and that of willing investors to offer products and services to customers. DOGE COMES FOR CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL As Musk and company continue exposing blatant graft and corruption, the attacks against the Tesla founder are likely to grow. DOGE isn't just bringing sound business practices to Washington -- it's uncovering waste, fraud, and abuse that would make Boss Tweed and the Tammany ring blush. It's unclear how much naked corruption people are willing to tolerate in a deeply divided nation, but DOGE and administrators such as Zeldin deserve credit for bringing sunlight to the corrupt political machinery of Washington. Hopefully, it proves as galvanizing as it was for the reformers of the early 20th century who determined that Tammany Hall-style graft would not be condoned or tolerated.

Farmers and small businesses need the tax cuts to be permanent,"Rural communities face a looming crisis if Congress allows certain provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to expire at the end of this year or soon after. These provisions are critical to ensuring that the positive economic impacts of that landmark legislation continue to be felt by rural families, businesses, and entrepreneurs. The TCJA was one of the biggest, most popular, and most effective pieces of legislation passed during the first Trump administration. For rural families and small businesses, particularly family-owned farms, the tax cuts enacted by the TCJA provided much-needed relief by doubling the ""death tax"" exemption and tying it to annual inflation rates. This is just one of the many provisions set to expire at the end of the year if lawmakers don't act. If that happens, it could force rural families to sell their farms or businesses and pay up to a 40% tax bill to boot. Farmers and other rural businesses benefited from a range of other provisions in the law. These included lower marginal tax rates, the child tax credit expansion, and provisions that enabled farmers and rural businesses to immediately expense research and development and equipment. Being able to expense these investments helps rural businesses that use heavy machinery continue to upgrade their equipment and improve workplace safety. According to an Agriculture Department study , when these TCJA provisions expire at the end of the year, farming households will see their tax liabilities soar, with ""moderate-sales farm households"" experiencing the biggest increase in tax liability percentage-wise as marginal income tax rates increase. Call it what you want, but this amounts to a tax hike that rural families and businesses simply cannot afford. Lawmakers in Congress have thankfully chosen to fight to preserve these vital tax provisions. House Republicans recently made an initial step in extending these lifelines to farmers by passing their new budget reconciliation plan. Allowing businesses to invest their money in their employees, operations, and growth rather than larger tax inlays to the government for spending is something we should all get behind. However, Congress must also avoid the temptation to increase the corporate tax rate of 21%, which the TJCA lowered from 35%, to help ""pay for"" these tax cuts and key provisions. Any increase in the corporate tax rate is a threat to Main Street and small businesses in rural America. That matters because small businesses are the beating heart of the economy. These same small businesses benefited immensely from the TCJA, with many of them choosing to restructure as C-corporations because of the incentives created by the legislation. Raising the corporate tax rate would put these businesses in jeopardy, especially as so many are already struggling to survive the high inflation brought on by the last administration's failed economic policies. Lawmakers in Congress should work together to reauthorize the pro-growth, pro-innovation tax policies and provisions passed as part of the TCJA and help keep rural economies and communities stronger and more secure.
