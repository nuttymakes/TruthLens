"Trump rides the vibes, for better or worse","After a flurry of activity — the president’s tariff threats and showdowns with Mexico and Canada, his expressions of interest in Greenland , the policy changes obtained by Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trips to Panama and El Salvador, the release of arrested Americans in Venezuela — it seemed clear that the focus of Donald Trump’s foreign policy would be the Western Hemisphere. And then, just a few days later, as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the first head of government to visit the White House, Trump announced that “the United States will take over the Gaza Strip.” This is obviously in tension with Trump’s and many Trump supporters’ opposition to U.S. military actions and “nation building” in the Middle East, and while Greenland is arguably within the Western Hemisphere, Gaza clearly is not. Cleaning up and policing Gaza doesn’t sound like a way for Americans to avoid endless wars and violence, as Trump says he wants. On the other hand, looking for outside-the-box solutions sometimes works. It had been gospel among Middle East specialists that Israel couldn’t achieve diplomatic relations with Arab nations without sanctioning the establishment of a Palestinian state first. But the Abraham Accords that Trump negotiated between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and with Bahrain in 2020 did exactly that. As the Abraham Accords suggested, so Trump’s proposal that the U.S. “take over” Gaza jogs the mind and, as Fox News’s Brit Hume writes , moves people “away from the endless pursuit of a ‘two-state solution,’ which has proved such a dead end.” Maybe in some better direction, though no one, including Trump, seems to have an idea of exactly what. In September 2016, the Pittsburgh-based reporter Salena Zito explained that while “the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally.” To them, he signals the kind of “make America great again” change he seeks, even where his proposals, as on Gaza, seem ludicrous on their face. Almost 10 years later, economist Tyler Cowen advances a similar explanation. “Trumpian policy,” he argues , “elevates cultural policy above all else.” The cultures of the foreign policy establishment, of great corporations, of public schools, of public health and scientific research — none is in great shape. So whenever “the policy or policy debate pushes culture in what you think is the right direction, just do it.” Assume that “the cultural factors will, over some time horizon, surpass everything else in import.” Don’t worry about other constraints, whether it’s legal, whether it will persist. Much of it probably will. Democrats and journalists hope the courts will put the kibosh on Trump’s initiatives. But at some point, this lawfare runs up against the first words of Article II of the Constitution : “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” His orders to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs have the backing of the large majority of people of all ethnicities and hues who oppose racial quotas and preferences — and the text of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. His termination of foreign aid programs that advance widely unpopular cultural stands, the hill Democrats are choosing to die on this week, are likely to stand as well. His threats to impose huge tariffs on Canada and Mexico, while economically ruinous if put into effect, prompted promises of increased border surveillance. His instant and massive retaliation against Colombia’s refusal to accept deported immigrants resulted in immediate surrender there and a preemptive surrender by the Maduro government of Venezuela, whose legitimacy the United States and the European Parliament refuse to recognize . Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, confirmed by only a 51-50 Senate vote, is reporting that Army recruitment has had its “best recruiting numbers ” in a dozen years in the two months since Trump was elected. A change in the culture resulting from Trump’s abolition of DEI and Hegseth’s emphasis on the “ warrior ethos ”? Not clear, but sort of looks like it. Whether Trump’s tactics and unorthodox policy initiatives will produce his promised peace in Ukraine and deter China from attacking Taiwan is far from certain. Clearly, some of Trump’s executive orders and policy directives are carefully vetted, while others — the Gaza acquisition? — are not. If one of his audacious bluffs gets called, the resulting damage could prove horrifying: Think seriously about the wreckage those 25% tariffs would have inflicted on auto supply chains. On foreign policy, matters of war and peace, damage could be orders of magnitude worse. After two weeks, Trump’s job approval is hovering around 50% , higher than at any point in his first term, but still below that of all other incoming presidents since 1953. But the “vibes,” what John Maynard Keynes would have called “animal spirits,” of the nation seem to have shifted. The death of former President Jimmy Carter last December reminded us that some of his policies — transportation deregulation and a defense buildup — helped produce the accomplishment and morale boost of the 1980s. But in his “malaise” speech — he never actually used the word — he admitted that the nation’s “vibes” were negative. They turned positive under his successor, Ronald Reagan, though he entered office with job approval not much above Trump’s, with positive material consequences for America and the world. Could something like that happen again?",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T17:47:51+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3311520/trump-rides-the-vibes/
Ignore Trump’s Gaza distraction. Focus on Iran,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with President Donald Trump , the first post-inaugural White House visit by a foreign leader, could shape the Middle East for generations. Pre-meeting speculation centered on how the leaders would handle the Hamas-Israel war. Stunningly, Trump’s comments just before and then after his meeting with Netanyahu focused on the U.S. taking control of the Gaza Strip while Gaza’s residents are resettled elsewhere in the Middle East. There is little point in commenting seriously on this “idea,” which appears to be entirely Trump’s own. The most important strategic issue in the real Middle East remains Iran’s existential threat to Israel. Tehran’s ayatollahs can only be delighted if the Trump administration expends any time and effort at all on the Gaza idea rather than addressing their nuclear weapons program. Restoring the “maximum pressure” campaign from Trump’s first term is a sound decision, but still only the beginning of an effective strategy. Since Hamas’s barbaric Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Israel, with U.S. assistance, has dealt Iran and its “ring of fire” strategy major blows. Hamas and Hezbollah have been decimated but not destroyed. Iran’s ballistic missile production facilities and its sophisticated, Russian-supplied, S-300 air-defense systems have been all but eliminated. Syria’s Iran-friendly Assad regime has fallen, and its S-300 systems and other military assets have been destroyed. Unfortunately, the Houthis in Yemen, West Bank terrorists, and Iranian-controlled Shia militias in Iraq are only wounded, and not severely. The job is unfinished, but enormous progress has been made to diminish Iran’s overall threat, especially its terrorist surrogates. The existential danger remains: Its nuclear program is essentially intact, with only one location, the Parchin weaponization facility, attacked . Looking ahead, the central issue remains how to destroy Tehran’s nuclear weapons efforts, which threaten not only Israel but also constitute a major proliferation threat to America and the world. Eliminating this menace is Netanyahu’s real top priority, but it should not be solely Jerusalem’s responsibility. The United States is the only country that can stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (chemical and biological as well as nuclear). For America and Israel, there has never been a better time to do just that, using carefully targeted force against Iran’s nuclear arms facilities. Accordingly, Israeli-American objectives should be victory against both Iran’s nuclear and terrorist threats. In World War II, Prime Minister Winston Churchill explained to his countrymen why this was the only acceptable outcome: “victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.” The real debate is between those advocating victory and those advocating the Obama-Biden approach: endless negotiations on an elusive deal to return Iran’s government to civilized behavior. There are certainly legitimate questions about the timing of striking Tehran’s nuclear facilities. Most important is reducing Iran’s capacity to retaliate against Israel, friendly Gulf Arab states, and deployed U.S. forces in the region. In Lebanon, Hezbollah likely retains tens of thousands of Iranian-supplied missiles, and Iran itself still has significant numbers of missiles and drones. The clock is running. Tehran is racing to repair the production facilities Israel leveled in October 2024 to replenish its missile stockpiles. Another mutual priority is achieving Israel’s objective of eliminating the political and military capabilities of Hamas and Hezbollah, as Netanyahu stressed yesterday. Although Israel has enjoyed remarkable success in Gaza and Lebanon, the recent Gaza hostage releases were staged to portray Hamas as a viable fighting force, with considerable support among Gaza’s civilians. Yet under former President Joe Biden’s ceasefire deal, which Trump’s pre-inaugural pressure on Netanyahu ironically brought to fruition, Israeli negotiations with Hamas over Gaza’s future are due to start. Yet this is precisely what Netanyahu wanted to avoid and why Biden failed for seven months to close the deal. Just because it is now Trump’s deal does not improve it substantively. Hamas can have no part in any future Gaza, whatever it looks like, nor can Hezbollah have any future in Lebanon. Only by removing these cancers can Gazans and Lebanese have any prospect of normality. And so long as the ayatollahs rule in Tehran, they will do their best to rearm their terrorist proxies, even under “maximum pressure” against Iran. Following their summit, Netanyahu and Trump must demonstrate the resolve to persevere, as Churchill said, however long and hard the road may be. Watch what happens on Iran. John Bolton served as national security adviser to then-President Donald Trump between 2018 and 2019.

How Trump and DOGE should reform the Social Security Administration,"As President Donald Trump and his administration look to reduce wasteful government spending and improve federal government productivity, they can find low-hanging fruit at the Social Security Administration . In particular, the administration should undo Biden-era regulations that unnecessarily bloated spending on welfare and disability benefits. The president, working with the technology experts at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, should also push for modernized information technology, including new digital features, to enhance accuracy and speed and help solve the agency’s service crisis. Finally, to reduce administrative costs and better target spending to those most in need, Trump must simplify and modernize the basic regulatory rules for disability programs. The Trump administration and DOGE need to act positively and methodically within the law to serve and protect taxpayers and SSA beneficiaries. To begin with, the Trump administration should roll back the unnecessary expansion of eligibility for, and the level of, welfare disability benefits. The SSA issued these regulations, costing about $20 billion over 10 years, with no analysis of how they would help the most disadvantaged people. Another set of regulations, costing about $30 billion, says that disability claimants need to be evaluated based on only five years of work history – down from the requirement in recent rules of fifteen years. This change ignores clear research evidence showing that workers’ skills from past jobs continue for at least ten years and often longer. Another set of administrative actions, costing about $10 billion, essentially forgives the collection of old overpayments made by SSA to beneficiaries. This gloss-over ignores the root cause of the problem – deficiencies in processing information on earnings, assets, and other items. The Biden administration stated that a major motivation for these changes was to reduce agency costs investigate the ability of disability claimants to work, or to see if they had other available resources of support. The aim was to help the agency at a time when it is failing to serve the public. SSA, however, is still failing to answer the phones promptly and accurately and is struggling to process changes in beneficiary status and condition. Furthermore, the agency has a massive backlog of claims for disability benefits. These changes abandoned the prudent stewardship of taxpayer dollars. By the faulty logic of the Biden administration, SSA could pay out on every disability claim made or forgive every overpayment, solving its backlog and service problems. That approach is easier than addressing the underlying sources of SSA’s failures – manual processes, antiquated technologies, and programming languages that were once cutting edge in the 1960s but now are costly to maintain and difficult to integrate into more efficient technology. Indeed, there are still only a few services that the public can get from SSA entirely online, without needing to call or visit a field office. In addition to modernizing customer-facing IT, SSA needs to simplify and modernize its complex and costly disability program rules. The agency needs to use the new statistical data on occupational requirements in its program rules to adjudicate disability claims and continuing benefits. It cannot continue to rely on information last updated almost 50 years ago. Moreover, the new data must be integrated with a modern view of the labor market, less focused on physical work. In the 21st century, more and more people are employed at older ages, and new types of careers are available to more people of various educational backgrounds. Implementing these new rules through an automated tool would simplify and speed up the program administration and improve the consistency of adjudication. Compared to current vocational rules, some disability claimants would get benefits paid while others would not. The net effect would likely be a significant reduction in government spending, from a more accurate and current read of labor market realities. Other recommended changes include a simplification of the return-to-work rules for when disability benefits are cut off and making greater use of claimant attorneys to provide complete information to the agency when filing a claim for a client instead of relying on the agency to collect the required medical and vocational records. Finally, the agency should consider and publish a full analysis of whether all the many layers of appeals are needed and cost-effective for speed and fairness to claimants and to protect the taxpayer. The Trump administration has the opportunity to make policy changes and to use the DOGE in a productive and positive manner to make long overdue technology changes in how the federal government functions. Efficiency and fiscal responsibility are imperative goals – especially for SSA to protect taxpayers and best serve its beneficiaries. Mark J.

Universities need more change than neutrality,"Institutional neutrality policies, such as those adopted by Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania , are good steps for hyperpoliticized universities . They also could prove entirely inconsequential. Each school has published a statement of its own explaining the policy and what it aims to accomplish. Universities taking official positions on sociopolitical events has become commonplace and even expected occurrences. The neutrality policy declares these schools will now refrain from doing so, in an effort instead to support the “creativity and academic freedom” of students and faculty, UPenn officials wrote. They still will issue statements on matters that directly affect the university. The conflict between Israel and Palestinians, for example, no matter how imminent college protesters’ theatrics want to make it appear, does not have any bearing on university functions. It is likely that these student demands were a primary catalyst for the schools’ final movements toward neutrality. The rest of the policy’s reasoning is that an institution cannot possibly represent the views of the diverse communities found on a college campus and that it will enhance future expression of free speech. Members will engage in debate without the burdens of political bias and self-censorship. These are benefits we can all hope eventually will take effect on campuses. As it is, though, the policy will change little of the substance that comes from these universities. Universities house mostly left-wing professors. A certain flavor of messaging and education comes out of these institutions as a result and becomes what is effectively the official position of a given school. Unless they hire more conservative professors, universities will strike no neutrality in their politics. Unfortunately, that sounds a lot like diversity hiring, but discrimination is the name of the game for liberal institutions that strive for balanced representation. Aside from that, encountering professors of varying political persuasions opens up a world of study for students. It only deepens their academic interests, provided professors are committed to a similar level of neutrality in the classroom. For their part, conservative professors have been practicing careful neutrality for years. The learning curve of this policy rests on liberal faculty. Without action that intentionally changes the university environment, high-up institutional policies will end up as passive maintenance for the leftism that already controls the school. Neutrality is a good hope, but it wants pairing with substantive measures.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-05T15:11:14+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3154264/universities-need-more-change-than-neutrality/
Rubio must reverse the Biden administration’s designations of US allies,"One year ago, Marco Rubio and seven other senators penned a letter to then-President Joe Biden expressing concerns over Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s misuse of sanctions in Latin America and the Caribbean. “Since January 2021, the overwhelming majority of public designations made under Section 7031(c) have targeted officials in Latin American and Caribbean governments that have cooperated with the United States on strategic diplomatic and national security interests,” the senators pressed. The senators expressed deep concerns about politicizing the sanction process and seemingly targeting politicians on the Right and ignoring “egregious actions in the region by others.” They urged Biden that the administration “must immediately explain the process and criteria it has used since January 2021 to designate individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean under Section 7031(c).” This may seem like an American, right-wing, or human rights concern. Still, as stated in the letter from the Republican senators, it is not just a U.S. problem and especially not just a concern of Latin America and the Caribbean. Among the eight, Rubio is acting as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state. By expressing concerns over U.S. allies’ designations and demanding the Democratic administration review and reverse them, Rubio has set a clear precedent. He must now uphold it. Enter Sali Berisha, a former president and prime minister of Albania who visited the White House twice in the early ’90s and was received by Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton. In 2007, Berisha welcomed the first and only U.S. president to visit Albania, George W. Bush. Berisha was and is a staunch ally of the United States, aligning with American interests on everything from the Middle East to Russia, from NATO expansion to the war on terrorism. Berisha’s fall from grace came in May 2021 when Blinken designated him for “undermining democracy” and “significant corruption.” Ironically, Blinken himself, while a senior adviser to Vice President Biden, lauded Berisha and his government’s anti-corruption efforts. Other U.S. Democrats once felt similarly. In 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a speech in Albania’s parliament, when Berisha was prime minister, stating that “if one wants to see democracy in motion, one should come to Albania.” Berisha blames billionaire George Soros and his cronies in the U.S. for his designation. Case in point, George’s son Alex Soros has been a mainstay in Albanian and Balkan politics since Prime Minister Edi Rama came to power. Former chief of the FBI’s New York counterintelligence office Charles McGonigal’s involvement in Albanian affairs should not be brushed aside. He was sentenced to 28 months in prison by a Washington, D.C., court for this involvement, accepting bribes from Albanian individuals set in motion by Rama’s office, according to the Justice Department file, and pushing the FBI to open an investigation into Berisha’s right-wing Democratic Party. Now that Rubio is in charge and Blinken is out, will Rubio reverse Blinken’s policies and condemnations of right-wing U.S. allies, not only in Latin America and the Caribbean but also in southeastern Europe? Many in Albania think Rubio will do so. Some point to an interesting reason: Being a descendant of anti-communist Cuban immigrants, he knows what communism is. Albania and his grandparents’ country have one thing in common: having suffered dearly under the communist joke. Berisha’s designation is nothing less than a new international Left trying to expunge its right-wing rivals.

The complicated story of Iron Mountain,"BOYERS, Pennsylvania — People around here are used to the trucks that deliver paperwork to the old Pennsylvania limestone mine. Here, over 700 locals work as employees of the Office of Personnel Management processing the retirement papers of federal government workers. Everyone around here knows of its existence. In fact, a lot of people around here either work there or have a family member who works there. Once upon a time, the mines and quarries around Boyers were filled with limestone and coal, which powered and built the country, like hundreds of places across Pennsylvania. Work in those mines provided families with a decent wage and a reason to stay rooted in the region. In the 1950s, as these mines emptied of their natural resources, local elected officials across the state, and across the country for that matter, looked for ways to utilize them so that people wouldn’t lose their jobs and have to relocate. In 1951, during the early, fear-driven days of the Cold War, the city council in Scranton, Pennsylvania, proposed using former mines to construct underground parking lots. The argument was that they could serve as bomb shelters in the event of an enemy atomic attack. In 1960, the Cleveland Plain Dealer detailed the use of a worked-out limestone mine in Western Pennsylvania that National City Bank used as a bank storage vault. It was constructed as part of a detailed plan to ensure the continuity of their banking operation in the event of a catastrophe, including a nuclear attack. That bank became one of the few financial institutions in the United States to obtain underground bomb-proof storage facilities. They were to use the same mine located in Butler County, about 60 miles north of Pittsburgh. At that time, the mine was operated by the National Storage Company , which already had other similar clients. Many of them were major, blue-ribbon industrial corporations in the Pittsburgh area and other sections of the eastern U.S. Today, that former limestone mine is Iron Mountain, which merged with the longtime owner of the National Storage Company or National Underground in 1998 . The facility is located right off of state route 308 in Boyers, a Butler County village located 20 miles from the Butler Farm Show Complex where President Donald Trump was shot on July 13, 2024. The Butler Farm Show Complex is the same place where Elon Musk took the stage with Trump for the first time to voice his support for the president. On Tuesday, Musk, the owner of X and the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, brought attention to the facility during an appearance with Trump in the Oval Office. His comments implied that this mine might need examining. “All that retirement paperwork is manual on paper,” Musk said in a rare public appearance in his role as an adviser to the president. “It’s manually calculated. They’re written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down a mine and, like, what do you mean a mine? Like, yeah, there’s a limestone mine where we store all the retirement paperwork.” Musk is not the first person to beg that question. Both the Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama administrations questioned the efficiency and lack of automation in processing thousands of case files, moving them from cavern to cavern, one line at a time. As one local, who asked for their name not to be used because half of their family works at the mine, noted, “Back in the ’50s, the concern was nuclear attack. Today, the concern is cyberattack. It is all about the protection and preservation of these documents.” Some consider the place an oddity. And of course, there is the always-entertaining speculation that a bunker for the president has been located deep within it since the Cold War — a speculation without evidence. There are locals who also say there are ghosts within the massive series of vaults and mines, which is common local lore. When Musk posted on X about the existence of a mine full of paperwork, the social media platform lit up in reaction. Its existence around here is as commonly known, the same as who makes the best pizza in the area. The jobs they hold at the facility do more than just provide an income — they also keep generations of families intact who are deeply rooted in the area. That, in turn, provides a tax base for the school district and the local townships, keeping the rural region thriving. “There are 700 jobs here, around 300 of them are OPM, but the rest are government contract jobs that revolve around OPM, with the overwhelming majority of those jobs held by citizens of small towns in Butler County,” the longtime resident said. “If this place is nixed and 70% of the jobs are gone, it will devastate both northern Butler County and southern Butler County,” he said. “We have no comparable jobs.” For those who are hoping this will pull Trump supporters away from him because of the mention of the mine, there is no evidence of that yet. “I think Mr. Musk is misinformed because the workers tell me they don’t just deal in manila envelopes. A lot of their work is digitalized, no question,” he said, adding, “I think the job of DOGE is to be skeptical about everything, and in the end, they will find that this facility isn’t a place of excess.” Trump won Butler County by a whopping 65 percentage points. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), of Butler County, who has toured the mine several times, said he, too, believes this will all work out in the end. “Once there is more nuance and context provided as to what exactly is done here and why it is done the way it is done,” Kelly said in an interview with the Washington Examiner . “The space is utilized not just for its size, but the process is also for safety and security,” Kelly said. “During the Cold War, it was considered safe from external attacks. Now, during the digital age, it keeps important government documents safe and preserved if there was a cyberattack.” Kelly said he understands that the move now is to do everything online. “Everything has to be digitalized. Everything has to be done quickly. All I’m saying is, you know what? There’s a reason why things have a long lifespan in something like the mine. That is a very safe storage space for these documents.” On Tuesday, Musk bluntly admitted he would get things wrong from time to time. “Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected, so nobody can bat 1.000,” he said, promising to swiftly correct errors, with the same going for the Department of Government Efficiency. “We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we’ll also fix the mistakes very quickly,” Musk said. Kelly says the root of what Musk is doing is good, old-fashioned getting to the root of what is the federal bloated bureaucracy. “That is not what is happening at Iron Mountain, but you don’t know that until you ask,” Kelly said. The limestone excavated here was owned and used by U.S. Steel from 1902 to 1952. It was used in the then-booming steel mills located all around Pittsburgh. When it regained new life as a storage facility in the late 1950s, the stone walls of the Boyers mine were painted silver and the floor was blacktopped with wide corridors as armored trucks drove through the miles of underground roadway to each individual vault. The Times-Tribune wrote in 1960 that the mine was entirely air-conditioned and had electric heaters, humidity-controlled equipment, and generators for producing power. They also wrote that it contained escape hatches and alternate entrances and exits, but their locations were kept secret. The Center for Land Use Interpretation , a research and education organization, recently reported that Iron Mountain expanded its data center, known as WPA-1, inside the mine.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T22:59:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318785/complicated-story-iron-mountain/
Is Disney back to putting families over politics?,"One of the hopes from the 2024 elections is that major corporations such as Disney would reevaluate to whom they are trying to appeal. It appears that the House of Mouse is finally starting that self-reflection. In the aftermath of the election, Disney has changed course on some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The changes are modest, but they include reorienting performance factors for executive compensation away from diversity and inclusion and toward values that promote business success. Disney is also taking off the condescending trigger warnings from the beginning of classic films such as Peter Pan and Dumbo , instead exiling them to the details sections of those films. Disney is also reportedly reevaluating the costs at its Disney parks, with the percentage of people planning return trips to Disney parks dropping. In Anaheim, California, the cheapest tickets start at $104 per day for just one of the two parks, Disneyland or Disney California Adventure, with tickets often going past $200. That is the cost for just one adult, with the total cost of tickets for the whole family, as well as food costs in the parks, making visiting Disney a one-time experience for many families. These changes show that Disney is at least looking to appeal again to the majority of normal people who aren’t obsessed with race and to families who simply want to be able to afford what Disney is offering. Even before the 2024 elections, there were signs that Disney was coming around. The company stood down from the political fight it picked with Florida Republicans, and Disney CEO Bob Iger admitted that the quality of Disney’s entertainment was declining. It is a welcome shift from the woke corporate posturing that plagued the 2010s and was amplified in 2020. Google, McDonald’s, Target, and Walmart are among the major corporations that have been reevaluating and removing their DEI policies. But none has the influence over children and families that Disney has through its entertainment offerings. For Disney to be focused on eliminating divisive DEI policies and on making itself more affordable for families is a massive step in the right direction. Disney never had to make itself a soldier in the political Left’s culture war. By exiting that culture war and focusing on appealing to families, Disney can once again be the family-friendly entertainment company it used to be remembered as, so long as it continues to stay out of the racially divisive DEI movement moving forward.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T21:38:46+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3318406/disney-families-over-politics/
Why were hopes of the 1990s dashed?,"As one who shared the hope, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, that representative government , guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections would spread across the globe, I naturally look back over the intervening long generation and ask what went wrong. In the 1990s, it seemed to many that the vision of Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man would prevail. Not that bad things would never happen again. Fukuyama’s more subtle thesis was that after the debacle of communism, there was no intellectually viable alternative to some combination of political democracy and market capitalism as the means to a decent society. But the past three decades have seen the vitality of politically viable alternatives — China’s dictatorial and Russia’s authoritarian state-directed capitalism, the oppressive clerical regimes of Shiite Iran, and various Sunni Muslim states. By Freedom House’s sophisticated measures , 2004 saw a high point in global freedom, which has been in decline ever since. How to explain this trend, the opposite of what I hoped for and predicted? As I have reflected on this question, I’ve fallen back on an article I wrote in 1993 for Irving Kristol’s Public Interest , in which I identified four types of political parties. Two were based on European conflicts over religion: Religious parties favored established churches, and liberal parties favored the separation of church and state. Two others, socialist and nationalist, had their beginnings in attempts to rally the masses in the failed European revolutions of 1848, appealing to their working-class interests or their folk national yearnings. Structural features — the Electoral College, the single-member House and Senate seats — push American politics into a two-party system in which both are incentivized to amass 50% majorities in what has always been a culturally and economically diverse nation. So, America’s political parties, operating in a unique republican framework and under democratic rules that predated Europe’s, have partaken of each of these four impulses in varying degrees. In my Public Interest article, I argued that religious parties tend to fade out in nations with no majority faith, liberal parties tend to collapse as their characteristic skepticism leaves them yielding to violent opposition parties, and socialist parties tend to peter out because, at some point, socialism fails to work. Parties that endure, I argued, were, in some major respect, nationalist. American politics over the past 30 years provides some confirmation. The market-respecting liberalism of former President Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party yielded to the woke socialism of former Presidents Barack Obama’s and Joe Biden’s. The religious emphasis and market economics of the Reagan-Bush Republican Party yielded to the demotic nationalism of President Donald Trump’s. And Trump won, despite lawfare persecution, a significant and possibly enduring victory over the Democrats’ woke socialism last November. My conclusion in 1993 and, tentatively, now is that nationalism is the glue that holds parties and nations together. The republican nationalism of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the democratic nationalism of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, and the nationalism of the two Roosevelt presidents, who remain vivid figures 116 and 80 years after leaving office. The problem we have encountered over the last 30 years is that other countries’ nationalisms are not like America’s. It turns out that neither the leaders nor the masses in Muslim nations have much interest in electoral democracy, market capitalism, or the rule of law. It turns out that the leaders of Western Europe, traumatized by the horrifying wars of the first half of the 20th century, seek a transnational harmony that overrules nations’ democratic electorates and smothers market capitalism with regulations. In reaction, Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, as the formerly (under Tony Blair) liberal Labour Party split into socialist and Scottish National parties and the long-dominant Conservatives into high-education Conservatives and the Trumpish Reform UK party. In the 1990s, there was reason to hope that Russia was moving toward democracy and that China, despite the Tiananmen Square massacre, would move away from repression and toward convergence with rules-based market economies. Instead, Russian President Vladimir Putin grabbed power from the flailing Boris Yeltsin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping jailed one rival and abolished his predecessors’ term limits. Putin has been in power for 25 years, almost as long as Joseph Stalin’s 29, while Xi has been in power for 13 years, about half as long as Mao Zedong’s 27. Putin has been following a nationalist policy that dates back not only to Stalin but also to the czars, expanding Russia’s power outward from Muscovy in every direction — though not as far in Ukraine as he hoped and expected. Xi evidently sees China as its emperors did for 2,000 years, as the greatest nation in the world, unfortunately recovering from a hundred years of humiliation by Western powers and Japan. Something similar has been happening in Mexico. Economic integration with Mexico and replacement of its one-party authoritarian rule by democratic rotation in office and the rule of law was the goal of the North American Free Trade Agreement, pushed in the 1990s by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who grew up on a ranch facing the Lower Rio Grande. NAFTA was ratified, the economies converged, and, as I witnessed, the opposition party ended 71 years of PRI party rule in July 2000. But Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected in 2018, has reinstalled one-party rule and government control of the economy, and his handpicked successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected with 61% of the vote. AMLO, as Obrador is universally known, managed to reach accommodations with Trump, and Sheinbaum has as well. But Mexico remains culturally distant, with uncertain property rights and opaque governance despite its geographic proximity. One lesson seems to be that national character matters and that it is more a product of deep-seated history than of recent American policy initiatives. It pops up even when you don’t expect it and can’t be transformed by paper guarantees. Another lesson is that America, with its unique Constitution, fashioned in 1787, revised in 1865-70 and, arguably, again in 1937-41, is indeed exceptional — and that American exceptionalism is a wine that does not travel. A third lesson is that the hopes of the 1990s were not totally dashed. Eighty-five years ago, in 1940, a time when some current leaders, such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), were living, Adolf Hitler and Stalin were allies in command of or with their allies holding most of the landmass of Eurasia, opposed actively only by Great Britain, whose air force and navy were stretched to the limit. Representative government, guaranteed liberties, and global capitalism laced with some measure of welfare state protections are much better off today than they were then, thanks in large part to the leadership at the time of the British nationalist Winston Churchill, the American nationalist Franklin Roosevelt, and the French nationalist Charles de Gaulle — something to keep in mind as we bewail our current discontents.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T19:43:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3318333/why-were-hopes-1990s-dashed/
The many problems with Trump’s Gaza plan,"President Donald Trump is standing firm on his plan to relocate “permanently” more than 2.1 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip to neighboring countries. Trump said the United States would take ownership of Gaza and redevelop the territory to serve as prized real estate on the Mediterranean Sea. Trump told Fox News’s Bret Baier that those living in Gaza would not be allowed to return. Some commentators say the president should not be taken literally. They argue that Trump is attempting to secure greater regional efforts to support Gaza’s postwar development. That by dangling a deeply unpopular idea of displacing the Palestinians out of Gaza, America’s Middle Eastern partners will have to offer better alternatives. What these arguments fail to recognize, however, is that Trump’s rhetoric complicates rather than encourages greater regional support for efforts to stabilize Gaza and secure Israel. As a primary case in point, Saudi Arabia has already made clear that the potential for a peace agreement with Israel is being greatly undermined by Trump’s proposal. And while it’s true that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has other priorities than the plight of the Palestinians, his supplication to a forcible relocation is a nonstarter. It would fundamentally undermine the crown prince’s key priority of establishing himself and Saudi Arabia as the rising global power of modern Islamic leadership. Similarly, while Jordan is heavily reliant on U.S. aid, King Abdullah II would risk imploding his rule were he to tolerate Trump’s Gaza ownership plan. This would be a disaster for the U.S. both in terms of what might follow Abdullah’s government and what its loss would mean for Washington. The Jordanian GID intelligence service is regarded by U.S. intelligence officers as the most reliable of all Middle Eastern intelligence partners in its service of U.S. security interests. The General Intelligence Department is viewed as more reliable even than the Israeli Mossad, which works to a distinctly Israeli agenda on Middle Eastern issues. This is not a peripheral concern. Alongside the Saudi intelligence services, the GID was instrumental in infiltrating the Islamic State during the heydays of the terrorist group’s 2013-2017 caliphate. This infiltration cost the lives of many GID officers and agents but helped prevent numerous mass casualty attacks in Europe and against American targets. Allies like Jordan are hard earned and deserve American efforts to maintain their stability. This is especially important, bearing in mind the deep Arab affinity for personal honor and trust. Trump’s Gaza plan serves the opposite interest. Trump’s plan is impractical on paper and would cause great damage to U.S. and allied interests in practice. But Trump’s very articulation of his idea is already causing damage to U.S. interests. Even if their regimes are autocratic in nature, the Saudis/Sunni Arab monarchies, Jordanians, and Egyptians now face escalating domestic populist pressures against their alliances with America. Trump is seen to be pushing a nakedly imperialist effort not simply to sidestep Palestinian aspirations but to crush them. Worse, Trump’s “America will own Gaza” and “Palestinians won’t ever be able to return to Gaza” rhetoric is a near pitch-perfect replication of exactly that which jihadist propagandists have long accused American policy in the Middle East of pursuing. Osama bin Laden, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei might have diverging ideologies and interests. Still, all of them have had great success in mobilizing young Muslim men to their otherwise perverse causes by falsely portraying the U.S. as an evil empire that is determined to dominate Muslim peoples. The crux of their arguments has been supposed American support for Israeli efforts to subjugate the Palestinians. It is for this reason that the overwhelming majority of U.S. counterterrorism specialists strongly oppose Trump’s Gaza rhetoric. While some supporters of the president wish to portray these critics as delusional left-wing activists, their number includes a large number of Joint Special Operations Command and CIA counterterrorism officers who made their careers finding and killing Islamic terrorists without remorse. Put simply, the serious voices opposing Trump’s Gaza plan cannot be characterized as Code Pink morons. Regardless, there’s another glaring problem with Trump’s proposal: Even if the U.S. were able to persuade allies to host Palestinians from Gaza, many Palestinians in Gaza would refuse to leave. A large number of Palestinians would likely even take up arms to defend their homes. Their number would include a great many not affiliated with terrorist organizations. This bears note in light of Trump’s incomprehensible argument that the U.S. military would not be required to secure Gaza. The natural implication is thus either that the Israel Defense Forces will forcibly clear Gaza for the U.S. or that Palestinians in Gaza will suddenly somehow collectively decide they want to leave. Neither possibility is credible. The military costs of forcible relocation of Palestinians in Gaza would be very heavy for Israel, entailing street-to-street fighting and clashes with mixed groups of terrorists, armed civilians, and unarmed civilians. The diplomatic impact on Israel would be catastrophic. The moral impact would also be highly problematic for the Israeli psyche. After all, the forcible relocation of an ethnic group from its home would stir traumatic memories of the Jewish people’s darkest days. That leaves the U.S. military option. Would Trump support such an action so utterly at odds with American moral authority and strategic interests? Doesn’t Trump insist he wants to avoid “stupid wars” rather than start them? The heavy weight of evidence against Trump’s plan leads its supporters to make somewhat outlandish claims in support of it. Trump’s first-term ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, claims that Palestinians want to leave Gaza but then implicitly recognizes that many may not want to do so. He then excuses this not-so-insignificant truth by declaring that “from a moral perspective, they have forfeited the right to the land which they have destroyed.” Friedman justifies this argument by pointing out that Palestinians in Gaza elected Hamas in 2006. And while this is true, Hamas has long wielded power through coercion, violence, and bribery. Opposing Hamas in Gaza is a recipe for death. In turn, a vote for Hamas does not justify the forced relocation of 2.1 million people from their homes. Indeed, I would argue that the collective punishment of ethnic cleansing is antithetical to Israeli and American moral values. What I suspect really motivates much of the Israeli-American support on the Right for Trump’s plan is how it would affect the future of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy — namely, by extinguishing even the longer-term prospect of a two-state solution, which led to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Trump has further fueled the optimism of the anti-diplomacy movement by suggesting that he might soon recognize full Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, much of which includes Palestinian settlements. But in contrast to the anti-diplomatic movement, I would argue that it is in the U.S. national interest to maintain political space for a two-state solution, which carries with it hardened guardrails against future terrorism against Israel. Yes, Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, atrocity and the ensuing Israeli military response means that there is no reasonable prospect of a two-state solution being reached in the short term. But to eradicate even the future possibility of a Palestinian state would be fuel to the jihadist fire. Again, it cannot be emphasized enough how much this conflict serves as a nuts-and-bolts terrorist recruitment tool for young Muslim men. In the same way, only a Palestinian state that provides a sense of dignity alongside opportunities for prosperity will be able to divert young Palestinians and other Muslims away from terrorism. Other moral considerations notwithstanding, that concern is reason enough for why former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and first-term Donald Trump all attempted to pursue a two-state solution. Trump’s greatest moral impulse is his desire to secure historic peace agreements that break decades, if not centuries, of cycles of war. But the president’s plan to dislocate Palestinians from their home is both immoral and impractical. And it would cause grievous harm to U.S. interests.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T18:58:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3318161/many-problems-trump-gaza-plan/
Trump’s order on transgender procedures is a win for religious liberty,"At every turn, young people are told that if they want to change their God-given gender, they can do so with a snap of their fingers and with sweeping permission from our nation’s highest leaders. But it does not take policy expertise or a medical degree to know that sterilization and puberty-blocking drugs are not authentic medical care. Fortunately, President Donald Trump issued an executive order putting a stop to child mutilation and the confusion that has taken hold of countless hospitals, including private Catholic hospitals once committed to respecting the dignity of every person. His effort should be applauded as an important first step toward protecting young people. FULL LIST OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ACTIONS, AND PROCLAMATIONS TRUMP HAS MADE AS PRESIDENT Trump’s executive order is unapologetic. Going forward, it reads, the U.S. government “will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.” It outlines what children and young teenagers frequently experience after attempting to surgically change their physical characteristics. They eventually realize, for example , that “they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding” or soon discover that they are “trapped with lifelong medical complications, a losing war with their own bodies, and, tragically, sterilization.” It is a great tragedy of our time that so many young people are being told that these harmful procedures will make their lives better. Trump’s executive order begins to undo countless actions taken by the Biden administration to force-feed reasonable Americans the notion that sex-change surgery is the compassionate way to “treat” people questioning their gender, when the very opposite is true. Trump explicitly calls on HHS to end the Biden administration’s harmful redefinition and application of Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act. Intent on imposing a destructive gender ideology on the American people, the Biden administration in 2024 amended rules pertaining to Section 1557 to force people of faith to fund abortion and transgender surgeries through their health insurance plans. Section 1557 reinterpreted the definition of “on the basis of sex” to include “gender identity” and “termination of pregnancy.” Revising the act delivered a forceful blow to American Christians, who make up nearly 70 % of the U.S. population, not to mention countless others who disagree with this redefinition. But Biden’s HHS went a step further. In a blatant attack on religious liberty, the administration required religious doctors and other medical professionals to perform gender-transition procedures no matter their own personal beliefs about doing so, while denying them the opportunity to opt out even for religious reasons. The policy from the Biden HHS department forced Catholic hospitals into a difficult choice: either comply with the order or shut down and cut off entire communities from healthcare. As a direct result of the Biden administration’s policies, far too many children have been put through the physical and mental agony caused by gender ideology in places where it should never exist. Nearly 150 Catholic hospitals across the country have given vulnerable children hormone therapy or performed gender-transition surgeries between 2019 and 2023. Out of more than 520 minors who received treatments in these Catholic hospitals, “more than 150 had surgeries to alter their appearances to resemble the opposite sex, while more than 380 children were given puberty blockers or hormone therapies,” according to a recent study from Do No Harm, an organization devoted to keeping politics out of medicine. Catholic hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers have no business engaging in any of these activities, which run counter not only to good medicine but the teachings of their faith, too. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has affirmed that transgender interventions are opposed to Catholic moral teaching and voted to move forward with updating its guidance for Catholic healthcare institutions, insisting that these institutions must not perform any such interventions. Thanks to the president’s executive order, it is my hope that soon families will once again have access to life-affirming care, free from harmful political agendas that damage or destroy patients’ health and well-being. For now, Trump’s executive order will help Catholic medical institutions — and many others — adhere to the highest standards of authentic medicine as well as Catholic social and moral teachings. Faithful Americans must continue to reject the dangerous, life-altering, and irreversible experiments on children that are happening across our nation in the very institutions that should be protecting them. Let us join hands in setting a high standard of care for every patient that affirms their inherent dignity and worth. Chris Faddis is president of Solidarity HealthShare , a health care sharing ministry guided by the moral teachings of the Catholic Church that negotiates directly with providers to ensure delivery of high-quality and affordable, life-affirming health care for the more than 46,000 members it has served since 2016.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T17:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/3317773/trump-transgender-order-win-for-religious-liberty/
Journalists discover the Constitution,"New talking points have gone out, and left-wing journalists and pundits have agreed that claiming the nation is in some sort of “ constitutional crisis ” is the soundest strategy to aid their beloved Democrats in their time of need. You could be forgiven if you believed members of the corporate press are just now discovering the Constitution , considering that they display profound ignorance of the nation’s founding documents at any available opportunity. But the shift in language from “Republicans are Hitler” to “save the founders’ legacy” is likely more malicious than it is mindless. People like the Constitution and the natural rights it safeguards. Journalists understand this, and they are likely hoping their audiences forget the press has led the charge to destroy constitutionality, namely the First and Second amendments, for decades. Unfortunately for the media, the “ crisis ” that keeps them up at night, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and its mission to rid the federal government of waste, fraud, and abuse, is also quite popular with the public. The Left’s commitment to perverse ideologies has forced it to defend extremely unpopular positions since losing the 2024 election. As Musk and crew uncover one instance after another of reckless, wasteful misuse of tax dollars, Democrats and journalists find themselves defending positions wildly out of step with the vast majority of people. After the Federal Emergency Management Agency neglected the victims of Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, it was caught red-handed funneling $59 million to New York City to fund luxury hotels for illegal aliens, according to Musk. To date, DOGE has saved taxpayers almost $38 billion, canceling wasteful contracts such as funding for an Anthony Fauci exhibit at the National Institutes of Health museum. (Perhaps the entire NIH museum could be on the chopping block next?) DEI programs have been eliminated across the federal government, and the nefarious, propagandistic work of the U.S. Agency for International Development is being clawed back. The people are just fine with those developments. Adding to the shamelessness of the press’s decision to declare that opposition to the Left is a constitutional crisis is the fact that these same journalists ignored a plethora of wildly unconstitutional acts by the Biden regime. Former President Joe Biden’s repeated attempts to undermine the Constitution via his illegal vote-buying student loan forgiveness scheme were praised by the corporate press, as was his decision to raid the home of his political opponent. Journalists covered up the former president’s senility at every turn until, of course, they couldn’t , and I struggle to think of a constitutional crisis greater than the leader of the free world revealed to be nothing more than a puppet for special interests and his own hard-left, ideology-obsessed staff. Aside from pardoning murderers, terrorists, and almost every member of his family, Biden’s focus in the waning days and hours of his presidency was to attempt to tweet an amendment to the Constitution into existence. Tell me more about the constitutional order, journalists. Congress last declared war in 1942 against Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and despite never declaring war since WWII, the U.S. has fought wars in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq (twice), and Afghanistan and has involved itself in civil wars and conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Lebanon, Libya, South Sudan, the Congo, Niger, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Grenada, just to name a few. The Patriot Act allowed unprecedented illegal spying on citizens, and as former President Barack Obama admitted , “We tortured some folks.” However, real crises like these leave journalists with the resting heart rate of an Olympic triathlete. Spare me if I don’t buy the press’s outrage over Musk and the gang’s attempt to get the nation’s fiscal house in order.

Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s pro-union stance makes her a poor choice for labor secretary,"There are only two pathways to greater economic growth: more people working or individuals producing more (or both). The new administration has proposed policies to grow the economy and increase U.S. manufacturing . It wants to get more people working and fewer watching by reducing the number of government employees so bureaucrats can enter the productive economy. It plans to leave minimum wage laws up to the states due to regional differences, so unskilled workers, especially teenagers, aren’t excluded from the labor pool, giving them a chance to gain valuable experience that will allow them to become more productive and command higher wages. More importantly, productivity must increase, something that big labor fights . We no longer pick corn by hand, the Bessemer converter allowed us to replace brittle cast iron with low-cost steel, and computers allow bookkeeping without physical books. In order to create an environment where companies can further innovate, the administration intends to reduce government regulations . Companies will be able to focus on technology and process improvements instead of filling out government forms. What doesn’t jibe with the administration’s policies is former Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination for labor secretary. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, considers her nomination significant because Chavez-DeRemer supports “pro-union” policies such as the ProAct, which would replace secret ballots with a card check , making it easier for union bosses to harass people who don’t want to join a union, and eliminating right-to-work laws that prevent forced union membership. Being pro-union is not the same as being pro-worker. In fact, it is the opposite, which is why union membership has recently hit a record low. Growing up in the Mon Valley of Pittsburgh, I witnessed firsthand the destruction of many of the factories that, during WWII, were part of the arsenal of democracy. There are many factors responsible for the downfall of the U.S. steel industry, but unions resisting innovation are part of it. That is one reason U.S. Steel desperately needs investment today. Yet, although Nippon Steel wants to invest over $1 billion in Pittsburgh steel plants, the union says no — despite many rank-and-file steelworkers wanting it. Today , the longshor emen threaten to shut down the economy if automation is installed at U.S. ports, which are already the least productive in the industrialized world. What’s more, we cannot simply hide behind tariffs. If we cannot compete with the world, we will simply fall behind and become economically backwards. President Donald Trump wants to invigorate the economy and revitalize world-class manufacturing in the U.S., but Chavez-DeRemer’s pro-union stances may not be a good fit. Phillip S.

Democrats against democracy,"Democrats are anything but democratic. In the past, their idea of governance was overreach and abuse of power carried through unelected bureaucrats, intimidation attempts by radicalized mobs disguised as protesters, and a weaponized judicial system, especially rogue judges, to impose their will on the public. As a famous quote often attributed to Mark Twain goes, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” Once again, the Democratic Party, when thwarted at the ballot box, has turned to judges to impose its will on the public. As many as 10 federal judges have recently ruled against President Donald Trump ‘s proposed budget cuts, spending freezes, transgender policies, and push to end birthright citizenship , as well as access to data by Trump-appointed auditors trying to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. This usurpation of the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government by the judicial branch, ideologically aligned with Democrats, should be considered dangerous, regardless of one’s political affiliation. It is an abuse of authority that the Founding Fathers recognized as a threat to the republic. Ironically, it was Elbridge Gerry — after whom the word “gerrymandering” was created and who was a Massachusetts delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 — who warned about judicial imposition. He voiced his concern about the “sophistry of the judges.” Authors of the Federalist Papers echoed similar sentiments in their writings. The ideas and words of those from the 18th century are applicable in 2025. For example, in Federalist 78 , Alexander Hamilton cautioned that judges might exercise their will instead of their judgment in interpreting laws. He also stressed the importance of judges remaining impartial, noting that the “independent spirit in the judges” was paramount to “a faithful performance of so arduous a duty.” Furthermore, consider Federalist 81 , in which Hamilton discussed the fears and concerns over judicial activism. Hamilton warned that if judges prioritized passion and politics over the law and construed it, then this would enable the judiciary to develop its own rules. “The power of construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will enable that court to mold them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body,” Hamilton argued . Hamilton’s words proved prescient. Activist courts have become more frequent as judges at the state and federal levels expropriate power assigned to the other two branches of government. Federal judges attempted to usurp executive branch authority in terrorist detainee cases during the Bush administration. They did so again during the first Trump administration when judges opposed Trump’s lawful orders to restrict people coming to the United States from nations where terrorists are active. In each case, judges interceded in nonjusticiable affairs, as was predicted in Federalist 78. Yet, this abuse can be traced back even further. One egregious example was during the last years of the Reagan administration. For example, in 1987, District Judge Russell Clark, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter, ordered a 150% increase in property taxes and a 1.5% income tax to fund a desegregation plan for schools in Kansas City, Missouri. Clark decreed that Missouri was to pay the balance. Since when did the Constitution authorize a judge to order a tax increase? In other instances, judges have overreached their authority in the criminal justice system, issuing rulings related to incarcerated prisoners. For example, in some cities, such activist judges ordered criminals to be released from confinement for no reason other than jails and prisons were, in their opinion, “overcrowded.” Still, other judges have reversed referenda. Judge Thelton Henderson issued an injunction against California’s Proposition 209, which was aimed at dismantling state affirmative-action programs based on sex or race. Californians voted on Proposition 209 in 1996. However, Henderson, also a Carter appointee, thought his opinions were superior to those of the electorate. A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel subsequently overturned Henderson’s ruling. In his majority opinion, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain wrote, “A system which permits one judge to block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted to enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.” O’Scannlain’s sentiments exemplify how the judicial branch should work. He provided an honest and intelligent explanation to which all judges should adhere. Unfortunately, they don’t. If the country allows rogue, activist judges to continue their abuse of power and judicial overreach without any accountability, then we will no longer be a constitutional republic but instead a judiciocracy. It would behoove people of all political parties and ideologies to reject such advances. Moreover, people all along the ideological continuum must remember that the government is “of the people, by the people, for the people” — and not ruled by judges.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T15:24:37+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317675/democrats-activist-judges-against-democracy/
Fort Bragg’s latest name change is pure political appeasement,"The Pentagon has announced it is once again changing the name of one of its largest military bases, Fort Liberty, back to its original name, Fort Bragg, but with a twist. Instead of bearing the name of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, the home of the 82nd Airborne Division and U.S. Army Special Operations Command will now honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, a World War II paratrooper who earned the Silver Star for his bravery during the Battle of the Bulge. Let’s be clear: There should never have been a military base named after Braxton Bragg in the first place. Beyond his role as a commander in an armed rebellion against the U.S. government, Bragg is widely regarded as one of the worst generals of the Civil War. His poor leadership and strategic failures were legendary even among his own troops. For this reason alone, the original decision to rename Fort Bragg was commendable. However, in typical fashion, the Biden administration chose the uninspired and overly generic “Fort Liberty,” a safe, watered-down option seemingly designed to appease a segment of the Left that finds offense in just about everything. Now, by rebranding Fort Bragg to honor a little-known WWII soldier, the Trump administration can claim to be restoring history erased by the Left’s insatiable appetite for faux outrage — all while sidestepping the awkwardness of celebrating a Confederate general who was both a notorious slave owner and an incompetent military leader. Yet, in doing so, it has fallen into the same trap of opting for political appeasement rather than seizing the opportunity to honor a genuinely deserving American hero: General James M. Gavin. As the highly decorated third commanding general of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II, Gavin was more than just a leader; he was a visionary and a soldier’s general. Nicknamed the “Jumping General,” Gavin personally participated in combat jumps alongside his troops in Sicily, in Italy, and during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. His leadership style exemplified courage, strategic brilliance, and an unwavering dedication to his men. At just 37 years old, he became the youngest divisional commander in the U.S. Army, leading the 82nd Airborne Division with unparalleled effectiveness. Gavin’s actions directly contributed to the success of key military campaigns during WWII, and his innovative thinking shaped airborne operations for decades to come. Gavin’s contributions extended far beyond WWII. In 1947, he incorporated the all-black 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion into the 82nd Airborne, making it the first integrated division in the U.S. Army. He also played a crucial role in shaping post-war military strategy, becoming one of the first senior officials to advocate a more agile and mobile fighting force. Gavin’s forward-thinking approach to logistics and rapid deployment, particularly using helicopters, was instrumental in developing the modern air cavalry. The renaming of Fort Liberty to Fort Gavin would not only have paid homage to his exemplary military service but also served as a reminder of the kind of leadership and moral clarity that should define America’s armed forces. Instead, the Pentagon chose to rename it Fort Roland L. Bragg, a name that has little connection to the installation’s rich history but conveniently aligns with an illusion of attempting to restore the past. Before becoming secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth declared, regarding the initial renaming to Fort Liberty, “We should change it back because legacy matters.” Yet, when given the opportunity to correct past mistakes, Hegseth failed to honor the man who best embodied the institution’s legacy and ethos. The 82nd Airborne Division has prided itself on its legacy of excellence, resilience, and innovation. Naming the base after Gavin would have been the perfect way to honor those principles. Unfortunately, by disregarding Gavin’s legacy, the current administration missed the chance to connect Fort Bragg’s new identity to the soldiers who made it legendary. General James M. Gavin was the embodiment of airborne excellence, a leader who defined the very institution Fort Bragg has housed for decades. By failing to recognize his contributions, the current administration has once again squandered an opportunity to tie the past, present, and future of one of the military’s most iconic bases to a leader who truly represented its values.

Trump must stop the UK’s dangerous surrender of the Chagos Islands,"Most Americans may not be familiar with the Chagos Islands, but they play a crucial role in U.S. national security . This remote Indian Ocean archipelago, which includes Diego Garcia, hosts one of the most strategically important American military bases in the world. The base has been a linchpin of U.S. military operations for decades, providing logistical support for missions in the Middle East , countering China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific, and serving as a critical hub for intelligence and surveillance. Despite its strategic significance, the United Kingdom, under the leadership of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is preparing to hand over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. This decision is not based on security concerns or practical governance but on a misguided sense of legalism and postcolonial revisionism. The U.K. is willing to cede control despite the islands having little historical or cultural connection to Mauritius, which lies 1,400 miles away. Under the proposed deal, Britain would cede sovereignty while paying Mauritius 9 billion pounds over 99 years to lease back Diego Garcia, the key U.S. naval base in the region. The negotiations are being led by Starmer’s attorney general, Lord Richard Hermer, who has previously stated that “almost every element” of the British Empire was racist and has actively advocated reparations to be paid to those who were “victims” of the empire. This latest arrangement from Hermer is not only an unprecedented act of strategic self-sabotage by the U.K. but also a direct threat to U.S. interests in the region. Now back in office, President Donald Trump must urgently intervene to prevent this reckless handover, a move that would deal a devastating blow to U.S. national security and ultimately play into the hands of China. China has a well-documented track record of leveraging debt and infrastructure projects to entrench its influence across the developing world. From Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port to military installations in Djibouti, Beijing has perfected the art of turning economic partnerships into strategic footholds. Once Mauritius takes control of the Chagos Islands, it is only a matter of time before China offers lucrative investment deals in exchange for naval access. Given Mauritius’s economic dependence on China, resistance to such overtures would be difficult. For Washington, the consequences of a Chinese presence in Diego Garcia would be catastrophic. The island has been crucial to America’s power projection in the Indo-Pacific and serves as a counterweight to China’s growing military assertiveness. Allowing China to establish even a minimal footprint in the Chagos archipelago would dramatically shift the balance of power in the region and weaken U.S. deterrence. Trump must make it clear to the U.K. that this deal is unacceptable. The U.S. should leverage its diplomatic and economic influence to halt the transfer, emphasizing that British participation in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and other key defense agreements depends on London’s commitment to shared security interests. If necessary, Washington must also be prepared to negotiate a direct long-term lease with Mauritius, ensuring ironclad restrictions on any Chinese involvement. This is not a matter of decolonization or historical redress. It is a matter of strategic survival. The Chagos Islands are too important to be sacrificed on the altar of postcolonial revisionism. If Starmer’s government insists on this folly, Trump must step in and put an end to it before it is too late.

Shein and Temu must be restricted over slave labor,"The Chinese companies Shein and Temu have become wildly popular for their dirt-cheap clothes and gadgets. Hidden behind the trendy bargains, however, rests an ugly truth: these companies are profiting from slave labor. Mounting evidence ties their supply chains to forced labor by Uyghur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region. This isn’t a minor allegation; it’s part of what many countries recognize as an ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people. President Donald Trump’s administration is reportedly weighing whether to add Shein and Temu to the Department of Homeland Security’s forced labor blacklist. As the Trump administration works to decouple the United States from reliance on Chinese goods, leveraging existing authority to prevent Shein and Temu from skirting U.S. law should be a priority. Kicking out forced-labor profiteers would protect our values and strengthen our resilience against a hostile foreign power. In 2021, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) to ensure that American commercial activity is not supporting forced labor. The UFLPA created a rebuttable presumption that any goods connected to Xinjiang are tainted by forced labor and barred from import unless proven otherwise. This law embodies a basic moral principle: no product of slave labor should reach American homes and businesses. Unfortunately, that principle is undermined every day when Americans purchase products from Shein and Temu. The allegations against Shein and Temu are not mere speculation. A 2022 report by Bloomberg used laboratory testing to confirm that Shein’s products contained cotton sourced from Xinjiang, the epicenter of China’s state-run forced labor program. While Shein claims it does not source from Xinjiang, the opacity of its supply chain raises serious concerns about its credibility. Similarly, Temu, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is also complicit in the use of forced Uyghur labor. Temu’s rapid expansion into the U.S. market has come with almost no transparency about its sourcing practices. Unlike Amazon or Walmart, which have regulatory and compliance mechanisms in place to audit suppliers, Temu operates as a marketplace that allows Chinese manufacturers—many of whom may rely on Xinjiang supply chains—to sell directly to American consumers with little scrutiny. Banning Shein and Temu is not just a moral necessity; it is an economic imperative. The presence of these companies in the U.S. market undercuts American businesses that adhere to ethical labor practices. Such rock-bottom prices are subsidized by forced labor, lack of supply chain transparency, and regulatory arbitrage. This creates an unfair playing field for American retailers and manufacturers and exposes consumers to harmful products. By formally designating these companies as complicit in forced labor in Xinjiang, their imports could be blocked outright unless they prove no ties to slave labor — a high bar given the evidence. From a strategic perspective, allowing companies with deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to dominate the U.S. e-commerce space poses national security risks. A 2023 report from the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the CCP identified Shein’s “aggressive data collection” on American consumers, similar to the concerns raised about TikTok. Given the CCP’s extensive history of using technology companies for intelligence gathering, continued access to U.S. consumers poses a direct risk. This move would be a significant escalation in holding China accountable and protecting U.S. consumers. It’s also a logical next step in Trump’s broader trade crackdown. Placing Shein and Temu on the UFLPA-covered list would send an unambiguous message: the United States will not be a dumping ground for goods made with slave labor. This approach offers a targeted solution that protects human rights without harming legitimate trade. By banishing Shein and Temu from our market, Trump would be standing up for the millions who cannot speak out, from Uyghur laborers to U.S. workers who deserve better than competing with slave labor.

Texas leads in securing the border,"In its coverage of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s recent trip to the White House, Fox News acknowledged the shift on display. Where the Biden administration threw open our borders, and fought Texas’s attempts to enforce the law, the Trump administration is embracing Abbott’s actions. Abbott’s deputizing the Texas National Guard to help the Border Patrol is just the next logical step. “It would be hard to find another governor who has done more to support, and help implement and endorse, Trump’s hardline border security and immigration agenda,” Fox News reported .” Texas, under Abbott’s leadership,” the article continued, “has spent billions of dollars on border security the past couple of years under Operation Lone Star. And this week, Abbott, in an unprecedented move, gave Texas National Guard soldiers the power to arrest undocumented immigrants in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.” Of course, Abbott’s decision to deputize the National Guard has come under fire from the party of open borders. “It’s likely to lead to harassment and racial profiling of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in South Texas and the border region,” claimed Texas Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro . But here’s the reality: The Biden administration’s efforts to undermine the rule of law have left the Border Patrol undermanned and underfunded. Abbott’s actions are lawful—troops have been used at the border for decades. “Military forces have been on the border continuously since the establishment of JTF-6 in 1989 to help combat drug smuggling,” the Center for Strategic and International Studies explains . “The levels have varied depending on the perceived level of need, the availability of forces, and the politics of immigration but continued in both Republican and Democratic administrations.” What happens next? Some Democratic-run states and cities say they’ll remain “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants, including violent criminals. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy even claims he is thinking about housing an illegal immigrant in his garage apartment. As he put it, “good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her.” Not everyone is so recalcitrant. Out in Nevada, Attorney General Aaron Ford, a gubernatorial hopeful, once sponsored legislation to make Nevada a sanctuary state. Now he supports enforcing the law. “Keeping our communities safe is not a controversial statement,” Ford told the Las Vegas Review-Journal . “It is my job, and I intend to do that, and I support policies that do that.” Ford, a Democrat, knows he must change his tune on the border. Not only did President Trump win Nevada by three points, the state now has more registered Republicans than Democrats . What other sanctuary states and cities are missing is that this moment represents a great political sea-change. Trump was very clear about what he was running on, and securing the border was at the top of his list. Voters went for it. Sanctuary states and cities also can’t afford the illegal immigration crisis brought about by the Biden administration. Indeed, while President Joe Biden was in office, New York, Chicago, and Denver were all pleading for federal funds to help them pay for their own irresponsible policies. Gov. Abbott has set an example to follow. He has shown how states can come alongside and assist the federal government in enforcing the law. Many states such as Florida, Tennessee, and South Dakota have already sent their own National Guard troops to support Texas. It’s time for the others to step up.

Trump is right on birthright citizenship,"At the heart of the legal debate over President Donald Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause. While there are numerous practical hurdles to eliminating birthright citizenship as it’s been practiced, the president is on solid legal footing. The clause (“All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”) should not be interpreted as conferring automatic citizenship to children born of illegal immigrants . Setting aside constitutional interpretation, that just seems like common sense. But not everyone sees it this way, hence the controversy. According to two federal judges who have issued injunctions since the order was issued, the language of the clause should be read at its broadest, which would grant citizenship to any person born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S., regardless of the status of the parents. Proponents of this interpretation point to the Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) in which the court held that a child born within the territorial boundaries of the U.S. to temporary Chinese immigrants was a citizen. But the problems with this interpretation are manifold. For one, it misinterprets the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to apply to children born to foreign nationals who are not under full and exclusive allegiance to the U.S. Those who are born in the U.S. to parents who are here on business or vacation should also be denied citizenship on these grounds. While in America, they are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. but only in a limited and ephemeral sense. They could not, for example, be drafted into the military. Once they leave, they are not subject to U.S. laws, which is not the case with Americans. There are various ways in which illegal immigrants are not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the same way citizens are. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson offered the following scenario: An infant is brought to the U.S. legally, is lawfully naturalized, and serves in the military but cannot run for president — but the child of a foreign tourist born in the U.S. can? The framers of the clause included it to ensure that citizenship would be conferred to the children of slaves who were brought here against their will. It is ludicrous to suggest that people who have traveled here of their own accord and entered the country unlawfully should be granted the same privilege. There are numerous practical hurdles that come with ending birthright citizenship that lawmakers will need to attend to should the Supreme Court eventually decide in Trump’s favor. Some have raised questions about the moral complexities of the move, suggesting that ending birthright citizenship could create an underclass of “stateless” children and result in family separations. It would also worsen the bureaucratic nightmare of our national recordkeeping systems. Lawmakers should do everything possible to mitigate these unintended consequences. But that doesn’t absolve the nation of the responsibility to enact sane immigration policy based on sound legal arguments. Trump’s executive order achieves this, and so it is to be hoped that the courts find this compatible with the Constitution.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T05:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3317408/trump-right-on-birthright-citizenship/
The Super Bowl rings in the return of Americana,"“Today we celebrate the urgency of now, the thrill of what’s next, the glory of this game , and we do it as one.” That sentiment is courtesy of Brad Pitt in a soaring prerecorded video on Fox right before the Super Bowl on Sunday night. Only rivaled by Thanksgiving and Christmas , there is no singular event that comes even close to bringing so many of us together — and on a night many of us have to work the next day, no less. A record-breaking 126 million U.S. viewers tuned in to watch the Philadelphia Eagles pummel the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22. And while the game itself wasn’t memorable, outside of the Chiefs finally and deliciously being dethroned, the overall tone and mood of unbridled patriotism was. As a prime example, the Pitt video might as well have been a Trump ad, complete with clips of cowboys riding horseback carrying American flags, firefighters battling wildfires, U.S. Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima, etc. The message: American greatness only works when we huddle up and work together. Forget patriotism. This was downright jingoistic. Donald Trump himself also became the first president to attend the Super Bowl out of the 59 that have been played. It is unbelievable that not one, from Ronald Reagan to the Bushes to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, all sports fans, had attended, considering that it is such an easy political win to just show up. There’s nothing but upside to doing so. As you may have heard, Trump received a roaring reception from the crowd when shown on jumbo screens during a tremendous national anthem by Jon Batiste. Contrast that with former Vice President Kamala Harris attending a Los Angeles Lakers game earlier in the week, where the installed 2024 Democratic nominee was barely acknowledged by the fans in her home state. And in what was the ultimate irony, while Trump was applauded in New Orleans, the once-untouchable Taylor Swift was roundly booed moments later. The president, of course, could not let that fact pass without weighing in. “The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift,” Trump trolled on Truth Social. “She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!” The culture shift compared to Trump’s first term is nothing short of extraordinary. After his first victory in 2016, Trump voters largely kept their support on mute, especially in the workplace, all out of fear of being ostracized or seeing career prospects going sideways. This time around, the Trump dance is openly being celebrated by everyone from NFL players to LPGA golfers. Corporations, one by one, have been doing away with DEI programs. Hostages are being released by Hamas, a reaction to Trump’s threat of “all hell breaking out” if they continue to stall. Violent gangs of illegal immigrants are being shipped back to their home countries or Guantanamo Bay. And the NCAA announced recently that it would no longer allow biological men to compete against biological women following Trump’s executive order that banned transgender athletes from female competition. The optimism felt during the Super Bowl is reflected in polls that have been exceptional for Trump, especially considering that most of the legacy media has continued its onslaught of unhinged negative coverage of him and his policies, which, after nearly 10 years since announcing his first presidential run, has become beyond tedious and predictable. CBS News has Trump’s approval at 53%, easily his highest ever while occupying the Oval Office. But the crosstabs tell an even rosier story. For example, when voters were asked if Trump was keeping his campaign promises, 70% said yes. What that tells us is that not only are Republicans happy with the president’s dizzying first three weeks of action, but independents and some Democrats are as well. Other highlights: Six-in-10 people support mass deportations for more than just criminals in the country illegally. Nearly two-thirds, 64%, support sending U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. And here are the four top words that voters would use to describe Trump most: 69% say tough, 63% say energetic — ya think? — 60% say focused, and 58% say effective. This is the Arctic polar opposite of the way former President Joe Biden was described. Voters thought he was old, outdated, elderly, aging, senile, demented, slow, confused, idiotic, ignorant, sleepy, gaffe-prone, and bumbling. Trump’s approval among black and Latino voters also blows away anything we’ve seen from a Republican president in the modern era, with 33% of blacks and 49% of Latinos approving of his performance. If these levels are maintained or even increased, it’s hard to see how Democrats can win any presidential elections moving forward. This is especially true if MAGA-approved JD Vance is the nominee four years from now. Young voters are also giving Trump a big thumbs up, with 55% under 30 approving. This voting bloc, like Latinos and blacks, is supposed to be owned by the Democratic Party. But in another poll from CBS News last month, a whopping 67% of adults aged 18-29 said they are optimistic about Trump’s second term, easily the highest of any age group. And while the president is riding relatively high, Democrats are melting down before our eyes. The confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet nominees were largely a display of cheesy performance art. Their behavior may have driven Republicans on the fence about confirming the more controversial candidates into Trump’s corner. And then there were stunts such as the one led by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) at the Education Department, where the 86-year-old led other House Democratss to attempt to enter the building but were denied by an unarmed security guard with cameras rolling. “What’s your name?” Waters demanded. “Tell us your name. Give me that ID again.” “I’m not giving you the ID,” the guard replied without emotion. “I showed it to you.” “Say what?” Waters asked incredulously. “I showed you the ID,” he replied. “Could you let me see the ID again?” she pressed. “No,” he replied. “Huh?” a flummoxed Waters responded. “No,” he reiterated. And that was it, basically. “The Democrats have lost their minds, and they’ve lost their confidence,” Trump told Senate Republicans at Mar-a-Lago afterward. “They looked foolish today. They tried to break into the Department of Education just because we want to go in and check the books.” As for other opportunities in his second term to play the patriotism card, check out this Triple Crown: The country will celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2026. The U.S. will also host the World Cup the same year. And in 2028, the Olympics return to Los Angeles. Much like attending the Super Bowl, Trump will be front and center for these events while the world looks on. “I’m going to be here for the Olympics and the World Cup,” Trump mused earlier this month. “God works in mysterious ways.” Fixing the economy after Bidenomics crippled it is a top priority, no question. As is fixing the border, improving our horrible test scores in education, drastically cutting government waste, and ending the Russia-Ukraine war. But winning the culture war is also important. It plays to voters’ emotions in a way policy cannot. Over the next four years, Trump has an opportunity to be seen as a beacon of optimism and an embracer of all things Americana. All in contrast to his opponents, who haven’t offered an inspiring vision for America in a long, long time.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-12T01:00:00+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3316988/super-bowl-rings-in-return-americana/
The war on plastic straws highlights Democrats’ shoddy ‘science’,"President Donald Trump ‘s executive order ending the federal government’s push to transition to paper straws is a good reminder that environmentally-obsessed Democrats regularly botch “The Science.” This is especially true when it comes to their climate policies. Trump’s executive order naturally earned a response from climate groups such as Oceana, whose “plastics campaign director” warned that “the world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.” Plastic straws, we were told, are a massive environmental threat. That’s why multiple Democratic states and cities have banned or restricted them. However, the idea to ban plastic straws stemmed from a study that found that Americans use 500 million plastic straws per day. That “study,” though, was an estimate from a 9-year-old child. It became gospel truth around 2018 among liberal media outlets, politicians in California and Hawaii, and environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club. In reality, however, the United States is hardly a global player when it comes to plastic pollution. The U.S. is responsible for less than 1% of global mismanaged plastic waste, with plastic straws making up a fraction of that share. China, in comparison, is responsible for more than 20% of global mismanaged plastic waste. Meanwhile, on the straw question specifically, a real study from Belgium found that paper straws have a higher concentration of “forever chemicals” than the plastic straws they are replacing. This is how it so often goes for Democrats trying to “save the planet” with their heavy-handed restrictions. Bans on single-use plastics, including plastic bags, led to New Jersey residents tripling their plastic consumption and using reusable grocery bags that are worse for the environment. California’s fast-approaching ban on gas-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles has several drawbacks for the environment, as does the state’s insistence on banning nuclear energy as part of its carbon-free energy grid. The Democratic Party’s junk science on environmental matters makes the environment worse and life more inconvenient for people. Nothing shows that better than the bizarre panic over plastic straws. It is a statistically insignificant portion of global plastic pollution that rose to prominence based on a “study” from a third grader, which managed to make it all the way to the desk of the president.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T23:05:24+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3317019/war-plastic-straws-highlights-democrats-shoddy-science/
A beloved Pennsylvanian returns home from a Russian prison,"BUTLER, Pennsylvania — “He’s coming home, he’s coming home.” Those were the words of Malphine Fogel, the mother of Marc Fogel, a western Pennsylvania teacher who was arrested in Russia in 2021 and sentenced to 14 years in a hard labor camp in 2022. He was imprisoned there until Tuesday, when President Donald Trump ‘s administration secured his release. Sean Parnell, a western Pennsylvania native who was recently named assistant secretary of defense by Trump, recalled being with Malphine Fogel when she met with the president ahead of his July 13 rally in her family’s hometown of Butler. He promised her at the end of the meeting, “We will get your son back.” After earning Trump’s promise, Parnell said Malphine Fogel exited the meeting and joined the crowd dancing to Kid Rock’s “American Badass, “which was pretty awesome to see a 90-year-old woman do.” Mike Kelly, the Butler County Republican congressman who has been a constant in trying to secure Marc Fogel’s release, marveled at his mother’s optimism after her meeting with Trump. “Malphine was given the gift of hope and purpose that day, and she held on to it,” said Kelly, who has known the Fogel family for decades. Kelly praised the Pennsylvania delegation for working together for the family and the upper chamber of the Senate, which in June passed a bipartisan resolution calling for Marc Fogel’s release. Since he graduated from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Marc Fogel has spent his career teaching the children of American diplomats around the world in places such as Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Venezuela, and Russia. He was sentenced in 2022 after he was arrested on charges of possessing medical marijuana, which was prescribed by a doctor in the United States for back pain. After missing so much time with his sons, Marc Fogel’s mother filed a lawsuit against then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken last June, saying he failed to designate her son as “wrongfully detained.” That designation finally came in the waning days of the Biden administration on Dec. 26, 2024, when it was moved to the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs within the State Department. Sen. David McCormick (R-PA), who has hosted Malphine Fogel at his home and even sat beside her at the July 13 rally in Butler, said, like the rest of the delegation, Marc Fogel’s release has been a top priority. “It was one of the questions I asked Marco Rubio when he was seeking confirmation as secretary of state and something we have discussed since then,” he said. U.S. Envoy for Hostages Ambassador Adam Boehler posted a photo on X of Marc Fogel in a grey sweatshirt, holding a plate of fruit and cheese, his passport, and what everyone hoped was a stiff drink in his glass. Sen. John Fetterman (PA), a Braddock Democrat, said on X, “Marc Fogel’s return home is long overdue and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family will be welcoming him back.” Twenty-two days after being sworn in, Trump kept the promise he made to Malphine Fogel. McCormick said, “Isn’t that something.” Kelly added, “After everything that happened that day, he never forgot. It is providential.”",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:56:20+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317377/beloved-pennsylvanian-returns-home-russian-prison/
Trump can make this a global golden age for religious liberty,"The United States is a beacon for religious freedom . That’s a regrettably rare thing around the world. Pew Research’s 2022 Report on Government Restrictions on Religion showed that restrictions in 198 countries and territories peaked in 2022. President Donald Trump’s second term thus presents a unique opportunity to cement his legacy in championing global religious freedom. “You shouldn’t have to leave your faith at the door of your people’s government, and under President Trump’s leadership, you won’t have to,” Vice President JD Vance said during the International Religious Freedom Summit last week in Washington. Protection of religious freedom was a core tenet of Trump’s first-term foreign policy. In his remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2019, he reaffirmed that “religious freedom is a fundamental right”. His efforts received bipartisan support in Congress. The first Trump administration built on the foundation set by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and launched a series of unprecedented initiatives to support persecuted religious minorities, advocate religious freedom in international forums, and maintain a strong stance against religious persecution in countries such as China and Iran. In 2018, for example, the State Department established the International Religious Freedom Ministerial and held the historic and first Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. The event was followed by ministerial meetings held in 2019, 2020, and 2022. These were designed to bring together religious leaders, advocates, and government officials from around the world to discuss and promote religious freedom. They served to elevate the importance of religious freedom on the global stage and reinforce U.S. leadership in defending this fundamental human right. Congress also acted. One of the most prominent bipartisan legislative actions was the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act in 2020. This act aimed to address China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in its Xinjiang region, including forced labor, surveillance, and mass detentions. The legislation introduced sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses. Also in 2020, the Falun Gong Protection Act was introduced in Congress to highlight concerns over China’s persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The bill had bipartisan backing, with lawmakers advocating action over the Chinese government’s human rights violations. In addition, several U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have expressed support for Shen Yun Performing Arts. Shen Yun is not just an arts group tied to the Falun Gong. According to its leaders, it is also a living artistic expression of a spiritual and cultural heritage that the Chinese Communist Party seeks to eradicate. Other examples abound. The Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act was bipartisan and passed with wide support in 2018. It aimed to hold the Iranian government accountable for human rights abuses, including the persecution of the Baha’i community, religious minorities, and others. In 2019, Congress passed the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act, which aimed to strengthen U.S. efforts to prevent genocide and other atrocities. The law had broad bipartisan support and was particularly focused on protecting religious and ethnic minorities, including Christians, Yazidis, Sunni minority groups, Shia minority groups, Alawites, Bahai’s, and Jews in areas including Syria, Iraq, and Iran. Building on these remarkable achievements, the new Trump administration could continue to advance global religious freedom and take further steps in supporting religious minorities around the world. The political change in Syria, for instance, requires the U.S. to ensure that minority faith groups — Alawites, Christians, Shiites, and others — finally enjoy religious freedom. In addition, the Trump administration should redouble efforts to protect Christians in North Korea, other religious minorities in Iran, and Christians, Uyghurs, Tibetans, or Buddhists in China. A comprehensive strategy to combat religious persecution and defend religious freedom abroad, ensuring that U.S. foreign aid, diplomacy, and other international efforts prioritize the protection of religious freedoms will advance global peace and stability, strengthen democratic principles, and counter extremism. It will also cement Trump’s legacy of global religious freedom champion.

The Biden economic hangover,"THE BIDEN ECONOMIC HANGOVER. Former President Joe Biden left a terrible legacy: the border catastrophe, chaos and disorder abroad, increased crime, oppressive wokeness. But for today’s purposes, consider the damage done by Biden’s economic policies. Inflation took away 20% of people’s purchasing power in a short period of time. Even when the rate of inflation slowed, it is still, right now, rising faster than economists — or anybody else — are comfortable with. This week there will be new numbers for inflation in January, and the message again will be that Biden brought inflation on but was unable to fully get rid of it. Now that is President Donald Trump’s job. Meanwhile, recent reports have brought word of what the New York Times called an “unusually large” downward revision in the number of jobs we thought were created in Biden’s final year, since March 2024. The bottom line is that about 600,000 fewer jobs were created in that period than we were told at the time through monthly jobs reports. “The Biden jobs market was way worse than markets thought,” Trump White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said recently. “There’s a lot of cleaning up to do.” Then there is federal spending. Biden and his Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill went crazy with spending. Coming off the already-high emergency COVID spending of the final year of the first Trump administration, Biden and congressional Democrats poured trillions of dollars unnecessarily into the economy. First, Congress passed a $900 billion “COVID relief” bill just after Christmas 2020, as Trump was heading out the door. Biden, then president-elect, strongly supported it. Once Biden was in the White House, he pushed Democrats to pass his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in March 2021. One-point-nine trillion dollars. Did the economy really need a stimulus of that size? It was pretty clear, even at the time, that it did not. A month before it was passed, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote that, given the $900 billion stimulus that had already been passed, “the gap between actual and potential output [of the economy] will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed [American Rescue Plan] stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month. … That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.” Biden and the Democratic Party decided to pass the bill anyway, spending $150 billion a month to fix a $20 billion a month problem. That much money flooding the economy was going to worsen inflation. But Biden, who fantasized about being a new Franklin Delano Roosevelt, did not stop there. Later in 2021, he signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill — this one made possible in part by a minority of House and Senate Republicans who joined Democrats in supporting it. And then Biden took aim at what would be the biggest spending extravaganza ever — the proposed $2.2 trillion Build Back Better Act. It would spend on everything: climate change, housing assistance, welfare, Medicaid, everything. By the time the House passed a version of the bill , in November 2021, inflation had already reached 6.8%. (It would hit 9.1% in June 2022.) Some Senate Democrats got nervous about Biden’s reckless spending and forced reductions in the Build Back Better Act. It was downsized to $750 billion, including about $370 billion for climate spending and the rest for healthcare and other expenses. Then Biden gave it a new name: the Inflation Reduction Act. With inflation raging, still going up, and millions suffering, it was an act of supreme cynicism to call a bill that would make things worse the Inflation Reduction Act. But that is what Biden and his Democratic allies did, passing the bill in August 2022. Only now are we learning the true damage the Inflation Reduction Act did. Look at this from the Cato Institute : “The Inflation Reduction Act was initially touted as a deficit-neutral bill, with its ten-year energy and climate-related provisions projected to cost about $370 billion, offset with tax increases. However, in an upcoming Cato policy analysis, Travis Fisher and Joshua Loucks estimate that the [Inflation Reduction Act] will cost between $936 billion and $1.97 trillion over the next ten years and up to $4.67 trillion by 2050 (and perhaps even more in later years because the subsidies are uncapped.)” In other words, with the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden and Democratic lawmakers created a perpetual spending machine. It’s possible some of them didn’t even know what they were doing. “If I’m being cynical, they may have been misled by advocates who knew how to game the scoring,” Cato’s Travis Fisher told me in an email exchange. “Even some policy analysts who should know better were fooled by this one.” So were millions of people, of course. And in the end, they didn’t get what their trillions of dollars were supposed to buy. In the infrastructure bill, for example, there was $42 billion that was supposed to bring high-speed internet to people in hard-to-reach areas. More than three years later, it has not connected a single person. There was also $7.5 billion to build tens of thousands of electric vehicle chargers. More than three years later, only a few dozen have been built. That makes sense; Biden and Democrats passed money faster than anyone could possibly use it, and even though they raced to shovel cash out the door in December and January, many billions remain unspent. Trump has put a freeze on Inflation Reduction Act funds, and there could be a fight over it in Congress. But none of that changes the final conclusion . Joe Biden, imagining himself to be FDR, did enormous damage to people’s standard of living. They will be suffering a Biden hangover for a long time to come.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T22:48:06+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3317404/biden-economic-hangover/
"If there’s a ‘constitutional crisis,’ blame Democrats","When a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from accessing Treasury Department information this week, Vice President JD Vance noted that “judges aren’t allowed to control” the president’s “legitimate power.” This, we are told by hysterics, has plunged the United States into a “constitutional crisis.” However, Vance is, of course, entirely correct that it’s illegitimate for activist judges to dictate how the executive branch governs itself. It’s certainly not a constitutional crisis for an administration to seek emergency relief from a partisan injunction. Presidents have done it on numerous occasions. And any higher court that takes the Constitution seriously will smack down these assaults on separation of power by judges, tout de suite . If none do, then we have ourselves a constitutional crisis. Then again, if the Left’s alarms were legitimate and genuine, it has zero moral authority to decry abuse after spending nearly two decades deliberately trashing the separation of power. The Democratic Party has been a walking constitutional crisis. Take the New York Times , which is leading the charge on the “constitutional crisis.” The outlet has spent years running columns championing the need to “reform” or trash our antiquated Constitution. Now, the paper is demanding courts suddenly uphold the founders’ vision of governance? Well, I assure you not one of them envisioned a federal government agency funding a “transgender comic book” in Peru or dictating the kind of straw one can use. It was only a few weeks ago that former President Joe Biden tried to post an amendment to the Constitution. Instead of mocking a failed president’s break with reality, Democratic senators and an array of left-wing groups, including the American Bar Association, praised him. The same ABA, incidentally, just wrote a scathing letter criticizing the Trump administration’s “dismantling” of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many of the people who feigned horror at the president auditing departments under his purview were quite happy when former President Barack Obama ignored Congress and unilaterally bestowed millions of illegal immigrants with amnesty. Obama also ignored Congress and SCOTUS on immigration law, and then repeatedly ignored the courts on his signature law, Obamacare, as well as on recess appointments. “When Congress won’t act, this president will,” one of his aides famously bragged. It was Obama-era Democrats who normalized the modern imperial presidency. And today, many voters, seem convinced that a nonexistent “popular vote” empowers presidents with nonexistent ”mandates” to rule as a king. Thanks, Obama. Remember when Harvard constitutional law professor Mark Tushnet offered the faux legal rationalization for the Biden administration to ignore the “MAGA court” and implement “popular constitutionalism?” Does Trump also have a license to do anything he pleases because he won the “popular vote?” Democrats now contend an activist district court judge should be able to micromanage the White House’s hiring decisions. Only recently, though, they were pushing Biden to ignore the Supreme Court and “forgive” billions of dollars in existing loans by decree. He did. “The Supreme Court blocked it, but that didn’t stop me,” Biden bragged . Not one Democrat, as far as I can tell, decried this flagrant circumvention of separation of powers. Then again, the Left has spent the better part of two decades destroying the legitimacy of the “unelected” Supreme Court, the only institution in American life that is more or less still functioning properly. It began with Obama’s unprecedented public disparagement of the court for upholding the First Amendment in Citizens United . Soon, the Left was engaged in a concerted big-dollar “dark-money” effort not to only smear justices but to convince a large swath of constituents that the institution was a threat to “democracy.” (They say it like it’s a bad thing.) By 2024, the mainstream Left had embraced the authoritarian idea of court packing. What happened to the campaign to add justices, by the way? What happened to the Democrats’ efforts to “reform” the filibuster? I guess we’ll have to wait until the next time a Democrat wins the White House to hear about how the procedure is a relic of Jim Crow. Because the Left’s newfound respect of separation of powers is also a matter over consequentialism, not constitutionalism. It was only a few years ago that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, now extraordinarily alarmed about the constitutionality of DOGE, was imploring Biden to take emergency powers over climate change and hand the entire economy over to an unelected administrative state. So, spare us your fake indignation. For decades, the threat of mutually assured political destruction led both parties to guard governing norms to some extent. Once the Left had control of the administrative state, it believed no matter what norm it broke, federal agencies would continue the mission, even if Republican presidents won. Today we’re supposed to be horrified that Elon Musk wasn’t elected directly by the people. There is virtually no aspect of life that unelected heads of the administrative state agencies haven’t tried to control over the past few years. Your cars. Your stoves. Your school bathrooms. And that’s really why Democrats are so freaked about USAID being audited and scaled back. Their power is vested in these institutions. Now, even if you believe that USAID — or whatever agency is next in line — does some good work, as I do, there’s little doubt it was also a slush fund for parasitic non-governmental organizations that spread progressive social science quackery. If all this activity was above board and supported by voters and Congress — and democratic — the place wouldn’t be run with the secrecy of the CIA. There’s nothing unconstitutional about the president firing executive branch employees who serve at his pleasure, creating more transparency, or cutting spending that isn’t explicitly authorized by Congress. And, in fact, presidents have promised to do as much for decades and failed. Though, Republicans should remember that any countermarch through the institutions will only stick long-term if Congress passes laws that limit the power or shut down agencies such as USAID or the Department of Education — and hopefully others. MAGA likes to point out that USAID was created by an executive order, which is true. However, Congress has passed numerous bills since funding the agency. The Department of Education wasn’t created by Jimmy Carter, as people often contend, but by a law signed by the president. It should be undone the same way, or the next Democrat administration will quickly reactivate the leviathan. As for Democrats, it’s the easiest thing imaginable to stand up against executive abuses (real or imagined) when you’re out of power. No one believes you. And if there’s a genuine constitutional crisis in the next few years, you will deserve plenty of the blame.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T21:32:13+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3315442/constitutional-crisis-blame-democrats/
The dumbest immigration policy in the world,"Vice President JD Vance told the truth with characteristic bluntness recently when he said, “Just because we were founded by immigrants doesn’t mean that 240 years later, we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world.” He was speaking on CBS’s Sunday talk show Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan about birthright citizenship and President Donald Trump’s order that federal agencies cease issuing citizenship papers to children of illegal immigrants or other foreigners temporarily in the United States. The issue of birthright citizenship is not clear cut and will doubtless go to the Supreme Court for a clarifying decision. There is a strong case for birthright citizenship but also a strong one against it . As Chuck Cooper and Pete Patterson argued in the Wall Street Journal , granting birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants contains a constitutional absurdity; because only born citizens may run for president, it would mean the highest office was open to children of illegal immigrants but blocked to children brought here legally, naturalized, and raised in America, who might even have served in the U.S. military. How can it make sense that such citizens are treated as subordinate, with fewer rights than children born to foreign women with no connection to America other than that they arrived nine months pregnant, broke the law to cross the border, and gave birth? The legal controversy over birthright citizenship is based on interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which was adopted to entrench the abolition of slavery and ensure that former slaves were always in future recognized as American citizens with all the rights and protections that this status confers on others. But proponents of birthright citizenship often tellingly argue less over the precise and debatable meaning of the 14th Amendment and more on the vaguer, more emotional, less legalistic ground that, as Brennan said, “this is a country founded by immigrants.” It was this statement that Vance was answering when he talked of the dumbest immigration policy in the world. The fact that Americans all descend from immigrants is cited by the Left’s open borders crowd as a sort of talisman with the magical power to make all complexities and reasonable questions on the subject disappear in a puff of self-righteousness. Noting that we are a nation of immigrants is deployed like the accusation of racism to silence anyone who suggests there is room for debate. It is this simplistic sentiment that inspires, if that is not too flattering a word, a limitless number of dreary cartoons depicting the Statue of Liberty altered and unfeelingly denying entry to the world’s poor. The cartoonists intend these to deliver an acid rebuke to those who believe immigration is a nuanced issue and that current citizens should have a say in limiting the flow of foreigners into the country. Those who argue for the dumbest immigration policy want the acceptable limit of polite conversation to exclude suggestions that some immigrants are less desirable than others. They often remind you that during the great immigration surge early in the 20th century, xenophobes said arrivals from southern Europe were undesirable. The implication and often the explicit accusation is that it is racist today to regard mass immigration from the Muslim nations of Africa and the Middle East, for example, as unwelcome and ripe for restriction. Such arguments are coupled to the assertion that the U.S. is not a blood and soil nation but a country founded on universal principles to which all people can subscribe. This does not, however, fit well into the rest of the Left’s agenda, for it also insists that people arriving from different cultures should not have to integrate or accept those universal principles — should not agree to live by America’s traditional values but should retain their own. The Left angrily rejects the old-fashioned notion that such people should be stirred into the melting pot and “become” Americans. They insist, against all the evidence, that diversity is our strength. “Diversity” here is a deceptive term that erases the huge difference between diversity of race and diversity of culture and values. There would be no problem if America’s people were only racially diverse but united by a common culture. But that is not the case. The Left encourages immigrants, both legal and illegal, to cling to their alien cultures, which are often hostile to America’s foundational ideas. The Left denigrates the host nation and its values to which the foreigners have migrated. It is often noted on the separate subject of government spending that a nation can have a generous welfare state or an open immigration policy but cannot have both together without courting financial ruin. Likewise, America can have mass immigration or unlimited cultural diversity, but it cannot have both at the same time without inviting division and national decline.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T20:45:48+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3317163/dumbest-immigration-policy-in-world/
Trump runs defense for deep state with Mark Zaid clearance revocation,"President Donald Trump is heavily focused on dismantling what he regards as a so-called “deep state” of government agencies that work for their own partisan agendas. This concern is especially important when it comes to the intelligence and security agencies, where if malfeasance occurs, it undermines our democratic society. However, if Trump wants to take on the deep state, why is he taking one of its most successful challengers off the field? Namely, Mark Zaid. A longtime national security attorney based in Washington, Zaid has held a high-level Top Secret-SCI government security clearance for more than 20 years. This clearance has allowed Zaid to represent members of the intelligence community whose concerns relate to highly classified information. Trump revoked Zaid’s clearance last week. The president’s apparent motive for the revocation is Zaid’s role in representing a whistleblower who alleged that Trump improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call between the two leaders during Trump’s first term in office. If so, this is a silly rationale for revocation. Zaid is an attorney. His job is to represent clients whether or not he shares their political views. And Zaid is hardly an anti-Trump agitator. He has previously represented numerous Trump administration or aligned officials. Zaid previously worked closely with former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) in relation to the Benghazi terrorist attack investigation. John Solomon reported that Zaid was the first attorney to represent a key IRS whistleblower who alleged misconduct in the Justice Department’s investigation of Hunter Biden for tax fraud. Does that sound like the work of a deep state Democratic partisan to you? Zaid told the Washington Examiner why he believes Trump made a misjudgment here. “In reality,” he said, “this decision hurts his administration more than it does me because it will preclude my ability to represent his own people, as I did during his first administration, who face employment and security concerns, as well as defending them in investigations.” Zaid’s clearance revocation will also perversely help both Biden administration officials and Russia. Zaid represented numerous former and active intelligence officers in relation to the so-called “Havana Syndrome” or “Anomalous Health Incidents” concern. The Biden administration facilitated the intelligence community’s cover-up of Russia’s responsibility for causing many Havana Syndrome incidents. Zaid observed, “This action truly hurts my AHI clients. I was regularly bringing AHI whistleblowers to [the Congressional intelligence oversight committees] for classified interviews and giving them protection because of my clearance. That was to show the Biden administration was covering up the truth. And I was doing it pro bono.” Trump has some legitimate concerns over politicization within the deep state. However, if he wants to take on deep state malfeasance, the very worst thing he could do is remove the security clearance of lawyers such as Zaid. That path helps only those who are interested in cover-ups and setting their own agendas outside of effective oversight. After all, the government imposes strict conditions on how whistleblowers are supposed to disclose their concerns. If a whistleblower breaks these conditions, they will likely quickly find themselves facing a visit from the FBI. Even if prosecution and prison time don’t follow, suspension of a security clearance and dismissal are likely. For individuals who have spent their careers in the shadows and who have yet to put their children through college, this concern means that staying quiet about a deep state problem is often personally preferable to speaking out about it. Individuals such as Zaid are thus crucial in supporting democratic transparency by shielding those who want the truth to set Americans free. Put another way, Trump is further flooding the swamp rather than draining it with this decision. The president should reconsider.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T19:45:41+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3316191/trump-runs-defense-deep-state-mark-zaid-clearance-revocation/
Vance’s trip shows confidence for Gabbard and RFK Jr. confirmations,"Vice President JD Vance is in Europe this week for an AI summit in Paris and a security conference in Munich. Amid looming confirmation votes for Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., this may seem like a poor time for Vance, who would be required to cast a tiebreaking vote in the Senate, to travel out of the country. Gabbard, President Donald Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, is set for a full Senate vote Tuesday. Kennedy, Trump’s nominee for secretary of health and human services, will undergo a Senate cloture vote as soon as Gabbard’s vote finishes. Vance has already had to rescue one of Trump’s nominees, casting the tiebreaking vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after three Republicans broke ranks. Indeed, both Gabbard’s and Kennedy’s committee votes passed along party lines, indicating close upcoming votes in the Senate. And with Vance in Europe, Gabbard and Kennedy can only afford to lose two Republican votes to ensure confirmation. Gabbard has already cleared one major hurdle on the path to confirmation, passing a Senate cloture vote 52-46 yesterday. Kennedy’s fate, however, is more of an unknown. He won over previous skeptics such as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) during his committee hearings and passed a procedural vote along party lines, suggesting future success. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted against the Hegseth confirmation and is seen as a swing vote, also said she would vote for Kennedy. Vance’s trip indicates that Trump has likely secured enough Senate votes to confirm both nominees. After the procedural votes for both candidates, there are indications that both will receive the necessary votes for confirmation. The president would be unlikely to send his VP to overseas conferences if there were any doubt in the confirmation votes. Democrats’ continued delay regarding the votes also indicates that Gabbard and Kennedy have enough support. If Vance were the key vote in the process, Democrats would likely want to push the vote through before he returns. Vance’s sudden visit to Europe may be a source of worry to some, given the weight of Gabbard’s and Kennedy’s confirmations. The trip, however, reflects an increased confidence that Trump has sufficient Senate votes to confirm both nominees by Wednesday evening.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T17:07:08+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3316603/jd-vance-trip-shows-confidence-tulsi-gabbard-rfk-jr-confirmation/
India is the un-China,"No one should be that surprised India has chosen to permit United States military flights to return illegal immigrants. The decision followed swiftly after Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first meeting with any foreign official, that with India’s foreign minister. Progressives, who regularly denounce Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a religious fundamentalist strongman, may cast the evident alliance with the Trump administration as evidence that he is a populist authoritarian. But time spent in the world’s most populous nation tells a different story: Call it the un-China, the democratic contrast to the People’s Republic of China—which is far from likely to take back its own thousands of illegal immigrants who’ve been sneaking across the Mexico border. The reality for one traveling in India—enjoying dinner with local families, reading local papers (The Hindu or the Times of India), talking with rice paddy farmers—is that of an affinity with the U.S. not only militarily (through the QUAD group which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well) but culturally. One comes away convinced that as threats from China loom, we must root for India. In the un-China, political dissent is part of a normal day: newspapers simply teem with American-style op-eds of all kinds, from expressing concern about fraying family life to denouncing Modi’s BJP party for seeking to win elections by distributing “ freebies”— such as benefits to inefficient rural small farmers. The Hindu expresses concern that such redistribution may undermine the goal of 8% economic growth—the best means to uplift the country’s poor. Indeed, in India, information flows freely. There is no firewall that limits access to international media, nor are stories that reflect poorly on the government. The Times of India is unflinching in such criticism— as per a recent editorial calling for safe drinking water to become the norm throughout the country and calling out the government for not making it a priority. Modi may embrace traditional Hindu values based strongly on ethical behavior, but religious freedom is unrestricted in practice. Two Muslim women selling fashionable saris in the city of Kochi express unconcern to the point of being puzzled about the question of persecution. “We have many Hindu friends. There is no problem”. Christianity thrives in the southern state of Kerala, and the non-Hindu Sikh party rules Uttar Pradesh , India’s most populous state (241 million). ( It denounced the flights returning illegal immigrants.) Local Mumbai philanthropy has helped restore a grand 19th-century synagogue. Even more important, the Chabad of Mumbai continues to thrive, notwithstanding the murder of its rabbi and his wife in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of 2008 that killed 164, the dead murdered at hotels across the city and the main rail station by Pakistani Muslim extremists. Like the U.S., the un-China is a deeply religious country, where pilgrims travel by overnight bus from temple to temple. The world’s largest gathering of people just concluded, saw 90 million pilgrims attend the Maha Kumbh in the city Prayagraj, where the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers meet, and devotees dip in what are said to be holy waters that purge one’s sins. In the un-China, no one’s freedom of movement, from farm village to city or back, is restricted. This includes the legal right to work abroad. At a rice paddy in Kerala, the woman of the house, pointing to her smartphone, says she receives direct remittances from her son in Saudi Arabia, where he works as a welder. That helps pay for her daughter to attend nursing school. A sense of ambition and drive for individual upward mobility abound, even at a farm where five water buffalo still serve as beasts of burden. Freedom of internal movement has led to the growth of Mumbai’s Dharavi, the world’s largest so-called slum, where a million people, Hindu and Muslim from throughout India, have moved to what’s termed the “City of Hope.” This is far from the poverty one might imagine; the city provides power and water and every manner of small business-from plastic recycling to ceramics—thrives. Modern bathhouses have advanced Modi’s Clean India initiative, which has dramatically reduced the problem of outdoor defecation. On a Dharavi alley, a family of four shares a single room (neat and clean, with spaces and clothes on shelves), accruing savings toward buying their own “flat,’ in a better neighborhood. The two daughters attend a private school where instruction is in English. The elder aspires to be a flight attendant for the recently privatized Air India. The overwhelming majority of rural children plan to leave the farm. In the un-China, aspiration is not limited by political party membership (albeit caste discrimination remains a problem). At dinner (served on a banana leaf) at a family’s home in the provincial southern Indian city of Trichy, a young adult daughter discusses her plans for when she completes her pending master’s degree in computer science. Her teenage brother plans to be a doctor. Tradition and modernity coexist. If the daughter gets an IT job in Bangalore, India’s Silicon Valley equivalent, her mother will move with her for at least two months, she says, to make sure her daughter is safely settled. The family’s three children all expect arranged marriages, as per that of their parents. “Nothing is more important than family,” their father tells us. In the un-China, school choice, as Americans would call it, and for which Donald Trump expresses support, is already the norm. Since 2009, when the country passed a Right to Education Law, enrollment in private high schools has increased by 330%, compared to 30% in government schools. Slum families scrimp to pay tuition for English language private schools. In Kerala, the state with the highest literacy rate, only 44.5% of students attend government school, down sharply from 64.5% in 2022 . In this supposed religious state, in other words, the decision about what to teach and how is left up to thousands of individual schools. The un-China, like the U.S. projects, soft power—through literature and film. Bollywood, based in Mumbai, releases hundreds of films each year. Although many are replete with escapist song and dance, others broach the most sensitive problems. The acclaimed All We Imagine As Light , set in Mumbai and winner of the Cannes Film Festival Grand Prize, not only tells the story of a romance between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man but also that of an unscrupulous developer who forces a poor woman out of her home. Luxury high-rise construction in Mumbai, a metro of 20 million and growing, defines the city’s skyline. An affinity for the U.S. is evident on the teeming streets of the city, where pedlock is the norm. Insignia merchandise from U.S. cities and schools— Boston, Houston, New York, L.A., even the Bronx —abounds. Indians are well aware that emigrants from their country have become CEOs (Microsoft, Alphabet) in America. In a nation allegedly run by an aspiring strongman, it is democracy that is strong. Prime Minister Modi’s BJP party took a beating at the polls last year, falling far short of its goal to attain a parliamentary majority. There is palpable pride in democratic governance and the rule of law (much of it literally a British legacy). On an Air India flight from Kochi to Mumbai, the flight crew took time for an announcement recognizing Republic Day, the January 26 commemoration of the adoption of India’s federalist-style constitution, proclaiming aloud its guarantees of “democracy, equality, and justice.” Just a routine announcement in the un-China.

How serious is Trump about making Canada the 51st state?,"In an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News yesterday, President Donald Trump said he was serious about making Canada the 51st state. “I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state,” Trump said. “We lose $200 billion a year with Canada, and I’m not going to let that happen.” The interview came days after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was caught on a hot mic saying Trump’s plans to annex Canada are “a real thing.” Trump has previously entertained ideas about adding Canada to the United States and has jokingly called the prime minister “Gov. Trudeau.” “I’d like to see Canada become our 51st state,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Feb. 3. “Some people say that would be a long shot. If people wanted to play the game right, it would be 100% certain that they’d become a state.” If added to the U.S., Canada would be the most populous state, with 40 million residents, just ahead of California’s 39 million. However, it may be impractical to add another state with such a large land area and population. A solution would be to add each of Canada’s 10 provinces as separate states. Some provinces, such as Ontario, would likely lean left, while others, such as Alberta, would probably lean right. Adding the provinces separately could add as many as 20 new senators to the congressional mix. Also, over 10% of U.S. representatives would come from the new Canadian states. Congressional representation would also be a problem, as two Canadian provinces have smaller populations than all of the U.S. states. Prince Edward Island, with about 175,000 residents, has less than a third of the population of Wyoming, the U.S.’s smallest state by population. The province would likely need to be added to the U.S. as a part of either Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. It is possible that Trump is trolling Canada with his talk about annexing the country. He may be trying to leverage better trade deals as he did with immigration when he threatened tariffs on Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. In those instances, Trump showed that he was perfectly willing to go through with the tariffs before each country reached a compromise with him. If Trump annexed Canada, it would be, by far, the largest territorial acquisition in U.S. history, more than doubling the country’s current size. It may be a long shot, but with his push to acquire Greenland, Trump appears determined to add the first state to the Union since Hawaii in 1959.",Washington Examiner,2025-02-11T15:34:55+00:00,,Commentary,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3315791/how-serious-trump-making-canada-51st-state/
Obamacare insurers collect billions in taxpayer subsidies — just to deny claims,"Democrats spent the last four years trying to expand Obamacare enrollment, largely by ramping up federal premium subsidies. However, the health coverage available through the exchanges often doesn’t do much good, as too many Obamacare enrollees discover when a medical bill comes due. According to new research from KFF , health insurers operating through the federal exchanges denied 1 in 5 claims in 2023. In other words, the United States is funneling billions of taxpayer dollars to insurance companies so they can deny claims. It’s long past time for officials to curtail their corporate welfare for insurers. The new KFF report analyzed transparency data from health insurance companies that operated through HealthCare.gov in 2023. On average, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims and 37% of out-of-network claims — or 20% total. In-network denial rates for individual insurers varied from 1% to a whopping 54%. Some of the country’s biggest insurance companies scored worse than average. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama, for instance, denied 35% of in-network claims. UnitedHealth Group denied 33%, and Health Care Service Corporation 29%. Out of 175 health insurance companies, only 22 had an in-network denial rate of less than 10%. Sometimes insurers have good reasons for denying claims — say, if a patient wants coverage for a service the insurer plainly advertises it doesn’t cover. But the most common reason insurers gave for denying payment was “other” (34%). Next came administrative reasons (18%), followed by excluded service (16%) and lack of prior authorization or referral (9%). Only 6% of decisions were grounded in “lack of medical necessity,” such as with elective cosmetic surgery. For most patients, a denial ends up being final. Obamacare enrollees rarely ask their insurers to reconsider. In 2023, exchange customers appealed a mere 376,527, or 1%, of 73 million in-network denied claims. The insurer stuck with its original decision in over half of these cases. But data like these haven’t stopped Democrats from pressing for an extension of Biden-era premium subsidies , which expire at the end of this year. The subsidies guarantee that no Obamacare enrollee pays more than 8.5% of income on premiums, and they cover a steadily increasing share of premiums as income declines below four times the poverty level. According to the Congressional Budget Office, making these enhanced subsidies permanent would cost $335 billion over the next decade. Ending the premium subsidies is a commonsen se way to reduce wasteful spending. Republicans should ensure they do indeed expire at the end of this year. Sally C.
