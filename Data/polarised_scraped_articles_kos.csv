Nebraska went big for Trump—and that may kill its economy,"Nearly 60% of Nebraskavotedfor Donald Trump last November. There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. ""Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,"" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. ""For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling ""wearily"" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. ""There's no way it can,"" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. ""I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,"" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. ""The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens."" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: ""I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska."" That parishioner says people in the state ""understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid."" However, given Nebraska's overwhelming vote for Trump, that assertion seems debatable.",Daily Kos,2025-01-26 16:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/26/2298712/-Nebraska-went-big-for-Trump-and-that-may-kill-its-economy
The origins of Trump’s war on diversity,"Explaining the Rightis a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know. Donald Trump spent his first week in office using the power of the presidency to attack decades of actions to promote diversity. Trumpissued executive ordersrolling back desegregation orders, instructing government offices that promote diversity to be shuttered, and laying off workers tasked with promoting inclusion. He even threatened federal employees, ordering them tosnitch on each otherto expose any pro-diversity positions that might have flown under the radar. Trump, of course, has along history of racism, and the conservative movement and Republican Party he leads has frequently voiced opposition to social progress. But the executive actions in his second administration are occurring with a level of vigor much higher than in his first term. So what happened? In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set offa series of protestsagainst racial injustice throughout the United States and the world. While such protests have always occurred, the uprising of 2020 happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic—and while Trump was in the White House, pursuing a racist agenda that includedpraising Nazisand other right-wing extremists. Conservatives, still reeling from significant advances from Barack Obama's presidency, chose to strike back by more forcefully opposing pro-diversity efforts in government, academia, and business. Activists like Christopher Ruforallied conservativesto attack diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and falsely claimed that the academic ""critical race theory,"" which discusses systemic racism, was being taught at all school levels rather than just in college. At the same time, conservative media—led by outlets like Fox News—attacked any and all advances toward racial and gender equity as ""woke,"" subverting the meaning of the term originally coined by Black activists to promote racial awareness. Suddenly, according to Fox,everything under the sunwas ""woke."" When M&M's added a female character to its advertising, Fox's Harris Faulkner complained that the brand was ""back to pushing woke politics, the company now introducing a new progressive pack of chocolates: women M&M's."" Conservative pundit Buck Sexton appeared on Fox to argue that lingerie company Victoria's Secret's choice to get rid of its ""angels"" concept was a sinister plot to ""go a little bit woke."" Similarly, leading Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisdeclaredthat his state was at war with ""woke."" DeSantis ordered the state to only use red, white, and blue lights on bridges—prohibiting lights that celebrate events like Pride Month or Juneteenth. He even wenton the attackagainst one of the state's biggest and most beloved companies, Disney, because diversified some of its content. Trump was involved in all of this by promoting attacks on diversity from within the presidency, includingfalsely labelingthe racial justice protests as being purely violent. Trump is also a habitual consumer of Fox News and the network has a demonstrated ability to influence his world view, as can be seen by the slew of Fox talking headsnow populatinghis administration. While Trump was adopting this posture, many of the former members of his administration and their ideological allies were concoctingProject 2025, which isextremely focusedon rolling back many civil rights gains and other advances—like same-sex marriage—that have occurred in the ensuing decades. Now in his second term, Trump has installed Project 2025 architects in his Cabinet and is already implementing their wish list. Trump began his political careerriding a waveof racist right-wing anger after the United States elected its first Black president. And now, he and his party have the civil rights movement squarely in their crosshairs.",Daily Kos,2025-01-26 00:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298925/-The-origins-of-Trump-s-war-on-diversity
How Eric Adams’ downfall led him straight into Trump’s arms,"In a recent interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, New York City Mayor Eric Adams alleged that the Democratic Party ""left"" him. ""People often say, 'Well, you know, you don't sound like a Democrat, and you know, you seemed to have left the party.' No, the party left me, and it left working-class people,"" said Adams, who is running for reelection as a Democrat against the backdrop of five federalcriminal charges. The roughly50-minuteinterview with Carlson, one of Donald Trump'smost ardent allies, is Adams' latest attempt to appeal to the president, whoexpressed a willingnessto pardon him for his crimes. It also represents a break from Adams' past attitudes toward Carlson.During his 2021 mayoral run, Adams said he didn't ""want or need the support of Tucker Carlson, or anyone else who perpetuates racist, anti-immigrant propaganda."" But a criminal case clearly changed his outlook. More recently, Adams' attempts to curry favor with the president have been downright pathetic, butwithout the helpof his constituents, Adams might need to bring in the big guns. During his conversation with Carlson, Adams criticized both the Biden administration and Democrats' immigration policies, which he onceclaimedthreatened to ""destroy New York City."" He also said that the indictment against him was politically motivated. ""You complained about allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals and this indictment was punishment for complaining,"" Carlson said. ""That is clearly my belief,"" Adams confirmed. Later, Carlson questioned why Republican-led states shouldn't bus asylum seekers to New York City. For years, red states like Texas havespent millions of dollarsbusing immigrants to blue cities like New York in what amounts to a cruel political stunt. ""Isn't it fair to send all their illegals here because you guys welcome them?"" Carlson asked, nodding to the fact that New York is asanctuary city, meaning it aims to shield immigrants from unwarranted enforcement actions, including arrest or deportation. ""No, we're not welcoming them. Let me be very clear,"" he said, adding thatformer President Joe Biden and his aides once told him to tamp down his criticism regarding the influx of immigrants to help the party during the 2024 presidential election. ""Basically, be a good Democrat, Eric,"" Adams said. ""That was the basic overall theme."" ""It appeared to me there was a bigger focus on the national election and not on what it was doing to the cities,"" Adams later said, nodding to the influx of immigrants in New York City that officials estimatecosts $5 billion. The interview aired on the Tucker Carlson Network Tuesday evening but, asPolitico reports, was never promoted on the mayor's public schedule. A spokesperson for Adamsalso told the outletthat it was Carlson who requested the interview. ""Mayor Adams does not believe we should be living in silos and speaking into echo chambers,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""At a time where our country is so divided, the mayor believes we must break out of our comfort zones and speak with everyone—even those we may not always agree with."" While Adams, at times, gently refused some of Carlson's claims, it was a relatively friendly chit-chat. But the timing of it is interesting, as it comes amid increased speculation that Adams is angling for a presidential pardon ahead of hisApril trial. Adams, who wasfirst electedin 2021, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud, and two counts of illegally soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign national. Since at least October, Adams has tried to play nice with Trump and other Republicans. That month, after Trump defended Adams and suggested that both of them had been unfairly ""persecuted,"" Adamsavoided criticizingTrump. Now Adams is done playing coy. Shortly after Trump's reelection in November, Adamsrequested a meetingwith Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, then later danced around whether he'dconsider switching parties. Adams was a registered Republican from 1995 to 2002 before becoming a Democrat. Indeed, if party switching or, at the very least, cozying up to Republicans who are close to the president, is the way to win favor with Trump and the GOP, Adams' most recent interview and actions would suggest he's all in. On Monday, Adams scrapped his public scheduleto make the trekto Washington, D.C., after the Trump administration extended a last-minute invite to his inauguration. Adams, whopractically beggedTrump for a ticket, made the pilgrimage in thewee hours of the night. He had met with the president in Palm Beach, Florida,merely days prior. ""Inauguration Day is a sacred American tradition. Our country has been through so much, and every president has the honor and responsibility to protect and lead the American people,"" Adamswrote on X. ""I believe there's much we can achieve working alongside the federal government as we support our city's values and fight for New Yorkers."" Even if the interview with Carlson was just a formality, Trump is reportedly lapping up Adams' interest in his administration. According toRolling Stone, the president's allies have rightly called Adams ""thirsty"" for Trump's attention and even questioned when the ""actual begging and love letters start."" Adams isunlikely to be reelectedlater this year, so maybe his newfound fealty to the GOP is part of his backup plan once he's out of office. Or maybe he's angling for a role in Trump's Cabinet. After all, it is arevolving doorof senior-level administrators.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 22:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298270/-How-Eric-Adams-downfall-led-him-straight-into-Trump-s-arms
Maddow blasts Trump for his dangerous public health gag order,"The first few days of Donald Trump's second term have given Rachel Maddow a lot to cover, including the president's approach to public health. ""[Trump] has ordered that all information be stopped, including scientific information, to advise hospitals on how to deal with this emerging epidemic,"" Maddow said. The Trump administration's decision tocease all public-facing communicationfrom federal health agencies has been widely criticized. ""Is that popular? Is that a good idea? Is that perceived as a popular idea among the American people? Is that what you thought you were voting for?"" Maddow asked. ""You know what else isn't a popular idea? Bird flu."" Maddow went on to point out that the price of eggs hasskyrocketedas a result of the bird flu, inflating an already fraught economic situation. At the same time, Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has reportedlysolicited a raw milk purveyorto take up a role in the Food and Drug Administration. Scientists warn againstthe consumption of raw milkfor many reasons, least of which is that it canspread diseases like bird flu. ""In the meantime, stop releasing any information on this bird flu thing—anything,"" Maddow concluded. ""Honestly, it sounds scary. Maybe if we don't talk about it, maybe it'll go away. And by the way, pay no attention to the price of eggs."" Thebird fluhas affected livestock across the United States, from poultry to cattle. In January, thefirst human deathconnected with the disease was recorded in Louisiana.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 18:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298931/-Maddow-blasts-Trump-for-his-dangerous-public-health-gag-order
Hegseth confirmed as Trump's defense secretary in tie-breaking vote,"The Senate confirmedPete Hegsethas the nation's defense secretary Friday in a dramatic late-night vote, swatting back questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon amidallegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behaviortoward women. Rarely has a Cabinet nominee faced such wide-ranging concerns about his experience and behavior as Hegseth, particularly for such a high-profile role atop the U.S. military. But the Republican-led Senate was determined to confirm Hegseth, a former Fox News host and combat veteran who has vowed to bring a ""warrior culture"" to the Pentagon, rounding out PresidentDonald Trump'stop national security Cabinet officials. Vice President JD Vance was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote, unusual in the Senate for Cabinet nominees, who typically win wider support. Hegseth himself was at the Capitol with his family. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunesaid Hegseth, as a veteran of the Army National Guard who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, ""will bring a warrior's perspective"" to the top military job. ""Gone will be the days of woke distractions,"" Thune said, referring to the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives being slashed across the federal government. ""The Pentagon's focus will be on war fighting."" The Senate's ability to confirm Hegseth despite a grave series of allegations against him will provide a measure of Trump's political power and ability toget what he wants from the GOP-led Congress, and of the potency of the culture wars to fuel his agenda at the White House. Next week senators will be facing Trump's otheroutside Cabinet choicesincluding particularly Kash Patel, a Trump ally who has published an enemies list, as the FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as director of the office of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate at Health and Human Services. ""Is Pete Hegseth truly the best we have to offer?"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging his colleagues to think seriously about their vote. Hegseth himself was working the phones late Friday to shore up his support, his confirmation at stake. ""He's a good man,"" Trump said of Hegseth while departing the White House to visit disaster-hit North Carolina and Los Angeles. ""I hope he makes it."" Trump leveled criticism of Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who announced they would vote against Hegseth. And Tump raised fresh questions about Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying, ""And of course Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. Is Mitch a no vote?"" In the end all three voted against Hegseth, as tensions soared late Friday at the Capitol. McConnell, the former GOP leader in the Senate, had not declared his vote, but signaled skepticism in an earlier speech when he declared he would confirm nominees to senior national security roles ""whose record and experience will make them immediate assets, not liabilities."" He voted against. It takes a simple majority to confirm Hegseth, and Republicans, with a 53-47 majority in the Senate, could only lose one more objection. One Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, sent the Senate swirling as he raised questions and was provided information and answers, said a person familiar with the situation Thursday and granted anonymity to discuss it. But Tillis ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth who he said ""has a unique perspective"" and is passionate about modernizing the military. He said he spoke to Hegseth for ""nearly two hour"" about his concerns. Democrats, as the minority party, have helped confirm Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand CIA DirectorJohn Ratcliffein bipartisan votes to Trump's national security team within days of his return to the White House. But Democrats gravely opposed to Hegseth have little power to stop him, and instead have resorted to dragging out the process. Hours before the vote, Democrat after Democrat took to the Senate floor to object. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said during the debate there are few Trump nominees as ""dangerously and woefully unqualified as Hegseth."" Hegseth facesallegations that he sexually assaulted a womanat a Republican conference in California, though he has denied the claims and said the encounter was consensual. He laterpaid $50,000 to the woman. More recently, Hegseth's former sister-in-lawsaid in an affidavitthat he was abusive to his second wife to the point that she feared for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and in divorce proceedings, neither Hegseth nor the woman claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse. During afiery confirmationhearing, Hegseth dismissed allegations of wrongdoing one by one, and vowed to bring ""warrior culture"" to the top Pentagon post. Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job if confirmed. But Republican senators facing an intensive pressure campaign by Trump allies to support Hegseth have stood by his nomination, echoing his claims of a ""smear"" campaign against him. A Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth represents a newer generation of veterans who came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He went on to a career at Fox News as the host of a weekend show, and was unknown to many on Capitol Hill until Trump tapped him for the top Defense job. Hegseth's comments that women should have no role in military combat drew particular concern on Capitol Hill, including from lawmakers who themselves served. He has since tempered those views as he met with senators during the confirmation process. Murkowski said in a lengthy statement ahead of a test vote on Hegseth that his behaviors ""starkly contrast"" with what is expected of the military. ""I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,"" Murkowski wrote on social media. Collins said that after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth, ""I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed."" But one prominent Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a veteran and sexual assault survivor, came under harsh criticism for her skepticism toward Hegseth and eventually announced she would back him. Hegseth would lead an organization with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of $850 billion. In exercising its advise and consent role over Trump's nominees, the Senate is also trying to stave off his suggestion that the GOP leaders simply do away with the confirmation process altogether, and allow him to appoint his Cabinet choices when the Congress is on recess. Trump raised the idea of so-called ""recess appointments"" during a private White House meeting with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a step many senators are trying to avoid.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 03:09:35,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2299021/-Hegseth-confirmed-as-Trump-s-defense-secretary-in-tie-breaking-vote
GOP congressman makes oddly specific proposal to give Trump third term,"Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles has proposed legislation that would amend the Constitution, allowing Donald Trump to run for a third presidential term. ""I am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to revise the limitations imposed by the 22nd Amendment on presidential terms,"" Ogles saidin a statement. ""This amendment would allow President Trump to serve three terms, ensuring that we can sustain the bold leadership our nation so desperately needs."" Ogles also argued that the administration of President Joe Biden had left America in ""decay,"" echoing the false narrative offered by Trump and other Republicans.Nonpartisan datashows that under Biden the unemployment rate fell, crime decreased, and factory openings and infrastructure spending has significantly increased. Ogles' amendmentincludes the following wording: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms."" The change would upend the current law as laid out in the22nd Amendment, which limits presidential terms to two. The only president in U.S. history to be elected to more than two terms was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat whonotably spentthe bulk of his presidency in a fight againstglobal fascismand buildingthe social safety net—while Trump hasembraced fascistsandseeks to cutthe net. But what is particularly notable is that the Ogles change includes a limit of two consecutive terms. There are four former presidents that are alive, in addition to Trump. Of those men, only two would be eligible for another shot at the presidency if Ogles had his way—Trump and Biden. The law would conveniently prohibit Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush from running again because they all served two consecutive terms. Conveniently Trump's two-term Democratic predecessors all have electoral records significantly dwarfing Trump's track record. Trumpwonthe 2024 race with a popular vote margin of 1.5% and that is the only of the three times he has run for president that he received a popular vote majority or plurality (he lost the popular vote to former Sec. Hillary Clinton in 2016). By contrast, Obama has thesecond largestpopular vote margin of all the living presidents thanks to his 7.27% victory in 2008 against the late Sen. John McCain. Obama's reelection win also comes out well ahead of Trump, after he won by 3.86% in 2012 in his defeat of former Sen. Mitt Romney. Clinton, who is actually two months younger than Trump, also has a much better electoral track record. Clinton won by 5.56% in 1992 and by 8.51% in 1996—the biggest margin of the living presidents. Even his fellow Republican Bush, who like Trump also lost the popular vote before his first presidency, outperformed Trump. A constitutional amendment doesn't just need approval from Congress, but also hasto be ratifiedby 38 of the 50 states. Historically this has been a careful and deliberate process and extremely rare. The last amendment to be added is the 27th amendment, whichbecame lawin 1992. Ogles' proposal is the work of a Trump supporter attempting to extend his presidency in an impractical way. The congressman has been criticized in the comments ofhis Instagram accountfor pushing for the unlikely legislation just a day aftera school shootingin his district, arguably a more pressing concern. But then again, how else could he show his devotion to the MAGA cause?",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 00:00:26,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298973/-GOP-congressman-makes-oddly-specific-proposal-to-give-Trump-third-term
Trump gloats about pardoning criminals who attacked abortion clinic,"Donald Trump flexed his presidentialpardoning powers againon Thursday,granting clemencyto 23 anti-abortion lawbreakers. The move came one day ahead of the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. On Friday, aprerecorded videoof Trump was broadcast to the anti-abortion marchers. In the video, Trump praised himself for pardoning the criminals, including extremist Paula Harlow. ""At 75 years old, Paula was sentenced to two years in prison, after praying outside of a clinic,"" he said. ""That's why she was sentenced to two years."" However, the facts paint a different picture. Harlow was one ofnine protestersindicted in March 2022 for using chains, ropes, furniture, and themselves to block the doors to a health care facility that provides abortions. Per theJustice Department, Harlow and the other eight lawbreakers ""forcefully entered the clinic"" as a means to keep people from accessing medical care that went against the activists' beliefs. Another pardoned woman—whom MAGA die-hard Charlie Kirkdescribedas a ""peaceful"" activist ""persecuted by the Biden regime""—is Bevelyn Williams. In reality, Williams was sentenced to 41 months in prison after shecrushed a clinic employee'shand and used other means to block peoples' access to the clinic, according to the Justice Department. She also threatened ""war"" on the clinic's staff, saying she would ""terrorize this place."" Presidential pardons aside, the thousands of anti-abortion marchers descending upon the nation's capital on Friday seem to forget one important aspect of the March for Life rally: They've already achieved their primary goal. Thefirst March for Lifewas held on Jan. 22, 1974, on the anniversary ofRoe v. Wade, in protest of the monumental case granting federal abortion rights to women. But after the conservative-controlled Supreme Court overturnedRoein 2022, states can nowban abortionto their anger's content. However, allowing states to ban abortion isn't enough for the anti-abortion extremists. According to the March for Lifewebsite, they won't stop until they build a ""culture of life"" that makes abortion ""unthinkable"" for everyone.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 23:00:19,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298965/-Trump-gloats-about-pardoning-criminals-who-attacked-abortion-clinic
Trump ramps up pettiness by revoking more security—including for Fauci,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that he pulled federal security protection for former top U.S. health official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, making him the latest casualty of Trump's revenge tour. Fauci, whoretired from government servicein December 2022, served as the nation's top infectious diseases expert amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He was protected by federal marshals, and later by a private contractor, that was paid for by the National Institutes of Health, according to The New York Times. Sources close to the situation also told CNN,which first reported the move, that Fauci's detail was abruptly terminated on Thursday evening. This past June, Fauci said he and his familystill receive death threats, in part, because right-wing figures like Trump repeatedly promoted baseless lies about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""It's a pattern,"" Fauci toldCNN, adding that when someone in the media or Congress ""gets up and makes a public statement that I'm responsible for the deaths of X number of people because of policies or some crazy idea that I created the virus— immediately you can, it's like clockwork—the death threats go way up."" In May 2022, for instance, a West Virginia manpleaded guiltyto sending Fauci and other federal officials emails that threatened to kill them. Given that, and the public-facing role Fauci played during the pandemic, he's now hired his own private security that he'll pay for himself. During a press conference in North Carolina on Friday, Trumpdefended the moveas a natural progression that comes once officials no longer serve in the federal government. He also suggested that Fauci has more than enough money to pay for his own security detail. ""When you work for [the] government at some point your security detail comes off and you know, you can't have it forever. So I think it's very standard,"" Trump said. ""We took some off other people, too. But you can't have a security detail for the rest of your life because you work for [the] government."" Of course, this is easy to say if you're president, as they getprotection for the rest of their lives. This is the latest move in Trump's revenge arc. Earlier this week, heyanked security detailfrom his former national security adviser, John Bolton, whosharply criticizedthe president in his memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened."" Trumpcited the memoiras one of his reasons for revoking Bolton's security detail. ""The memoir's reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff,"" Trump said in theexecutive orderfrom Monday that announced the move. ""Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed."" (Not that Trump has ever been accused ofdoing such a thing.) In addition to Bolton, Trump also moved to end security details for former Secretary of StateMike Pompeoand former State Department officialBrian Hook. Both men were granted additional protection because they faced threats from Iran. At least, in Fauci's case, Trump might not be able to retaliate against him personally. Former President Joe Bidenpreemptively pardoned Faucion his last day in office, citing concerns about politically motivated investigations into the doctor, who had served for decades as the nation's top infectious diseases expert.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 22:00:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298932/-Trump-ramps-up-pettiness-by-revoking-more-security-including-for-Fauci
California governor to crash Trump's photo op in fire-ravaged state,"President Donald Trump is set to follow his Friday visit to North Carolina, which was hit by Hurricane Helene, with a trip to wildfire-ravaged Southern California. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a longtimeTrump nemesis, said he has yet to hear from the president—but plans to greet him at the airport anyway. ""I look forward to being there on the tarmac to thank the president, welcome him, and we're making sure that all the resources he needs for a successful briefing are provided to him,""Newsom saidto reporters on Thursday in Pasadena, where he signed two bills greenlighting $2.5 billion in recovery efforts. ""There's no limit to the resources we'll provide for that briefing."" Wildfirescontinueto batter Southern California, with a new one threatening San Diego County as of Friday. Fueled by record winds, the firestorm has killed 25 people and caused a staggering$250 billionin estimated damages, making it one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history. Despite the devastation, Trump and theGOP-led Congresshave floated the idea of withholding federal aid for the Golden State. He has also lied and said that California officials mismanaged the water supply after some fire hydrants in the Pacific Palisades area ran dry at the height of the fires. Los Angeles firefightersrefutedthis claim, arguing that hurricane-strength winds battering a drought-ravaged landscape mean ""no water system in the world"" could've stopped the wildfires. Trump has repeatedly spreadmisinformationabout the causes of the Los Angeles fires and suggested he will not release any aid unless the state changes its policies or caves on his mass deportation plans. On Friday, he told reporters he wants mandatory voter identification added to the list of capitulations he's demanding from the progressive state—something experts say leads tovoter suppression. ""People want to have voter identification. You want to have proof of citizenship. Ideally, you have one-day voting. But I just want voter ID as a start, and I want the water to be released,"" Trump said on a tarmac in Asheville, North Carolina, repeatingnonsensical claimsabout California's water supply. ""After that, I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen."" Trump also repeatedlysaidhe plans to overhaul or get rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is tasked with responding to natural disasters. ""I think we're going to recommend that FEMA go away,"" Trump said, adding that he'd dismantle the agency by signing an executive order. AsDaily Kosreported, this is sure to hit the red states that voted for him the hardest. Trump has ahistoryof playing politics with cities and states devastated by natural disasters if their leaders and voters disagree with him politically. His tried-and-true gambits include issuing threats via social media and spreading misinformation and conspiracies about FEMA recovery efforts, with conservative mediafollowing his lead. As apossible 2028 Democratic presidential contender, Newsom is not backing down from his standoff with Trump. Despite the ongoing tensions, he has consistently emphasized that his focus remains on getting aid to Californians, and not on petty partisan squabbles. ""My message to the incoming administration, and I'm not here to play any politics, is please don't play any politics,"" Newsom said during a Jan. 7 press conference. It's hard to ignore the sense that for Trump, this trip is more about posturing than problem-solving, and Newsom's challenge to the new administration has set the stage for a potential confrontation.

Boebert mocked in her home state for playing anti-trans bathroom cop,"Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert was mocked on-air by a news anchor from her home state after the Republican was caught patrolling a bathroom on the lookout for transgender people. ""Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert is tackling a key issue driving the high cost of living for Coloradans: Whether the one transgender woman in Congress is using the right bathroom,"" 9News anchor Kyle Clark said. The event, which Clark described as a ""restroom inquisition,""was witnessedby Bloomberg reporter Billy House. House said he saw Boebert running out of the Capitol's women's restroom on Thursday afternoon and that she complained to security that ""a guy"" was inside. Boebert then wrangled Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been themost vocal anti-trans figurein Congress, and took her into the bathroom to investigate. The two women later exited, without uncovering ""a guy"" as had been claimed. ""There was a rumor there was, but it wasn't true,"" Boebertlater admittedto House. Following the election win of Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, the first openly trans person to serve in Congress, Mace led a crusade in November toadopt a rulesegregating bathrooms in the Capitol by ""biological sex."" Speaker Mike Johnson agreed and initiated the restriction. At the time, Florida Rep. Maxwell Frostsaid, ""I just don't understand why bathrooms are top of mind for her, why she's thinking about where future members are going to piss and shit."" Months later, Boebert and Mace are clearly still on the case, diligently patrolling the bathroom to ensure that the ""proper"" genitalia is in use to comply with the speaker's rules. But it will not lower the price of eggs or in any way assist the residents of their home states.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 20:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298945/-Boebert-mocked-in-her-home-state-for-playing-anti-trans-bathroom-cop
Musk continues to overstep his authority—and Trump is pissed,"Allies of Donald Trump are annoyed that ""First Buddy"" Elon Muskcontinues to assert his dominanceover the president. In fact, one White House official toldPoliticothat the unelected co-president ""very much"" overstepped when he trashed a recent artificial intelligence project that the president had announced. Earlier this week, Trump publicized a newStargate ventureto help grow AI infrastructure in the United States. The new entity will also start building out a data center and the electricity generation needed for therapidly growing AI in Abilene, Texas, according to the White House. With an initial investment of $100 billion, there are plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. ""This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential,"" Trumptold reportersat the White House on Tuesday. ""We're going to make it as easy as it can be."" Hours after the announcement, in a rather unprecedented move, Musk took to his social media platform, X, to dunk on the deal. He claimed that OpenAI, whose leaders, along with those from Oracle and SoftBank, had stood alongside Trump during the announcement, is too poor to fulfill its high-dollar pledge. In a sense, the Tesla CEO divulged the rocky ground beneath Trump's deal while elevating his own knowledge of AI and tech. This is sure tofurther inflamethealready shaky relationshipbetween the two self-imagined strongmen. ""They don't actually have the money,"" Muskwroteon X in response to a post from OpenAI announcing the digital infrastructure deal. ""SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority."" Musk alsoreshared a postfrom another X user who suggested that Sam Altman,a Trump cronyand OpenAI's CEO, and his team smoked crack to ""come up with their $500 billion number for Stargate."" According toFortune, OpenAI and SoftBank will lead the project, with SoftBank taking on the venture's financial responsibility and OpenAI assuming operational duties. Altmancalled Stargate ""the most important project of this era."" One can imagine, then, that Trump wasn't too pleased when Musk pooh-poohed it. One Trump ally told Politico that Musk isabusing his relationshipwith the president; another claimed Trump's staff was ""furious"" over Musk's various X posts. ""It's clear [Musk] has abused the proximity to the president,"" the Trump ally said. ""The problem is the president doesn't have any leverage over him and Elon gives zero fucks."" It's possible that Musk's temper tantrum was a result of the fact that he seemingly wasn't invited to Tuesday's White House presser. Notably, Muskowns an AI startupand has long been critical of Altman, hisonetime partnerin the burgeoning AI world. (Altman and Musk cofounded OpenAI, but Musk later departed and sued Altman and the company, alleging that they betrayed the firm's founding principles. Musk dropped this lawsuit before filing another. In the second suit, Musk claimed he was ""deceived"" into cofounding the company.) At least publicly, Trump attempted to downplay Musk's actions and blamed his diatribe on X on Musk'sdisdain for Altman. ""The government's not putting up anything. They're putting up money. They're very rich people, so I hope they do,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""And, I mean, Elon doesn't like one of those people."" But it seems obvious that,as some journalists have predicted, the relationship between Musk and Trump is destined to flame out. Trump's allies have alreadyexpressed concernwith the level of access and power Musk has. After all, Musk harbored blame forhelping tanka bipartisan budget proposal in December, but was never really punished for doing so. Since then, arguably, he's only received more access to the goings-on of the Oval Office. After all, he has aWhite House emailand office space close to the West Wing. It's just weird that an unelected senior adviser would publicly criticize one of the president's prized initiatives and expect things between the two to be okay after. Trump put up with a lot of internal discord in his first term but has shown this time around that he's fine pushing out those who annoy him. He's already joked at least once that Musk ""won't go home"" and that he ""can't get rid of him."" At the time, these were just jokes—or so Trump says. But it'd be somewhat ironic if the guy whopushed out his Department of Government Efficiency cochairis next in line to get the pink slip.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 19:00:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298900/-Musk-continues-to-overstep-his-authority-and-Trump-is-pissed
'Reign of terror': Trump immigration raid blasted for targeting veteran,"The Trump administration is coming under fire for an immigration raid in New Jersey that detained an American citizen who is also a military veteran. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agentsraided a Newark, New Jersey, business on Thursday. According to Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, ""one of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned."" The raid comes just a few days after Donald Trumpsigned a flurryof anti-migrant executive orders as his administration and congressional Republicansplan to implementa policy of mass deportation. In an interview with longtime Trump admirer Sean Hannity on Fox News,Trump saidhis policy is focused on migrants who pose a security threat, which can be determined by merely looking at people. ""Open borders with people pouring in. Some of whom, I won't get into it, but you can look at them and you can say, 'Could be trouble, could be trouble,"" Trump said. Trump is a racist who has expressed anti-migrant sentiment for years, largely targeting brown-skinned members of minority groups. Barakaexplainedthis ""egregious act is in plain violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,"" referring to protection against unreasonable search and seizure. ""Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,"" he added. New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Colemandescribedthe raid as ""unconstitutional"" and evidence of ""the reality of Trump's reign of terror."" Ina joint statement, New Jersey Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim said they were ""deeply concerned"" about the raid and that they have reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for answers. ""Actions like this one sow fear in all of our communities—and our broken immigration system requires solutions, not fear tactics,"" the senators added. Veteran groups previously expressed concern about Trump's actions against migrants before the New Jersey incident. As part of the administration's anti-immigration efforts,ICE has been giventhe power to rapidly deport migrants who are legally in the country, including those granted temporary protected status under the Biden administration. In a letter addressed to Trump, veterans' groupsexpressed fearthat the crackdown would endanger the safety of interpreters who had helped the military during the war in Afghanistan, as well as their families, now living in America. Trump is implementing the immigration policy he has long touted and Republicans are on board with it, but just a few days in and veterans are already among the people who are in the crosshairs.

Democratic AGs slam DOJ’s immigration threats as ‘empty words’,"In a unified response on Thursday, Democratic attorneys general from 11 states issued ajoint statementcondemning the Department of Justice's recent threats to prosecute state and local officials who do not comply with President Donald Trump'ssweeping immigration enforcementagenda. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, along with attorneys general from New York, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont, issued the statement. The statement centers around the Supreme Court's landmark decision inPrintz v. United States, which ruled on the constitutional limits of federal authority, particularly to enforcement of federal laws. The Democratic attorneys general called it a ""touchstone of our American system of federalism,"" separating the rights of state and federal government. ""We are reminded by longstanding Supreme Court precedent that the U.S. Constitution prevents the federal government from commandeering state resources to enforce federal laws,"" the attorneys general assert. ""InPrintz v. United States, the Court made it clear that the federal government cannot 'impress into its service—and at no cost to itself—the police officers of the 50 states.' This principle is a cornerstone of American federalism, ensuring a clear division of powers between state and federal governments."" The joint statement goes on to say while the federal government can use its own resources to enforce immigration laws, it cannot force state or local law enforcement agencies to do the job for them—and that Trump is overstepping his presidential authority. ""Despite what the President may claim, he cannot simply rewrite the Constitution to suit his agenda,"" the statement continues. ""His recent threats to weaponize the Department of Justice against public servants who are merely following state laws is not only overreach, but also a direct attack on local governments' ability to serve their communities. This is an affront to the very system of checks and balances that protects us all."" This unified response comes on the heels of a controversialinternal memoissued by the DOJ, which suggests that state and local officials, particularly in so-called ""sanctuary"" cities and states, could face prosecution if they obstruct or fail to comply with the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. The memo outlines an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement tactics, including the use of federal resources in ""sensitive areas"" like schools, churches, and health care facilities—places that are traditionally seen as safe zones for vulnerable immigrants. The DOJ memo argues that state and local officials must adhere to federal immigration mandates under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, and failure to do so could result in criminal charges or civil penalties. ""Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, or failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,"" the document states. ""The U.S. Attorney's Offices and components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution."" The threat of legal action has sparked widespread concern among immigrant rights advocates and state leaders, who warn that it could lead to more tensions between federal and local authorities, particularly in cities and states that have passed laws designed to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. While the memo's implications are unclear for now, the attorneys general are expressing their unity and readiness to defend their states' rights and local autonomy. They stress that these threats will not be taken lightly and that they are ready to act if necessary.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 16:00:23,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298727/-Democratic-AGs-slam-DOJ-s-immigration-threats-as-empty-words
Grifter in chief: Trump finds a new way to exploit his MAGA minions,"Donald Trump'slist of griftsis seemingly endless, but his new stake in the cryptocurrency market might bring one of his biggest cash hauls yet. Earlier this week, the first convicted felon to be elected U.S. presidentlaunched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, sending the value of his self-titled digital currency (briefly) skyrocketing. For those who don't quite understand the crypto market, meme coins or tokens rose to popularity in 2013 and have been used by celebrities and influencers alike to cash in on their brand and notoriety. But because of the lack of regulation around cryptocurrency, some high-profile hucksters have also managed a ""rug pull"" on the giddy fans who hoped that investing in their favorite celeb's new coin would help them get rich. A ""rug pull"" is a term used to describe when creators of a digital coin—which has a limited supply—sell most or all of their personal stake after their fans substantially increase the value. This subsequently tanks the value of the coin and sends fans' investments tumbling. A recent example of this scenario:Haliey Welch, who rose to fame as the""Hawk Tuah"" girl. After she gained overnight fame thanks to a bawdy viral video, Welch launched a podcastand later her own meme coin, $HAWK. The value of Welch's coin soared after itsDecember launch—but the value plummeted a mere two hours later and Welch's fans felt they were part of a ""pump and dump"" or ""rug pull"" scheme. Welch has beenwrapped up in legal battlesover the matter ever since. Welch's team claims that what happened wasn't a ""rug pull"" and places the blame on single parties buying a majority of the coins and quickly selling them for a profit. But the exploitation of buyers who are investing in crypto based on fandom alone is a major concern that ties back to Trump's meme coin ventures. Crypto expert and fraud investigator Stephen Findeisen, known as Coffeezilla, expressed his disdain for Trump's latest marketing gimmick on X. Findeisen noted that ""most"" of the people destined to lose money on the $TRUMP coin will be his MAGA supporters, while 80% of the tokens will be vested to insiders during Trump's presidency. ""[This] should be a crime but crime is legal now [I guess?],"" hewrote. Jessica Tillipman, an anti-corruption and government ethics professor at George Washington University, told Daily Kos that this ""black box"" of potential profit Trump stands to gain from crypto sits atop a list of many other grifts in Trump's back pocket. And as Tillipman points out, there are no actual laws stopping a president from profiting off of the people he was elected to serve. Past presidents have acted in good faith without the pressure of legal ramifications—but Trump has never met a norm he wasn't happy to trample on. ""We've always relied on this system of norms,"" she explained. ""I think people were pretty surprised to see how few restrictions there were on what a president could do, because we hadn't seen this before."" While restrictions are in place for presidential infractions such as outright bribery, crypto offers a grey area allowing foreign investors to potentially dump large funds into the coins as a workaround, Tillipman speculates. Trump's appointedartificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sackshas been notably silent on the $TRUMP launch. Daily Kos reached out to the tech investor and former Paypal CEO for comment but did not immediately hear back. No one knows how much Trump will net from his (orhis wife Melania's) meme coins. Some finance experts havespeculatedthe windfall could reach the billions, as the value of the individual coins shoots up to $40 or more for the 200 million coins in rotation.A total of 1 billion coins will be ""unlocked"" over the course of three years, according to Quartz. While a Trump-affiliated company owns 80% of the coins, no one knows exactly how many of the coins are owned directly by the president. And even as Trump pushes his branding, his crypto trading platform, World Liberty Financial, ismaking multimillion-dollar movesas well. All in all, Trump is virtually guaranteed to profit from crypto—regardless of how his personal coin venture turns out. Bibles, cologne, shoes, and now meme coins are fueling Trump's never-ending grift—and the newly inaugurated president stands to make untold millions off the very people who elected him in hopes that he would save them a buck or two on eggs and gas.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 15:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298540/-Grifter-in-chief-Trump-finds-a-new-way-to-exploit-his-MAGA-minions
Why some Democrats are shrugging as Trump wreaks havoc,"It's been a weird few months as we liberals have come to terms with the reality of yet another four years of Donald Trump-fueled chaos, instability, hatred, and insanity. Unlike 2017, when outraged liberals took the streets in resistance, it seems many of us are just shrugging our shoulders this time. This is their America. They are welcome to wallow in it. AndCiviqspolling,visualized by The New York Times, confirms it. For those who don't know, Civiqs is a polling and research firm owned by Kos Media, which also operates Daily Kos. It's hard to be a reality-based community if we don't have solid data to understand where America is and what might move it in the right direction. Thus, for the last decade, Civiqs has provided insight deep into the American psyche. For example, early last year, I declared that Democrats had lost the immigration debate and that it was right for President Joe Biden to work with Republicans to take the issue off the board for the elections. I based that primarily on thisCiviqs chart, which shows support for granting undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship fell from 58% on Election Day 2020 to around 46% by early 2024—with those wanting deportation moving up from 31% to 45% across the same time period. More distressing, Civiqs' paywalled data shows that Latino support for a pathway to citizenship fell from 67% on Election Day 2020 to 53% by early 2024. The signs were all there. We're tracking them. The New York Times used Civiqs' data to come up with nifty visualizations contrasting how voters when Biden was in the 2024 race, after he left it and endorsed Kamala Harris, and now, as Trump takes office. As you can imagine, Republicans have radically shifted from being angry to being hopeful. Democrats are scared and depressed. But there are a couple of interesting observations within that broader take. Among all respondents, those saying they're angry have gone from 29% to 16%. Yes, a big chunk of that is happy conservatives. But among Democrats, we've gone from 10% angry while former President Joe Biden was running, to 6% angry when Vice President Kamala Harris was running, to 13% today. We just haven't seen an outpouring of liberal anger, and the reason is clear: We warned Americans about what would happen if Trump was reelected, and they didn't listen. They believed Trump's lies about Harris, refused to believe him about his plans, and ushered in the dumbest, most incompetent president in history back into office. We're not angry. We're shrugging our shoulders, saying, ""You fucked around. Having fun finding out."" One of the harsh realities of the Republican Party is that it isheavily composed of white, non-college-educated Americans, while Democrats arelargely a white-collar, college-educated party. Biden funneled billions of dollars into red counties and states to rebuild shattered rural economies,bailed out the Teamsters, and enacted the strongest pro-labor agenda since former President Franklin D. Roosevelt—and voters, by and large, rewarded him and his Democratic Party by bringing back Trump. Trumpwonthose making $50,000 or less by 2 percentage points, afterBiden won them by 11 pointsin 2020, according to exit polls (which are not perfect). And while the exit polls don't break out income and race, it's clear that poor white voters went overwhelmingly for Trump. Non-college-educated white voters—a decent proxy for income attainment—voted for Trump 66% to 32%. Meanwhile, college-educated white voters backed Harris 53% to 45%. Among all college graduates, Harris won 56% to Trump's 42%. So it's not surprising that among voters making more $100,000, Harris won them 51% to 47%. A significant number of Democrats also live in blue states, which have the kind of social safety nets to insulate their residents from some of Trump's promised abuses. Obviously, lots of Democrats will still suffer under the Trump administration, but his own voters will likely bear the brunt of it—and that takes some of the sting out of Harris' loss. It's easier to suffer the consequences when we see his own voters (as well as nonvoters) realize the error of their ways. For instance, when TrumprescindsBiden's ""Executive Order 14087 of October 14, 2022 (Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans),"" it isn't just Harris voters suffering the consequences. When Trump targets the Latino community—mycommunity—it's hard to feel too sorry when 46% of them voted for Trump, according to exit polls. Even the GOP's most loyal Latinos—Miami Cubans—gotslapped on Day 1of Trump's new presidency when he ended emergency parole for them, which provided an additional pathway to legally enter the country. On issue after issue, the Trumpists are running into the cold hard reality of their choice. Take the Trump-loving account Jamieson on X. Here's them on Jan. 10: And now here's them just a day into the new Trump presidency: Whosigned that executive order, Jamieson?Who??? It's about time people learn about all the ways that Bidendidlower prices. Trump has alsostopped disbursementsunder the Inflation Reduction Act, most of which has benefited red America. ""Republican-led states were projected to receive the lion's share of the IRA's grants and subsidies,"" reported PV Magazine, a publication covering the solar industry. ""$337 billion in IRA funding for factories and renewable energy projects in 'red states,' significantly outpacing the $183 billion expected for 'blue states."" If Democrats pass legislation with only Democratic votes, like the IRA, the bulk of the benefits should go to blue states and blue voters. But hey, Biden foolishly tried to help them, and they empowered the guy who wants to hurt them. This is the same guy who surrounded himself with working-class people at his rallies but who, at his inauguration, featureda trillion dollars of net worthin his small crowd, even seating many of them in front of his own Cabinet picks. That's who they voted for. So ittotallymakes sense liberals aren't as angry as we were in 2017. Back then, we assumed the American people were bamboozled, or that Hillary Clinton was a bad candidate, or something something. But now? People knew exactly what they were voting for, and they will suffer for it. And yes, that makes our own suffering more bearable. And who knows, if even 5% learn from their mistakes and decide to vote differently in 2026 and 2028, then we'll be able tosalvage somethingfrom this clusterfuck. One final point, from the conclusion of The New York Times' article: Shitisfucked up, and people are fed up. And the Democratic Party's deference to institutions that haven't served America well ended up biting us in the ass. Trump supporters are, at their core, nihilist. They don't care about norms and institutions and traditions being torn down—none of those have demonstrably helped them. And that's not just MAGA but also a lot of soft Republican voters and even some Democrats who voted the right way, despite feeling alienated from our economic and political classes. Democrats will need an answer for that. In fact, the 2028 presidential primary, which will start much sooner than anyone realizes, will be all about it.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 14:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298263/-Why-some-Democrats-are-shrugging-as-Trump-wreaks-havoc
Only 2 GOP senators have a problem with Hegseth’s heinous history,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska,announcedin a social media post on Tuesday that she will vote against Donald Trump'sdisgraced secretary of defense pick, Pete Hegseth. With this move, Murkowski became the first Republican to publicly say she would oppose one of Trump's Cabinet picks, though he'slikelyto still get confirmed during the Friday vote. In a lengthy statement, Murkowski said that the ""allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking,"" which Hegsethhas denied, ""starkly contract"" with what is expected of someone tasked with leading the Department of Defense. She also expressed concern about Hegseth'spast commentsthat women don't belong in combat roles, though he attempted to walk this back during his Senate confirmation hearing. ""After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense. I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness,"" shewrote. ""The past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment,"" Murkowski went on. ""... These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards."" Joining Murkowski in opposing Hegseth's nomination isSen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. On Thursday, during a procedural vote to advance his nomination, Collinsvoted against doing so,along with Murkowski. The rest of the Senate GOP opted to move forward with Hegseth's confirmation, in a 51-49 vote. Unfortunately, assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, the two Republicans' votes aren't enough to prevent Hegseth's confirmation. It's somewhat notable that Collins seems to oppose Hegseth's nomination now, just one day after she called the most recent report of his alleged abusive behavior ""troubling."" By that, Collins was referring to anaffidavitfrom Hegseth's former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth. In it, Danielle alleged that Hegseth abused alcohol to the point where he ""passed out, threw up, and had to be carried out of family events and public settings, sometimes shouting sexually and racially offensive statements."" It also said that Hegseth engaged in threatening behavior toward his second wife, Samantha Hegseth, to the point that she devised an ""escape plan"" that involved texting a ""safe word"" to friends and family in case she ever needed assistance. Danielle also accused Hegseth of making racist and sexist comments, including his argument that women shouldn't vote or work and that Christians need to ""outbreed"" growing Muslim populations. In astatementto NBC News, Samantha denied any physical abuse in her marriage to Hegseth, whose attorney also denied the latest charges. Hegseth appeared to clear his most difficult hurdle last week, skating throughhis confirmation hearingwhere his Republican allies largelylobbed him softball questions. After the hearing, Sen. Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who previouslyexpressed skepticismtoward Hegseth's bid, saidshe'd now support him. But these new reports on Hegseth's behavior come as the Senate is preparing for a crucial vote to advance his nomination. Indeed, even the newest allegations, however damning, aren't enough to move many members of Trump's GOP. In addition to helping clear the way for a final confirmation vote,Sen. Eric Schmitt, Republican of Missouri, suggested that Democrats were colluding with Hegseth's enemies to tank his bid. ""It's desperate. This is a sad attempt by Democrats to oust a reformer,"" Schmitt toldPolitico. Notably, these aren't the only allegations that could potentially sink Hegseth's bid to lead the Department of Defense. In 2017, he wasaccused of rape, though hemaintainsthat the encounter was consensual. Moreover, a former colleague of his from Fox News accused him of getting ""handsy"" while drunk, claiming that he groped ""her bottom"" while the two were in New York, according toNPR. The majority of Americans have already said thatthey don't wanta Cabinet full of drunks and abusers. But somehow Republicans, save for Murkowski and maybe Collins, can stomach it.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 01:01:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298723/-Only-2-GOP-senators-have-a-problem-with-Hegseth-s-heinous-history
You’ll never guess which notorious files Trump forgot to declassify,"Donald Trump ordered the declassification of files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy. ""A lot of people are waiting for this for a long, for years, for decades,"" Trump said as he signed the executive order Thursday. But, of course, Trump seems to have forgotten to declassify the files on Jeffrey Epstein, theserial sexual abuser of minorswho hobknobbed with many wealthy and important folks during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2019, Epsteindied by suicidein his jail cell in Manhattan, where he was being detained on federal sex trafficking charges. Then-president Trumphelped spreadconspiracy theoriesquestioning the nature of Epstein's death. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump appeared in a Fox News interview that sure made itseemlike Trump was all in on releasing the Epstein files and getting to the bottom of things. But when you view the full interview, you can see that Trump is uncomfortable with the proposition of releasing the Epstein files. Maybe most problematic for Trump is his very public relationship with Epstein, which spanned the better part of two decades. That friendship soured in 2004 after a squabble over Florida real estate, according to theWashington Post. At least some QAnon conspiracists will be excited to see this move, since so many of them havefetishized and atomizedconspiracy theories around the Kennedys.

Elon Musk is facing more fallout over his Nazi salute,"Subreddit communities are banning the use of links from X after Donald Trump's billionaire bestie Elon Musk threw outtwoNazi salutesduring the indoor inaugural parade. Musk had the world ablaze with furor and controversy once again after throwing out his arm in a ""Sieg Heil"" as he thanked the crowd for ""making it happen."" While some sources, such as the Anti-Defamation League, dismissivelycalled itan ""awkward"" hand gesture, others, including a popularGerman newspaper, left no room for ambiguity. The weekly paper Die Zeit titled a piece ""Ein Hitlergruß ist ein Hitlergruß ist ein Hitlergruß,"" which translates to ""A Hitler salute is a Hitler salute."" And though many can't seem to agree on whether or not a grown man who owns one of the largest social media companies is aware of what a ""Sieg Heil"" is, hundreds of moderators behind Subreddit groups aren't fooled by Musk's deflection. Almost immediately, communities across Reddit began banning the use of X links, starting withpopular sports subredditssuch as r/NBA and r/NFL, both of which include at least 10 million people. Despite their names, these Subreddits are not officially affiliated with the sports giants. According tothe BBC, more than 100 Subreddits have banned the use of X links since Musk's Nazi salutes. ""This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now,"" the moderator of the Subredditr/pcgamingwrote. ""X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently."" Groups such as these cite not only Musk's egregious behavior and the toxicity coming out of his social media platform, but they have also considered the usability of posting links to X—which now requires users to have an account to view. As communities on Reddit distance themselves from the increasingly volatile and pro-white nationalist platform,journalistsandcompaniesalike are also making their exodus from the app. Subreddits pertaining to PC gaming might come as a personal blow to Musk, whoadmitted to paying gamersto help him win video games. While he juggles arguing over public policy andimmigration, Musk also seems to be spending time trying to defend his self-imposed reputation as a ""living god of video games.""

Kook who said there are too many gays on TV will lead government agency,"Donald Trumphas selectedright-wing activist L. Brent Bozell III to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The agency is independent of the federal government andoverseesthe Voice of America broadcast network as well as other taxpayer-funded news and information services targeting Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Bozell will require Senate approval to become CEO of USAGM. Trump's latest pick is best known for creating the extremist Media Research Center, which has claimed for decades that mainstream media is liberal and does not provide enough of a platform for conservative views. MRC has stood by this claim even as mainstream media organizationsfurthered liesabout Iraqi weapons of mass destruction,advanced falsehoodsabout former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, and arecurrently bucklingto Trump. Along with his crusade against the ""liberal media,"" Bozell and his organization have also repeatedly complained that movies and television shows sometimes acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ+ people and occasionally regard them as perfectly acceptable members of society. In a 2013 column,Bozell lamentedthat gay characters on movies and TV shows ""never face any real opposition to the gay agenda on these so-called 'inclusive' programs."" He also railed against a project by the advocacy group GLAAD which tracked the number of LGBTQ+ people depicted in entertainment. He referred to GLAAD as ""trend-enforcers"" who ""want children indoctrinated."" A few years before that,Bozell wrotethat he was upset that actors and media outlets expressed sympathy for gay teens who face bullying, describing them as ""evangelists for a revolution of sexual immorality."" Bozell's Media Research Center alsocomplainedthat Yahoo! deleted anti-gay hate comments, that the mediadidn't depictenough ""ex-gays,"" and wasincensedat CNN for purportedly supporting ""homosexual causes."" MRC evenboycottedthe notoriously right-wing CPAC conference because a group that supported gay equality was allowed to attend. At one point,Bozell even demandeda congressional investigation of an art exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington because it depicted ""images of an ant-covered Jesus, male genitals, naked brothers kissing, men in chains, Ellen DeGeneres grabbing her breasts."" The exhibitwas pulledafter Bozell and other conservatives complained. On foreign policy matters,Bozell was amongthe contingent of conservatives who insisted that weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq. Bozell made the claim in 2006, long after it had been discovered that no such weapons existed. He is also a reliable presence spoutingright-wing talking pointson Fox News programs. Trump's decision to tap Bozell for the post echoeshis choiceof conspiracy theorist Kari Lake to head Voice of America. These selections make it clear that Trump intends to infuse the government's media infrastructure with extremist right-wing values and talking points. But it seems that extremism runs in the family. Bozell's son L. Brent Bozell IV, wassentenced to 45 months in prisonfor assaulting law enforcement, destroying government property, and other charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot instigated by Trump. Bozell's son was among the 1,500 people who werepardoned by Trumpon Tuesday for their participation in the insurrection.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 23:00:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298719/-Kook-who-said-there-are-too-many-gays-on-TV-will-lead-government-agency
AOC's chat with Jon Stewart is the jolt Democrats need right now,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York spoke with Jon Stewart on his podcast ""The Weekly,"" Thursday. In a sprawling interview the two talked about the billionaire oligarchy Donald Trump represents and the state of the Democratic Party. What makes Trump more dangerous this go-around, according to Ocasio-Cortez, is how much more he has been normalized by the elite class. Describing what we have been watching thepast few weeksas a ""billionaire feeding frenzy,"" and ""a kiss ass race,"" AOC said that ""the important thing for people to understand about this administration is that you're being ripped off ... everybody is being ripped off."" Ocasio-Cortez was critical of the Democratic establishment's reliance on clearly archaic social mores that are no longer effective, but warned against the nihilism inherent in rhetoric that both political parties are the same. ""When you look at how, for example, Putin has operated in Russia and the way they've been able to kind of take things over in these oligarchies, these kleptocracies, they prey on that exact logic, on that exact predicate, which is that everyone's corrupt and is all corrupt. And so who gives a fuck?"" She added that there are a lot of people in Congress trying todo good things, and people should demand that from their representatives. ""When we decide to hold people to a higher standard, then things actually do get better."" AOC was optimistic about positive change in the Democratic Party, saying that while she did not become the top-ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee,losing out on an intraparty vote to 74-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly, she was moved into a powerful position on energy and commerce. Shortly after the election, the congresswomanappealed directly to her constituents via social mediato find outwhy some of them voted for both her and Trump. ""They see two people that are fundamentally anti-establishment,"" she told Stewart. ""Two people that do not respect a rule if the rule does not lead to an outcome, like a positive outcome."" She added that as far as messaging goes, one of the shifts she's seen is that people will believe a politician speaking directly to them. Unfortunately, that includes immigrants in her community who believed Trump when he claimed that only criminals would be harassed as a part of his immigration policy. However, with an ever-right-moving media, AOC said appealing directly to constituents offered Democrats a real shot at getting a message through. ""If you ask a working-class American or just any normal American, what is a Democrat? What do they stand for?"" Ocasio explained to Stewart. ""They will not really be able to give you a clear answer. And so our party needs a clear and strong agenda."" ""The stuff that's crazy to me is like, the answers are stuff, like, we're just asking for things that our parents and our grandparents had,"" Ocasio-Cortez added. ""Like, tuition-free public colleges and universities, not new, not new."" She also added an appeal to Medicare for All, and a platform that includes promises to Americans young and old. ""There are very, very few swing seats left in America. Republicans and this whole system has been gerrymandered that the number of swing seats is so low,"" AOC said of why she felt there needed to be more progressive candidates primarying less progressive ones across the country. ""At the end of the day, people who are in Congress want to return to Congress,"" Ocasio-Cortez explained. ""And the reason that the Republicans have so much enforcement is because they're more scared of a primary than they are of a general election.""

How Trump’s tax cuts could have devastating impacts on health care,"To pay for Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations, the GOP hasoutlineda sweeping $5 trillion in cuts from Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. These government-funded health care programs support 70 million elderly, poor, and disabled Americans. If the plan goes forward—which it is likely to in the GOP-led House and Senate—it could have devastating impacts on U.S. health care. In their50-page memo, Republicans outline how they would use a 10 percent tariff on all imports to save the government money—at the cost of American consumers. If implemented, the GOP's plan would strip undocumented immigrants' eligibility for health care, cut Affordable Care Act expansion, implement requirements for Medicare that experts say would remove 600,000 recipients, and create ""site neutrality"" that would force doctors to perform procedures in their offices instead of outpatient hospital settings. Site neutrality is the idea that patients should pay the same price for the same service, regardless of where it's performed. The goal is to reduce health care costs and promote the viability of independent practices—at the expense of potentially making a patient less safe due to not being in a hospital setting when they receive intensive care. Trump recently signed an executive orderrepealingPresident Joe Biden's prescription price caps for people on Medicare and Medicaid, calling them ""deeply unpopular"" and ""radical."" He also issued a directive Tuesday toprohibit any public communicationfrom the Department of Health and Human Services until it is reviewed and approved by a presidential appointee. The Republican plan would reduce the federal government's Medicare cost burden, leaving states to pick up the slack. Health care has long been a target for Republicans, primarily because it's one of the largest items in the federal budget, accounting for nearlya quarterof all federal spending—an estimated $1.7 trillion in 2024 alone. Cutting these programs is part of a broader strategy to reduce federal spending, but it's also one that could disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans. In response to the anticipated slashes, Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts voiced their opposition in aletterto HHS nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this month. ""I am concerned about Republican proposals to cut Medicaid in order to pay for proposed tax cuts to ultra-wealthy individuals and large corporations,"" Warren wrote. ""The House Republican Contract Against America will end Medicaid as we know it, destroy the Affordable Care Act, and eliminate the mortgage interest deduction, which will raise costs on tens of millions of working-class and middle-class Americans,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffriessaidin a press conference Thursday, adding that Democrats vow to push back on the agenda ""with every fiber in our body."" The GOP's proposed cuts would upend the lives of millions of people, all for the benefit of the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Will that stop them, though? Not likely.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 21:00:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298689/-How-Trump-s-tax-cuts-could-have-devastating-impacts-on-health-care
New FCC chair eagerly carries out Trump’s war on the press,"If President Donald Trump really ""loves"" the First Amendment as much as he claims to, he's got an odd way of showing it. Trump and his cronies have beenwaging a war against the pressfor years now. So it shouldn't be a surprise that members of his new administration want to help him destroy the Fourth Estate. On Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the new chair of the Federal Communications Commission,said it would again consider three complaintslevied toward ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News after a conservative group alleged the networks were biased against Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. The Center for American Rights, a right-wing nonprofit law firm, initially filed the three complaints against the outlets. One accused ABC News of bias toward former Vice President Kamala Harris after one of the network's moderators fact-checked Trumpduring their September presidential debate. Another alleged that CBS News engaged in ""significant and substantial news alteration"" relating to the editing of a preelection interview with Harris. And a third charged that NBC News had violated the equal-time rule when Harrismade a guest appearanceon ""Saturday Night Live"" the weekend before this past November's presidential election. Shortly before Trump's inauguration this month, the outgoing FCC chair, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel,dismissed four pending petitions and complaintsbefore the FCC, including one regarding Fox News. ""The facts and legal circumstances in each of these cases are different,"" Rosenworcelsaidin her order dismissing the cases. ""But what they share is that they seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment."" Carr, aProject 2025contributorTrump pickedto lead the agency, reversed her decision. The new FCC chair has made clear his desire to see the agency fight Big Tech's supposed ""censorship cartel."" But it's clear that partisanship is motivating his latest moves. Unsurprisingly, he did not revive the complaint against a Fox-owned television station. The complaint argued the station should lose its license for promotingbaseless lies and conspiracy theoriesregarding the results of the 2020 presidential election. With this move, Carr will put the three cases back into pending or active status, meaning the complaints can be adjudicated on their merits, according to right-wing outletNewsmax. As expected, the announcement was praised by conservatives. ""Glad to see that our campaign for truth and transparency through the [FCC] won't be stopped by the prior chair's last minute attempt to excuse the networks from accountability,"" Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, said ina social media poston Wednesday. Rosenworcel may harbor some blame for Carr's latest stunt, though. Had she acted a few weeks earlier, she could've prevented the reversal from happening since there is usually a 30-day buffer period, according to a source who spoke withthe New York Post. Still, this surely won't be the last time the Trump administration goes after the press. Throughout his 2024 campaign,journalists expressed fearthat he and his allies would use the court system to punish or silence his critics on the grounds that bad coverage of Trump was defamatory. Since his win this past year, the president has said he wants to ""straighten out"" the press, which seems to meanicing out or silencing reporterswho offend him. But Trump's compulsive hostility toward the press has gonebeyond blacklisting journalistswho ask tough questions. He's now attempting to quash entire news networks. The president's revenge tour is already off to a great start for him. In December, he scored a win byreaching a settlementin his lawsuit against ABC News over host George Stephanopoulos saying on-air that Trump was found ""liable for rape."" (What he was actually found liable for was ""sexual abuse."") That same month,Trump himself suedIowa-based pollster Ann Selzer over a survey she released days before the election in which she predicted Harris would carry Iowaby 3 percentage points. (Trump went on to win the state byroughly 13 points.) It's not surprising, then, that Trump is nowfloating the idea of shutting down MSNBC. Reacting to news that CNN would lay offabout 6% of its workforce, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, ""MSDNC is even worse than CNN. They shouldn't have a right to broadcast—Only in America!"" The post was a clear shot at the left-leaning network, with ""MSDNC"" being a portmanteau of the network's name, MSNBC, and the Democratic National Committee's initials. These statements, coupled with the latest moves by Carr, make it easy to wonder just how far Trump will take his grievances against those who dare to cross or question him.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 20:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298677/-New-FCC-chair-eagerly-carries-out-Trump-s-war-on-the-press
Trump orders federal employees to be more racist,"The Trump administrationhas sent directivesto federal employees ordering them to snitch on each other to reveal if they are involved in diversity programs. In an email from the Office of Personnel Management the administration said, ""We are aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language."" The email further warns federal employees that if they do not turn in their fellow workers they could face ""adverse consequences."" The email does not detail the consequences for disobeying the order. The directive is another in a series of actions from Donald Trump meant to attack the gains of the Civil Rights Movement under the guise of curtailing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Republicans have falsely alleged that DEI programs prioritize mediocrity over merit, a long-standing boogeyman that has been used to attack reform. Trump issueda flurry of executiveorders in the same vein over his first few days in office which seek to remove DEI programs and employees within the federal government. Trump even rescinded diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration and falsely blamed a 2023 database error that caused flight problems on diversity programs. In one particularly troubling order, Trump rescinded a 1965 executive order from former President Lyndon Johnson which was key in preventing racial segregation at companies working with the federal government. The administrationalso ordereda halt to civil rights cases at the Department of Justice with a letter directing the supervisor of the agency's civil rights decision not to file ""any new complaints, motions to intervene, agreed-upon remands, amicus briefs, or statements of interest."" But when he was campaigning in 2024, Trump couldn't even explain what DEI is—despite attacking it over and over again. During his interview with the National Association of Black Journalists Trump was asked to defend claims from Trump supporters that Vice President Kamala Harris was a ""DEI hire."" ""How do you define DEI?"" Trump asked. The snitching directive and other associated anti-DEI actions are a manifestation of the planslaid out inthe right-wing Project 2025, which argues for replacing the nonpartisan federal civil service with conservative loyalists. Trump claimed that the plan was not associated with him, but his presidency is carrying out its directives. Federal workers are also facing other pressures. The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency hasbeen interrogatingfederal workers to uncover their purported political stances, while Trumphas initiatedorders that seek to undo long-held employee protections for those workers. Since Trump took office, federal workers are now facing unprecedented attacks in addition to their existing burdens of serving the public.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 19:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298676/-Trump-threatens-federal-employees-orders-them-to-snitch-on-each-other
How Trump’s plan to upend FEMA will screw his supporters the most,"Donald Trump said Wednesday that he wants to completely upend the Federal Emergency Management Agency, encouraging states to handle their own disaster responses. ""FEMA is a whole 'nother discussion, because all it does is complicate everything. FEMA has not done their job for the last four years,"" hesaidduring a batshit crazy interview with sycophantic Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""But unless you have certain types of leadership, it's really, it gets in the way. And FEMA is going to be a whole big discussion very shortly, because I'd rather see the states take care of their own problems."" As an example, Trump said that if a tornado were to hit Oklahoma, he'd want the state to respond and for FEMA not to have any role in disaster aid. Sending FEMA back to the states is an idea ripped straight from the pages ofProject 2025, the unpopular right-wing policy roadmap of which Trumplied abouthis involvement during his 2024 campaign. ""Reform of FEMA requires a greater emphasis on federalism and state and local preparedness, leaving FEMA to focus on large, widespread disasters,"" the nearly 1,000-page screed says. Of course, leaving disaster recovery to states would hurt Trump supporters the most. Florida, Louisiana, and Texas—three states Trump won handily in 2024—have ""received the lion's share of FEMA direct assistance since 2015,"" Axiosreported. NBC Newsreportedahead of the November election on the negative impacts that the FEMA plans in Project 2025—which Trump now seems to have adopted—would have on states like Florida where hurricanes cause billions of dollars worth of damage on an annual basis. The NBC News report says: What's more, decentralizing FEMA and making states responsible for disaster relief at a time whenclimate change causesunpredictable and costly weather-related disasters—including in places that don't typically experience those types of weather events—could lead to chaotic recoveries, with states unprepared to quickly mobilize disaster responses. ""It almost becomes unthinkable that states would ever be able to recover without long, costly recovery periods that would come out of state and local budgets,"" Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator under President Barack Obama,told NBC News. Trump's call to upend FEMA comes after hewrongly blamedCalifornia leaders for the devastating fires that are ripping through the southern portion of the state. Trump and other Republicanshave liedabout why the fires were so brutal, claiming that it's because of California's water management despite firefighters saying thatno municipal water system on earthcould have provided enough water to combat these fires. Trump and his GOP pals in Congress are nowthreatening to withholddisaster funding for California to punish Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Trump wrongly blamed for the fires. In fact, Trump's whole FEMA plan seems to be a way to punish California for the fires. Still, California's wildfires aren't the only natural disasters that Trump and the GOP have been politicizing. Following Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of North Carolina with unprecedented flooding, Trump and the GOPspewed a torrent of liesabout the FEMA response in an effort to try to weaken support for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The lies were so pervasive that FEMA had tocreate a fact-checking webpageto combat them. But now it appears that the ultimate outcome of the lies could be the decimation of FEMA, which will not only hurt California, but also millions of Trump's own supporters.

Fox News melts down over 'woke bishop' who called on Trump to show mercy,"Fox News has gone all-in on attacking Right Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop who delivered the national prayer service at National Cathedral on Tuesday and called for compassion for LGBTQ+ people and migrants. In her sermon, Budde asked Trump to ""have mercy."" Trump panned the event as ""not too exciting."" He later posted an angrier complaint on his Truth Social Platform,writing, ""The so-called Bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning was a Radical Left hard line Trump hater. She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way."" Fox News echoed Trump's invective throughout its broadcast day, targeting Budde for her views and her physical appearance. ""Fox and Friends"" host Lawrence Jones exclaimed ""Oh my God!"" after a clip of Budde's speech was aired. ""As someone who comes from generations of preachers, I would have walked out,"" he added. Jones said it was not an ""appropriate"" time for Budde to speak out and that she should have done so in private. His co-host Ainsley Earhardt worried that ""there are children there that are hearing this message,"" apparently concerned that children might hear something about ""mercy"" toward others in a church—somethingfrequently associatedwith Jesus Christ and Christianity. Also on the panel, host Steve Doocy suggested that the sermon was a sign that the president and other Washington officials should stop attending services at National Cathedral. On ""Outnumbered,"" host (and former Trump press secretary) Kayleigh McEnany complained that Budde was ""preaching politics from the pulpit"" (something Fox News has encouraged for decades with conservative policy). Her co-host Harris Faulkner suggested that rhetoric like Budde's reflected poorly on the Episcopalian church's decision to allow women to serve as clergy. ""It was so awkward not to have a faith-filled, forward-looking positive message at a time when we know the numbers of people going to church are falling again,"" Faulkner lamented. Panelist Gerri Willis said the message was evidence that Protestantism has ""gone woke."" ""There seems to be such an emphasis on the issues of wokeism, whether it's helping people of different race or different sexual persuasion or whatever, instead of focusing on The Word,"" Willis added. Summarizing the panel's take on the event Faulkner said, ""If you believe in the Lord, that was offensive."" ""The Five"" co-host Jeanine Pirro labeled Budde as a ""woke bishop"" and ""nasty clergywoman,"" and accused her of ""hijacking"" the service. In prime time, host Laura Ingraham kept the insults flying, calling Budde a ""Peter Pan lookalike"" and referring to her as a ""warrior-princess waif."" Her fellow prime-time host and infamous misogynist Jesse Watters called Budde the Democratic Party's ""new Avenger."" He then asked, ""Would the bishop show mercy if someone showed up to her church service, cut the line at Communion, guzzled the blood of Christ, flipped over the body of Christ, and then snatched all the cash from the offering plate?"" Despite the attacks from the sitting president and his cheerleaders at the right-wing cable news channel, Budde remained unbowed. ""I don't hate the president, and I pray for him,""Budde told NPR. ""I don't feel there's a need to apologize for a request for mercy.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 17:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298639/--Woke-bishop-Fox-News-freaks-out-over-plea-to-Trump-for-compassion
GOP celebrates Trump's release of violent criminals—but no one else does,"Donald Trump and his GOP defenders are trying to rewrite history of the violent and deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, all in an effort to inoculate Trump from criticism after hepardoned 1,500 insurrectionists, including hundreds who violently assaulted law enforcement officers. In an interview with Fox News sycophant Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday night, Trump defended hisunpopular pardonsby falsely declaring that the law enforcement assaults ""were very minor incidents."" Also on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson announced thecreation of a new committeeto investigate the Jan. 6 attack, giving Republicans an avenue to spread disinformation about who was responsible despite it being Trump's fault. ""We are establishing this select subcommittee to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people,"" Johnson said in a statement, as if we don't have hours of video tape showing what happened and hours of interviews with witnesses who say Trump is to blame. CNNreportedthat it is Trump himself who asked for the committee, so it's no surprise that lap dog Johnson acquiesced to Dear Leader's command. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, went to the jail in Washington, D.C., where many of the violent offenders were being held anddeclaredshe wanted to be the first to give them a tour of the Capitol they had defiled four years earlier. One of the men released from that prison hasalready been rearrestedon gun charges. Great going, guys! So much for making the streets safer. Right-wing white supremacist Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence Trump commuted, was also alreadyseen at the Capitolon Wednesday, andmet with Florida GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis. Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to18 years in prison, was caught on tape after the insurrectionsaying, ""My only regret is they should have brought rifles. We should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang fucking Pelosi from the lamppost."" ""I think it's new and interesting that they're using the front door this time,"" Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the now-defunct committee that probed the Jan. 6 attack, toldThe Associated Press. Judges who oversaw the trials of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists are aghast at Trump's pardons, issuingblistering statementsdecrying the decision. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw Trump's federal case on his effort to steal the 2020 election, wrote in a decision dismissing the case against one of the insurrectionists that Trump's pardons ""cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power."" The Fraternal Order of Police, the union that endorsed Trump's reelection bid, also slammed Trump's move, saying in astatementthat the union ""firmly believe[s] that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences."" If only they had ahint ahead of timethat Trump was going to pardon violent cop assaulters. But few Republicans are speaking out, and are instead eitherplaying dumbor playing a ridiculous whataboutism game to avoid having to criticize Trump's vile decision. ""We're not looking backwards, we're looking forwards,"" Johnsonsaidon Wednesday, adding that he wasn't going to ""second guess"" Trump's pardons—as if his job doesn't include oversight of the executive. But it sure doesn't seem like launching a committee to reopen the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack in order to try to convince Americans that they didn't see what they saw is a forward-looking move.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 16:00:01,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298631/-GOP-celebrates-Trump-s-release-of-violent-criminals-but-no-one-else-does
Did Vivek Ramaswamy leave DOGE—or did it leave him?,"Vivek Ramaswamy, the failed presidential candidate President Donald Trumptapped in Novemberto co-lead the toothless Department of Government Efficiency, wants you to think hequit the projectbecause heplans to run for governor of Ohio. In a post tosocial mediaon Monday Ramaswamy noted it was an ""honor to help support the creation of DOGE"" but that he was stepping aside for greener pastures. Reporting fromThe Washington Post, however, suggests that Ramaswamy didn't leave on his own accord. Rather, he was pushed out by billionaire Elon Musk because he didn't share the same vision for the initiative as theunelected co-president. According to the Post, Ramaswamy was the mastermind behind a November op-ed in theWall Street Journalwhere the two advocated for slashing billions of dollars' worth of essential government services. Ramaswamy allegedly wanted DOGE to function as a sort of think tank—a nongovernmental body whose function would be to determine which government agencies could be slashed and which regulations could be repealed without congressional approval. But Musk had no interest in this, according to the Post, which cited more than a half-dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. The Tesla CEO and X owner apparently had a ""competing vision,"" which entailed doing things from a ""technology-first perspective."" He also wanted DOGE to operate within the government. Tensions were exacerbated after Ramaswamy went on a social media rant where he alleged thatAmerican culture rewards mediocrityand voiced support for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers (something Musk also supports). But his tirade didn't sit well with Trump's allies or Musk, according toPolitico. ""Everyone wants him out of Mar-a-Lago, out of D.C.,"" a Republican strategist who is close to Trump's advisers told the outlet. A second source told Politico that ""they wanted [Ramaswamy] out before the [""mediocrity""] tweet—but kicked him to the curb when that came out."" Musk, anuisance in his own right, also made it known that he no longer wanted Ramaswamy to be part of DOGE. A person close to the advisory commission told Politico that Musk didn't think it was feasible for Ramaswamy to both campaign for public office and work within the federal government. Then there's the fact that, despite being co-chairs of the special commission, Musk was supposedly the one who called the shots. The Post noted that while Ramaswamy visited the SpaceX offices that housed DOGE staff on various occasions, only Musk had the authority to direct their work. ""They've been wanting Vivek to step aside so Elon could have more control,"" one person briefed on the matter told the Post. ""There was tension, and then they had an out and kind of took the out."" In other words, the two were never really partners—they were co-heads in name only, or CHINOs. Apparently, Ramaswamy had performed virtually no DOGE-related work since early December, according to Politico. One person with knowledge of the deteriorating DOGE structure told the Post the joint arrangement was ""probably doomed from the jump."" And they were right: Musk's vision seems to have won in the end. For instance, while draft executive orders preferred by Musk were implemented, ones put forth by Ramaswamy and his team were reportedly ignored by Musk and are unlikely to get issued, according to the Post. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderrenaming the U.S. Digital Service, created under former President Barack Obama, to the U.S. DOGE Service, which will determine best practices for the government use of technology. Specifically, the purpose of Musk's DOGEwill be to""implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,"" according to the executive order. This is far more in-line with Musk's technology-forward vision for DOGE. It also landed him aWhite House officeandemail address—and all the unbridled access that comes with that. In his new role, per the executive order, Musk will have ""full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems."" And now, thanks to Trump, DOGE will be able to sidestep federal hiring rules—and Trump's hiring freeze—sinceDOGE is a White House office. Despite the reportedly heated behind-the-scenes exchanges between Musk, Ramaswamy, and allies for both men, it appears there's no bad blood between the two. Before announcing his departure from DOGE, Ramaswamy posted a photo of the two shaking hands. According to the Post, Musk is also expected to publicly endorse Ramaswamy's gubernatorial candidacy. With Ramaswamy out of the picture, Musk will likely have to bear the brunt—and face the potential consequences—of thevarious lawsuitstargeting DOGE. Ramaswamy's future is less clear. We don't know whether he can win statewide in Ohio, and Trump seems to care little about his political future. A spokesperson for the president only issueda half-hearted statement, saying Trump's team ""expect[s] him to play a vital role in making America great again.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 15:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298516/-Did-Vivek-Ramaswamy-leave-DOGE-or-did-it-leave-him
Why is Trump being so hard on his former pal Putin?,"Donald Trump is a Russian asset, whether willing or unwilling. His obsequiousness toward Russian strongman Vladimir Putin during his first term wasn't just embarrassing—it became a grave national security threat. Trump literallysided with Putinover his own intelligence agencies. And why wouldn't he? Russia was a major factor in his 2016 election victory. Meanwhile, Trump'sfirst impeachmentwas literally centered on his effort to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, drumming up a fake Hunter Biden investigation in exchange for anti-tank weapons to try to stave off a looming Russian invasion. Last year, Trump repeatedly promised toend Russia's warin Ukraine within ""24 hours"" of taking office, which many took to mean pulling U.S. support for Ukraine and freezing the conflict in its current state—something Russia desperately needs. Yet a funny thing has happened. Trump slobbered over Putin, believing that he and Russia are strong and mighty, serving as an example for his own imperialist and undemocratic designs. But Russia is not strong and mighty. In fact, Russia has run out of tools to prop up itsfailing economy. And out-of-control inflation, sky-high interest rates, and lower global energy prices have put Putin in a precarious position. Somehow, Trump noticed this, and his disdain couldn't be clearer. We just might have somehow lucked into a pro-Ukraine Trump presidency. Trumpshared his thoughtsabout Russia's war in Ukraine on Truth Social Wednesday morning. How does Trump always manage to get so much wrong? Russia didn't lose 60 million lives in World War II;it lost 27 million. And, really, seven million of those were Ukrainian, as that total is for the Soviet Union, not Russia. That's a lot, so why the need to exaggerate it? Probably because thetotalnumber of people killed in World War II is around 60 million, and Trump is just too stupid to know the difference—or to fact check. Furthermore, tariffs don't mean shit to Russia, since the U.S. doesn't really trade with them. In 2022, the United States imported just $15 billion in Russian goods and services. Thanks to deep sanctions, what little we exported, like intellectual property (movies and such), was either appropriated by Moscow or just stolen. But sanctions are something that could be hiked up, which would be a welcome response from the Trump administration. If Trumpreallywants the war to end (and to take credit and have statues raised all over Ukraine in his honor), then he needs to do what former President Joe Biden was loath to do: open up the arms spigot and remove all restrictions on their usage. More specifically, he needs to flood Ukraine with aircraft—Ukraine now flies F-16s—and long-range missiles. Russia has endless manpower to incrementally take ground in Ukraine. In October 2024, U.S. intelligence agencies estimated Russian casualties for the entire war at more than 600,000, including those killed and wounded. And that pace has increased year over year as Russia runs out of armor but continues to send soldiers on foot, motorcycle, and even in civilian vehicles. Yet manpower continues to be sourced from Russia's poorest, more remote regions, insulating the oligarch elites in Moscow and St. Petersburg from direct consequences. That economic instability, on the other hand, hits those oligarchs in the only place it matters, and a continued10% inflation rateis taking a bite out of everyone's earning power. How long can the czar remain in power if his people are starving? Meanwhile, the country's banking system ison the verge of collapseas Moscow forces them to lend to the military industrial complex—at levels that far exceed their ability to cover the risk. With their inability to access foreign reserves due to sanctions, they are isolated and exposed. Wary of being caught up with retaliatory sanctions from the United States and the European Union, China issteering clear. While Russia still has significant financial reserves to cover its massive defense-related budget deficits, they are on pace to bedepleted by 2030, according to an analysis by Janes—and that's assuming energy prices don't crater. Saudi Arabia has beenthreateningto open the spigot, and if Trump's policy to encourage additional domestic drilling pans out, global prices might further tumble to Russia's great peril. And additional Western sanctions on oil and on countries that help Russia circumvent sanctions (cough, cough,looking at you, India) will further tighten the noose. Long-range missiles would help accelerate Russia's economic woes. Ukraine's biggest war gains the past year came from systematically targeting Russian economic engineslike refineries and factories. On the ground, Ukraine needs to merely hold the line, extracting a steep price on Russian advances. But if they want to win the war, it will be with long-range missiles. Unfortunately, Trump didn't threaten that, but once Putin ignores Trump's demands for ""A DEAL,"" it would be a logical next step to ratchet up the pressure. Someone might even whisper in his ear—with their fingers crossed behind their back—that if he helps end the war, a Nobel Peace Prize is on the table. Trump's 180-degree turn on Putin clearly stems from Russia's weakness not only in Ukraine, but also in Syria following the country's humiliating defeat. One Russian Telegram channelclaimedthat secret negotiations between Russia and Trump representatives in December failed when the Americans made demands that Putin was unwilling to meet. That is quite the conspiracy theory. The United States doesn't need China to know the state of the Russian economy. Heck, I've linked to a bunch of Western media sources and analysts who have had their finger on Russia's true economic situation throughout the entire war. But the underlying point is quite interesting. Not only is it against China's interests for the war to end, but Russia is also reliant on it for just about everything right now. Plus, China loves to see EU and U.S. dollars and assets spent on Putin's theater rather than on Taiwan. The end result is a weak Russia and a pathetic Putin, groveling before North Korea for weapons andmanpower. And if there's one thing Trump abhors, it's weakness. By aligning himself against China, Republicans' favorite geopolitical boogeymandu jour, Trump is further susceptible to influence from pro-Ukraine voices inside the GOP and his administration. If he wants to end the war, Trump needs to give Ukraine the means and permission to further target Russia's failing economic engine. Long-range missiles are the way to do it.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 14:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298528/-Why-is-Trump-being-so-hard-on-his-former-pal-Putin
Watch AOC kick ass on the House floor over GOP's anti-immigrant bill,"Rep.

""And these are the people who want you to believe—who want us to believe—that they're trying to 'keep criminals off the street,'"" Ocasio-Cortez added. She then fixed in on themost serious critique of the bill, which is that noncitizens risk losing the right to due process, allowing for the detention of immigrants simplyaccusedof a crime.

How Trump's DOJ plans to enforce his brutal immigration raids,"Aninternal memofrom the Department of Justice revealed that, if state or local officials in sanctuary cities and states don't comply with Donald Trump's immigration raid orders, they will face prosecution. According to the document obtained by CNN, the DOJ will be used to carry out Trump's executive orders to conduct mass deportations and immigrant raids, which can now be extended to ""sensitive areas"" like churches, health care facilities, and schools. The memo asserts that state and local officials must comply with the department under the Constitution'sSupremacy Clause, otherwise they could face criminal prosecution or civil violation charges. ""Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,"" the memo said. ""The U.S. Attorney's Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution."" Meanwhile, ""border czar"" Tom HomantoldCNN's Dana Bash that ICE officials havebegun conducting""targeted enforcement operations""—or raids—as directed by Trump. Similarly, the Pentagon announced Wednesday thatit will send1,500 military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, where Trumpdeclareda state of emergency. These troops will be joining the 2,500 Army Reserve and National Guard troops that are already at the border. Several Democratic attorneys generalfiled a lawsuitTuesday against Trump's executive order that attempts to ban birthright citizenship—a right that's enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. It's unclear if they, too, will cower to Trump's whims. On Tuesday, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who has been a vocal Republican critic of Trump,sharedsome profound advice on how to handle the president. ""If you stand up to Trump you intimidate him and he will back down,"" he wrote on Bluesky.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett puts the GOP on blast about immigration myths,"During Wednesday'sHouse Judiciary hearing on ""Restoring Immigration Enforcement in America,"" Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas did some debunking of the GOP's most racist and ignorant mythmaking concerning undocumented immigrants'crime ratesandtax burdens. ""I do want to be clear. Federal law already, no matter if it's under the Biden administration or if it's under a Republican administration,"" Crockett said, ""we all agree that we want to be safe."" She reiterated that theLaken Riley Act, whichwas passed by the Senate on Monday,and will strip away due process for undocumented immigrants who areaccusedof a crime, is an egregious andinhumaneoverstepping of authority. ""I want to play a little game with you,"" Crocket said to witness David Bier, who is the director of Immigration Studies at the CATO Institute. Bier has beencritical of Trump and the Republican Party's disingenuous handling of immigration policyand enforcement in our country. ""It's called 'rhetoric versus reality,'"" Crockett continued. ""Is this rhetoric or reality? Immigrants commit more crimes than U.S. citizens."" ""Rhetoric,"" Bier responded. Crockett received the same responses from Bier when she asked if ""immigrants are just living off the federal government and contribute nothing,"" and whether ""immigrants only enter at the southern border."" Crockett then asked Bier about the perpetrators of various shootings across the country. Crockett asked about terrible shootings like the one that took place in Charleston,South Carolina, in 2015, of nine Black parishioners at theEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. She also asked about a shootinginEl Paso, Texas, in 2020, at a Walmart, targeting Latinos, that resulted in the death of 23 people. Her last question was about the 10 Black people shot and killed at a Buffalo, New York,supermarket in 2022. ""In fact, in each of these cases, it was white supremacists,"" Crockett said.

"Trump's youngest kid enters the family business—no, not grifting","Like father, like sons. Barron Trump, the youngest son of Donald Trump, is reportedly entering the real estate ring. According toNewsweek, the 18-year-old student at New York University embarked on a luxury real estate venture with former classmate Cameron Roxburgh in July 2024. Their company—Trump, Fulcher & Roxburgh Capital Inc.—was dissolved right after Donald Trump's presidential election win in November in order to not attract media attention, according toRoxburgh. However, per Roxburgh, the two plan to relaunch their high-end real-estate development company in the spring. The two young men—who both attended the $40,000-a-year Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida—are eyeing golf courses and other properties in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah. Roxburgh told Newsweek that Barron's father did not contribute monetarily to their company. However, given that Barron is the son of thegrift-loving presidentand doesn't appear to be working a fast food job to pay for these real estate investments, it's perhaps fair to assume that funds could be linked back to daddy dearest. The other incorporator, Carter Fulcher, is reportedly the cousin of Republican Rep. Russ Fulcher of Idaho, who is seemingly not involved in their business plans. While Donald doesn't appear to be directly funding his youngest's real estate venture, Roxburgh told Newsweek that Barron has been receiving real estate advice from his father. This is all on-brand for the Trump family and seems to be more of a right of passage for the young Barron than anything else. The eldest Trump sons, Eric and Don Jr., haveprofited immenselyfrom their father's real estate investments and have leveraged the Trump name to continue business of their own. Real estate handoutsand reportedtax evasionsaside, Eric and Don Jr. were passed the keys to the Trump real estate kingdom ahead of his first term, in 2017. It's hard to keep track of all the scandal,fraud, andbankruptcysurrounding the Trump family real estate empire, including the$355 million civil fraud judgementDonald Trump was hit with in February 2024 for lying about his wealth to banks and insurers. More so, Donald's lore alone is steeped in lies and tax evasion. AsThe New York Times reported, the convicted felon received what would be about $413 million today from his father's real estate empire, and used tax schemes and outright fraudulent methods to grow his fortune. In other words, nobody in the Trump world is self-made or playing fair. Even Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, has been benefitting from Trump alliances by way ofobtaining permits forluxury hotel complexes in Albania and Serbia. And as for Barron—who was reportedlypivotal in introducinghis father to thepodcast broswho boosted his campaign—his biggest role in this business venture is likelykeeping his nose clean.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 22:15:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298510/-Surprise-Barron-Trump-reportedly-wants-in-on-the-family-grift
Trump's inauguration is a ratings bust,"The ratings are in, and let's just say they don't look too good after Donald Trump's second inauguration. In fact, his ratings are downrightunderwhelmingcompared to both his own 2017 inauguration and Joe Biden's in 2021. Trump's inauguration rating dipped 27% from Biden's 2021 viewership and 20% from his first inauguration in 2017, which must be devastating to the president, who loves to harp about hiscrowd sizes. According toThe Wrap, a combined total of 24.59 million viewers tuned in to cable and network news. Fox News, for obvious reasons, received the highest ratings, making up nearly half of the total viewership, with an average of 10.3 million viewers from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM ET. CNN averaged 1.7 million viewers during the same period, MSNBC had 848,000 viewers, ABC had 4.7 million viewers, CBS had 4.1 million viewers, NBC had 4.4 million viewers, and there is no immediate information on audience ratings for streaming platforms. That means that more peoplewatchedBeyonce's Christmas halftime show than the 47th president's inauguration. Those numbers seem especially bleak when you consider the size of the U.S. population and the fact that a relatively modest 7.2% of U.S. residents watched Trump's inauguration. But, hey, at least they didn't have to witness the endless spectacle of Trumpclaimingrecord crowds, an ongoing theme from his first inauguration. For those with short memories, Trump's first term kicked off in 2017 with a bizarre and unprovoked obsession over his crowd size. During hisfirst White House press conference, he directed his short-lived Press Secretary Sean Spicer to lie about how many people gathered at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., comparing his crowd to that of former President Barack Obama in 2009—whose audience people can see in photos was clearly more prominent. At least they didn't miss much, other than Trumpnot putting his handon the Bible during his oath of office, an awkward air kiss with Melania, and an array of billionaire oligarchs front and center. Whether it's his polarizing presence, general apathy, despondency, orTrump fatigue, this dip in viewership suggests that the appetite for Trump's theatrics might be waning—at least for now.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 21:30:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298475/-Trump-s-inauguration-is-a-ratings-bust
Egg prices skyrocket and Trump appears not to give a cluck,"Egg prices have surged to anall time highin the new year. As Donald Trump and his billionaire cabal enter the White House, the increasing grocery prices highlights how disingenuous the hand-wringing was during the Biden administration. To be clear, the surge in egg costs is out of Trump's tiny hands. Theavian flu, which has been ravaging farms across the country since this summer, has created massive shortages, increasing the price of eggs to more than $7 per dozen in some places. Meanwhile, fast-food chains like Blake's Lottaburger in Albuquerque, New Mexico, arereportedlyplanning on adding a $1 surcharge to meals that include eggs starting on Thursday. But President Joe Biden wasn't offered that bit of grace during the initial surge in egg costs in 2023 when it was revealed that a large swatch of inflationary costs weredue to corporate malfeasance, specificallycollusionbetween the two largest egg producers in the country. Meanwhile,Trump's flock of quacksoccupying the U.S. government includesraw milk purveyorRobert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services. There is very little reason to think that Kennedy—orTV doctor Mehmet Oz—has any answers related to public health, let alone a surging avian flu crisis. In fact, it was reported Tuesday that the Trump administration hasput a pauseon federal health agencies' communications. So if you were hoping to stay on top of public health concerns, like containment (or lack thereof) of the avian flu, you're out of luck. And while Trump can't be blamed for the conditions surrounding skyrocketing egg prices, it is a perfect encapsulation of how acutely bogus his claims have always been. Trump waited until winning the electionbefore admittingthat he wasn't going to be lowering grocery prices anytime soon. This wasn't much of a surprise to the people actually listening to his speeches on the matter, as it was alwaysunclear whether or notTrump understood what groceries were in the first place. Trump's inability to expedite his promises to the American people is nothing new, but hehasbeen willing to act very quickly in order toissue petty attackson his perceived enemies, while signing aslew of racistandunpopular executive orders.

Trump’s aides had no idea of his Jan. 6 pardon plans to ‘release ‘em all’,"President Donald Trump's decision to issue pardons to the violent insurrectionists who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, isn't onlywildly unpopular with the electorate—but the move apparently caught many of Trump's aides and supporters by surprise. Two officials who worked on Trump's transition toldNBC Newsthat the decision topardon the more than 1,500 people convictedfor their role in the violence was made mere days before Monday's inauguration. ""He is who he is,"" one person who worked on Trump's transition team told the outlet. ""Expectations are sometimes set as best as can be expected, and sometimes they change quickly."" Throughout his presidential campaign, Trumprepeatedly saidthat one of the first acts of his second term would be to free the people who were convicted of breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in his name. At one point, Trump said he'd consider issuing pardons on a ""case-by-case"" basis, suggesting that he might not be as lenient toward those who were found guilty of violent offenses. After all,169 people pleaded guiltyto assaulting police officers,five of whom later died. But of course, Trump effectively left everyone convicted for their actions off the hook. On Monday, heissued roughly 1,500 pardonsand commuted the sentences of 14 imprisoned insurrectionists, allowing them to go free. According toAxios, an adviser familiar with the pardon discussions said that ""Trump just said: 'Fuck it: Release 'em all.'"" While most Republicans are fine playing dumb andpretending like they didn't truly understandthe scope of Trump's pardons, others were mystified by the president's actions. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, told NBC News that denying pardons to those who attacked the police officers whoRepublicans claim to care about""is a more defensible position and easier to support."" ""You have to wonder whether you really want to put people back on the street who haven't paid their dues for having done those things,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the nation whichendorsedTrump's latest presidential bid,issued a joint statementon Tuesday with the International Association of Chiefs of Police in which members slammed both the Biden and Trump administrations for pardoning or commuting the sentences of those convicted of killing or assaulting a police officer. Before leaving office, former President Joe Bidencommuted the sentencesof 37 death row prisoners, including at least two of whom hadkilled a police officer. ""Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety—they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law. Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families,"" the statement said. Part of what makes Trump's leniency toward his supporters even more abhorrent is the fact that his vice president was seemingly just as surprised by it. In a Jan. 12 interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" JD Vance said people who committed violence on Jan. 6, 2021 ""shouldn't be pardoned."" Since then, though, it appears Vance has come around to the fact Trump is king, andhis actions rarely match his words. NBC News reported that once it became clear Trump planned to issue sweeping pardons for those involved in the deadly attack on the Capitol, the entire administration, including Vance, quickly got on board. ""Everyone has been clear that we were looking at all the cases and the ultimate decision, which the Vice President ended up being a driving force behind, was more encompassing action,"" a second transition official told NBC News. ""The President ended up airing on leniency given how political and broken the process was."" Trump, for his part, has defended his disgusting pardons, even going so far as to compare the rioters in prison to ""hostages."" During a Tuesday press conference at the White House, he suggested that his imprisoned supportershad suffered enough behind bars. ""These people have already served years in prison and they've served them viciously,"" Trump said. ""It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing."" More recently, on Wednesday, CNNreportedthat Trump administration officials are toying with whether to invite some of the convicts to the White House for a potential meeting and visit with Trump. Predictably, Republicans are trying to justify Trump's awful decision to pardon the insurrectionists bynoting thatBidenpardoned some members of his familyjust before leaving office. But the comparisons are of apples and oranges at best. Biden's last-minutepreemptive pardonswere controversial, but they were issued as a sort of protection to potential Trump administration targets who have not been indicted, let alone convicted, of a crime. Trump, on the other hand, moved to protect more than 1,500 people, many of whom were indicted, tried, and convicted of criminal wrongdoing. While many of those who have now been set freehave praised Trump'smove, it sets a foreboding tone for the rest of his presidency. If this was truly a last-minute move by Trump, that would suggest that the next four years will be nothing more than him making a series of disastrous and potentially harmful decisions based on whims and vibes. And we're all going to suffer the consequences.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 20:00:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298458/-Trump-s-aides-had-no-idea-of-his-Jan-6-pardon-plans-to-release-em-all
Trump unveils 'plan' to end Russia's war on Ukraine—and it's dumb as hell,"Donald Trump on Wednesday teased that his plan to end Russia's brutal war against Ukraine is to put tariffs on Russian goods and put sanctions on the country, the latter of which the United States is already doing. ""If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries,"" Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social, following a lie-filled screed about the ""Russia Hoax"" and his great relationship with brutal Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. ""Let's get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with!"" he added. ""We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!"" Tariffing his way to peace is not likely to work. That's because Russia and the United States are barely trading at all right now because of the war. In 2024, the U.S. imported almost $2.9 billion in Russian goods—down from $29.6 billion in 2021, the year before the war started, according todatafrom the U.S. Census Bureau. That's a 90% decline. The U.S. is alsoalready imposing punishing sanctionson Russia, and that hasn't stopped Putin from continuing his deadly war to seize land in Europe. On Jan. 10, the Biden administration announced new sanctions on Russian oil producers, oil-carrying vessels, and Russian energy officials, targeting Russia's biggest form of income. ""The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,"" now-former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellensaidin a news release at the time. ""This action builds on, and strengthens, our focus since the beginning of the war on disrupting the Kremlin's energy revenues, including through the G7+ price cap launched in 2022. With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports."" Of course, during the 2024 election cycle, Trumppromisedto end the war before he even took the oath of office—something that obviously didn't happen. He also said he would end the war within his first 24 hours in the White House, something thatalsodidn't happen. Russia has been mocking Trump since he took office. RT, Russia's state-owned propaganda network, posted avideoof Trump falling asleep at the National Prayer Breakfast on Tuesday. ""Trump must be tired after signing all those executive orders, deporting all those people and abolishing all those genders,"" RT wrote alongside the video. ""Melania [Trump] makes sure he doesn't pull a Biden and fall asleep,"" After Trump released this super-detailed plan to get the war to stop, RT will probably mock him more.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 19:15:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298456/-Trump-unveils-plan-to-end-Russia-s-war-on-Ukraine-and-it-s-dumb-as-hell
Republicans are rushing Hegseth through despite horrific new allegations,"Senate Republicans are accelerating the timeline for a vote on Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, even asnew allegationsof abusive behavior have surfaced. Senate Majority Leader John Thunefiled a motionTuesday to end the debate on Hegseth's nomination, which means that the Senate will vote on the nomination by Friday or Saturday. The motion follows the Senate Armed Services Committee's14-13 voteto advance the nomination to the Senate floor. Every Democrat on the committee opposed Hegseth's nomination, while all of the Republicans supported him despite previous allegations of drunkenness, financial mismanagement, and abuse—including a letter in whichhis own mother said he was abusive. On Monday,it was reportedthat Hegseth's former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a sworn affidavit that he abused his second wife. Inthe document, Danielle said that Hegseth's ex-wife had an ""escape plan"" in which she would text members of her family for assistance in getting away from him when he became violent. The affidavit also said that she hid in a closet in fear of him. Hegseth is also accused of being drunk while in military uniform, which is a violation of service laws, while on duty with the Minnesota National Guard. Danielle also accuses Hegseth of making frequent racist and sexist comments, including arguing that women shouldn't vote or work and stating that Christians need to outbreed growing Muslim populations. Hegseth's attorney denies these allegations. ""There was no question that Pete Hegseth is unqualified and unprepared to be secretary of Defense. The affidavit adds additional weight to a case that is already overwhelming against him,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut,told reporters. But Republicans were unmoved. Sen. Lindsay Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Donald Trump's top congressional allies, claimed without evidence that the allegations ""didn't happen"" and refused to address the concerns about Hegseth's alleged drinking problem. The affidavit echoesprevious concernsabout Hegseth's alleged pattern of behavior throughout his life. Trump picked Hegsethfollowing his stintas a Fox News host, during which he praised Trump and established misogynistic stances, like his belief that women should not serve in military combat positions.

Trump doesn't want you to know if another deadly pandemic might kill you,"Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday ordered federal health agencies to cease all public-facing communication, The Washington Postreported, a move that will leave Americans in the dark about everything from viral outbreaks to the spread of possible food-borne illnesses. The directive to halt all communication with the public comes amid aparticularly bad virus season, with influenza A, COVID-19, RSV, and norovirus tearing through communities across the country. It also comes as abird flu outbreakis causing an egg shortage, leading to spiking egg prices. Currently, the outbreak is mostlycontained to animalslike poultry and cows. And humans who have contracted bird flu got it from infected animals, not other humans. In December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—an agency Trump has now essentially placed a gag order on—announcedthat a human in Louisiana was in critical condition after contracting bird flu from exposure to a backyard flock of infected birds. ""It has been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks,"" said the CDC. ""This is the first case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. that has been linked to exposure to a backyard flock. ... No person-to-person spread of H5 bird flu has been detected."" However, scientists are warning that thevirus is mutatingand could cause yet another public health crisis under Trump's watch. According to The Washington Post, the CDC was set to issue three reports this week about the bird flu outbreak but now will not. People within the public health agencies are reportedly not sure why Trump ordered all communication with the public to cease. One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the new administration, told The Washington Post they are hopeful this communications pause is just the sign of a badly run transition and not something more nefarious. ""We have tried to assume good intentions here, and that they're just disorganized,"" the official said. However, it's worth noting that in 2017, during Trump's first presidency, he ordered a similar pause in public-facing communication from the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Agriculture, and the Interior Department, ordering them to, as The Washington Postreportedat the time, ""convey only information that supports the new president's agenda."" Trump also has a history of trying to keep public health information from the public. During his botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump wanted people tostop testing themselves for the virusbecause a high number of cases wouldmake him look bad. It's unclear how long Trump's administration will gag public health agencies or whether the agencies will be able to release factual information when the order is lifted. Even more troubling is that Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services—which oversees the CDC and its communication on disease outbreaks—is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-science quack who falsely believes vaccines cause autism anddrinks raw milk, which can expose humans to bird flu. Experts are speaking out about the new gag order, saying it endangers public health. ""More cases of H5N1 [bird flu] are occurring in the United States than in any other country. Pausing our health communications at a time when states are scrambling to contain this virus is dangerously misguided,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, aprofessor of epidemiologyat Brown University,wrotein a post on X. ""This will make America less healthy and will worsen the virus's economic tolls.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 17:45:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298419/-Trump-doesn-t-want-you-to-know-if-another-deadly-pandemic-might-kill-you
"Trump pardons notorious drug trafficker—wait, what?","Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned the creator of Silk Road, a dark-web marketplace where people sold heroin, cocaine, LSD, and other illicit drugs by using cryptocurrency to keep the transactions anonymous and avoid being caught by law enforcement. Ross Ulbricht wassentenced to life in prisonfor creating the website, in which he made millions of dollars profiting off of illegal drug sales as well as thesale of illegal services, such as computer hacking and forged documents, like passports and Social Security cards. ""Make no mistake, Ulbricht was a drug dealer and criminal profiteer who exploited people's addictions and contributed to the deaths of at least six young people,"" Preet Bharara, the now-former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York whose office prosecuted Ulbricht in 2015,saidin a statement at the time. But Trump has now pardoned Ulbricht and set him free, marking the second time in as many days that Trump let criminals back onto the street. On Tuesday, hepardoned roughly 1,500 Jan. 6, 2021, insurrectionists, many of whom violently assaulted law enforcement officers. Pardoning a major drug trafficker is bizarre for Trump, who hasvowedto give the death penalty to drug dealers. ""We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,"" Trump said in November 2022. ""Because it's the only way."" However, last May at the Libertarian National Convention, Trumppledged to pardonUlbricht in exchange for Libertarians' vote. Libertarians have fought for Ulbricht's release since they support wide-ranging drug legalization and viewed Ulbricht's life sentence as government overreach. ""If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht,"" Trumpsaidat the convention as the crowd chanted Ulbricht's name. ""He's already served 11 years. We're going to get him home."" In the Truth Social post announcing Ulbricht's pardon, Trump wrote that his pardon is making good on his pledge to Libertarian voters. ""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trumpwrote. ""The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!"" What's more, Ulbricht is supported by crypto bros, who have been arguing for Ulbricht's release for years. Bitcoin Magazine hailed Ulbricht's pardon, whichcalledit a ""monumental victory for Bitcoiners."" Trump is also now a cryptocurrency fan, following the launch of his memecoin. Here's how it wasdescribedby Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell: Now thatcrypto has apparently made him even richer, Trump fancies himself one of the crypto bros and did them a solid by releasing Ulbricht.

Trump kills 1965 anti-segregation order in blizzard of racist actions,"Donald Trump has along historyof racism, fromexcusingthe actions of Nazis to promoting the racist birther conspiracy theory. Trump alsosurrounds himselfwith racist advisers like Stephen Miller, who is currently formulating the administration's harsh immigration policy. Trump continued this approach in the first few days of his second presidency by issuing a series of executive orders meant to undo past actions by the U.S. government to address the harmful effects of racism. Trump and his fellow Republicanshave for yearsattacked programs meant to counter racism and encourage diversity, attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. They have falsely claimed that these programs prioritize mediocrity over qualified individuals and decision making. But in reality, the anti-DEI crusade has been a smokescreen for rolling back civil rights. Inhis executive order""Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,"" the Trump administration made this posture clear. The orderexplicitly rescindsExecutive Order 11246, which President Lyndon Johnson signed in 1965—an order Johnson used to desegregate federal contracting. As the Department of Labor websiteexplains(for now, at least), the Johnson order ""reinforced the requirement that federal contractors not discriminate in employment and take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity based on race, color, religion, and national origin."" The department also notes that the Johnson order—now gone, thanks to Trump's actions—were a ""key landmark in a series of federal actions aimed at ending racial, religious and ethnic discrimination."" Reversing an order meant to attack racism and pro-segregation policies was described by the Trump administration ina releaseas ""protecting civil rights and expanding individual opportunity."" In addition to undoing Johnson's actions against segregation, Trump also blamed airline problems on diversity programs. The administration issuedan orderinstructing the Department of Transportation and the FAA to ""immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring."" The order claimed without evidence that increasing diversity in transportation programs somehow makes travel more dangerous for Americans. As evidence, the administration pointed to a January 2023 FAA outage as ""an illustration of the importance of FAA competence."" But in reality, as theFAA determinedat the time of the outage, the cause was a corrupted database issue that occurred when files were deleted by mistake by a contractor. That's not exactly a diversity issue. The Trump administration alsoissued a blanket orderthat fires all staff within the federal government tasked with addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. But even as decades of work to dismantle bigotry were being undone, new reporting revealed that Trump's inner circle has benefitted from these supposedly problematic programs. The New York Timesreportedthat Kash Patel, Trump'scontroversial pickto lead the FBI, benefitted from a DEI program. Patel participated in the American Bar Association's Judicial Intern Opportunity Program in 2003. According to the association's website, the program ""provides opportunities to students who are members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the profession, including students from minority racial and ethnic groups."" Patel benefitted from the same kind of programs that Trump is undermining for millions of Americans, but as part of the presidential inner circle, he gets a pass.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 16:15:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298429/-Trump-issues-blizzard-of-racist-executive-orders
"Trump unleashes ICE raids on churches, schools, and health care facilities","Donald Trump is following through on some—albeitunpopular—campaign promises. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services released astatementrescinding all of the Biden administration's guidelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ""that thwart law enforcement in or near so-called 'sensitive' areas."" In 2021, the Biden administrationexpandedthe definition of ""sensitive locations"" to include social services spaces in the locations where ICE could not arrest people. This meant places such as domestic violence shelters, food banks, counseling facilities, and disaster response centers were off limits for federal raids of undocumented immigrants. But Trump's new guidance doesn't just remove Biden's expansions, but it also includes plans to now allow ICE to raid and arrest people in places of worship, hospitals, and schools. ""The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,"" aDHS statementsaid. Under the first Trump administration, ICE did not have a good record of using ""common sense,"" withnumerous lawsuitsand allegations ofsystemic sexual abuse. ""I said a few times here and there before the election that we'll see what the mass deportation plan looks like when it's ICE agents dragging grandmothers out of churches and, well, here we are,"" New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouiewrote on Bluesky. How this will all unfold remains unclear. Trump's ""border czar"" Tom Homan recentlywalked backsome of the mass deportation promises made during Trump's campaign, though the Trump administration has already planned immigration raids in sanctuary cities likeChicago. While Trump might not be able to deport tens of millions of people as he promised, he is certainly keeping true to his promise to terrorize Americans and their families.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 15:30:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298304/-Trump-unleashes-ICE-raids-on-churches-schools-and-health-care-facilities
‘Totally f-cked’: Instagram users are upset about platform’s shift right,"As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg rubbed elbows with fellowfront-row billionairesduring Donald Trump'sinaugurationMonday, Instagram users began to notice that searches for the term ""Democrats"" yielded rather dark results. ""Hey, Meta, what the fuck is this?"" influencer Mercedes Chandlerasked in an Instagram videoalongside a screenshot of an error screen. When some users searched the hashtag ""Democrat"" Monday morning, they were hit with the message, ""We've hidden these results. Results for the term you've searched for may contain sensitive content."" In astatement to the BBCTuesday, Meta said, ""We're aware of an error affecting hashtags across the political spectrum and we are working quickly to resolve it."" The company insisted this was not targeted and that the disruption impacted other search terms, including one unspecified Republican hashtag. But once service was restored, users were still claiming that their feeds looked different than before. Multiple social media users told Daily Kos that when they searched the term ""Democrat,"" the results were flooded with Republican content, often from right-wing media like Breitbart, Fox News, and Newsmax. ""I think it's time to leave Instagram. This is totally fucked,"" one user posted alongside a screenshot of their MAGA-laden search results. In our own independent Instagram searches, Daily Kos acquired similar findings. However, we noticed a mix of Republican and Democratic content from the ""Republican"" hashtag as well. Meta declined Daily Kos' request for comment. While theories abound regarding what could be happening behind the scenes with Instagram's algorithm, Zuckerberg has been making much more apparent MAGA-friendly moves. Zuckerberg, who notoriously butted heads with Trump during his first administration, gave in and bent the knee to the convicted felon this time around. The college lonely boy-turned-multibillionaire not only gave a whopping $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, but he alsodismantledMeta's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs;removed fact checkingfrom Facebook and Instagram; and made changes to Meta's ""hateful conduct"" policy, which now allows the use of hate speech toward women, transgender, and nonbinary people. ""We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,"" Zuckerberg said in astatementearlier this month. And as the freshly permed Zuckerberg cozies up to theNazi-saluting Elon Musk, he's also announced a company move to Texas—where Musk's empire is headquartered. Ultimately, it's unclear if Instagram's algorithm is laden with MAGA content because of string pulling behind the scenes or if content from right-leaning creators is just simply more popular. One thing, however, is clear: Owners of the social media platforms that connect people, shape opinions, and keep people informed areeating out of Trump's handgoing into his second term.

These Democrats are uniting against Trump's birthright citizenship ban,"The remaining guardrails of democracy are holding strong—for now. Democrats have wasted no time challenging Donald Trump's attempt to thwart birthright citizenship during his signing of ominous executive orders on his first day in office. A group of Democratic attorneys general announced Tuesday that it wouldlegally challengeTrump's birthright citizenship ban, asserting it as unconstitutional. The group cited the 14th Amendment, which states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" The group included attorneys general of Arizona, Washington, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Michigan, Colorado, Delaware, Nevada, Hawaii, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, along with the District of Columbia and San Francisco. The groupcitesthat it brings this action ""to protect their states, localities, and residents from the President's flagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage."" Since 2018, Trump has beenpushing to endbirthright citizenship through executive order. But even an executive ordercan't overrulethe Constitution, and Congress can't pass nor implement an unconstitutional bill. Rather, a constitutional amendment, which requires38 of the 50 statesto ratify, is needed to amend the Constitution. ""President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship is a direct attack on the Constitution and the fundamental rights it guarantees to every child born on American soil,"" New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said. ""The Fourteenth Amendment is clear: citizenship is not a privilege to be granted or revoked by political whim—it is a right enshrined in the very fabric of our nation. We will not stand by as this administration attempts."" ""On day one, President Trump moved to use executive power to effectively amend the Constitution in an unprecedented, but not unexpected manner,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. ""With the exception of indigenous peoples and the descendants of enslaved peoples, the United States is a nation of descendants of immigrants, many of whom risked their lives for the promise of a better life. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that no matter your family's country of origin, if you are born here, this is your home, this is your country."" ""I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, and this executive order is plainly unconstitutional. Babies born here in Vermont have a constitutional right to be embraced as Vermonters and Americans,"" Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said. Meanwhile, just hours into his presidency, Trump was hit with numerouslawsuitsfrom groups like American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, and State Democracy Defenders Fund for his unconstitutional executive order and for the Department of Government Efficiency's violation of theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. It's unclear whether Trump's ban on birthright citizenship will reach the Supreme Court.

"Republicans are back to playing dumb, as Trump does the unforgivable","Fearing the wrath of Dear Leader, congressional Republicans are either refusing to comment on Donald Trump'sdisgusting pardonsof violent Capitol insurrection convicts, or are flat-out lying about what Trump actually did to avoid having to criticize his behavior. Hours after being sworn in to his second term, Trump gaveunconditional pardonsto 1,550 people who either pleaded guilty to or were convicted of crimes related to their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. According toThe New York Times: Trump also commuted the sentences of members of right-wing militia groups theProud Boys and Oath Keeperswho were convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in planning and encouraging violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021—leading to the release of those men from prison. But multiple members of the House and Senate, including Republican congressional leaders, told reporters on Tuesday that they couldn't make a judgement on the blanket pardons Trump issued because they haven't read up on them yet—the least believable lie on earth. ""I haven't gone into the detail,"" Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said. ""I don't know all the cases. I certainly don't want to pardon any violent actors. But there's a real miscarriage of justice here so I'm totally supportive of it,"" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of WisconsintoldFox News reporter Chad Pergram, apparently unaware that Trump pardoned violent actors. Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabamasaidhe wouldn't be for pardoning the violent insurrectionists, but wouldn't comment because he ""didn't see"" if Trump did that. Republican Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota knew that Trump issued pardons, but played dumb about what they entailed. ""My understanding, there was a range of actions that he took. And I guess I want to look and see what those are,"" Hoevensaid. Other lawmakers straight-up lied about the pardons, saying Trump issued them on a ""case-by-case basis."" ""We're not looking backwards, we're looking forward,"" Senate Majority Leader John ThunetoldCNN's Manu Raju, adding, ""I think they were case-by-case."" Meanwhile, a number of GOP lawmakersrefused to comment at allon the pardons, or tried to shift the conversation to formerPresident Joe Biden's preemptive pardons of his familymembers, who were likely to be harassed by the Trump administration. ""Republican senators are physically shrugging when reporters ask them what they think of Trump pardoning January 6 defendants,"" Haley Byrd Wilt, a Capitol Hill reporter for the nonprofit news outlet NOTUS,wrotein a post on X. Former Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now Trump's secretary of state,saidhe wouldn't comment. ""I'm not going to engage in domestic political debates,"" Rubio told NBC News. In anotherinterviewwith CBS, Rubio refused to comment again, saying ""I work for Trump."" ""I assume you're asking me about the Biden pardons of his family,"" Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of IowatoldSemafor's Burgess Everett—a ridiculous whataboutism. ""I'm just talking about the Biden pardons, because that is so selfish."" Sens. John Cornynof Texas andJim Banksof Indiana also tried to pivot to talking about Biden's pardons. ""You've seen President Biden's preemptive pardons. Pardons of his own family. The power presidential pardons is one granted to a president and there's really no role for the Congress ... it's the president's prerogative,"" Cornynsaid. The pardons go against what Trump's own vice president said just a few days ago that Trump would do. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" JD Vancesaidin aJan. 11 appearanceon ""Fox News Sunday."" To be sure, a few Republicans criticized Trump. ""I'm disappointed to see that and I do fear the message that is sent to these great men and women that stood by us,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the few Republicans who's actually stood up to Trump in the past,said. ""Anybody who is convicted of assault on a police officer, I can't get there, at all. I think it was a bad idea,"" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina,said. ""Well I think I agree with the vice president,"" Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of KentuckytoldSemafor, referring to Vance's belief that violent insurrectionists shouldn't have been pardoned. ""No one should excuse violence. And particularly violence against police officers."" Of course, we don't want to praise anyone for doing the bare minimum and speaking the truth about Trump's awful actions.

Russian state media mocks Trump a day after he criticizes Putin,"RT, Russia's state-owned propaganda network, mocked Donald Trump just a day after he offered up light criticism of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Trump has usually avoided criticizing Putin over the issue of Ukraine. Trump has even claimed that the war wasn't Putin's fault and blamed it on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The war began in 2022 afterPutin lied and saidareas of Ukraine were under control by neo-Nazis, justifying an incursion across the border by the Russian military who has been there since. Not only has Trump offered up excuses for Putin, he haseven blamedUkraine for their predicament—at one point claiming that Zelenskyy ""let that war start."" RT has traditionally been in Trump's corner. In September, the Department of Justiceaccusedthe network of being part of a scheme to funnel millions of dollars to pro-Trump media influencers.

Trump seems hell-bent on jamming through some wildly unpopular promises,"Shortly after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump set out to fulfill many of his campaign promises, signinga flurry of executive ordersandpardoning roughly 1,500people convicted for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. While many of these moves haveearned him plauditsfrom bothmembers of the mediaand his base, polling shows they're divisive, if not outright unpopular, with the American electorate. Starting with Trump's most audacious immigration-related proposals, he's sought tosend troopsto the Southern border, reinstate the controversial ""remain in Mexico"" policy for asylum-seekers, and end birthright citizenship for those born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants—a conceptpromised by the Constitution's 14th Amendment. While Americans' attitudes toward increased immigrationhave souredand there's anuptick in supportfor securing the U.S.-Mexico border, the public hasn't quite taken to mass deportations,which Trump has promised. A DecemberCiviqs poll for Daily Kosfound that just over half of registered voters (53%) support this, while an almost equal percentage (46%) were opposed. Deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been convicted of a crime nets even less support. According to recent polling fromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, just 37% of Americans support deporting undocumented immigrants who have not committed a crime, compared with 44% who are against doing so. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderseeking to end birthright citizenship—despite the fact that few Americans want him to do so. The same AP-NORC poll found that 28% of Americans support this, while a majority (51%) were opposed. It's possible that recent polling might undersell how many people are opposed to this policy, especially since it's sure to get tied up in legal challenges. Republicans have pushed to end birthright citizenshipsince at least 2011, but polling from around that time suggests that there was never a majority support for it. For instance, a 2010 poll fromQuinnipiac Universityfound that 45% of registered voters said they wanted to ""continue to grant citizenship to all children born in the U.S.,"" while 48% said that existing laws should change ""so children of illegal immigrants are not automatically granted citizenship."" According to former special counsel Jack Smith'sreport,Trump could not accept his loss to former President Joe Biden in 2020 sohe triedto ""direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol ... to further delay it."" Smith added that the crowd was predominantly supporters of Trump and that they ""violently attacked"" law enforcement officers attempting to secure the building. The ensuing riot was a rough day for law enforcement.Roughly 140 officers were injured, andfive later died. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly against pardoning the convicted rioters. The sameDecember Civiqs pollfound that 51% of voters were opposed to pardoning the rioters, including a plurality (47%) who said they were strongly opposed. Other surveys have found similar results. According to December polling fromCBS News/YouGov, 80% of Americans still disapprove of the actions of those who forced their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, compared with 19% who approve of it. Meanwhile, AP-NORC found just only 2 in 10 Americans favor pardoning most people who participated in the attack, but a much larger share (6 in 10) oppose it, including half who strongly oppose it. Trump has also announced plans toimpose 25% tariffson imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1. But according to data from theGlobal Strategist Group, released in December, 3 in 5 Americans view tariffs unfavorably and believe that they'll increase costs (which they likely will). Meanwhile, data released on Tuesday byNavigator Researchshowed that 37% of registered voters support Trump's tariff plan, while a slightly larger share (41%) are against it. Like Trump's other proposals, support for tariffs is highly partisan: Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (67%) support imposing taxes on foreign goods, while 67% of Democrats oppose it. Independents are more split on the issue: While a plurality (43%) are against Trump's tariff plan, roughly one-third of them (35%) are unsure. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderdirecting the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, but about half of Americans oppose this, according to aforementioned AP-NORC polling. That polling found that roughly half of Americans (52%) ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" oppose that action, with even Republicans fairly split on it (only 45% support the move). Meanwhile, only 2 in 10 Americans (21%) support withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a move that could isolate the nation from the global campaign to curb climate change. Another one of Trump's executive orders mandated that federal employeesreturn to the officefive days a week, ending almost all remote-work arrangements. This is likely to be one of the Trump administration's most unpopular policies since many workers have come to appreciate the flexibility of remote or hybrid work, which was popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October, thePew Research Centerfound that a little under half (46%) of U.S. employees who work from home at least sometimes would be unlikely to stay at their current workplace if their employers required them to come into an office. Only about one-third (36%) said they would stay at their current job if existing remote-work policies changed. There are a number of reasons why workers might prefer more flexible work policies, thoughGallupfound in 2021 that some of the top reasons for wanting fully remote work included avoiding a commute (52%) and feeling more productive (35%). While Democrats most strongly oppose the majority of Trump's plans, Republicans also display some ambivalence, especially over pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. Despite Republican lawmakers and Big Tech allies hyping up Trump, this data seems to suggest that Trump'shoneymoon periodmight be over soon. Then again, if Trump's ever on the outs with voters and finds himself looking to curry favor with them, maybe he can sign an executive orderto lower the prices of eggs.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 23:30:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298220/-Trump-seems-hellbent-on-jamming-through-some-wildly-unpopular-promises
Trump pans prayer service after bishop calls for ‘mercy’ on immigrants,"Donald Trump gave a negative review to a church service that asked for mercy for immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. Trump attended a national prayer service at National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday accompanied by Vice President JD Vance. The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, an Episcopal bishop, delivered the service and called for unity across ideologies. Directly addressing Trump, Budde said, ""In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent families—some who fear for their lives."" Budde then mentioned immigrants and noted, ""The vast majority of immigrants are not criminals,"" as Vance appeared to roll his eyes and Trump shuffled in his seat. ""I ask you to have mercy on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away,"" Budde asked. Following the service, Trumpwas askedby reporters to comment. ""Not too exciting,"" he said. ""They could do much better."" Budde's call for mercy comes as Trump prepares to deliver on the anti-immigrant promises he made during the presidential campaign, most notably planningfor mass deportations. Senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, who hasa considerable history of racismand affiliations with white supremacists,recently huddledwith congressional Republicans to begin making plans on that front. Trump also signedan anti-transgenderexecutive order, claiming that there are just two biological sexes—a return to his campaign's demagoguery of transgender Americans. (Biologistslargely disagreewith the idea of binary sex.) Trump's flippant remark following the religious service comes just a day after henotably declinedto put his hand on the Bible during his inauguration ceremony, bucking a cross-party tradition. His negative review of the sermon also echoes his habit of reacting poorly to criticism. During the presidential campaign, hebacked outof a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, who waswidely seen as the winnerof their first and only debate. As arguably the most prominent leader in the world, Trump will attract considerable criticism, and like the last time he held office, he is showing early signs of not being able to handle it well.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 23:00:05,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298265/-Trump-pans-prayer-service-after-bishop-calls-for-mercy-on-immigrants
How the right is justifying—and even celebrating—Musk’s Nazi salute,"Feeling emboldened by Donald Trump officially being sworn in as president, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, gave a nod to Germany's Nazi Party—you know, the one thatkilled six millionJewish people and started World War II. ""Thank you for making it happen,"" Musk said to the raucous MAGA crowd during an inaugural event speech, which he wrapped up by doing the ""Sieg Heil,"" or Nazi salute—twice, just to clear up the possibility that it might have been an unintentional slip-up. Obviously, people have been expressing their reactions of shock and disgust on social media from around the world—except, of course, by far-right Trump supporters and white nationalists, who justified and praised the salute. ""I studied the Nazis at university, taught the history of Nazi Germany on two continents and wrote for major newspapers about Nazi Germany,"" Mike Stuchberywrote on X. ""I am internet famous for fact-checking chuds on the history, ideology and policy of Nazi Germany. That was a Nazi salute."" ""For every dingbat posting Kamala or [Hillary] waving... they're not doing the wind-up, hand to heart which is the hallmark of the Nazi/fascist salute,"" Stuchbery said inanother post. Democrats in Europe were equally aghast, with Spanish Minister of Labor and Social Economy Yolanda Díazdeciding to leaveX after ""the entire world witnessed Elon Musk mimicking a Nazi salute during Donald Trump's inauguration."" Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzsaidat the World Economic Forum Tuesday that Musk has the right to free speech, but ""what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions."" Muskrespondedon his platform X on Monday in an attempt to downplay his Nazi gesture. ""Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, corporate media coverage of Trump has beenoverwhelmingly positive, with POLITICO co-founder John F. Harris writing that Trump is a ""great president."" The Washington PostlabeledMusk's Nazi salute as merely ""exuberant speech,"" and The New York Times explained it away with theheadline, ""Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture."" So we're watering down Nazi salutes as ""hand gestures"" now? To add insult to injury, the Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy organization, defended Musk,sayingthat he ""made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute."" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quicklyrespondedto the ADL's statement. ""Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity. People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all,"" she wrote. During her hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New Yorkdeniedthat Musk did a Nazi salute whenasked about itby Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. Meanwhile, white nationalist and far-right commentators like self-identified ""Christian"" Evan KilgorepraisedMusk's salute. ""Holy crap... Did[Musk] just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington D.C... This is incredible,"" he wrote. But after criticism came roaring in, Kilgorebacktrackedby insulting everyone with autism whodoesn'tsalute Nazis. ""Elon Musk is autistic. He was excited. We all know his intentions weren't to make a Sieg Heil,"" he wrote. ""It looked much more like a Roman Salute. Can we all have a sense of humor for 5 seconds?"" Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of theextremist and conspiratorialplatform Gab,sharedthe photo of Musk doing the Nazi salute with the caption, ""Incredible things are happening."" ""Incredible"" is certainly one way to put it. This moment—and the four years to come—will serve as a significant flashpoint in the slow, steady battle over the normalization of fascism and oligarchy in U.S. politics and culture.

Trump immediately reminds America of his pettiness and fragile ego,"Less than 24 hours into his second term, Donald Trump is already trying to settle scores with his perceived enemies, taking multiple petty actions to stroke his giant and fragile ego. Less than two hours after being sworn in, Trump had a portrait of Gen. Mark Milley—the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who called Trump a ""fascist"" and a ""dangerous"" person—removed from the Pentagon, The New York Timesreported. The portrait had beenunveiledjust 10 days ago. Milley is one of the people Trumpput on his enemies list. Trump's hatred of Milley runs so deep that former President Joe Biden gave Milley apreemptive pardonto prevent Trump from ordering his administration to prosecute Milley for whatever made-up crimes they could conjure up. Milley said he was grateful for Biden's pardon. ""I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,"" he said in a statement. ""I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety."" Trump also announced that he removed four people Biden appointed, including Milley. Trumpwrotein a post on X: Andres is a humanitarian who has beennominatedfor a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit he founded that feeds people suffering from natural disasters, war, and poverty. Andres wrote in a post on X that he couldn't be removed from his position because he already resigned a week ago. Andreswrote: Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta and later worked in the Biden White House as the director of the Office of Public Engagement. Like Andres, Bottoms said she already left her position so Trump's ""firing"" was moot. ""A day late and a dollar short ... My resignation from the President's Export Council was submitted January 4, effective yesterday,"" Bottomssaid. ""You can't fire someone who has already resigned. Of all the things happening in the world, not sure why I'm on Donald Trump's mind at 1:30 am following his inauguration, but I count it as a badge of honor."" And it's unclear why he targeted Hook, who actuallyservedin Trump's first administration as an envoy to Iran. As for other pettiness, following Trump'sdark and low-energy inaugural address, he gaverambling 30-minute remarksin which he complained about his 2024 victory and lied about voter fraud, falsely saying he ""would have won the state of California"" in 2024 were it not for fraud. In thoseremarks, Trump also falsely accused Milley as well as the members of Congress who investigated the Capitol insurrection of being guilty of ""very, very guilty of very, very bad crimes""—making Biden's preemptive pardons look well justified. Ultimately, Trump's first day in office was anabject disasterthat proved his detractors right when they warned that his second term would be four years of Trump going after anyone who he deems insufficiently subservient.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 21:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298193/-Trump-immediately-reminds-America-of-his-pettiness-and-fragile-ego
Why the internet is blaming a billionaire couple for California fires,"Online creators have been buzzing aboutStewart and Lynda Resnick, billionaires who own a portion of Southern California's water supply, claiming that the couple is to blame for fire hydrantsrunning dryamid the ongoing wildfires across the region. But while the Resnicks have areputationfor being the ""California couple who uses more water than every home in Los Angeles combined,"" the blame is actually misplaced. The Resnicks made their billions from theirWonderful Company, which produces foods like Wonderful Pistachios, POM pomegranate juice, and Halo tangerines. In 1994, the Resnicks signed acontroversial backroom dealsecuring 58% of the Kern Water Bank. But according toCBS News, California's water laws allow owners the right to usage, not ownership of the water itself. Moreover, the state actually has laws prohibiting people from withholding or hoarding water. Felicia Marcus, former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, told CBS News that the state constitution includes a ""prohibition against waste and unreasonable use."" In other words, if ""you actually ended up in a situation where somebody was withholding water at a grand scale,"" the government could step in. The Resnicks, whopledged $10 millionfrom Wonderful Companyfor wildfire relief efforts,are just one example of the misinformed blame-throwing going on since the fires started. President Donald Trumpfalsely claimedthat California Gov. Gavin Newsom's failure to sign a ""water restoration declaration"" was the reason for water supply shortages. Newsom's office later noted that ""no such document"" even exists. Other finger pointing was aimed atAI and tech companies, where social media users quickly circulated claims that super computers used up the water supplies desperately needed by the firefighters. Thereal reasonfor the lack of water, however, is much more complicated. And, even more so, Los Angeles was simply not equipped for a natural disaster of this scale even with water supplies at a historical high. ""What's happening in LA is not because there's not enough water in LA in storage,"" Marcus said. ""There are no urban water systems that are built out to handle a firestorm like this."" At the end of the day, people are angry and scared. Many have lost their homes, their financial safety net, and their sense of security. And as of Jan. 16,at least 27 peopledied in the fires. While conditions have eased, allowing firefighters to push back the flames, the ultra-dry conditions have expertsconcerned about future vulnerability. For those looking to help out but not sure where to start, disaster relief expertIrwin Redlenertold Daily Kos that it's not always helpful to throw money at large nonprofits like American Red Cross, since they often already have large endowments for disasters. Instead, he recommends supporting charities at the local level, including churches. But even that, unfortunately, can be complicated as it's difficult to trace where exactly funds are going. ""It's hard for the consumer to tell what is actually most effective,"" he said, adding thatCharity Navigatoris a helpful tool for assessing a charity's effectiveness. Redlener also pointed out that the destruction from the California wildfires will last much longer than the media coverage. ""It will disappear from the front pages of news organizations, and it will be replaced by other issues. And, ironically, that may be the time when we really need to be thinking about what's happening to the people who have been affected by the disaster,"" he said. ""So sometimes it might be worth it for people to sort of hold on to their generosity.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 20:00:22,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297340/-Why-the-internet-is-blaming-a-billionaire-couple-for-California-fires
'Great president': Mainstream media slobbers all over Trump,"Early in Donald Trump's new presidency, mainstream media outlets confirmed fears of how they would cover him—by avoiding the truth, equivocating on his abuse of power, and even praising him. The actions by widely read and watched outlets was the continuation of a recent trend that has seen outlets likeABC News,MSNBC, andThe Washington Postcave to Trump, even before he was sworn in. ""Time to Admit It: Trump Is a Great President,"" readsthe beginning of a Politico headlinepublished Tuesday. Contrary to its appearance, the column was not written by Trump himself or even one of his many MAGA acolytes in the media. Instead, it is the work of Politico co-founder and current Global Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, a longtime mainstay of Washington journalism. The gushing goes beyond the headline as Harris writes, ""[Trump] is someone with an ability to perceive opportunities that most politicians do not and forge powerful, sustained connections with large swaths of people in ways that no contemporary can match. In other words: He is a force of history."" When the mainstream press isn't prematurely declaring Trump's greatness (and ignoring thedeath tollof his previous stint of making America ""great""), it equivocated on one of his first acts, which gave a green light to hundreds of criminals. Trumppardoned about 1,500 people convictedof attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, over the protests of millions—including the police officersbattered and bruised by insurrectionists attempting to overturn the election. ButatThe Washington Post, this was the equivalent of President Joe Biden'sdecisionto preemptively pardon figures like Anthony Fauci, retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, and members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee whom Trump and his MAGA movement have targeted. ""Biden started the day with pardons. Trump finished with many more,"" reads the Post headline—as if pardoning Enrique Tarrio, convicted of sedition against the United States, is the same thing as pardoning Dr. Fauci, who MAGA world hates for the sin of telling Americans to mask up during a global pandemic. Things aren't much better at The New York Times.Their headlineon Trump's pardons: ""In Dueling Pardons, an Intensified Fight Over the Meaning of Jan. 6."" Apparently, the Times believes that Biden issuing a pardon to Milley, whom Trump has lambasted for calling him a ""fascist,"" is on the same level as Trump's pardon of the man who stormed the Capitol with a ""Camp Auschwitz"" hoodie. At a post-inauguration rally for Trump, his co-President andcampaign benefactorElon Musk—the richest person in the world—gave a Nazi salute. Twice. Yet,atThe Washington Post, it was merely an ""exuberant speech."" Meanwhile, forThe New York Times, the furor at the hand motion was explained away: ""Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture."" Meanwhile, NBC's Chicago affiliate apparentlyposted a videoof Musk's speech where the feed cut to a shot of the audience at the precise moments of the offensive salutes. Over the course of the 2024 election, the mainstream pressmade clearthat it would prioritize criticism of Democrats like Biden and Vice President Harris while playing down offenses by Trump. Now that Trump is back in the Oval Office, the press is continuing that trend. The press has long been described as the watchdogs of democracy, but these outlets show that the watchdog has gone on a break.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 18:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298201/-Mainstream-media-fails-the-Trump-test-on-his-first-day-back
Trump's speech raises the old question: Is he evil or merely stupid?,"In Donald Trump's new conceit, America was a hellhole in 2016, he made it great, then former President Joe Biden broke everything, but thanks to Trump's 2024 election win, everything will be great again. Or, as he said inhis inaugural addresson Monday, ""The golden age of America begins right now."" You know he is full of shit. I know he's full of shit. We'd like to think everyone around him knows so as well, but doeshe? It's the age-old question: Is Trump evil or merely stupid? Ifhis inaugural speechsays anything, it's that he is delusional in what he thinks he can accomplish. After some throat clearing, Trump's speech begins: One of Trump's conceits is that other countries no longer respect the United States but that they did respect us when he was president—a time when the world literallylaughed at him. Right off the bat, we find out that Trump has no intentions of uniting the country. Rather, he'll be airing his usual grievances—Trump's 24/7/365 celebration ofFestivus. Trump wants to end the weaponization of the Justice Department? So patently absurd, especially as Trumpfrequently talks aboutall his enemies he wants to prosecute. Just this past Saturday, heshared a poston his Truth Social platform that called for Democratic politicians to be prosecuted. It's going to be an exhausting four years. Sunlight is pouring over the world, y'all. Imagine the gall of saying that when the front row of your inauguration audience—in front of your Cabinet picks—is the modern American oligarchy: Net worthof those pictured as of Tuesday morning: Tesla CEO Elon Musk: $425 billion Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: $241 billion Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: $212 billion Google CEO Sundar Pichai:$1.3 billion Add in Bernard Arnault, whoalso attendedand whose familial net worth is $181 billion, and you get a combined net worth of nearly $1.1 trillion. TRILLION. Four of the five richest men in the world were there, and it's possible all five were if Trump pal Larry Ellison was also somewhere in the crowd. Trump will stand there and talk about ""extracted ... wealth from our citizens"" when he seems to havejustpulled apump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemeon his own followers? It's telling that when talking about national disasters, his real empathy has always been for the wealthy: Maybe those powerful and wealthy individuals can pay their fair share of taxes to support those services? Not to mention the brutal insult to the firefighters bravely fighting those fires in Los Angeles. Also,Trump cut the FEMA budgetlast time he was president. You better believe it'll get hacked this time around as well. It won't be remembered as such. Why would it be? Sheesh. And no, the nation isn't unifying. It'sjust as divided as always. In any case, Trump then starts with his promises, leading with sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. As I've written before,good luck with that. Even his own border czar, Tom Homan, is trying to temper expectations. The U.S. is already atop energy exporterin the world. Trump will soon take credit for somethingBiden has largely done. Given the climate crisis, though, this may not actually be a good thing. Congrats, Elon Musk, who owns the electric car company Tesla. Also, the Green New Deal isn't law. Is Trump talking about green energy projects under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act? In one of those inexplicable things Democrats keep doing to themselves, the bulk of investment from that lawwent to red congressional districts. And those Republicansdon't want to give up that sweet federal cash. Me, I'm actually rooting for Trump to kill those projects. If Republican voters want federal investment in their communities, they can vote Democratic next time. And when Democrats have power, they need to spend that money ontheirconstituents. Build those factories in blue cities and states. Give them a reason tokeepvoting Democratic. Because watching their tax dollars go to ingrate conservatives isn't doing the party any good. Every business leader, including those sitting in Trump's inauguration audience, knows that this will be a tax on American consumers. Along with any deportations the administration manages, this will prove to be deeply inflationary. So all those people complaining about the price of eggs? Buckle down—it's about to get much worse. Also, there's already an ""External Revenue Service."" It's thecustomspart of the U.S.Customsand Border Protection agency. Put a pin on this one. Itwon't age well. Cruelty will certainly be the official policy of the United States. I'm gonna have to research what ""radical political theories"" he's talking about. Is itwomen in combat? I bet it's women in combat roles. Our armed forces are facing arecruiting crisis. Trump wants to make it worse. I'm laughing too! Trump's a loon. He also claims he'll take back thePanama Canal. But remember, he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, as he threatens Panama (andGreenland and Denmark, andCanada, among other allies). He wants to keep kids disease-free ... and yet he wantsa vaccine denierto lead the Department of Health and Human Services ... all while being the dude wholovesMcDonald's. He wants his legacy to be peace, and nothing says ""peace"" more than actual, literal imperialism. So ... is his vision of ""unity"" and ""peace"" actually more like ""world conquest""? Sure seems that way. Because nothing says ""angry, violent, and totally unpredictable"" like Trump himself and his MAGA movement. Indeed, if there'sanythingwe are sure to see over the next four years it's more anger, violence, and unpredictability, courtesy of Trump. That is already his legacy, andeverythinghe is pushing for—deportations, inflationary tariffs, anti-trans hate, and imperialism—will only further cement that legacy.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 17:00:09,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298037/-Trump-s-speech-raises-the-old-question-Is-he-evil-or-merely-stupid
Trump hit with barrage of lawsuits over his lawless Day 1 actions,"Just hours into his second term, Donald Trump has been hit with multiple different lawsuits. The lawsuits are challenging his spate of lawless executive orders that hesigned from a big boy deskin front of a crowd of his economically anxious supporters wholeft thousands of dollars worth of their belongingsoutside of the Capitol One Arena Monday afternoon. The lawsuits target everything from Trump'sblatantly unconstitutional executive orderthat reinterprets the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, to his toothless Department of Government Efficiency advisory commission. And more lawsuitscould be on the way. The ACLUsuedTrump over his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, which is plainly guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump's executive order states that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to people born to undocumented parents, and thus those people should not be given birth certificates. From theorder: The ACLU said in its lawsuit that this order violates the Supreme Court's ruling inUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark. ""The Supreme Court conclusively determined that all children born in the United States are citizens, subject only to very limited exceptions,"" the ACLU lawsuit said of theWong Kim Arkdecision. ""This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans,"" Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,saidin a statement. ""We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail."" Trump's executive order creatingDOGE, meanwhile, was hit with three lawsuits, all of which allege that the fake government department violates theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which defines how such committees operate. The public interest law firm National Security Counselors was first out the gate in suing the advisory commission led by co-President andNazi saluterElon Musk. (DOGE was also supposed to be led by billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but Ramaswamy was reportedlyoustedbefore his job even began. He is preparing to launch a bid for governor in Ohio, as his fetish for losing elections can't be suppressed.) The NSC lawsuitsaysthat under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, DOGE is considered a ""federal advisory committee"" and thus must ""be balanced in terms of points of view represented,"" have public meetings held with 15 days of advance notice and have minutes available to the public. DOGE follows none of those rules. Asecondlawsuit from six public interest groups, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also alleges that DOGE violates FACA. ""DOGE's unchecked secrecy, access, and private influence—bought by political loyalty—is anathema to efficient, effective government. Indeed, any federally endorsed, but fundamentally private, advisory effort to shape how our government serves the American people must comply with federal transparency laws, including FACA. Defendants have not done so,"" the lawsuit states. And athirdsuit from Public Citizen, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the American Federation of Government Employees, also says DOGE is in violation of FACA. ""AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,"" American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelleysaidin a statement. Finally, the National Treasury Employees Union filedsuitover Trump'sexecutive orderthat seeks to make it easier for him to fire federal employees. ""When establishing hiring principles, Congress determined that most federal government jobs be in the merit-based, competitive service. And it established that most federal employees have due process rights if their agency employer wants to remove them from employment. Because the Policy/Career Executive Order attempts to divest federal employees of these due process rights, it is contrary to congressional intent,"" the lawsuit states. ""This order is about administering political loyalty tests to everyday employees in the federal workforce who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve their country,"" NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in astatementto Bloomberg Law. Of course, Trump doesn't care about following the law, as he thinks he is above it, so it's unclear if he would even follow court orders that arise from these lawsuits. Already, he is blatantly violatingthe law that banned TikTokby signing an executive orderpausingthe app ban.

Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of ""law and order,"" one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump's pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost ""patriots"" and ""hostages"" in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump's actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio's caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump's action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading ""Camp Auschwitz,"" referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump's action. ""One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,"" Gonelltold HuffPost. ""It's a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It's a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again."" Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, ""This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump's pardons,writing, ""President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists."" One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that ""these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose."" The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.'s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""I don't think it's causing much controversy."" She later added, ""President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system."" Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency.

Why is Trump stockpiling so much cash?,"Business leaders and wealthy donors are surrendering to President Donald Trump's demands for more money, and his team said it expects to amass an eye-popping $500 million by summer. According toAxios, Trump is hoarding cash partly because he doesn't want his second administration to be seen as a lame duck, even though he's constitutionally prohibited from running again. Of course, the fundraising efforts will benefit Trump first and foremost. With half a billion dollars in his coffers, Trump could surely continue wielding control over the GOP, using the money to punish his dissenters. ""The money is just pouring in at Mar-a-Lago. Trump doesn't have to lift a finger. Everyone's coming to him,"" one anonymous Trump adviser told Axios. The adviser added that Trump's team is ""on track"" to raise $500 million by June. ""It's sort of a target but it's just a realistic projection of what's happening."" The money is feeding into several accounts, including Trump's inauguration fund, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, the Securing American Greatness nonprofit, the Republican National Committee, and the fund for Trump's future presidential library. While it's been thoroughly reported that business and tech moguls aremajor Trump donorsand were beingrewarded with plum seatsat Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, people from the cryptocurrency industry are blowing them out of the water. A Trump adviser told Axios that ""crypto guys"" were giving as much as $20 million. Notably, it's not just tech and crypto bros added to Trump's treasure trove of cash. The donors come from a wide range of industries—from agriculture and insurance to finance to health care. These donations are a stark change from what we saw four years ago, when some companiespledged to rethink or withholdtheir donations from Republican lawmakers whovoted to overturnthe results of the 2020 election. While many of those companies later resumed their donations, Trump apparently kept a list of those who didn't and is reminding them thatthey'll only get richer once he's back in the White House. ""You guys made this amount of money last year and you're gonna make so much more now because of me,"" Trump told the representatives of one company, according to Axios. Trump is also apparently holding a grudge over the fact that some of the donors now knuckling under were nowhere to be found during his 2024 presidential campaign. One company's consultant told Axios that Trump was ""raking [a client and future donor] over the coals"" after they paused donations. ""When I needed you, where the fuck were you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with [Vice President Kamala Harris],"" Trump reportedly said. But he has made clear that his newfound treasure trove of cash won't go toward benefitting those who donated. A second Trump adviser put it plainly: ""He'll take your money and then tell you, 'I don't give a fuck what you want.' He did that during the campaign. ... He's going to do what he wants, what the base wants."" This hasn't stopped the donations from pouring in, however. Axios reported that some donors are holding out hope that getting back on Trump's good side—even if they don't get any tangible legislative rewards for their giving—is worth it. After all, getting on Trump's bad side is known to negatively affect companies,just look at Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Plus, in the words of one anonymous lobbyist who spoke with Axios, these companies don't want to ""get DOGE'd"" by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have threatened tocut an unspecified amountof federal spending once they're co-leading thetoothlessadvisory commission known as the Department of Government Efficiency. With all this money stockpiled—and the abilityto keep raking it in—Trump will surely use it to punish his enemies, reward those who are loyal to him, and help Republicans keep power in Washington, D.C., where they hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate. In life, and in politics especially,money is power. With this, Trump can continue his reign as de facto leader of the GOP for not only his next four years in the White House but also long afterward.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 14:00:19,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297105/-Why-is-Trump-stockpiling-so-much-cash
9 Trump inauguration promises that won't lower the price of your eggs,"After not putting his hand on the Bible as he took the oath of office, Donald Trump gave an extremely dark and lie-filledinaugural addresson Monday in which he rattled off a list of his priorities—none of which will lower prices for Americans, as he promised to do. In his speech, Trump bragged about hisnarrowvictory, whined that he's been ""challenged more than any president in our 250-year history,"" and ultimately declared that God himself saved Trump so he could ""make America great again""—a totally humble thing to say. He then went on to list his priorities, most of which were either immigration-related or meaningless gestures meant to hurt vulnerable populations or make him feel macho. In fact, after the official speech was over, Trump spoke to an overflow crowd of his supporters—who were kept out of the Capitol Rotunda where the speech took place so that the cadre ofbillionaire tech brosTrump pals around with could get front-row seats—telling them that his advisers really wanted him to talk more about inflation, but he refused. ""How many times can you say an apple has doubled in cost?"" Trumpsaid,in a rambling speech in which he went on to complain about his 2024 victory again and said he would have won California if it were not for fraud—a complete lie. In any event, here are the promises Trump made in his inaugural address that won't help your pocketbook and could actually make your finances worse: ""I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,"" Trump said, invoking the Nazi-esque language about immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border. Deploying troops to deal with immigrants at the border willcost taxpayers money, and likely won't make a difference as it islegalto seek asylum in the U.S. ""America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it,"" Trump declared. ""We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it."" Contrary to what Trump said, America is already producing a record amount of crude oil, and is currently the lead oil producer in the world for thesixth consecutive year. What's more, experts say his ""drill, baby, drill"" policy won't actually lower prices. ""This will likely have little to no impact on #gasprices or fuel prices in the short-term, as a President can de-regulate, but there is no direct action that can be issued requiring oil companies to raise production,"" Patrick De Haan, a gas prices expert,wrotein a post on X. ""I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,"" Trump said. ""For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues that will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources."" Of course, foreign countries do not pay tariffs. Companies in the United States that import goods pay the tariffs, and then they pass those added costs down to consumers, raising prices and causing inflation to soar. Hisnew tariff policywill be destructive to the economy, and your pocketbook. ""After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,"" Trump said. There's already a thing called the First Amendment that protects speech, so it's unlikely a toothless executive order will do anything more than give Trump a piece of paper to sign at hisbig boy desk. ""As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,"" Trump said. This declaration will literally do nothing to make your daily life better, and instead will only hurt transgender Americans, who are already at risk of beingtargets of violenceanddiscrimination. Trump wants to look macho by declaring he will unilaterally change the name of a major body of water. How will this help you, you ask? It won't. It's literally a meaningless gesture. It was such a dumb promise that Hillary Clinton was seen laughing out loud in the audience. ""We will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mt. McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs,"" Trump said. ""President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent."" Alaskans, where Denali is located,don't even want this, but that's not stopping Trump from using his Sharpie to sign an executive order to make him feel like he's accomplishing something. ""We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama's promise to us has been broken,"" Trump said. ""The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we're taking it back."" There's a lot to unpack here. First, American ships are being charged the same as other ships in the canal. And second,China is not operating the canal. Trump has been telling this lie for weeks, leading Panamanian President José Mulino todeclarepublicly, ""There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God. The world is free to visit the canal."" Trump eventhreatened to use military forceto take back the canal, which would violate Trump's other inaugural speech promise of not starting any wars. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pointed out that conflicting message after Trump's inaugural address. ""He pledged to be a president of peace and not start any new wars but also pledged to forcibly take another country's territory,"" Maddowsaid. ""And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars,"" Trump said, a line that really got co-President Elon Musk going. If this speech is any indication, the next four years are going to be so incredibly stupid. Just 1,461 days to go.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 22:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/20/2298007/-9-Trump-inauguration-promises-that-won-t-lower-the-price-of-your-eggs
DOGE makes its first cut as 'co-chair' Ramaswamy reportedly dumped,"Awkward entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamyalready appears to be outat the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, multiple media outletsreported, not even making it to Day 1 of the toothless advisory commission. According to CBS News, Ramaswamy is expected to depart the pretend department, after he pissed off Elon Musk, a fellow awkward rich dude who Donald Trumpjointly taskedwith leading the entity that's supposed to find ways to slash the federal budget. CBS News reported that Ramaswamy was lazy and hasn't been working on the project, leading to friction with Musk. ""Vivek has worn out his welcome,"" an unnamed ""person close to Trump""toldCBS. Rather than actually doing the work to find the $2 trillion in cuts to the budget that he and Musk promised to make, Ramaswamy has instead been trying to get himself a role as an elected official. He had reportedlywanted to be appointedto the Ohio Senate seat vacated by JD Vance, but the current Ohio governor snubbed him andchose someone else. Now, Ramaswamy has his sights set on Ohio's governorship, and could announce his candidacy for that by the end of the month, Fox Newsreported. There's nothing Ramaswamy—who ran a failed bid for president in 2024—likes more than losing elections, it seems. As for the future of DOGE, Musk has alreadyadmittedthat the commission, which is not a real department and has no actual power, likely won't even get to half of the $2 trillion in cuts he once promised. And the Washington Postreportedthat DOGE is expected to be sued by the public interest law firm National Security Counselors within minutes of Trump's swearing in. According to the Post's report: All in all, not a very auspicious start for the DOGE bros. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Musk and Ramaswamyhad said they would cut $2 billion from the budget. The number is actually $2 trillion.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 19:27:26,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/20/2297968/-DOGE-makes-its-first-cut-as-co-chair-Ramaswamy-reportedly-dumped
Meet the unlikely Democrats who could revive the weary party,"Democrats have a long four years ahead of them. Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential election loss finds the party in a wake of theories, finger-pointing, and hopeful ideas for how to reignite a fire in voters' bellies. Part of this quest starts with the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the effort to elect Democrats to positions at the federal, state, and local levels. In other words, the DNC amplifies the message of the Democratic Party as a whole. Following the resignation of DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, Democrats are seeking tofind a new leaderwho excels in areas where the party fell short. A main area in need of improvement: engaging disinterested or alreadyexhausted voters. On Tuesday night, the DNC chair candidatesmet with CHORUS, a teamof progressive online creators, for afirst-of-its-kind forumin an attempt to do just that—and according to the statistics, they succeeded. A real-time poll during the event showed that 85% of the people tuning into the livestream were watching a DNC forum for the first time The candidates vying for the chair position include:Wisconsin Democratic chair Ben Wikler; Minnesota party chair Ken Martin; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; 2022 Arkansas congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; self-help guru Marianne Williamson; New York state Sen. James Skoufis; and attorney Jason Paul. While most of these candidates might be unfamiliar to most Americans, the online creators who moderated the forum gave their collective millions of followers an opportunity to get to know them. As the chart above shows, a Civiqs poll of Democrats showed that 64% of respondents feel ""scared, depressed, or angry"" about ""the way things are going in the United States today."" Grappling with a growing number of weary and burnt-out voters following this last election cycle, the Democratic Party is looking toward creators as a way to inform, educate, and reengage the party base. Creator and political commentator Zack Kirk, known as theZacktiviston social media, told Daily Kos that he was shocked by how misinformed many people online are. ""I've been baffled and was blindsided by the lack of understanding [people have] around how government works,"" he told us. And as conservativeonline creators and podcastersrallied and enraged the right over the past four years, left-leaning creators such as Kirk realize more than ever the importance of educating and motivating their side's online community. This is where his own content comes in. Kirk—whose full-time job doesn't include politics and content creation—spends his free time thinking about how and where to best relate to his community. Identifying as someone who puts the ""well-being of people"" before politics, Kirk's style of delivering political news and commentary offers something that traditional media such as MSNBC typically does not: a solution. Instead of reporting on the doom and gloom of MAGA wins, Kirk intends to flip the narrative. ""[I will] continue to deliver information to my network, to my communities, that will give them ways of coping and surviving,"" he said, adding that he plans to ""uplift the stories that are being missed"" in the sea of Trump news. For those looking for reprieve and connection when scrolling on their phone, stories that aren't screaming of negative breaking news might serve as an avenue back into political engagement. Another benefit of these creator-led political discussions for the Democratic Party is the ability to highlight communities in America that may not always get air time in mainstream media. ""Raise your hand if you know who the 92% are,"" creator Elizabeth Booker-Houston asked the DNC chair candidates Tuesday night. The lawyer, professor, comedian, and content creator was referring to thepercentage of Black womenwho voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Notably, only one candidate raised their hand when asked the question. Telling the panel of candidates that ""Black women are exhausted"" and quipping that Baltimore is ""too Black and too scary for Republicans,"" Booker-Houston is but one example of a left-leaning creator who authentically appeals and relates to a base of Democratic voters sometimes viewed as forgotten. But as the countdown inches closer to Donald Trump's second inauguration, Democrats—and the DNC chair nominees—unanimously agree on one thing: The Democratic Party's approach isn't working anymore, and it's time to embrace new left-friendly media sources. If you ask Kirk, Democrats have their work cut out for them. ""We're at ground zero,"" he said. ""No one has emerged as a definitive voice of the Democratic Party or the resistance to what Trump is going to do. No one's giving a counter."" A vote for the new DNC chair is scheduled for Feb. 1, and while a front-runner hasn't emerged just yet, one thing is for sure—Democrats can't afford to ignore the power of influencers.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 00:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/19/2297155/-Meet-the-unlikely-Democrats-who-could-revive-the-weary-party
What migration to red states could mean for the Democratic Party,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a significantpopulation shifthas been underway, led chiefly by millennials and Gen Z Americans who aremovingfrom urban to rural areas. This could spell trouble for the Democratic Party, which has historically depended on voters in dense and progressive cities and states. As thepopulationsin states like California, New York, and Illinois decline, these once-solidly blue states could face an existential crisis as they are no longer the reliable powerhouses they once were. Meanwhile, conservative southern states like Texas and Florida are gaining new residents. This could dramatically shift the balance of political power, making blue states less competitive and red states more influential. According to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, if these migration patterns continue through the 2030 Census, California will lose four Congressional seats and New York will lose two. In total, states that went to Kamala Harris in 2024 could lose a dozen House seats and Electoral College votes, making the path for Democrats even more difficult. The concept ofcritical mass theoryis that collective political action requires a ""critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body."" It's no secret that rural areas tend to be red, while urban areas are typically blue. The migration trend, while unsettling for Democrats, isn't all bad news. If it continues, the party could have an opportunity to reshape these growing, historically conservative regions into states in play. But this won't happen overnight. First, Democrats might experience a significant loss of voters in blue states as people migrate to red states. Only after reaching a ""critical mass"" of voters in these conservative areas will Democrats have the chance to make an impact. However, parties can't base their fundraising and strategies on wait-and-sees. Right now, Democrats are looking at North Carolina and, yes, even Texas, where there was a close Senate race in 2024—with Colin Allred losing by less than a million votes to Ted Cruz—to build a platform on the economic issues that got Donald Trump his populist base. As time passes and migration patterns continue, baby boomers will give way to a new generation of rural voters who Democrats could sweep up. But it would be a mistake to ignore the issues that impact the majority of Americansnow, like student debt, sky-high housing prices, the climate crisis, and expensive health care. There are many reasons why people migrate. The pandemic caused aboom in remote workthat, combined withrising rental costsin cities, made it easier for people to relocate to more affordable rural areas. Trends like ""cottage core"" and ""trad wife"" that have become popular among millennials and Gen Z have idealized homesteads and rural living. Some might argue that the great migration is simply a result of anoverworked,exhausted, anddisillusionedgeneration of Americans whowant to quitthe rat race. Migration could also be due, in part, to the drastic changes in cities as a result of the pandemic. What was once a bustling nightlife scene has given way toshuttered small businesses, leading to a more solitary lifestyle. Similarly, as rents increase, young people are priced out of homeownership, and wages don't keep up, people are opting to live in places where they can get more for their money. Democrats haven't achieved a significant victory in the South since former PresidentJimmy Carterin the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the GOP staked out the long game, successfully implementingits southern strategyand winning all of those states in 2024. Even before its defeat in November, the Democratic Party recalibrated, adhering to its loss of the South and instead focusing on trying to win the Midwest's ""Blue Wall""—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. But as the electorate has shifted, it's no longer enough to win the White House without the support of some southern states. How will the party that is redlining itself reclaim rural voters, especially ones in the South who've gone devout MAGA? And will these migration trends solidify Democrats' decline in traditionally blue states, or will they become an opportunity to shift the political landscape in red states? The answers are still unknown, but how the Democratic Party adapts to these population changes will determine where it goes from here.",Daily Kos,2025-01-19 16:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/19/2297351/-What-migration-to-red-states-could-mean-for-the-Democratic-Party
Explaining the Right: The imaginary scourge of noncitizen voting,"Republicans in multiple states are pushing for federal legislation to address noncitizen voting, something they insist is an urgent matter requiring intervention at the highest levels of the government. But the problem does not really exist and is a smokescreen for rules, regulations, and practices that help Republicans win elections. Earlier this week, 12 of the state chairs for the right-wing State Freedom Caucus Networksent a letterto congressional leaders pushing for passage of the ""Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act."" The law, proposed by Republicans, purports to close loopholes allowing for noncitizen voting. ""The states continue to face the prospect of a huge population of noncitizens illegally voting in our elections and potentially affecting the outcome,"" the letter alleges. ""We must close the loopholes that put the integrity of our elections at risk. We need the SAVE Act to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections."" This isfalse. First, it'salready illegalfor noncitizens to vote in federal elections. If a noncitizen even registers to vote, they could face up to five years in prison. Ina studyconducted by the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, researchers could find only 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting in the 2016 election, comprising 0.0001% of votes that were cast in those jurisdictions. That number includes onlypotentialnoncitizen votes—notcases that have been investigated and determined to be ineligible. Not only is noncitizen votingextremely rare, it's also not coordinated by any groups in a way to systematically control the outcomes of elections. Additionally, civil rights groupshave calledthe SAVE Act ""unnecessary and dangerous,"" and said it ""is intended to elicit irrational fear of the growing number of citizens of color."" But the issue is just one of the latest ways Donald Trump and other Republican officialsarefearmongeringaround immigration. Similarly, right-wing media outlets, like Fox News and Newsmax, havemade storiesabout the purported problem a staple of their programming. Promoting these lies creates an environment where voter-suppression laws and regulations can thrive. When these rules are in place, eligible voters have then beenbarred from voting, and frequently when election turnout is low,that has favoredthe political fortunes of the Republican Party (but it is not the case in every election). Noncitizen voting is also a convenient boogeyman for the right.Conservative ideasand candidates are often unpopular, but instead of confronting this lack of appeal, the right can simply blame noncitizens—a population they demonize anyway—for their loss. Trumpdid this in 2017, when he falsely claimed that his popular-vote loss to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was the fault of undocumented immigrants. Campaigning against an imaginary wave of noncitizen voting serves many purposes for the right: It rallies supporters against migrants, it pushes laws that help Republicans, and it excuses Republican losses in elections. The core issue is made up, but the effects are unfortunately very real.",Daily Kos,2025-01-19 00:00:15,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297485/-Explaining-the-Right-The-imaginary-scourge-of-noncitizen-voting
Here’s the moment Mark Zuckerberg gave away the game,"Like the rest of the tech billionaire class, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided to give up any pretense of ethics in order to cozy up to President-elect Donald Trump. ZuckerbergkilledMeta's fact checking andendedall of the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. In order to do some damage control—and to audition for the Trump administration's favor—Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan's podcast, which has become a forum for billionaires to act aggrieved as theytake control of the country. When Rogan asked Zuckerberg to elaborate on how he has become a victim of a politicized government, Zuckerberg rambled on. ""So we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like I think like the CFPB like, this, financial—I don't even know what it stands for. It's the ... it's the financial organization that Elizabeth Warren had set up. And, and it's basically, it's like, we're not a bank,"" he said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which started under theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, has beeninvestigating Metaover allegations that it misuses private data for financial gain. The idea that Zuckerberg doesn't know what the CFPB is or that it doesn't exclusively involve banks (having alsoinvestigatedApple, Amazon, Google, etc.) is incredibly disingenuous. He's either so outrageously dumb that shareholders must force him to leave the business, or he's lying on Rogan's show for a reason. ""They kind of found some theory they wanted to investigate. And it's like, okay, clearly they were trying really hard, right? To like, to like, find, find some theory, but it, like, I don't know. It just, it kind of, like, throughout the, the, the, the, the party and the government, there was just sort of, I don't know if it's, I don't know how this stuff works. I mean, I've never been in government,"" Zuckerberg told Rogan. Is the CEO of Meta talking about the CFPB's investigation? Or maybe he's talking about theupcoming anti-trust trialbetween Meta and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Since Trump's first term, Meta has been fighting to keep anti-trust laws from breaking up its control of Facebook and Instagram. Outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khantold CNBCthat she wasn't surprised companies like Meta are trying to ""get some type of sweetheart deal"" from the incoming Trump administration. While on Rogan's podcast, Zuckerberg cravenly appealed to the insecure and aggrieved male audience,telling Roganthat the ""corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,"" before arguing that ""masculine energy"" was lacking in the workforce today. ""It's one thing to say we want to be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it's another to basically say that 'masculinity is bad,'"" he said. According toThe New York Times, the ever-masculine Zuckerberg followed that up a few days later by throwing his former COO Sheryl Sandberg under the bus for Meta's previous DEI policies. Zuckerberg has secured hisspecial VIP seatat Trump's inauguration, along with fellow oligarchs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Now he just needs all of those pesky consumer protection watchdogs to go away.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 18:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297478/-Here-s-the-moment-Mark-Zuckerberg-gave-away-the-game
Trump and his goons are already bailing on mass deportation pledge,"Donald Trump's 2024 campaign emphasized two key promises far and beyond any others: to lower grocery costs—and inflation overall—and to enforce mass deportations of scary brown and Black immigrants (even those who are in the country legally). Already, Trump hasshrugged his shouldersat the first promise, saying there's little he can actually do to lower prices. ""Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,"" he said. Now Trump's ""Border Czar"" Tom Homan is also walking back his mass deportation promise. CNNreportedearlier this week that Homan has been privately telling Republican lawmakers that deporting millions of immigrants might be a tad ... impossible. ""We are not having a discussion about 20 million [deportations],"" Rep. Darrell Issa, Republican of California, told CNN. ""We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation."" The expectation, of course, is that the federal government has nowhere near enough manpower or funding to expel that many immigrants. In fact, the American Immigration Councilhas estimatedthat it would cost nearly $1 trillion (with a ""t"") to deport that many undocumented immigrants over a decade. Suffice it to say, this government isn't scaring up an extra $88 billion this year to get the ball rolling. Democrats might not even need the filibuster to stop such a monstrosity in the Senate. As I'vewritten before, the reality is that mass deportations only work with the assistance of local and state law enforcement. The U.S. Border Patrol only has 20,000 agents, 17,000 of whom patrol the border (that isn't about to stop, is it?). And as the CNN article cites, Homan said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has only 6,000 officers—not nearly enough to deport millions of people. As Trump's former Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgansaid in an interview with Stateline, ""It's not going to be successful, as long as we have sanctuary cities and states that refuse to allow local and state police departments to work with ICE."" That's all well and good in places like Texas and Florida, where 6.4% and 5% of the population is undocumented, respectively. While local authorities might love to help the feds raid cities like Houston, Dallas, and Orlando, there are still millions of undocumented immigrants in sanctuary states like California, Illinois, and New York. So while Trump could achieve some small-scale deportations, he doesn't have the resources for high-profile raids. Even in rural America, where farmers depend on the labor of undocumented immigrants, local politicians and industry groups (all Republicans, mind you) aresounding the alarm, warning of economic devastation if the feds—with or without local help—move in. So what is Trump to make of this? Xenophobia has been a key pillar in Trump's reelection, and his party has gleefully followed along. But this is also the same party that pretends (sometimes) to care about budget deficits and the national debt, which would explode with an additional $1 trillion in expenses. While most Republicans don't care about such things when they are in power, the razor-thin GOP margin in the House means it wouldn't take many of them to derail these efforts. And those aren't the only costs to deportation. ""It will cost a lot to deport. But guess what? It will also save a lot. And it'll be a net benefit,"" hard-right xenophobic Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona told CNN. There is a false yet religiously held belief in right-wing circles that undocumented immigrants are costing good, hardworking Americans billions in tax dollars. The reality is the exact opposite: Those immigrants pay payroll and income taxes on their earnings, yet they're ineligible for most public programs. ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2 to 6.8 percent,"" according to the American Immigration Council. ""It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare."" That's a one-way flow of money, with none of it coming back to undocumented workers. So what exactly are these ""savings"" that Biggs is talking about? I looked hard, and the best I could find isstuff like thisfrom Fox News: ""President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan will be a 'cost savings' for the American people, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, responding to a warning from the Wall Street Journal that carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in history could bear a hefty price tag. [The Biden administration] is paying for free airline tickets around the country, free hotel rooms at $500 bucks a night, free education, free medical care, and that's in perpetuity."" Note that they can't find math to support their theory that undocumented immigrants are costing taxpayers money, just that theenforcementof immigration laws is costing money. Well, that won't change no matter how many people are deported—people who, by the way,aren'tbeing given ""free airline tickets around the country"" or staying in any ""free hotel rooms."" So what now? Republicans hope that tough anti-immigration rhetoric leads to ""self-deportation,"" but the existence of sanctuary states complicates things. If anything, internal migration from hostile states like Texas and Florida to sanctuary states like California and Illinois is far more likely. Meanwhile, the demand for labor will be off the charts as thecharred toxic remainsof more than 10,000 homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and other structures in Los Angeles are cleaned up and rebuilt. The potential flow of immigrants from red states to blue ones won't just help the economies of those welcoming them with open arms, but it would also decimate local economies in hostile red states, driving up the costs of food, hospitality, and construction—among other things. Expelling or driving out millions of their residents could also alter thedemographicsthat have allowed Florida and Texas to gain up to eight congressional seats at the expense of mostly blue states. That might not be such a bad outcome after all.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 16:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297143/-Trump-and-his-goons-are-already-bailing-on-mass-deportation-pledge
Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of ""law and order,"" one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump's pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost ""patriots"" and ""hostages"" in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump's actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio's caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump's action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading ""Camp Auschwitz,"" referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump's action. ""One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,"" Gonelltold HuffPost. ""It's a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It's a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again."" Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, ""This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump's pardons,writing, ""President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists."" One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that ""these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose."" The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.'s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""I don't think it's causing much controversy."" She later added, ""President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system."" Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 15:01:24,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298174/-Law-and-order-Trump-slammed-for-freeing-terrorists-and-Nazi-sympathizers
Trump's tiny inauguration is making MAGA morons lose their minds,"Donald TrumpannouncedFriday that his inaugurationwill be held indoorsdue to harsh weather concerns. Now, instead of hundreds of thousands of Trump voters gathering at the U.S. Capitol to watch their president begin his second term, they'll instead be ushered to the Capital One Arena about a mile away where they can watch from ... a jumbotron. ""We made all of the plans and all of the arrangements to come up and be a part of this event, and ... it's kind of a bummer,"" Jose Granado toldNBC News. We might as well stay at home and watch it on TV. I'm kind of disappointed, to be honest with you,"" Ken Robinson, who traveled from Oklahoma with his family, said. ""We came here to watch it in person. We don't really care to watch it on a jumbotron."" Traveling to watch the swearing in isn't cheap. Hotel rates around Washington, D.C., are around $500 per night the weekend leading up to Trump's inauguration. However, the Trump administration is handing out its condolences to supporters by allowing them to hold onto their now ""commemorative"" tickets. But it isn't just average MAGA supporters getting the short end of the stick. Some of Trump's wealthy donors have reportedly been cut from the in-person ceremony, given the limited number of seats in the rotunda. Instead, as The New York Times reporter Teddy Schleiferwrote, some of Trump's donors will be escorted to a suite at the Capitol One Arena. Of course, Trump's tech sugar daddies and burgeoningoligarchyhaveVIP seatingfor the inauguration, and all it took wasseveral millionsdonated to the convicted felon's inaugural fund. Looks like Trump's inauguration is only available for in-person viewing if you're a part of the White House or wealthy enough tobuy your way in. But it isn't just his everyday supporters who are taken aback by the news. Even MAGA talking heads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia questioned the decision. ""I have personally attended countless rallies where President Trump spoke in extreme weather conditions from cold to rain to heat,"" shewrote on X. ""Is there a security threat other than extreme cold temperatures? Not only for him but for the people?"" Even MAGA conspiracy loon Glenn Beck had his theories about why Trump made the call to move everything indoors. ""These guys are under such threat. This is 'Jason Bourne' stuff,"" hesaid. Beck went on to imply that, due to Trump's shakedown of the ""power structure"" of government, conditions during the inauguration might not be safe for him. It's unclear if he is implying that members of the U.S. government would target Trump. Trump's last-minute decision means thatmonths of security planninghave been scrapped. Instead, the Secret Service and other security officials have three days to prepare for the new plan. The last president to be sworn in indoors was Ronald Reagan, when temperatures dipped down to 7 degrees in 1985. But you'd think MAGA supporters would be prepared for D.C.'s January weather, given that many of themmade the tripfour years ago.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 01:01:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297520/-Trump-s-tiny-inauguration-is-making-MAGA-morons-lose-their-minds
Democrats demand tech bros explain cash being tossed at Trump,"Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado sentlettersto tech company CEOs at OpenAI, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Uber about their or their companies' million-dollar donations to Donald Trump's inaugural fund. In each letter, the senators remind the tech giants that their generous donations come at a suspicious time as their industry has ""come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition."" ""We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,"" the letter reads. Some of those big-money donations come from people like Amazon's Jeff Bezos, whose companyreportedly donated at least $1 millionto Trump's inauguration. But as Warren and Bennet explained in theletterto the Amazon CEO, his company ""is the subject of multiple ongoing regulatory actions, including multiple Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suits related to anticonsumer and anticompetitive practices, a Department of Justice (DOJ)."" Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi donated acombined $2 millionto Trump's inaugural fund. ""The company is the subject of an ongoing FTC investigation for predatory practices,"" Warren and Bennet wrote in their letter to him, referring to the recentinvestigationinto the ride-hailing company's subscription and cancelation policies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmandonated$1 million to Trump. And the senators' letter to him details how his company is under both an FTC investigation concerning itsconsumer practicesas well asone from the Securities and Exchange Commissionconcerning its investors. Googledonated $1 millionto Trump's fund, and CEO Sundar Pichai was reminded by Warren and Bennet that the search giant ""was found by a federal court to have an illegal monopoly over the online search market."" Google haspromised to appeal the ruling, and it will be up to Trump's Department of Justice to decide whether to contest its appeal. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gotits $1 million in early—after limiting political news on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2024 election. All this clearly seems done in order to ingratiate Zuckerberg and his company to Trump. Meta is facing aFTC antitrust lawsuit in April. According toDemocracy Now, Trump's inauguration committee has raised upward of $250 million. To put into perspective, before Trump's inaugural committee raised more than $100 million during his first go-round, the largest amount of money ever spent on an inauguration was President Barack Obama, who reportedly raised $50 million. Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the consumer-rights group Public Citizen, reports that much of that money has been donated by billionaires, such as the tech CEOs whom Warren and Bennet sent the letters to. Many of the CEOs who received letters from the senators areexpected to attend Trump's inaugurationon Monday, and have beengiven VIP status for the day. And it cost them only a drop in their buckets.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 00:00:16,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297500/-Democrats-demand-tech-bros-explain-cash-being-tossed-at-Trump
Trump’s family wastes no time profiting off of Daddy's second term,"Albania has given preliminary approval to Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a$1.4 billionluxury hotel complexon an abandoned military base. The deal raises eyebrows, given Trump will oversee foreign policy for Albania and has atrack recordofseeking revengewhen people or businesses don't do what he wants. The hotel will be built on a 111-acre section of the 2.2-square-mile island of Sazan, which can be reached by ferry from Albania's mainland. Ivanka Trump—who hassworn off politics—is apparently also working on the project. ""The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest in investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,"" a spokesman for Albania Prime Minister Edi Rama told The New York Times last year. Kushner's private equity company, Affinity Partners, was also given preliminary approval for a luxury hotel complex in Serbia, another country with vested interest in U.S. relations. While the Albanian government insists that its only motive behind approving the hotel is tourism, Albania and Serbia both havepending foreign policy matterswith the United States as theyattempt to jointhe European Union. The United States also has a vested interest inbolstering its relationshipwith Serbia to sway the country from supporting Russia. Kushner started Affinity Partners after he left hiscontroversial White House roleduring Trump's first term, during which he established relationships with the Middle East and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who provided Kushner's firm $2 billion from a sovereign wealth fund. Kushner's hotel venture is just one example of questionable business deals circling Trump's family leading up to his inauguration. Trump's real estate company met last week to discussreclaimingits former Washington, D.C., hotel, which has been owned by Hilton since the Trump family sold the lease rights in 2022 for $375 million. During Trump's first term, Democrats claimed that his financial stake violated a constitutional provision known as theForeign Emoluments Clause. Should the family buy back the hotel, this would revive concerns. The perks rolling in for Trump's family are hardly shocking considering his first term. For example, in 2018, Chinagranted 18 trademarksto companies tied to Ivanka and her father over a two-month span. Sixteen of those went to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, raising her total of trademarks in China at the time to 34 for products such as handbags and sunglasses. Trump's other children have alsobenefited immenselyfrom business,real-estatedeals, and other ventures since 2016.

Trump-loving tech bro reportedly set to run for Ohio governor,"Failed Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to run for governor of Ohio. The news comes shortly after he attacked American culture for purportedly celebrating ""mediocrity."" The Washington Post reportsthat multiple sources close to Ramaswamy say an announcement is soon to come and that the statement ""is drafted."" Ramaswamy was a candidate for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2024 but attracted very little support. Hereceived only 0.4% of the votein the primaries and was awarded just three delegates (of the1,215 needed to win the nomination). By contrast, Donald Trump received 76% of the vote and over 2,000 delegates on his way to securing the nomination. Despite a reported behind-the-scenes push from Trump, Ramaswamywas passed overby Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who announced that Lt. Gov Jon Husted would be appointed to the Senate vacancy created bynow-formerSen. JD Vance, who was elected vice president. Currently, Ramaswamyis set to co-chairthe proposed Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk, an essentially powerless advisory commission created by Donald Trump. The two billionaires will purportedly use the group tocut government spendingonsocial programswhile also advocating for tax cuts for the wealthy. After being tapped to co-lead DOGE, Ramaswamy made his most recent controversial remarks. In December, Muskdefendedthe use of H-1B visas to bring in skilled immigrant labor, a practice that many anti-immigrant Republicans oppose, when Ramaswamy weighed in. ""Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,""he wrote. ""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers."" Ramaswamy went on to cite the media portrayal of several nerdy characters on 1990s sitcoms as evidence of his claim. The comments provoked the ire of many, including fellow failed Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley,who wrotein response, ""There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture."" When he isn't calling American culture mediocre, Ramaswamy has been afrequent promoterof debunked conspiracy theories. He claimed that the federal government was involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and called it an ""inside job."" Ramaswamy also alleged that the 2020 election wasstolen by ""big tech,""and theorized that the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged to help President Joe Biden win that year's presidential election. On policy matters, Ramaswamy previouslyexpressed supportfor former President George W. Bush'sfailed planto privatize Social Security. Even if Ramaswamy officially announces his gubernatorial run and receives the backing of MAGA-aligned voters, it is not a sure thing that he will secure the nomination, let alone win. In 2022, Trump-backing candidate Jim Renacciran againstDeWine but failed to unseat the incumbent governor, who was then reelected. Additionally, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost,an election denier, is alsorunning. Ohio has been a reliable state for Republicans, but it is unclear if they will back a gubernatorial candidate with such a negative take on the American work ethic.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 22:00:20,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297474/-Trump-loving-tech-bro-reportedly-set-to-run-for-Ohio-governor
Dog killer Noem pushes immigration and wildfire lies at Senate hearing,"Dog-killingSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem fearmongered about the threat immigrants pose to the United States and lied about the California wildfires during the confirmation hearing for hernominationto lead the Department of Homeland Security Friday. As head of DHS, Noem would be in charge of Customs and Border Patrol and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps respond to natural and manmade disasters. Her answers about how she would handle both of those areas should scare everyone. During the hearing, Noem lied that the U.S. border is ""open,"" andclaimedthat ""the No. 1 threat to our homeland security is the southern border."" Of course, the border is obviously not open. In fact, border crossings havedramatically declinedin recent months, achieving similar levels as those during Donald Trump's first term. What's more, the head of the FBI has actuallysaidthat homegrown extremists are the biggest terror threat, and thatChina's cyber programand its impact on U.S. infrastructure is a bigger danger to the United States than immigrants crossing the border. Aside from fearmongering about immigrants, Noem alsorefused to saywhether she'd withhold disaster relief if Trump asked her to—a relevant question as Trump and Republicans have said California should not receive financial assistance to help recover from the devastating fires. ""If President Trump were to say to you, 'We're going to withhold money from Connecticut or Michigan or any of the states, Iowa, because we don't like the governor or we don't like the politics of the state,' you would stand up to him and say, 'Mr. President, we need to allocate that money'?"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked Noem. She refused to respond, saying that she couldn't answer a hypothetical question. But it's not hypothetical, since Trumptried to do just thatduring his first term, when California was reeling from another wave of devastating wildfires. As Politicoreportedin October: ""I assume you agree, withholding disaster relief is a violation of duty and law,"" Blumenthal pressed Noam. ""Leadership has consequences,"" she said in a chilling response. Noem went on to lie about the response to California's wildfires, claiming that somehow Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is responsible for the devastating impacts of this natural disaster—echoing the baseless claims ofTrumpand other Republicans. ""I wish we would have had different leadership or a different governor in California,"" Noemsaid. However,firefighters saythat humanscould nothave stopped the fires that ravaged the state. ""Wildfires like this, driven by 70 to 100 mph winds, couldn't be 'put out' if every firefighter in the West were in Los Angeles,"" retired firefighter Riva Duncanwrotein an op-ed for MSNBC.

"Biden shows support for ERA, but does that actually mean anything?","President Joe BidenannouncedFriday that Americans should consider theEqual Rights Amendmentto be ""the law of the land."" However, the last-minute effort to enshrine the 28th Amendment into the Constitution is unlikely to actually go anywhere due to its legal hurdles. ""It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people,"" the White House statement said. ""In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex."" The amendment would need to be formally signed and certified by National Archivist Colleen Shogan in order to become law. According toNPR, supporters of the ERA are expected to protest in front of the National Archives office, urging Shogan's signature. She has previously stated that she will follow the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, which suggests that the courts or Congress must decide the amendment's fate. To lift the1982 deadlinefor ratification, Shogan said that further action is needed—with Republicans now controlling all three branches of government, prospects for that seem bleak. Supporters of the ERA, however, believe that the amendment should have become law of the land after Virginia ratified it, making it three-fourths of states to pass it. Because of the obscurity of how to proceed, the amendment is expected to either face a long legal battle or to simply die at the hands of a GOP-led Congress. A senior Biden administration official told CNN that the president is not taking executive action but is ""stating an opinion that it is ratified,"" which was one crucial hurdle Shogan said needed to be cleared before signing it. ""He is using his power of the presidency to make it clear that he believes—and he agrees with leading constitutional scholars and the American Bar Association—not that it should be, but it is the 28th Amendment of the Constitution,"" the official said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a leader in the ERA movement,posted on XFriday in support of ratification. ""President Biden's official notice to the nation today follows clearly established precedent dating back to President Adams in 1798. The ERA is a valid part of our Constitution,"" she said. If the ERA is signed by Shogan, it would enshrine protections for women and trans people who will be vulnerable during Donald Trump's second term. But for now, the odds of it moving forward seem slim.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 19:30:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297447/-Biden-shows-support-for-ERA-but-does-that-actually-mean-anything
Trump inauguration will be too frigid even for that coldhearted man,"Afraid of a little cold weather, Donald Trump will break with years of tradition tomove his inauguration ceremony indoors. He will deliver his address inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda before joining supporters at the nearby Capital One Arena. ""There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!),"" Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social. Apparently, now he cares about the safety of law enforcement at the Capitol, unlikefour years ago, when he allowed those law enforcement officers to be brutally beaten by his supporters who were, at his behest, trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory. Trump's swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for12 PM ET on Monday, when the temperature in Washington, D.C., is expected to be22 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with the wind chill around 8 degrees. That puts it close to the28 degree temperature and mid-teens wind chill during Barack Obama's first inauguration, in 2009, according to historical data from the National Weather Service. And Obama didn't chicken out and move the ceremony inside. Trump continued, ""This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!"" What's more, in 1961 when John F. Kennedy was sworn in, it snowed 8 inches and was also 22 degrees at 12 PM ET. Yet JFK still held his inauguration outside, withnearly 1 million peoplebraving those sub-freezing temperatures to watch his swearing-in. In fact, the last time an inauguration was held indoors was 1985, when the National Weather Service says temperatures in the District of Columbia were 7 degrees, with the wind child going as low as 20 below zero—far colder than what's expected on Trump's Inauguration Day. Holding the event indoors will make it so that Trump won't get to look out at a crowd of supporters as he delivers his inaugural address, which will probably be insanely dark and xenophobic. But maybe Trump prefers an indoor ceremony. After all, he can use it and the temperature as an excuse for why a paltry number of supporters show up. Trump is infamously obsessed with crowd sizes. He often lies about the number of people who attend his campaign rallies to say that more people showed up than actually did. And no one can forget the rage he felt when his 2017 inaugural crowd wassignificantly smallerthan Obama's in 2009. He was so mad heforcedthe National Park Service to provide images that made his crowd look as big as the ones Obama had. Ultimately, moving the inauguration inside is a real chicken move.

CNN reportedly hiding anchor who dares to call out Trump’s BS,"CNN reportedly plans to move anchor Jim Acosta, who has frequently fact checked and challenged Donald Trump's falsehoods, to a time slot with almost no viewers. As Status Newsreported, CNN's CEO Mark Thompson proposed that ""CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta"" be moved from the 10 AM ET time slot to midnight. ""They want to get rid of Acosta to throw a bone to Trump,"" a media executive told Status. ""Midnight is not a serious offer when his ratings are among the best on the network."" If CNN goes through with this plan, it will effectively sideline someone who has provided accurate reporting on the leader of the Republican Party.

Trump has a long history of expressing contempt for Acosta, who was CNN's White House correspondent for much of Trump's first term, tasked with debunking Trump and his team. In a 2018 exchange, Acosta asked Trump about his claim that a migrant caravan from Mexico was an ""invasion,"" noting that the characterization was false. Trump responded by calling Acosta a ""rude, terrible person."" Trump supportershave echoedthis hostility. During a 2018 Trump rally, a crowd surrounded the reporter and yelled at him. Trump later shared video of the incident on his social media account. At the peak of the conflict between Acosta and Trump in 2018, the first Trump administrationpulledthe reporter's media credentials andmade up a false storyalleging that he put his hands on an intern. A federal judge later ordered for Acosta's pass to be restored. Back then, CNN had Acosta's back. But now, the network appears to be joining a chorus of corporate media—including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times—who arebending to Trump's will.

Chaos among GOP lawmakers threatens Trump's agenda—already,"Yes, Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated for a second time, but we can take solace in the fact that his agenda is already on the rocks. Republican leaders in the House and Senatestillcan't agree on how to move forward with legislation to make good on Trump's promises. More than two months after Republicans won both chambers of Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are continuing to fight over whether to put Trump's destructive tax cuts for the rich and mass deportation agendain the same bill, or to split it into two. ""Right now, that teamwork isn't happening. Not by a long shot,"" Politicosaidof Johnson and Thune's relationship. If Republicans can't even agree on how to move forward, forget about how difficult it will be to select the budget cuts Republicans will need to make to pass the legislation. That's because Republicans want to accomplish Trump's agenda using budget reconciliation, which will allow them to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass the bill(s) with a simple majority—i.e., just Republican votes. Butbudget reconciliation has strict limitsaround how much legislation can affect the national debt. And it will require Republicans to make cuts from other programs to fund the tax cuts and deportations. And getting Republicans to agree on what to cut from the budget will be harder than herding feral cats. Theywon't be able to lose a single votein the House, given Republicans' extremely narrow majority. Among the cuts Republicans arefloatinginclude slashing subsidies middle-class Americans to purchase Affordable Care Act plans, cutting food assistance for the poorest Americans, and making cuts to Medicaid. Good luck getting every single House Republican—including vulnerable members in swing seats—to vote for cuts like that. Even worse for Johnson is his political capital is already waning in his caucus, which will make it harder for him to twist arms and get his lawmakers to vote for whatever awful legislation ultimately emerges. That's because Johnson pissed off many Republican lawmakers when he cowed to Trump andremovedpro-Ukraine Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. One unnamed House Republican told Fox News' Chad Pergram that Turner may not vote for things Johnson wants to pass as a result of his ouster. ""Mike's never going to vote for another fucking thing around here again,"" the unnamed House Republicansaid. ""He's mad."" What's more, as GOP leadership quarrels about whether to put Trump's agenda into one bill or two, Republicans are fighting over how to make the destructive legislation revenue neutral. Senate Republicans are rejecting a revenue generating proposal from House conservatives to raise the corporate tax rate, The Hillreported. ""Absolutely not,"" Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told The Hill, regarding that idea. Meanwhile, Democrats are watching with amusement as Republicans flail.

TikTok announces pro-Trump bash just as Supreme Court upholds ban,"TikTok has joinedthe paradeof tech companies lavishing money on the incoming Trump administration—though only TikTok faces exile from the American market on Sunday. The video social media platformwill sponsora pre-inauguration party for Donald Trump on Sunday that the company's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will reportedly attend. Pro-Trump influencers who used TikTok to promote him during the recent presidential campaign will be honored. The event is scheduled on the same day a recently passed law requires TikTok to be spun off from its Chinese owners or shut down U.S. operations—a lawupheld by the Supreme Courtin a rareunanimous opinionreleasedFriday. An official with the outgoing Biden administrationtold the Associated Pressthat the law will not be enforced in the time between taking effect Sunday and Trump's inauguration on Monday. This effectively leaves the fate of TikTok in Trump's hands, and his advisors have indicated that they also will not enforce the legislation. Legislation targeting the operations of a single company is extremely unusual behavior for the government. Yet the bill calling for the company's sale had bipartisan support in Congress, and President Joe Bidensigned it into lawon April 23. The law did not successfully pressure the Chinese government to sever connections to TikTok or parent company ByteDance, andover 170 million Americanscontinue to usethe service millions of times per day. Now, both Democrats and Republicanshave apparently changedtheir positions and are wrangling behind the scenes to give the company behind the wildly popular app a reprieve. While his new stancealigns with public opinion, Trump's about-face on TikTok is particularly notable since he was the first at the executive level to pursue government action against the company. In 2020,he issuedan executive order that required ByteDance to spin off the video service. In the order, Trump alleged there was ""credible evidence"" that TikTok ""might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."" It's likely not a coincidence that the order came at the height of Trump's reelection campaign and thatvideos mocking himwere popular on TikTok. Trumphas often pushedfor media critical of him to be silenced or shut down. Yet when his campaign finally opened an account on the platform and quickly amassed millions of followers, Trump's ""full flop"" on the platform—wherehe proudly braggedthat he was ""a big star""—took root. Following Trump's successful 2024 campaign, Facebook's parent companyMeta said they wouldget rid of fact checkers and follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk's X in allowing disinformation and bigoted content to circulate unchecked. With their sponsorship of the pro-Trump party, TikTok may be signaling they are also moving towards looking the other way in the face of more disinformation. ""Big Tech"" joining the Trump coalition—and being welcomed by Republicans—is a reversal from years and years ofthe right claiming(without evidence) that their voices were being silenced in new media. Nowadays, they are happy to take Big Tech's money and bend the laws in their favor—or in TikTok's case, pretend they don't exist.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 15:30:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297412/-TikTok-announces-pro-Trump-bash-just-as-Supreme-Court-upholds-ban
Democrats prepare to fight Trump’s Day 1 executive orders in the courts,"While Joe Biden's presidency comes to an end on Monday, Democrats aren't stepping down from the fight just yet, as they prepare to battle Donald Trump through the court system. The Democracy Forward Foundation, a prominent progressive legal group,announcedThursday that it will push back against Trump's dangerous agenda by targeting his executive orders, of which he haspromisedmore than 100 on ""day one."" Among Trump's potential executive orders is a ""shock and awe"" strategy ofmass deportations. ""We're confident this center will be a critical resource for opposing dangerous policies in Project 2025 and other harmful and unlawful conduct,"" Democracy Forward President and CEO SkyePerrymansaid in a statement. Launched in 2017, Democracy Forward is ramping up its four-year plan beginning on Inauguration Day. According to the report, it has already identified 200 potential executive orders that it will fight in the legal system as soon as Trump signs them into law. ""During his first term, Trump's executive orders made health care less accessible, banned travel based on the predominant religion in certain countries, and made it easier for corporations to pollute our communities,"" Perryman said. ""This time, the Trump-Vance administration is better organized, has four years of previous experience, and can rely on the policy and staffing infrastructure of Project 2025."" Biden administration officials will be joining Democracy Forward as senior counselors, including Karianne Jones, former litigation counsel for the Kamala Harris campaign; Mike Martinez, deputy general counsel at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; Dan McGrath, senior counsel at the Department of Labor; and Kevin Friedl, outgoing senior counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additionally, Department of Justice Executive Secretary Emily Ross will join Democratic Forward as deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Perryman. This is in line with what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumertold POLITICOin December about how Democrats plan to use the courts to combat Trump during his second term. ""I don't know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judiciary will be one of our strongest—if not our strongest—barrier[s] against what he does,"" he said. Democracy Forward will not only challenge the policies that Trump implements, but it will also aim to setlegal precedentsthat will limit the president's unchecked power in the long term.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 14:30:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297266/-Democrats-prepare-to-fight-Trump-s-Day-1-executive-orders-in-the-courts
Infamous Jew-hating racist Mel Gibson gets 'special' job from Trump,"Donald Trump is appointing three washed-up actors to serve as ""special ambassadors"" to Hollywood, including the notoriously racist and antisemitic Mel Gibson. ""It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,"" Trumpwrotein a Thursday post on Truth Social. ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!"" Choosing Gibson to serve as whateverthisis ... is certainly a choice. In 2004, Gibson's movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" waspanned as antisemiticfor depicting Jews as responsible for Jesus' crucifixion. Then in 2006, Gibsonwent on an antisemitic tiradeduring a drunk driving arrest in Los Angeles. According to a police report, ""Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about 'fucking Jews'. Gibson yelled out: 'The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Gibson then asked: 'Are you a Jew?'"" Gibson laterapologized, saying, ""I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith."" But as the saying goes:in vino veritas. Then in 2010,audio tapes were releasedin which Gibson was heard verbally abusingOksana Grigorieva,his then-girlfriend and the mother of one of his children. ""You look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of [N-words], it will be your fault,"" he screamed at her. Gibson also threatened her, saying on tape, ""I am going to come and burn the fucking house down ... but you will blow me first."" That Trump would choose someone so vile to serve his administration in any capacity at all is despicable. But it's also random. Maybe Trump thought of the ""Mad Max"" for this ridiculous made-up role because he saw Gibson's Jan. 10 appearance on Fox News, where he spread paranoid theories about the raging wildfires in Southern California. ""I can make all kinds of horrible theories up in my head, conspiracy theories and everything else,"" Gibson told fellow bigot Laura Ingraham. ""But it just seemed a little convenient that there was no water, and that the wind conditions were right and that there were people ready and willing and able to start fires, and are they commissioned to do so or are they just acting on their own volition?"" Gibson also appeared on podcast bro Joe Rogan's show, where heclaimedto know people with Stage 4 cancer who were cured after taking ivermectin, the horse deworming pill COVID deniers are bizarrely obsessed with.Ivermectin does not cure cancer. In a karmic twist, Gibson later revealed thathis Malibu home was burning downwhile he was yakking it up with Rogan in Texas. As for the other two men Trump appointed as ""special"" ambassadors, Voight is a vocal right-winger who haslong backed Trumpand bizarrelycalled for President Joe Biden's impeachment. And Stallone has also emerged as a MAGA minion, ridiculouslycomparingTrump to George Washington Appointing these three clowns to somehow tell Trump how to fix Hollywood feels more like the latest attack on California from thenotoriously fame-hungryincoming president. Trump has spent the past weekspreading disinformationabout the deadly wildfires that have ravaged homes and communities in the Los Angeles area. Even worse, Trump isthreatening to withhold recovery fundingfrom the state.

Even Republicans aren’t happy about House speaker’s latest cave to Trump,"House Republicansare disapprovingof House Speaker Mike Johnson'sdecisiontoremoveRep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, from his position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Many believe this move was motivated by Donald Trump's eagerness to install a MAGA loyalist in the position, since the president-elect has long sought to fill congressional seats with those willing to kiss the ring. Though Johnson denied external pressure, Turner believes otherwise. In a phone interview with CBS reporter and ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan, Turner said that Johnson told him, ""You're fired. There are concerns from Mar-a-Lago."" Johnsondeniedthis claim. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnson said on Wednesday. Now, Republicans are voicing their concerns about Johnson bending the knee to Trump. ""We all have questions and concerns ... This came out of nowhere,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, said. Crenshaw's comments reflect the uncertainty and frustration that Republicans feel about the pressure to either fall in line with Trump or risk being demoted. ""I'm not happy with the decision. I think the vast majority of us are not happy with the decision,"" an anonymous House Republican told Axios. Other Republicans, like Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, are concerned that Johnson's decision will be harmful to the party's unity. ""It divides the conference, and I don't think that's good,"" he said, adding that ""most of us agree"" with Turner on issues like Ukraine. Turner has been astaunch supporterof Ukraine in its war against Russia, often pushing back against GOP colleagues who spread Russian propaganda. His strong advocacy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine has earned him praise from moderate Republicans, but it has also made him a target among what is now an empowered MAGA faction in Congress. While it's still unclear how his second administration will cozy up to Vladimir Putin, Trump has suggested that heplans to speakwith the Russian strongman shortly after his inauguration. During his first term, Trump had aclose relationshipwith Putin, and he even sent him COVID-19 tests in 2020 while U.S. citizens reeled from the virus. And since leaving office, Trump has had numerous private phone calls with him. Trump's long-standingbromancewith Putin—along with reportedlyidolizingdictators—has sparked accusations that Trump is sympathetic to autocrats and even perhaps has a desire to become one himself. But even as U.S. national security hangs in the balance, it seems Trump's adoration of authoritarian regimes is still not enough to break the GOP's obedience to Dear Leader.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 00:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297298/-Even-Republicans-aren-t-happy-about-House-speaker-s-latest-cave-to-Trump
Trump treasury nominee slammed for opposing minimum wage increase,"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump's nominee to besecretary of treasury, is being criticized for opposing an increase of the federal minimum wage at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Bessent was being questioned by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who noted to Bessent that the federal minimum wage has not been increased fromits current rate of $7.25per hour since 2009. ""You don't think we should change the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour?"" Sanders asked. Bessent replied, ""No, sir."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus,quickly responded, writing, ""Wrong. Working people deserve a raise. Raise the minimum wage."" The last time that legislation was passed to raise the federal wage was the 2007 Fair Minimum Wage Act. Thatlaw incrementally increasedthe wage from $5.15 in 2007 to $7.25 in 2009, as Sanders stated. Since then, no laws have increased the federal minimum wage. In the meantime, due to inflation, the real value of the minimum wagehas gone down. According to a2019 studyby the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually increase wages for more than 33.5 million people across the country, including over 6 million people living in poverty. According to hisfinancial disclosures, Bessent, a hedge fund managerwho donatedto Trump's campaign, is a billionaire. That is the normamong the figureswhom Trump has nominated to serve in his Cabinet and who are among his closest advisors. The average publicly known net worth of Trump's team is $67.7 billion as of early December, compared to theroughly $1.06 million net worthof the average American family. Despite their extraordinary wealth, key Trump allies, like billionaire Elon Musk (the richest person in the world, worthover $427 billion),havepushed for cutsto the social safety net that millions rely on. These same people, and especially Trump, favor keeping in place tax cuts that disproportionately help billionaires and large corporations.

The settlement ended proceedings that saw thedirtbag former mayor'sFlorida condo, valued at $3.5 million, in jeopardy of being added to the assets Freeman and Moss could claim as a part of their compensation.

Another MAGA loyalist eyes Florida governor’s race,"Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida has shared with potential donors and political big-wigs in the state that he intends to run for governor, making him the second MAGA loyalist to consider throwing his hat in the ring. ""He was in town [Tallahassee] meeting with all the folks you need to meet with. He told them he is in,"" a source who met with Donalds toldNBC News. ""It's the steps any candidate takes as they prepare to run for governor."" Donalds reportedly made similar remarks at a GOP meeting in Orlando this past weekend, according to the outlet. NBC News said it spoke with five sources familiar with Donalds' thinking and upcoming plans. While there have long been rumors that the Florida representative is angling to replace Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, this is the biggest sign yet that the Trump loyalist will likely leave his plum congressional seat in an attempt to be the Sunshine State's next top executive. When asked for comment, Donalds didn't deny the rumors but told NBC News he's focused on ""helping President Trump pass his America First Agenda."" A spokesperson for Donalds did not immediately respond to Daily Kos' request for comment. Should Donalds run, he might face some intriguing competition. Disgraced former Rep. Matt Gaetzis also toyingwith whether to run for the gubernatorial seat. In a statement to NBC News, Gaetz reiterated that he and his wife are still considering his next steps. Notably, this is not the first sign of Donalds' increased interest in running for Florida's governorship. Earlier this month, hehiredone alum of President-elect Donald Trump's 2016 campaign: Fabrizio, Lee & Associates. This company is led by Tony Fabrizio, who was Trump's lead pollster during his first campaign for the White House and has conducted polling for MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. NBC News also reports that Donalds is working with Brad Herold, who served as an advisor to DeSantis during his 2018 run, among others who have long worked to help boost MAGA-type Republicans. Trump will almost certainly try to sway the fast-approaching GOP primary for Florida's governor race. Last year, at a high-dollar fundraiser in New York,Trump asked Donaldspoint-blank whether he was planning to succeed DeSantis, whom Trump has had a ratherstormy professional relationshipwith. And let's not forget, Trump's influence can mean a lot in this race. After all, Trump'sendorsement of DeSantisin 2018 helped propel his candidacy. DeSantiswon that year's Republican primarywith 57% of the vote; his closest competitor, Adam Putnam, the state's former agriculture commissioner, received 37%. There's no sign, either, that Trump's grip on the party is slipping. Any Republican hoping to succeed in Florida politics likely needs to kiss the ring and earn Trump's approval; at the very least, they need to avoid getting on his bad side. Donalds, who is 46, rose to prominence during the tea party movement. Hewas elected toFlorida's House of Representatives in 2016. Then, in 2020, he won a seat in the U.S. House, representing Florida's 19th Congressional District. In his relatively short time in Congress, Donalds has become a close ally of Trump's. He was among the group of Republicans whovoted to overturnthe 2020 election results after Trump lost to Joe Biden, andwas endorsed for the House speakershipby far-right lawmakers who refused to back then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid in early 2023. Last year,it was rumoredthat Trump might tap Donalds as a running mate. That's not to say Donalds is a shoo-in to be Florida's next governor, should he decide to run. Beyond Gaetz, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson could jump in the race. At one point, it looked like the race to replace DeSantis might attract more candidates, but the field has narrowed. State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis isrunning to replaceGaetz in Congress (with Trump's blessing, of course), and state Attorney General Ashley Moody has just beenappointedto fill the Senate seat that Marco Rubio will vacate if he is confirmed as Trump's secretary of state, as is expected. There's no timeline set for Donalds' next steps. While he could, of course, leave Washington, D.C., early to start his bid, concerns about Republicans' slim margins in the House make that tricky to navigate. As NBC News pointed out, Donalds may make his next move more clear following the conclusion of Florida's two scheduled special elections, one of which reveals who Gaetz's replacement will be. Both electionswill take placeon April 1.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 22:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297251/-Another-MAGA-loyalist-eyes-Florida-governor-s-race
Democrats have one weird trick to release the rest of Jack Smith's report,"In alettersent Thursday morning, House Judiciary Committee Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop federal charges against Donald Trump's co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. In so doing, Garland would remove the only barrier preventing the release of the second volume of Jack Smith'sreporton alleged crimes committed by Trump. ""The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith's report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records,"" the letter reads. ""It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public,"" it goes on to say. ""As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump's co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira."" Last week, the DOJ released the first half of the report, which focused on Trump's ""unprecedented criminal effort"" to steal the 2020 election. Garland noted that he would not release the second volume of Smith's investigation since Trump's co-defendants' cases are still active. ""To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors,"" House Democrats argue in the letter. ""[T]hose concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report."" One alternative, with somesupport in Congress, would be for President Joe Biden to take advantage of the Supreme Court's ruling on ""absolute immunity"" for ""official acts"" by releasing the report in the name of national security. Judge Aileen Cannonagreed to allowthe DOJ to release the first volume of Smith's investigation, and she has nowscheduled a court hearingFriday to consider Garland's plan to share the second volume with ""some lawmakers.""

Nancy Pelosi will skip Trump’s inauguration,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, will not attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed to Daily Kos. Pelosi is the second big-name Democrat to announce that they won't attend. Earlier this week, former first lady Michelle Obama saidshe also plans to skip the event, which will take place on Monday. Other Democratic lawmakers who will play hooky that day include Reps.Jasmine Crockettof Texas,Ilhan Omarof Minnesota, andAyanna Pressleyof Massachusetts. News of Pelosi's pending absence was first reported byABC News. Pelosi's spokesperson didn't elaborate on why she won't make the pilgrimage to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,this go-around. Her absence may be because Pelosi is stillrecovering from hip surgeryshe underwent in Germany following a fall in December. It's also possible that, like most Democrats,she just hates Trump. No one would blame her if that were the case. The two have long had a tumultuous professional relationship. Since Trump's first administration, their disdain for one another has seemingly only increased. Pelosi famously spent the final days of Trump's first term trying tooust him from the Oval Officeafter the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Trump, for his part, spent much of his first termavoiding Pelosi, even as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged states and lawmakers attempted to work together to deliver aid. Since then, Trump has called Pelosi ""crazy,"" ""crooked,"" ""evil,"" and ""sick,"" among other abhorrent things. In November, he nearly called her a bitch during a campaign rally, though he stopped himself from saying the word outright. ""She's a bad person, evil. She's an evil, sick, crazy—"" Trump said ata rally in Michiganamid his 2024 campaign, sounding out the letter ""B"" but stopping just short of uttering the obscenity. ""It starts with a 'B,' but I won't say it. I wanna say it."" Pelosi's inauguration absence marks a break in tradition for the octogenarian. In addition toattendingTrump's first inauguration, in 2017, ABC News reports that Pelosi has gone to 11 presidential inaugural events. Senior leaders of both parties typically attend presidential inaugurations, regardless of the incoming president's party. But Trump has no room to complain about Pelosi's absence: Hefamously skippedPresident Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021. In reality, Trump probably won't notice that Pelosi's gone. He'll be too busy trying to impress his trio of tech-bro sugar daddies—Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—who have beenrewarded with plum seatsat the inauguration. (All three men alsodonated at least $1 millionto Trump's inaugural fund.) Meanwhile, while they will attend Monday's inauguration, former presidents George W.

House Republicans take first step in mass deportation scheme,"Donald Trump's Deputy Policy Chief, Stephen Miller,met Wednesday with membersof the House Republican Study Committee to begin planning for the mass deportation of immigrants. ""He talked about how the cost of immigration is costing this country and he used the example of if an illegal has four children they have the same rights and privileges to the gimmes that Americans do, health care, education, all of that,"" Rep. Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina,told the Daily Beast. Miller reportedly told the attendees to determine the funding needed to carry out Trump's deportation plan, which they are expected to include in a reconciliation bill that requires a simple majority to pass through Congress. This would allow the party to secure funding for mass deportations without any Democratic support, as long as there aren't many defectors within theslim Republican majoritiesin Congress. While the GOP reconciliation bill will include tax cuts for the wealthy and draconian changes to immigration policy, thereconciliation processwas originally used under Democratic administrations for more progressive policy items. Under President Barack Obama, reconciliation was used to pass health care reform in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Under President Joe Biden, it was used to pass theAmerican Rescue Planand theInflation Reduction Act. But now, Republicans are using the reconciliation process to move forward with Trump's immigration policy, which is likely informed by Miller'sracist history. Miller served as an aide to former Sen. Jeff Sessions during whichhe promotedwhite supremacist literature, objected to efforts to remove symbols honoring the pro-slavery Confederacy, and promoted racist immigration stories. During Trump's first term, Miller wasa key architectof the policy that separated immigrant families to supposedly dissuade border crossings. The policy led to the separation of children from their parents, anda reunification processthat is still ongoing under the Biden administration. Family separation wascondemnedacross the world by figures like Pope Francis. There is widespread concern about the mental and emotional harm that mass deportation is likely to cause for thousands of families, but experts have also warned that there will be a financial cost. A ""highly conservative""estimatefrom the American Immigration Council found that Trump's mass deportations would cost at least $315 billion. The council also projected that the amount of funding used for a 10-year deportation program could build more than 40,450 new elementary schools, construct 2.9 million new homes, pay college tuition for 8.9 million people, and provide brand new cars to more than 20.4 million people.

Trump mimics mug shot in official presidential portrait,"Donald Trump did his best to look as evil as humanly possible in his official presidential portrait, which wasreleased Thursdayahead of his inauguration on Monday. In the terrifying headshot, Trump, wearing a rare blue tie, appears to be scowling at the camera and squinting one eye closed, as if he's plotting something nefarious. His evil look is enhanced by the choice to light him from below creating creepy dark shadows on Trump's face, while also blowing out his signature bright orange makeup to a muted apricot hue. The photo also bears an uncanny resemblance to hisGeorgia mugshot, which he took after he wasindictedin Fulton County for his efforts to overturn his loss in the Peach State. Trump's right-wing cult members were a littletooexcited over the portrait. ""Dad is home,"" Charlie Kirkwrotein a not-at-all creepy post on X, along with the photo. Russian propagandistBenny Johnson was also super pumped about Trump's portrait. ""Trump really went with the mugshot ascetic [sic] with the new Presidential Portrait,"" Johnsonwrotein a post on X, misspelling ""aesthetic."" He added, ""Trump chose violence 🔥"" Trump himself seems to be super proud of the creepy image, releasing the photo in a news release titled ""Official Portraits Released — And They Go Hard ????"" Yes, that was actually the title of the release, question marks and all. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect JD Vance's official portrait shows him with his arms cheerfully crossed over a blue tie that's nearly identical to his boss', smiling just hard enough that there's no trace of his signaturenatural ""eyeliner.""

Trump releases enemies list,"Donald Trump has released a list of people he wants blacklisted from positions in his upcoming administration. The release of the list comes just a few weeks after Trump said he would not seek retribution against his detractors. In November, after his election win, TrumptoldFox News, ""I am not looking for retribution, grandstanding or to destroy people who treated me very unfairly, or even badly beyond comprehension."" But on Wednesday night,Trump wroteon his Truth Social platform, ""In order to save time, money, and effort, it would be helpful if you would not send, or recommend to us, people who worked with, or are endorsed by, Americans for No Prosperity (headed by Charles Koch), 'Dumb as a Rock' John Bolton, 'Birdbrain' Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, disloyal Warmongers Dick Cheney, and his Psycho daughter, Liz, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, General(?) Mark Milley, James Mattis, Mark Yesper, or any of the other people suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, more commonly known as TDS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" While some of the people and groups on Trump's list are merely fellow travelers within the conservative movement who have disagreed with him (the right-wing Americans for Prosperity group) or who ran against him (failed presidential candidate Nikki Haley), many of them are figures who warned that Trump would engage infascistic behaviorduring a second term. Beforeretiring, Army Gen.

Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming served on the bipartisan committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol led by Trump supporters hoping to overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden.

House speaker demotes Ohio Republican who won’t ‘bend the knee’ to Trump,"Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio was unceremoniously ousted as chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, after Donald Trump ordered the pro-Ukraine lawmaker's removal, according to CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" hostMargaret Brennan. Turner has been avocal critic of Russiaand a supporter of Ukraine. He's evencriticized his own GOP colleaguesforspreading Russian propaganda. ""We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,"" Turner said in April. Being pro-Ukraine is untenable for Trump, who is buddies with violent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Putin worked to help get Trump elected in 2016 by running an unprecedented propaganda campaign. And now that Trump won again, Politicoreportedthat Putin hopes the U.S. will stop sending money and weapons to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. ""​​One person who'll clearly be pleased Mike Turner's been dumped as House Intelligence chair: Vladimir Putin,"" Republican Bill Kristol, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and his own party in recent years,wrotein a post on X. Trump hasrefused to saywhether he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia in the war Russia started. But he has made it clear that he wants Ukraine tomake concessions to Russia, which attacked the country unprovoked, in order to end the war. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who removed Turner as committee chair, claims Trump had nothing to do with the decision to remove Turner. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnsonsaid, adding, ""The intelligence community and everything related to [the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence], it needs a fresh start. And that's what this is about. Nothing else."" It's not yet clear who will be the new chair of the committee, which has oversight of the U.S. intelligence community and is privy to the nation's top secrets. In 2017, during Trump's first term, the committee was led byPutin stoogeDevin Nunes, who worked to thwart the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee,told reportershe's ""enormously concerned"" over Turner's removal since Turner wasn't one to ""bend the knee"" to Trump.

Trump's attorney general pick won't admit Biden won 2020 election,"Election denier Pam Bondi, Donald Trump'spickto lead the Department of Justice, refused multiple times at herWednesday confirmation hearingto say that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Sens.Dick Durbinof Illinois andMazie Hironoof Hawaii separately asked the former Florida attorney general if she believed Biden won the election—and Bondi refused to answer both times. When Durbin asked, Bondi dodged. ""President Biden is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power,"" Bondi said. Of course, the transition of power was anything but ""peaceful,"" as Trump incited a violent mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block certification of Biden's win. When Hirono asked Bondi, ""Who won the 2020 presidential election?"" Bondi gave the same canned answer. ""Joe Biden is the president of the United States,"" Bondi said robotically. The Hawaii lawmaker was unimpressed by that response. ""You cannot say who won the 2020 election,"" Hirono said. ""It's disturbing that you can't give voice to that fact."" Sen. Alex Padilla of California asked Bondi for evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which she has continued to lie about for years following Trump's loss to Biden. But Bondirefusedto give any concrete evidence. ""Do you have any evidence of election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election, yes or no? It's a yes or no question,"" Padilla said. In response, Bondi gave condolences to Padilla for the fires in California and refused to give a yes or no response about whether she had evidence of fraud. Bondi was among the dozens of Trump campaign officials and surrogates who lied about voter fraud in the 2020 election in a failed quest to help Trump remain in power. She specifically focused on Pennsylvania, which Bondi falsely claimed Trump won. ""We are not going anywhere until they declare that we won Pennsylvania,"" Bondisaidduring a Fox News appearance in 2020. In fact, Bondi helped organize the infamous news conference in Philadelphia that was supposed to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel but instead was mistakenly held atFour Seasons Total Landscapingafter the inept campaign booked the wrong venue. Bondi didn't speak that day, but was seen ""helping other staff to rearrange the company's landscaping equipment to make way for a podium"" before the event began,accordingto The Washington Post. It's no surprise that Bondi refused to say Biden won. Trumpdemands total loyaltyfrom his Cabinet picks, and admitting that Biden was the victor goes against Trump's narcissistic delusion that he didn't lose in 2020. But it's terrifying that Republican senators are set to confirm an attorney general who not only can't admit basic reality, but will readily lie to stroke Trump's fragile ego.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 01:01:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297102/-Trump-s-attorney-general-pick-won-t-admit-Biden-won-2020-election
Trump tries to take full credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal,"Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war after more than 15 months of fighting, according tothe U.S. and Qatar. The destruction and violence resulted in the deaths ofat least 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, while thousands morehave been injured. But amid the news, President-elect Donald Trump made the historic deal about himself and tried to take sole credit for it—all before President Joe Biden's administration hadheld a news briefingon the matter. ""WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,"" Trump posted to hisTruth Socialplatform. ""THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!"" In asecond post, Trump added, ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies."" Of course, the ceasefire effort was put into motion by Biden and has been carried out while he is president. The deal reached by negotiatorsis broadly the sameasthe one Biden proposed last May, which the president noted in astatement, saying, ""I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council."" Additionally, on Monday, Jake Sullivan, the Biden White House's national security adviser, said that a deal was imminent and that he ""coordinated very closely"" with the incoming Trump team to ""present a united message"" and ""get this deal done as fast as possible."" The deal stillneeds to be approvedby the Israeli cabinet, which isexpected to happen on Thursday. If approved as expected, the ceasefire will go into effect on Sunday. That said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid late on Wednesdaythat final details are still being worked out. If approved, the deal will allow for an exchange and release of all the remaining living Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel would also release some jailed Palestinians and allow for increased humanitarian aid in Gaza. In addition, during the plan's first 42 days, ""Israeli forces will withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas,"" according toABC News, and eventually, there will be a ""permanent cessation of military operations."" The final phase of the plan would see the two sides exchange remains for identification. At that time, the reconstruction of Gaza would begin, ""with compensation for all affected individuals under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar and the U.N.,"" according to ABC News. Notably, last September, Netanyahurejectedthe Biden administration's claim that a ceasefire plan was nearly finished. Since then, of course, the U.S. has elected a new president, suggesting that Netanyahu is far more prepared to bend a knee to the United States now than he was when Democrats controlled Washington, D.C. It's alsolikelythat he wanted to harm Democrats' chances at winning the presidency since the continuing conflict in Gaza was seen asa bad issue for them. Last week, Trump warned reporters that ""all hell"" would break loose if Hamas did not release the hostages by his Jan. 20 inauguration. It's possible that the pressure of Trump's threat shook Netanyahu, who has long shownfealtyto the president-elect despite Trump famouslyaccusing him of disloyalty. Of course, Trump is not currently president, so it makes sense that Biden is pushing back on giving the president-elect too much credit. When a reporter asked on Wednesday who gets credit for the deal, him or Trump, Biden responded, ""Is that a joke?"" Unsurprisingly, Trump's allies are lapping up his lies that the president-elect was singularly responsible for brokering this deal.

Trump pushes DOGE dork to fill Vance's vacant Senate seat in Ohio,"Donald Trump isreportedly pushingfailed presidential candidate and billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to take JD Vance's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat in Ohio. According to the Washington Post, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to take the position if offered by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who will make the appointment for the vacated seat once Vance is sworn in as vice president. The outlet also reports that Ramaswamy was planning to run for Ohio governor in 2026. If Ramaswamy assumed the position, Ohio would be represented by a senator whose history is checkered with promoting debunked conspiracy theories. During his unsuccessful presidential campaign,Ramaswamy saidthat the Jan. 6 insurrection of the U.S. Capitol looked like it was an ""inside job,"" amplifying a conservative conspiracy that it was undertaken by shadowy forces within the government. ""Why am I the only person on this stage, at least, who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?"" Ramaswamy asked his fellow Republican candidates during a December 2023 debate. Healso postedon social media on the anniversary of the insurrection, writing ""Happy Entrapment Day,"" a nod to thedebunkedright-wing conspiracy theory that federal agents staged the event to entrap Trump supporters. Trump's Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth,has espousedsimilar beliefs. Ramaswamyhas also claimedthat the racist ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory, which argues that increased immigration from Mexico is a plan to replace white people with Latinx people, is ""a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform."" He also promoted thefalsehoodthat the 2020 election was ""stolen by Big Tech."" Perhaps the most absurd conspiracy that Ramaswamy has embracedis his theorythat the result of the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs and that it would be connected to a future endorsement of President Joe Biden from Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. When he's not promoting conspiracies, Ramaswamy has embraced unpopular conservative policy ideas, like privatizing Social Security. In avideofor AARP, Ramaswamy endorsedthe failed proposalfrom former President George W. Bush to allow partial privatization of the popular pension program by investing funds in the stock market. Along with Elon Musk, Ramaswamy iscurrently co-chairingthe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-governmental pressure group created by Trump. DOGE representatives have reportedly beenharassing federal workersin an effort to undermine federal spending. And recently, RamaswamydenigratedU.S. culture in a lengthypost on Xclaiming that ""American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long."" ""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from 'Boy Meets World,' or Zach & Slater over Screech in 'Saved by the Bell,' or 'Stefan' over Steve Urkel in 'Family Matters,' will not produce the best engineers,"" he wrote.

Even Fox News can't spin how much Greenlanders don't want to join US,"Well, this is awkward. A reporter from right-wing propaganda outlet Fox News headed to Greenland to see if its residents were as pumped about the idea of the country becoming part of the United States as Donald Trump and his brain-dead MAGA cult are. But the reporter did not encounter scores of Trump fans who want the country to be taken over by the U.S. Instead, the reporter said that ""most"" of the people she spoke to were against Trump's plan to acquire the territory. ""I hate it,"" one Greenlander told Fox News of Trump's proposal. ""I want to stick with Danish ... government,"" another person interviewed by Fox said. (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.) Trump has had a bizarre fixation with annexing Greenland since at least2019, when he first saber-rattled about buying the island. He had gone quiet about the idea until after he won the 2024 election. And now, once again, he is saying that the U.S. should take control of Greenland, going as far as saying hemay use military forceto acquire the land. Earlier in January, Trump sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to the country to try to build support among the people for a U.S. acquisition. But Greenlandic politicians described Jr.'s visit as astaged public-relations stunt. In fact, a Danish media outletreportedthat the pro-Trump folks whom Trump Jr. featured in photos he posted of his visit included unhoused people who wereoffered free lunchin exchange for wearing MAGA gear. ""They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,""Tom Amtoft, a Greenland resident, told the Danish outlet, according to Google's translation of the comment. Trump alsoposteda video of a man in Greenland wearing MAGA gear, saying, ""I am hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.'"" But apparently unbeknownst to Trump, the man in the video is a convicted drug trafficker,according toa Danish media outlet. Ultimately, officials from bothGreenlandand Denmark officials say the arctic territory will not become part of the US. ""Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,"" Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede,said in a statement. And even Fox News can't propagandize that fact.

AG nominee is still covering up Trump’s Georgia election fraud efforts,"Former Florida Attorney General and Trump lawyer Pam Bondi is lying her way through Wednesday's Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general. When Sen. Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked if she ""heard the recording of President Trump on January 2, 2021, when he urged the secretary of state of Georgia to, quote, 'find 11,780 votes' and declare him the winner of that state,"" Bondi denied ever hearing it. ""No. I've heard about it through clips, but no, no, Senator, I've not heard it,"" she said. ""What was your reaction to President Trump making that call?"" Durbin pressed. ""I have, I would have to listen to the tape, Senator,"" Bondi responded. As Durbin continued pushing Bondi on the issue, the formerregistered foreign agentwiggled free by claiming that she didn't know the context, adding ""but it's my understanding that is not what he asked him to do.""

""It's free speech. It shouldn't even be in state court. Legally, it should be in federal court if they're ever going to prosecute him for something so ridiculous,"" she said.

Trump set to start second term with underwater approval rating,"As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office for a second time, he claims to have a ""massive"" mandate to enact his destructive agenda. But new polling shows that's far from the truth. ANPR/PBS News/Marist College pollreleased Wednesday shows that just 44% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 49% view him unfavorably. That's nearly identical to the 45% approval rating Trump has inCiviqs' tracking poll. The fact that Trump is viewed unfavorably before he even takes office is a warning sign for his tenure. The start of a presidential term is usually when a president is at their high-water mark of approval. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, 51% of registered voters approved of the job he was doing on the transition, according to anNPR/PBS News/Marist College pollat the time. In the first two months after Barack Obama was sworn in as president, around 60% of Americans approved of the job he was doing, according to538's historical polling average. And when he was sworn in again four years later, his approval rating was around 53%. The NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll has other warning signs for Trump. Just 31% of Americans say thetariff policyTrump plans to enact would help the economy. That should be a flashing red warning light for Trump, showing that Americans will likely blame him if those tariffs cause prices toskyrocket, as economists expect. What's more, 62% of Americans oppose Trump's plan to pardon people who either pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for their role in the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It's not just Trump who is unpopular among voters. Trump's Cabinet nominees are also underwater. Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, has just a 19% approval rating in the NPR/PBS News/Marist College survey. And the survey was conducted before Hegseth's confirmation hearing, when Democratic senatorslaid barethe nominee's abhorrent behavior of alleged sexual assault, womanizing, on-the-job drinking, and misogynistic remarks. Twenty-six percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hegseth, with the remaining 55% not knowing who he is or having no opinion of him. However, Trump's co-president, Elon Musk, is broadly unpopular. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable view of him, while 46% view him unfavorably, according to the poll. That's also a warning sign for Trump, who is allowing Musk to hog the spotlight and even letting the awkward billionaireoccupy an officein the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next door to the White House. Ultimately, while it's awful that Trump will be sworn in for a second time, polling suggests that he will have no honeymoon phase and that backlash to his agenda could be a serious problem for Republicans in the 2026 midterms.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 20:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297068/-Trump-won-the-popular-vote-but-that-doesn-t-mean-Americans-like-him
Fox News host celebrates lack of diverse inauguration performers,"Fox News host Jesse Watterscelebratedthe news that Carrie Underwoodwill be performing""America, the Beautiful"" at Donald Trump's inauguration, citing her sexual orientation and blonde hair as a sign of America's return. ""I'm just happy Carrie Underwood is performing. When a straight, blonde female is singing at the inauguration, I think we're back. I think we're definitely back,"" he said during a Tuesday episode of ""Jesse Watters Primetime."" His guest, conservative comedian Nick Di Paolo added, ""Thank God Kamala didn't win, we would've had to see Lizzo's ass for 45 minutes."" Watters' and Di Paolo's comments echo longtimeconservative complaintsthat President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democrats are too ""woke,"" meaning they have embraced diversity. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the performers were in fact diverse. Lady Gaga—who was blonde at the time—sangthe national anthem, Jennifer Lopezalso performed, and so didGarth Brooks—a straight white man. Watters has spent years at Fox espousing racist and misogynistic comments, and the network expanded his platform whenhe receivedhis primetime show in 2023, replacing the extremelybigotedTucker Carlson. During the recent presidential campaign, Watterslobbed multiple sexistand racist attacks at Harris, who made history as the first woman of color to secure a major party's nomination. ""She's just like your typical girl's girl that talks behind everybody's back and then says nice things to your face. She's just not at the level of what you would think would be a president,"" he ranted. In another instance, Watters called Harris a ""frightened woman too insecure to tell us who she is"" and claimed the media supported her because ""they love a Black woman taking on a white man.""

Biden spends final days in office tackling another important crisis,"In one of his final moves in office, President Joe Biden is aiming to eliminate some bureaucratic hurdles that have historically forced homeowners and renters into expensive mortgages and sky-high rental rates. On Tuesday, the Biden administrationunveileda $100 million grant program from the Department of Housing and Urban Development aimed at helping local communities identify and remove barriers to the production and preservation of affordable housing. ""The United States faces a shortfall of millions of affordable homes that has driven up home prices and rents and has made finding a quality and affordable home out of reach for too many Americans,"" the White House statement said. The grant will remove red tape and modernize local permitting procedures to facilitate the construction of new housing, finance the construction of new homes for renting and owning, and repair and revitalize existing buildings. New plans will be developedacross 14 states, including in the cities of San Francisco, California; Austin, Texas; Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and St. Louis, Missouri. The White House also approved the first residential transit-oriented development (TOD) loan under the Department of Transportation's lending programs. The new initiative will fund the creation of more than 300 new housing units near Florida's Boca Raton Tri-Rail Station, which is expected to generate an annual $2 million in land lease revenue for the commuter rail system. This would help ensure that public transportation is accessible to people living in affordable housing, removing a potential barrier to employment. Housing experts from platforms like Zillowargue thatthe lack of housing supply is one of the main driving forces behind the soaring costs that have prohibited millions of Americans from entering the housing market. For many,skyrocketing rents and home pricescombined withstagnant wageshave made it nearly impossible to save for a down payment, locking an entire generation out of homeownership. Biden's push to address the housing shortage is an extension of his 2022Housing Supply Action Plan, which aimed to reverse years of underbuilding and stimulate housing growth by offering incentives to state and local governments. For many Americans, the dream of homeownership has been squashed by the harsh reality of rising rents and unaffordable home prices. The pandemic-era boom in the housing market only exacerbated these trends, leaving many feeling like homeownership is an impossibility. During the2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presented vastly different visions for tackling the housing crisis. Harris proposed a bold plan to offer $25,000 in down-payment assistance and to expand the supply of housing—focusing on practical steps to help people get into homes. Trump, on the other hand, was far less detailed. He suggested that curbing immigration could somehow ease housing costs. This was widely debunked, as immigration does not significantly impact housing prices. He also called for lowering mortgage rates, whichcurrently sit ataround 7.25% for a 30-year fixed loan. Though it remains unclear how he planned to achieve that, as the president is independent of the Federal Reserve, which dictates rates. Biden's latest move is part of a series of sweeping policy decisions made during his final months in office, including signing a record number ofcommutations,cutting billionsin student loan debt,protecting landby designating two new national monuments, andbanning medical debtfrom impacting credit scores. As Biden moves forward with his efforts to ease the housing crunch, he seems to understand that boosting the housing supply and cutting through bureaucratic red tape are two crucial steps in making housing more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans.

Joni Ernst of Iowa announced late Tuesday that she'd vote in favor of President-elect Donald Trump's utterly unqualified pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth—a move that suggests the former Fox News host has a high chance of being confirmed. During an appearance on anIowa radio showon Tuesday, Ernst said she believed that Hegseth adequately answered all her questions during his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon, and I think we're at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,"" Ernstsaid. ""I will be supporting President Trump's pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth."" Ernst's support is a huge boon for Hegseth's odds, practically ensuring he'll lead the Pentagon in Trump's incoming administration. Assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, Hegseth can afford to lose just three Republican senators. And while some in the GOP, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, stillhaven't said how they'll vote, Tuesday's confirmation hearing demonstrated thatmany are on board with Hegsethand are willing to give hisabhorrent alleged behaviora pass. Part of what makes Ernst's raving endorsement notable is her history as a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor whopreviously raised concernsover Hegseth's ability to lead the Pentagon. In December, she cited unease over Hegseth's past opposition to women serving in combat roles, though hewalked this backduring Tuesday's hearing. It was also unclear how Ernst, who has crusaded for years to address sexual misconduct in the military, would respond to allegations that Hegseth raped a woman in 2017. (Hegseth maintains that theencounter was consensual.) Perhaps Ernst can stomach Hegseth's nomination because sheintentionally distanced herselffrom some of the worst charges against him. According to new reporting from The New Yorker, Ernst declined an invitation to meet with the woman whom Hegseth paid to settle that 2017 sexual assault claim. Or maybe Ernst simply bowed to outsized pressure from the GOP base. After meeting with Hegseth in December and voicing doubts about whether she'd vote in his favor, she was relentlessly bullied by hardcore MAGA adherents. Not only did some of Trump's most ardent supportersrun adsin Ernst's home state of Iowa, but they alsoquestioned her conservative bona fideson social media. Mega-billionaire Elon Musk also pledged tobankroll primary challengesto Republicans who went against the president-elect. It appears that threats to primary Ernst worked. Following another December meeting with Hegseth, Ernstsignaled more opennessto his nomination. Thispressurevery likely helped change Ernst's tone on Hegseth. Notably, on Tuesday, asDemocrats slammed the defense nomineeover his alleged drinking problem and past comments toward women, Ernsttossed him softballs. ""As secretary of defense, will you appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response?"" she asked. ""Senator, as we have discussed, yes I will,"" Hegseth responded. Ernst is up forreelection in 2026in a statethat went for Trumpby more than 13 percentage points in November. Given that, it's likely she would've been targeted by MAGA followers had she not kowtowed to the president-elect and refused to back Hegseth. That type of politicking might work for the likes of Collins or even Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who isalso on the fenceabout confirming Hegseth, but not the bulk of Senate Republicans who need Trump's base of loyal Republicans to retain their positions in Congress. Ernst's onetime arms-length attitude toward Hegseth signaled that some Senate Republicans would attempt to maintain independence under a second Trump administration, but the Iowan's changed tune suggests that for Republican lawmakers, Trump is still king.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 17:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297074/-GOP-senator-ditches-skepticism-and-backs-Pete-Hegseth-to-lead-Pentagon
Nancy Mace threatens Jasmine Crockett during House proceeding,"During a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace threatened to fight Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett after she called out Mace for anti-transgender bigotry. Crockett was attempting to get the committee to reinstate its subcommittee on civil rights when she took note of Mace's recent anti-trans rhetoric andpromotion of billsmeant to restrict transgender rights. ""Somebody's campaign coffers really are struggling right now. So [Mace] gonna keep saying 'trans, trans, trans' so that people will feel threatened, and child, listen—"" Crockett said. Mace interjected, saying, ""I am no child, do not call me a child, I am no child,"" then told Crockett, ""If you want to take it outside, we can do that."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost objected to the call for violence, but Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican, ruled that the threat could merely have meant going outside to ""have a cup of coffee or perhaps a beer."" Following the incident,Mace postedabout it on social media at least a dozen times but claimed that her response to Crockett was not about instigating a fight. ""Please explain to me how the same damn Karen that called Cap[itol] Police on a child who shook her hand wanted to act like she wanted to fight me?!""Crockett wrote. ""Republicans incite violence from the highest levels of government & ALSO claim to be the party of law & order. The two cannot be true! Do yourself a favor, decide to require better of your electeds. Last I checked, threatening members in a committee room doesn't exactly reduce the cost of eggs."" Mace has been widely criticized forpushing House Republicanleadership to adopt a rule that prevents transgender members of the House from using a restroom corresponding to their gender identity. The adoption of the rule followed the successful election of Rep. Sarah McBride, the first (and so far only) openly transgender member of Congress. After being criticized for her bigoted stance, Mace has spent months attacking transgender people. A recent fundraising text for Maceallegedthat a ""Trans Mob"" wanted to kill her. The comment from Crockett comes as the Republican-led Housepassed legislationto ban transgender girls from participating in girls' sports at schools that receive funding from the federal government. The bill also changes federal law to say ""sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth."" Republicans pushed the bill through—only two Democrats supported it, and no Republicans opposed it—even as concerns have been raised that it would empower predators. ""The House Republican Child Predator Empowerment Act does not promote fairness and safety in sports,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffrieswrote. ""It will unleash horrific child predators on girls and young women throughout America. Unacceptable."" Frostnotedthat if the Republican bill became law, it would allow young children to be subjected to invasive questions about their genitals from strangers and that inspections could occurwithout parents present. ""We must protect children. This bill is disgusting and puts every girl in this country at risk,"" he wrote. Republicans,led by Donald Trump, have attacked transgender rights as a unifying rallying cry for bigots to support the party's candidates at the polls.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 16:00:24,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297061/-Notorious-GOP-bigot-tries-to-pick-literal-fight-with-Texas-Democrat
Trump's tech sugar daddies bestowed VIP seats for Inauguration Day,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, and oh-so-""masculine"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be very special guests at Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. An official involved with the event planningconfirmed to NBC Newsthat three of the United States' wealthiest men will be seated together on the platform as theconvicted felontakes the oath of office. The tech bros will be cozied up right next to Trump's Cabinet nominees and other prominent elected officials. Given the billionaire trio'sseven-figure donationsto the inaugural fund, this naked display of favoritism on Trump's big day doesn't come as a surprise. As Daily Kos previously reported, a bunch of tech moguls have lined up tokiss Trump's ring, offering sizable donations ahead of his second term. But as the three stooges kiss up to the incoming president and throw money at his feet, Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos also share something else in common: personal interests to protect. Online shopping mogul Bezos has alarge stake in defense contractswith his aerospace company Blue Origin—and he also has some trouble ahead with the Federal Trade Commission, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Amazon founder in 2023. The case made headlines last year when the government agency accused Bezos of concealing evidence by using the disappearing messaging service Signal amid the ongoing lawsuit. Despite multiple attempts by Amazon to get the lawsuit thrown out, the hearing is set to go ahead inOctober 2026. And while Bezos butted heads with Trump in the past, it's clear he knows having Trump on his side this time around can only benefit him. As for Musk, the wealthiest man in the world has multiple investments hinging on his blossoming relationship with Trump—not to mention that Trump's win aloneboosted Musk's(and other billionaires') wealth. Of course, Musk alreadyhas his own Trump-backed vanity projectto keep him and fellow tech bro billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy busy during the next four years: the very unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, which claims it will cut spending by $2 trillion. Zuckerberg also has some concerns about his empire that having a friendship with Trump might alleviate. The Meta owner is set togo to trial with the FTCin April over an antitrust lawsuit regarding his purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg allegedly purchased the apps at an exorbitant price in order to push out any possible competitors. The social media scion seems to be playing up his MAGA support in light of the new administration. As previously reported, Zuckerberg has called off the use ofindependent fact-checkerson Facebook, altered thehateful conduct policyto allow harassment of women and the LGBTQ+ community, announced that content moderation efforts willmove to the famously unbiased Texas, and is dismantling his company'sDEI initiatives. To really drive home his ass-kissing, Zuck is alsoreportedlycohosting a black-tie Inauguration Day reception for his new bestie. Billionaire oligarchs aside, Trump appears to be pulling out all the stops for his big day, booking country music singer Carrie Underwood to sing ""America the Beautiful"" as well. But given the incoming president's obsession withcrowd sizesand big introductions, Trump wasn't satisfied with a simple inauguration ceremony. The Republican will also be hosting three inauguration balls following the morning ceremony:the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball, and the Starlight Ball. Trump will also throw a so-calledVictory Rallyin D.C.'s Capital One Arena the night before. Given the millions of dollars that billionaires have lavished on his inaugural fund, the guy can certainly afford to throw multiple ego-stroking celebrations.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 15:00:17,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2296980/-Trump-s-tech-sugar-daddies-bestowed-VIP-seats-for-Inauguration-Day
'Blueprint for suffering': Democrat trashes GOP's heartless budget,"Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico brought some thunder to the House floor on Tuesday. With Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" tax cut for the wealthy teetering on the edge of failure, Stansbury made it clear where the Democratic Party and theAmerican people stand. ""I rise today to oppose this so-called budget resolution, which is one of the greatest heists in American history, as they loot the Treasury to give permanent tax breaks to billionaires at the expense of millions of Americans,"" Stansbury said. ""We're talking about cuts to health care, Medicaid, Medicare."" ""These cuts are cruel. They are unnecessary. They are undemocratic. And they will blow a hole through our deficit spending by $4 trillion,"" she continued. ""Because this is not a budget resolution. This is a blueprint for suffering."" Trump and the Republican Party are trying to cut taxes for the wealthy by cutting hundreds of billions from Medicaid and the social safety net. And their attempts to paint this as a kind ofcostsavingshas failed everycredible metricapplied to it. Stansbury pulled no punches, calling out Musk and co.'s willingness to cause American families' suffering in their desire for control. ""It's about power and greed. And the GOP is enabling them,"" she said. ""So we will not sit down and do it. We will not support this budget resolution, and we will not give them one single vote.""

Team assigned to help DOGE gives middle finger instead,"Nearly two dozen federal technology workers just walked out the door rather than bow to billionaire Elon Musk, who they say is set on running the government into the ground with chaos and cronyism. On Tuesday, 21 engineers, data scientists, and product managers who worked for what was once known as theUnited States Digital Servicesubmitted a mass resignation letter in response to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency interloping in federal jobs and agencies. In the joint letter, obtained by theAssociated Press, staffers from the USDS wrote, ""We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services. We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE's actions."" They also alluded to nameless DOGE bros wearing White House visitor badges infiltrating their office and grilling the nonpartisan staffers. The staffers told reporters these young men were rife with technological inefficiency, fandom for Musk, and ideological partisanship. ""Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,"" the staffers wrote. ""This process created significant security risks."" This follows the layoffs of 40 USDS staffers earlier in February. After Musk's initial layoffs, 65 USDS employees remained—a third of whom just resigned. USDS wasestablishedby former President Barack Obama in 2014, after hischaotic rolloutof the federalhealth care website, Healthcare.gov, proved to be clunky and slow. Since then, theagencyhas made the site efficient, helping Americans sign up for health care. It has also worked to improve services for veterans, assisted the government in purchasing updated technology, and created a free tax portal. Meanwhile, the White House is covering for Musk,claimingthat he has nothing to do with the DOGE firings. When he isn't sending micromanagingemailsthreatening federal workers to list five things they did that week or be fired, he's brandishing bedazzledchainsawsat CPAC conference, shouting, ""This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy."" Since being sworn in, Trump has given Musk full reign to use DOGE to illegally accesssensitive dataon private citizens. He has also dismantled federal agencies like theUnited States Agency for International Developmentandlaid offthousandsof federal employees in the name of ""efficiency."" As federal employees have been the target in Trump's first month in office, some,joinedby congressional Democrats, stood outside in Washington's wintery streets to protest outside their agencies. Others, like USDS staffers, are taking other means of protest by bowing out of an administration they see as unable to do right by the American people. ""We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,"" the USDS employees wrote. ""However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.""",Daily Kos,2025-02-25 20:30:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/25/2306173/-Team-assigned-to-help-DOGE-gives-middle-finger-instead
