How the right is justifying—and even celebrating—Musk’s Nazi salute,"Feeling emboldened by Donald Trump officially being sworn in as president, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, gave a nod to Germany’s Nazi Party—you know, the one thatkilled six millionJewish people and started World War II. “Thank you for making it happen,” Musk said to the raucous MAGA crowd during an inaugural event speech, which he wrapped up by doing the “Sieg Heil,” or Nazi salute—twice, just to clear up the possibility that it might have been an unintentional slip-up. Obviously, people have been expressing their reactions of shock and disgust on social media from around the world—except, of course, by far-right Trump supporters and white nationalists, who justified and praised the salute. “I studied the Nazis at university, taught the history of Nazi Germany on two continents and wrote for major newspapers about Nazi Germany,” Mike Stuchberywrote on X. “I am internet famous for fact-checking chuds on the history, ideology and policy of Nazi Germany. That was a Nazi salute.” “For every dingbat posting Kamala or [Hillary] waving... they're not doing the wind-up, hand to heart which is the hallmark of the Nazi/fascist salute,” Stuchbery said inanother post. Democrats in Europe were equally aghast, with Spanish Minister of Labor and Social Economy Yolanda Díazdeciding to leaveX after “the entire world witnessed Elon Musk mimicking a Nazi salute during Donald Trump’s inauguration.” Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzsaidat the World Economic Forum Tuesday that Musk has the right to free speech, but “what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions.” Muskrespondedon his platform X on Monday in an attempt to downplay his Nazi gesture. “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired,” he wrote. Meanwhile, corporate media coverage of Trump has beenoverwhelmingly positive, with POLITICO co-founder John F. Harris writing that Trump is a “great president.” The Washington PostlabeledMusk’s Nazi salute as merely “exuberant speech,” and The New York Times explained it away with theheadline, “Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture.” So we’re watering down Nazi salutes as “hand gestures” now? To add insult to injury, the Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy organization, defended Musk,sayingthat he “made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quicklyrespondedto the ADL’s statement. “Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity. People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all,” she wrote. During her hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New Yorkdeniedthat Musk did a Nazi salute whenasked about itby Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. Meanwhile, white nationalist and far-right commentators like self-identified “Christian” Evan KilgorepraisedMusk’s salute. “Holy crap… Did[Musk]  just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington D.C… This is incredible,” he wrote. But after criticism came roaring in, Kilgorebacktrackedby insulting everyone with autism whodoesn’tsalute Nazis. “Elon Musk is autistic. He was excited. We all know his intentions weren't to make a Sieg Heil,” he wrote. “It looked much more like a Roman Salute. Can we all have a sense of humor for 5 seconds?” Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of theextremist and conspiratorialplatform Gab,sharedthe photo of Musk doing the Nazi salute with the caption, “Incredible things are happening.” “Incredible” is certainly one way to put it. This moment—and the four years to come—will serve as a significant flashpoint in the slow, steady battle over the normalization of fascism and oligarchy in U.S. politics and culture.

Trump immediately reminds America of his pettiness and fragile ego,"Less than 24 hours into his second term, Donald Trump is already trying to settle scores with his perceived enemies, taking multiple petty actions to stroke his giant and fragile ego. Less than two hours after being sworn in, Trump had a portrait of Gen. Mark Milley—the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who called Trump a “fascist” and a ""dangerous"" person—removed from the Pentagon, The New York Timesreported. The portrait had beenunveiledjust 10 days ago.  Milley is one of the people Trumpput on his enemies list. Trump's hatred of Milley runs so deep that former President Joe Biden gave Milley apreemptive pardonto prevent Trump from ordering his administration to prosecute Milley for whatever made-up crimes they could conjure up. Milley said he was grateful for Biden's pardon. “I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,"" he said in a statement. “I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.” Trump also announced that he removed four people Biden appointed, including Milley. Trumpwrotein a post on X: Andres is a humanitarian who has beennominatedfor a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit he founded that feeds people suffering from natural disasters, war, and poverty. Andres wrote in a post on X that he couldn't be removed from his position because he already resigned a week ago. Andreswrote: Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta and later worked in the Biden White House as the director of the Office of Public Engagement. Like Andres, Bottoms said she already left her position so Trump's ""firing"" was moot. ""A day late and a dollar short ... My resignation from the President’s Export Council was submitted January 4, effective yesterday,” Bottomssaid. “You can’t fire someone who has already resigned. Of all the things happening in the world, not sure why I’m on Donald Trump’s mind at 1:30 am following his inauguration, but I count it as a badge of honor.” And it’s unclear why he targeted Hook, who actuallyservedin Trump's first administration as an envoy to Iran. As for other pettiness, following Trump'sdark and low-energy inaugural address, he gaverambling 30-minute remarksin which he complained about his 2024 victory and lied about voter fraud, falsely saying he “would have won the state of California” in 2024 were it not for fraud. In thoseremarks, Trump also falsely accused Milley as well as the members of Congress who investigated the Capitol insurrection of being guilty of “very, very guilty of very, very bad crimes”—making Biden’s preemptive pardons look well justified. Ultimately, Trump’s first day in office was anabject disasterthat proved his detractors right when they warned that his second term would be four years of Trump going after anyone who he deems insufficiently subservient.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 21:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298193/-Trump-immediately-reminds-America-of-his-pettiness-and-fragile-ego
Why the internet is blaming a billionaire couple for California fires,"Online creators have been buzzing aboutStewart and Lynda Resnick, billionaires who own a portion of Southern California’s water supply, claiming that the couple is to blame for fire hydrantsrunning dryamid the ongoing wildfires across the region. But while the Resnicks have areputationfor being the “California couple who uses more water than every home in Los Angeles combined,” the blame is actually misplaced. The Resnicks made their billions from theirWonderful Company, which produces foods like Wonderful Pistachios, POM pomegranate juice, and Halo tangerines. In 1994, the Resnicks signed acontroversial backroom dealsecuring 58% of the Kern Water Bank. But according toCBS News, California’s water laws allow owners the right to usage, not ownership of the water itself. Moreover, the state actually has laws prohibiting people from withholding or hoarding water. Felicia Marcus, former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, told CBS News that the state constitution includes a ""prohibition against waste and unreasonable use."" In other words, if ""you actually ended up in a situation where somebody was withholding water at a grand scale,"" the government could step in. The Resnicks, whopledged $10 millionfrom Wonderful Companyfor wildfire relief efforts,are just one example of the misinformed blame-throwing going on since the fires started. President Donald Trumpfalsely claimedthat California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s failure to sign a “water restoration declaration” was the reason for water supply shortages. Newsom’s office later noted that “no such document” even exists. Other finger pointing was aimed atAI and tech companies, where social media users quickly circulated claims that super computers used up the water supplies desperately needed by the firefighters. Thereal reasonfor the lack of water, however, is much more complicated. And, even more so, Los Angeles was simply not equipped for a natural disaster of this scale even with water supplies at a historical high. ""What's happening in LA is not because there's not enough water in LA in storage,"" Marcus said. ""There are no urban water systems that are built out to handle a firestorm like this."" At the end of the day, people are angry and scared. Many have lost their homes, their financial safety net, and their sense of security. And as of Jan. 16,at least 27 peopledied in the fires. While conditions have eased, allowing firefighters to push back the flames, the ultra-dry conditions have expertsconcerned about future vulnerability. For those looking to help out but not sure where to start, disaster relief expertIrwin Redlenertold Daily Kos that it’s not always helpful to throw money at large nonprofits like American Red Cross, since they often already have large endowments for disasters. Instead, he recommends supporting charities at the local level, including churches. But even that, unfortunately, can be complicated as it’s difficult to trace where exactly funds are going. “It's hard for the consumer to tell what is actually most effective,” he said, adding thatCharity Navigatoris a helpful tool for assessing a charity’s effectiveness. Redlener also pointed out that the destruction from the California wildfires will last much longer than the media coverage. “It will disappear from the front pages of news organizations, and it will be replaced by other issues. And, ironically, that may be the time when we really need to be thinking about what's happening to the people who have been affected by the disaster,” he said. “So sometimes it might be worth it for people to sort of hold on to their generosity.” ",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 20:00:22,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297340/-Why-the-internet-is-blaming-a-billionaire-couple-for-California-fires
'Great president': Mainstream media slobbers all over Trump,"Early in Donald Trump’s new presidency, mainstream media outlets confirmed fears of how they would cover him—by avoiding the truth, equivocating on his abuse of power, and even praising him. The actions by widely read and watched outlets was the continuation of a recent trend that has seen outlets likeABC News,MSNBC, andThe Washington Postcave to Trump, even before he was sworn in.  “Time to Admit It: Trump Is a Great President,” readsthe beginning of a Politico headlinepublished Tuesday. Contrary to its appearance, the column was not written by Trump himself or even one of his many MAGA acolytes in the media. Instead, it is the work of Politico co-founder and current Global Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, a longtime mainstay of Washington journalism. The gushing goes beyond the headline as Harris writes, “[Trump] is someone with an ability to perceive opportunities that most politicians do not and forge powerful, sustained connections with large swaths of people in ways that no contemporary can match. In other words: He is a force of history.” When the mainstream press isn’t prematurely declaring Trump’s greatness (and ignoring thedeath tollof his previous stint of making America “great”), it equivocated on one of his first acts, which gave a green light to hundreds of criminals. Trumppardoned about 1,500 people convictedof attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, over the protests of millions—including the police officersbattered and bruised by insurrectionists attempting to overturn the election. ButatThe Washington Post, this was the equivalent of President Joe Biden’sdecisionto preemptively pardon figures like Anthony Fauci, retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, and members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee whom Trump and his MAGA movement have targeted. “Biden started the day with pardons. Trump finished with many more,” reads the Post headline—as if pardoning Enrique Tarrio, convicted of sedition against the United States, is the same thing as pardoning Dr. Fauci, who MAGA world hates for the sin of telling Americans to mask up during a global pandemic. Things aren’t much better at The New York Times.Their headlineon Trump’s pardons: “In Dueling Pardons, an Intensified Fight Over the Meaning of Jan. 6.” Apparently, the Times believes that Biden issuing a pardon to Milley, whom Trump has lambasted for calling him a “fascist,” is on the same level as Trump’s pardon of the man who stormed the Capitol with a “Camp Auschwitz” hoodie. At a post-inauguration rally for Trump, his co-President andcampaign benefactorElon Musk—the richest person in the world—gave a Nazi salute. Twice. Yet,atThe Washington Post, it was merely an “exuberant speech.” Meanwhile, forThe New York Times, the furor at the hand motion was explained away: “Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture.” Meanwhile, NBC’s Chicago affiliate apparentlyposted a videoof Musk’s speech where the feed cut to a shot of the audience at the precise moments of the offensive salutes.  Over the course of the 2024 election, the mainstream pressmade clearthat it would prioritize criticism of Democrats like Biden and Vice President Harris while playing down offenses by Trump. Now that Trump is back in the Oval Office, the press is continuing that trend. The press has long been described as the watchdogs of democracy, but these outlets show that the watchdog has gone on a break.

Trump's speech raises the old question: Is he evil or merely stupid?,"In Donald Trump’s new conceit, America was a hellhole in 2016, he made it great, then former President Joe Biden broke everything, but thanks to Trump’s 2024 election win, everything will be great again. Or, as he said inhis inaugural addresson Monday, “The golden age of America begins right now.” You know he is full of shit. I know he’s full of shit. We’d like to think everyone around him knows so as well, but doeshe? It’s the age-old question: Is Trump evil or merely stupid? Ifhis inaugural speechsays anything, it’s that he is delusional in what he thinks he can accomplish. After some throat clearing, Trump’s speech begins: One of Trump’s conceits is that other countries no longer respect the United States but that they did respect us when he was president—a time when the world literallylaughed at him. Right off the bat, we find out that Trump has no intentions of uniting the country. Rather, he’ll be airing his usual grievances—Trump’s 24/7/365 celebration ofFestivus. Trump wants to end the weaponization of the Justice Department? So patently absurd, especially as Trumpfrequently talks aboutall his enemies he wants to prosecute. Just this past Saturday, heshared a poston his Truth Social platform that called for Democratic politicians to be prosecuted. It’s going to be an exhausting four years. Sunlight is pouring over the world, y’all. Imagine the gall of saying that when the front row of your inauguration audience—in front of your Cabinet picks—is the modern American oligarchy: Net worthof those pictured as of Tuesday morning: Tesla CEO Elon Musk: $425 billion Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: $241 billion Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: $212 billion Google CEO Sundar Pichai:$1.3 billion Add in Bernard Arnault, whoalso attendedand whose familial net worth is $181 billion, and you get a combined net worth of nearly $1.1 trillion. TRILLION. Four of the five richest men in the world were there, and it’s possible all five were if Trump pal Larry Ellison was also somewhere in the crowd. Trump will stand there and talk about “extracted … wealth from our citizens” when he seems to havejustpulled apump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemeon his own followers? It’s telling that when talking about national disasters, his real empathy has always been for the wealthy: Maybe those powerful and wealthy individuals can pay their fair share of taxes to support those services? Not to mention the brutal insult to the firefighters bravely fighting those fires in Los Angeles. Also,Trump cut the FEMA budgetlast time he was president. You better believe it’ll get hacked this time around as well. It won’t be remembered as such. Why would it be? Sheesh. And no, the nation isn’t unifying. It’sjust as divided as always. In any case, Trump then starts with his promises, leading with sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. As I’ve written before,good luck with that. Even his own border czar, Tom Homan, is trying to temper expectations. The U.S. is already atop energy exporterin the world. Trump will soon take credit for somethingBiden has largely done. Given the climate crisis, though, this may not actually be a good thing. Congrats, Elon Musk, who owns the electric car company Tesla. Also, the Green New Deal isn’t law. Is Trump talking about green energy projects under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act? In one of those inexplicable things Democrats keep doing to themselves, the bulk of investment from that lawwent to red congressional districts. And those Republicansdon’t want to give up that sweet federal cash. Me, I’m actually rooting for Trump to kill those projects. If Republican voters want federal investment in their communities, they can vote Democratic next time. And when Democrats have power, they need to spend that money ontheirconstituents. Build those factories in blue cities and states. Give them a reason tokeepvoting Democratic. Because watching their tax dollars go to ingrate conservatives isn’t doing the party any good. Every business leader, including those sitting in Trump’s inauguration audience, knows that this will be a tax on American consumers. Along with any deportations the administration manages, this will prove to be deeply inflationary. So all those people complaining about the price of eggs? Buckle down—it’s about to get much worse. Also, there’s already an “External Revenue Service.” It’s thecustomspart of the U.S.Customsand Border Protection agency. Put a pin on this one. Itwon’t age well. Cruelty will certainly be the official policy of the United States. I’m gonna have to research what “radical political theories” he’s talking about. Is itwomen in combat? I bet it’s women in combat roles. Our armed forces are facing arecruiting crisis. Trump wants to make it worse. I’m laughing too! Trump’s a loon. He also claims he’ll take back thePanama Canal. But remember, he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, as he threatens Panama (andGreenland and Denmark, andCanada, among other allies). He wants to keep kids disease-free … and yet he wantsa vaccine denierto lead the Department of Health and Human Services … all while being the dude wholovesMcDonald’s. He wants his legacy to be peace, and nothing says “peace” more than actual, literal imperialism. So … is his vision of “unity” and “peace” actually more like “world conquest”? Sure seems that way. Because nothing says “angry, violent, and totally unpredictable” like Trump himself and his MAGA movement. Indeed, if there’sanythingwe are sure to see over the next four years it’s more anger, violence, and unpredictability, courtesy of Trump. That is already his legacy, andeverythinghe is pushing for—deportations, inflationary tariffs, anti-trans hate, and imperialism—will only further cement that legacy.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 17:00:09,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298037/-Trump-s-speech-raises-the-old-question-Is-he-evil-or-merely-stupid
Trump hit with barrage of lawsuits over his lawless Day 1 actions,"Just hours into his second term, Donald Trump has been hit with multiple different lawsuits. The lawsuits are challenging his spate of lawless executive orders that hesigned from a big boy deskin front of a crowd of his economically anxious supporters wholeft thousands of dollars worth of their belongingsoutside of the Capitol One Arena Monday afternoon. The lawsuits target everything from Trump'sblatantly unconstitutional executive orderthat reinterprets the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, to his toothless Department of Government Efficiency advisory commission. And more lawsuitscould be on the way. The ACLUsuedTrump over his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, which is plainly guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump’s executive order states that the 14th Amendment doesn’t apply to people born to undocumented parents, and thus those people should not be given birth certificates. From theorder: The ACLU said in its lawsuit that this order violates the Supreme Court’s ruling inUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark. “The Supreme Court conclusively determined that all children born in the United States are citizens, subject only to very limited exceptions,” the ACLU lawsuit said of theWong Kim Arkdecision. “This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans,” Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,saidin a statement. “We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail.” Trump’s executive order creatingDOGE, meanwhile, was hit with three lawsuits, all of which allege that the fake government department violates theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which defines how such committees operate. The public interest law firm National Security Counselors was first out the gate in suing the advisory commission led by co-President andNazi saluterElon Musk. (DOGE was also supposed to be led by billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but Ramaswamy was reportedlyoustedbefore his job even began. He is preparing to launch a bid for governor in Ohio, as his fetish for losing elections can’t be suppressed.) The NSC lawsuitsaysthat under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, DOGE is considered a “federal advisory committee"" and thus must ""be balanced in terms of points of view represented,"" have public meetings held with 15 days of advance notice and have minutes available to the public. DOGE follows none of those rules. Asecondlawsuit from six public interest groups, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also alleges that DOGE violates FACA. ""DOGE’s unchecked secrecy, access, and private influence—bought by political loyalty—is anathema to efficient, effective government. Indeed, any federally endorsed, but fundamentally private, advisory effort to shape how our government serves the American people must comply with federal transparency laws, including FACA. Defendants have not done so,” the lawsuit states. And athirdsuit from Public Citizen, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the American Federation of Government Employees, also says DOGE is in violation of FACA. “AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,” American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelleysaidin a statement. Finally, the National Treasury Employees Union filedsuitover Trump'sexecutive orderthat seeks to make it easier for him to fire federal employees. “When establishing hiring principles, Congress determined that most federal government jobs be in the merit-based, competitive service. And it established that most federal employees have due process rights if their agency employer wants to remove them from employment. Because the Policy/Career Executive Order attempts to divest federal employees of these due process rights, it is contrary to congressional intent,” the lawsuit states. “This order is about administering political loyalty tests to everyday employees in the federal workforce who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve their country,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in astatementto Bloomberg Law. Of course, Trump doesn't care about following the law, as he thinks he is above it, so it's unclear if he would even follow court orders that arise from these lawsuits. Already, he is blatantly violatingthe law that banned TikTokby signing an executive orderpausingthe app ban. NPRreported: So much for Republicans being the party of law and order.

Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of “law and order,” one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump’s pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost “patriots” and “hostages” in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned,” he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump’s actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio’s caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump’s action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading “Camp Auschwitz,” referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump’s action. “One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,” Gonelltold HuffPost. “It’s a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It’s a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again.” Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, “This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump’s pardons,writing, “President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists.”  One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that “these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.” The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.’s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “I don't think it's causing much controversy.” She later added, “President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system.” Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.

Why is Trump stockpiling so much cash?,"Business leaders and wealthy donors are surrendering to President Donald Trump’s demands for more money, and his team said it expects to amass an eye-popping $500 million by summer. According toAxios, Trump is hoarding cash partly because he doesn’t want his second administration to be seen as a lame duck, even though he’s constitutionally prohibited from running again. Of course, the fundraising efforts will benefit Trump first and foremost. With half a billion dollars in his coffers, Trump could surely continue wielding control over the GOP, using the money to punish his dissenters. “The money is just pouring in at Mar-a-Lago. Trump doesn’t have to lift a finger. Everyone’s coming to him,” one anonymous Trump adviser told Axios. The adviser added that Trump’s team is “on track” to raise $500 million by June. “It’s sort of a target but it’s just a realistic projection of what’s happening.” The money is feeding into several accounts, including Trump’s inauguration fund, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, the Securing American Greatness nonprofit, the Republican National Committee, and the fund for Trump’s future presidential library. While it’s been thoroughly reported that business and tech moguls aremajor Trump donorsand were beingrewarded with plum seatsat Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, people from the cryptocurrency industry are blowing them out of the water. A Trump adviser told Axios that “crypto guys” were giving as much as $20 million. Notably, it’s not just tech and crypto bros added to Trump’s treasure trove of cash. The donors come from a wide range of industries—from agriculture and insurance to finance to health care. These donations are a stark change from what we saw four years ago, when some companiespledged to rethink or withholdtheir donations from Republican lawmakers whovoted to overturnthe results of the 2020 election. While many of those companies later resumed their donations, Trump apparently kept a list of those who didn’t and is reminding them thatthey’ll only get richer once he’s back in the White House. “You guys made this amount of money last year and you’re gonna make so much more now because of me,” Trump told the representatives of one company, according to Axios. Trump is also apparently holding a grudge over the fact that some of the donors now knuckling under were nowhere to be found during his 2024 presidential campaign. One company’s consultant told Axios that Trump was “raking [a client and future donor] over the coals” after they paused donations. “When I needed you, where the fuck were you? You weren’t with me and maybe you were with [Vice President Kamala Harris],” Trump reportedly said. But he has made clear that his newfound treasure trove of cash won’t go toward benefitting those who donated. A second Trump adviser put it plainly: “He’ll take your money and then tell you, ‘I don't give a fuck what you want.’ He did that during the campaign. … He’s going to do what he wants, what the base wants.” This hasn’t stopped the donations from pouring in, however. Axios reported that some donors are holding out hope that getting back on Trump’s good side—even if they don’t get any tangible legislative rewards for their giving—is worth it. After all, getting on Trump’s bad side is known to negatively affect companies,just look at Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Plus, in the words of one anonymous lobbyist who spoke with Axios, these companies don’t want to “get DOGE’d” by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have threatened tocut an unspecified amountof federal spending once they’re co-leading thetoothlessadvisory commission known as the Department of Government Efficiency. With all this money stockpiled—and the abilityto keep raking it in—Trump will surely use it to punish his enemies, reward those who are loyal to him, and help Republicans keep power in Washington, D.C., where they hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate. In life, and in politics especially,money is power. With this, Trump can continue his reign as de facto leader of the GOP for not only his next four years in the White House but also long afterward.

9 Trump inauguration promises that won't lower the price of your eggs,"After not putting his hand on the Bible as he took the oath of office, Donald Trump gave an extremely dark and lie-filledinaugural addresson Monday in which he rattled off a list of his priorities—none of which will lower prices for Americans, as he promised to do.  In his speech, Trump bragged about hisnarrowvictory, whined that he’s been “challenged more than any president in our 250-year history,” and ultimately declared that God himself saved Trump so he could “make America great again”—a totally humble thing to say. He then went on to list his priorities, most of which were either immigration-related or meaningless gestures meant to hurt vulnerable populations or make him feel macho. In fact, after the official speech was over, Trump spoke to an overflow crowd of his supporters—who were kept out of the Capitol Rotunda where the speech took place so that the cadre ofbillionaire tech brosTrump pals around with could get front-row seats—telling them that his advisers really wanted him to talk more about inflation, but he refused. ""How many times can you say an apple has doubled in cost?"" Trumpsaid,in a rambling speech in which he went on to complain about his 2024 victory again and said he would have won California if it were not for fraud—a complete lie.   In any event, here are the promises Trump made in his inaugural address that won't help your pocketbook and could actually make your finances worse: ""I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,” Trump said, invoking the Nazi-esque language about immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border.   Deploying troops to deal with immigrants at the border willcost taxpayers money, and likely won’t make a difference as it islegalto seek asylum in the U.S. “America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it,” Trump declared. “We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.” Contrary to what Trump said, America is already producing a record amount of crude oil, and is currently the lead oil producer in the world for thesixth consecutive year. What’s more, experts say his “drill, baby, drill” policy won’t actually lower prices. “This will likely have little to no impact on #gasprices or fuel prices in the short-term, as a President can de-regulate, but there is no direct action that can be issued requiring oil companies to raise production,” Patrick De Haan, a gas prices expert,wrotein a post on X. “I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” Trump said. “For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues that will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources.”  Of course, foreign countries do not pay tariffs. Companies in the United States that import goods pay the tariffs, and then they pass those added costs down to consumers, raising prices and causing inflation to soar. Hisnew tariff policywill be destructive to the economy, and your pocketbook. “After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,” Trump said. There’s already a thing called the First Amendment that protects speech, so it’s unlikely a toothless executive order will do anything more than give Trump a piece of paper to sign at hisbig boy desk. “As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,” Trump said. This declaration will literally do nothing to make your daily life better, and instead will only hurt transgender Americans, who are already at risk of beingtargets of violenceanddiscrimination. Trump wants to look macho by declaring he will unilaterally change the name of a major body of water. How will this help you, you ask?  It won’t. It’s literally a meaningless gesture. It was such a dumb promise that Hillary Clinton was seen laughing out loud in the audience.  “We will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mt. McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs,” Trump said. “President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” Alaskans, where Denali is located,don’t even want this, but that’s not stopping Trump from using his Sharpie to sign an executive order to make him feel like he’s accomplishing something. “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken,” Trump said. “The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.”  There’s a lot to unpack here. First, American ships are being charged the same as other ships in the canal. And second,China is not operating the canal. Trump has been telling this lie for weeks, leading Panamanian President José Mulino todeclarepublicly, “There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God. The world is free to visit the canal.” Trump eventhreatened to use military forceto take back the canal, which would violate Trump’s other inaugural speech promise of not starting any wars. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pointed out that conflicting message after Trump’s inaugural address. “He pledged to be a president of peace and not start any new wars but also pledged to forcibly take another country’s territory,” Maddowsaid. “And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars,” Trump said, a line that really got co-President Elon Musk going.  If this speech is any indication, the next four years are going to be so incredibly stupid. Just 1,461 days to go.

DOGE makes its first cut as 'co-chair' Ramaswamy reportedly dumped,"Awkward entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamyalready appears to be outat the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, multiple media outletsreported, not even making it to Day 1 of the toothless advisory commission. According to CBS News, Ramaswamy is expected to depart the pretend department, after he pissed off Elon Musk, a fellow awkward rich dude who Donald Trumpjointly taskedwith leading the entity that’s supposed to find ways to slash the federal budget. CBS News reported that Ramaswamy was lazy and hasn't been working on the project, leading to friction with Musk. ""Vivek has worn out his welcome,"" an unnamed ""person close to Trump""toldCBS. Rather than actually doing the work to find the $2 trillion in cuts to the budget that he and Musk promised to make, Ramaswamy has instead been trying to get himself a role as an elected official. He had reportedlywanted to be appointedto the Ohio Senate seat vacated by JD Vance, but the current Ohio governor snubbed him andchose someone else. Now, Ramaswamy has his sights set on Ohio’s governorship, and could announce his candidacy for that by the end of the month, Fox Newsreported. There’s nothing Ramaswamy—who ran a failed bid for president in 2024—likes more than losing elections, it seems. As for the future of DOGE, Musk has alreadyadmittedthat the commission, which is not a real department and has no actual power, likely won't even get to half of the $2 trillion in cuts he once promised. And the Washington Postreportedthat DOGE is expected to be sued by the public interest law firm National Security Counselors within minutes of Trump’s swearing in. According to the Post’s report: All in all, not a very auspicious start for the DOGE bros. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Musk and Ramaswamyhad said they would cut $2 billion from the budget. The number is actually $2 trillion.

Meet the unlikely Democrats who could revive the weary party,"Democrats have a long four years ahead of them. Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential election loss finds the party in a wake of theories, finger-pointing, and hopeful ideas for how to reignite a fire in voters’ bellies. Part of this quest starts with the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the effort to elect Democrats to positions at the federal, state, and local levels. In other words, the DNC amplifies the message of the Democratic Party as a whole. Following the resignation of DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, Democrats are seeking tofind a new leaderwho excels in areas where the party fell short. A main area in need of improvement: engaging disinterested or alreadyexhausted voters. On Tuesday night, the DNC chair candidatesmet with CHORUS, a teamof progressive online creators, for afirst-of-its-kind forumin an attempt to do just that—and according to the statistics, they succeeded. A real-time poll during the event showed that 85% of the people tuning into the livestream were watching a DNC forum for the first time The candidates vying for the chair position include:Wisconsin Democratic chair Ben Wikler; Minnesota party chair Ken Martin; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; 2022 Arkansas congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; self-help guru Marianne Williamson; New York state Sen. James Skoufis; and attorney Jason Paul. While most of these candidates might be unfamiliar to most Americans, the online creators who moderated the forum gave their collective millions of followers an opportunity to get to know them.  As the chart above shows, a Civiqs poll of Democrats showed that 64% of respondents feel “scared, depressed, or angry” about “the way things are going in the United States today.” Grappling with a growing number of weary and burnt-out voters following this last election cycle, the Democratic Party is looking toward creators as a way to inform, educate, and reengage the party base. Creator and political commentator Zack Kirk, known as theZacktiviston social media, told Daily Kos that he was shocked by how misinformed many people online are. “I've been baffled and was blindsided by the lack of understanding [people have] around how government works,” he told us. And as conservativeonline creators and podcastersrallied and enraged the right over the past four years, left-leaning creators such as Kirk realize more than ever the importance of educating and motivating their side’s online community. This is where his own content comes in. Kirk—whose full-time job doesn’t include politics and content creation—spends his free time thinking about how and where to best relate to his community. Identifying as someone who puts the “well-being of people” before politics, Kirk’s style of delivering political news and commentary offers something that traditional media such as MSNBC typically does not: a solution. Instead of reporting on the doom and gloom of MAGA wins, Kirk intends to flip the narrative. “[I will] continue to deliver information to my network, to my communities, that will give them ways of coping and surviving,” he said, adding that he plans to “uplift the stories that are being missed” in the sea of Trump news. For those looking for reprieve and connection when scrolling on their phone, stories that aren’t screaming of negative breaking news might serve as an avenue back into political engagement. Another benefit of these creator-led political discussions for the Democratic Party is the ability to highlight communities in America that may not always get air time in mainstream media. “Raise your hand if you know who the 92% are,” creator Elizabeth Booker-Houston asked the DNC chair candidates Tuesday night. The lawyer, professor, comedian, and content creator was referring to thepercentage of Black womenwho voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Notably, only one candidate raised their hand when asked the question. Telling the panel of candidates that ""Black women are exhausted” and quipping that Baltimore is “too Black and too scary for Republicans,” Booker-Houston is but one example of a left-leaning creator who authentically appeals and relates to a base of Democratic voters sometimes viewed as forgotten. But as the countdown inches closer to Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Democrats—and the DNC chair nominees—unanimously agree on one thing: The Democratic Party’s approach isn’t working anymore, and it’s time to embrace new left-friendly media sources. If you ask Kirk, Democrats have their work cut out for them. “We're at ground zero,” he said. “No one has emerged as a definitive voice of the Democratic Party or the resistance to what Trump is going to do. No one's giving a counter.” A vote for the new DNC chair is scheduled for Feb. 1, and while a front-runner hasn’t emerged just yet, one thing is for sure—Democrats can’t afford to ignore the power of influencers.

What migration to red states could mean for the Democratic Party,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a significantpopulation shifthas been underway, led chiefly by millennials and Gen Z Americans who aremovingfrom urban to rural areas. This could spell trouble for the Democratic Party, which has historically depended on voters in dense and progressive cities and states. As thepopulationsin states like California, New York, and Illinois decline, these once-solidly blue states could face an existential crisis as they are no longer the reliable powerhouses they once were. Meanwhile, conservative southern states like Texas and Florida are gaining new residents. This could dramatically shift the balance of political power, making blue states less competitive and red states more influential. According to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, if these migration patterns continue through the 2030 Census, California will lose four Congressional seats and New York will lose two. In total, states that went to Kamala Harris in 2024 could lose a dozen House seats and Electoral College votes, making the path for Democrats even more difficult. The concept ofcritical mass theoryis that collective political action requires a “critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body.” It’s no secret that rural areas tend to be red, while urban areas are typically blue. The migration trend, while unsettling for Democrats, isn't all bad news. If it continues, the party could have an opportunity to reshape these growing, historically conservative regions into states in play. But this won’t happen overnight. First, Democrats might experience a significant loss of voters in blue states as people migrate to red states. Only after reaching a “critical mass” of voters in these conservative areas will Democrats have the chance to make an impact. However, parties can’t base their fundraising and strategies on wait-and-sees. Right now, Democrats are looking at North Carolina and, yes, even Texas, where there was a close Senate race in 2024—with Colin Allred losing by less than a million votes to Ted Cruz—to build a platform on the economic issues that got Donald Trump his populist base. As time passes and migration patterns continue, baby boomers will give way to a new generation of rural voters who Democrats could sweep up. But it would be a mistake to ignore the issues that impact the majority of Americansnow, like student debt, sky-high housing prices, the climate crisis, and expensive health care. There are many reasons why people migrate. The pandemic caused aboom in remote workthat, combined withrising rental costsin cities, made it easier for people to relocate to more affordable rural areas. Trends like “cottage core” and “trad wife” that have become popular among millennials and Gen Z have idealized homesteads and rural living. Some might argue that the great migration is simply a result of anoverworked,exhausted, anddisillusionedgeneration of Americans whowant to quitthe rat race. Migration could also be due, in part, to the drastic changes in cities as a result of the pandemic. What was once a bustling nightlife scene has given way toshuttered small businesses, leading to a more solitary lifestyle. Similarly, as rents increase, young people are priced out of homeownership, and wages don't keep up, people are opting to live in places where they can get more for their money. Democrats haven’t achieved a significant victory in the South since former PresidentJimmy Carterin the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the GOP staked out the long game, successfully implementingits southern strategyand winning all of those states in 2024. Even before its defeat in November, the Democratic Party recalibrated, adhering to its loss of the South and instead focusing on trying to win the Midwest’s “Blue Wall”—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. But as the electorate has shifted, it’s no longer enough to win the White House without the support of some southern states. How will the party that is redlining itself reclaim rural voters, especially ones in the South who’ve gone devout MAGA? And will these migration trends solidify Democrats’ decline in traditionally blue states, or will they become an opportunity to shift the political landscape in red states? The answers are still unknown, but how the Democratic Party adapts to these population changes will determine where it goes from here.

Explaining the Right: The imaginary scourge of noncitizen voting,"Republicans in multiple states are pushing for federal legislation to address noncitizen voting, something they insist is an urgent matter requiring intervention at the highest levels of the government. But the problem does not really exist and is a smokescreen for rules, regulations, and practices that help Republicans win elections. Earlier this week, 12 of the state chairs for the right-wing State Freedom Caucus Networksent a letterto congressional leaders pushing for passage of the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act.” The law, proposed by Republicans, purports to close loopholes allowing for noncitizen voting. “The states continue to face the prospect of a huge population of noncitizens illegally voting in our elections and potentially affecting the outcome,” the letter alleges. “We must close the loopholes that put the integrity of our elections at risk. We need the SAVE Act to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections.” This isfalse. First, it’salready illegalfor noncitizens to vote in federal elections. If a noncitizen even registers to vote, they could face up to five years in prison. Ina studyconducted by the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, researchers could find only 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting in the 2016 election, comprising 0.0001% of votes that were cast in those jurisdictions. That number includes onlypotentialnoncitizen votes—notcases that have been investigated and determined to be ineligible. Not only is noncitizen votingextremely rare, it’s also not coordinated by any groups in a way to systematically control the outcomes of elections. Additionally, civil rights groupshave calledthe SAVE Act “unnecessary and dangerous,” and said it “is intended to elicit irrational fear of the growing number of citizens of color.” But the issue is just one of the latest ways Donald Trump and other Republican officialsarefearmongeringaround immigration. Similarly, right-wing media outlets, like Fox News and Newsmax, havemade storiesabout the purported problem a staple of their programming. Promoting these lies creates an environment where voter-suppression laws and regulations can thrive. When these rules are in place, eligible voters have then beenbarred from voting, and frequently when election turnout is low,that has favoredthe political fortunes of the Republican Party (but it is not the case in every election). Noncitizen voting is also a convenient boogeyman for the right.Conservative ideasand candidates are often unpopular, but instead of confronting this lack of appeal, the right can simply blame noncitizens—a population they demonize anyway—for their loss. Trumpdid this in 2017, when he falsely claimed that his popular-vote loss to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was the fault of undocumented immigrants. Campaigning against an imaginary wave of noncitizen voting serves many purposes for the right: It rallies supporters against migrants, it pushes laws that help Republicans, and it excuses Republican losses in elections. The core issue is made up, but the effects are unfortunately very real.

Here’s the moment Mark Zuckerberg gave away the game,"Like the rest of the tech billionaire class, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided to give up any pretense of ethics in order to cozy up to President-elect Donald Trump. ZuckerbergkilledMeta’s fact checking andendedall of the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. In order to do some damage control—and to audition for the Trump administration’s favor—Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan’s podcast, which has become a forum for billionaires to act aggrieved as theytake control of the country. When Rogan asked Zuckerberg to elaborate on how he has become a victim of  a politicized government, Zuckerberg rambled on. “So we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like I think like the CFPB like, this, financial—I don't even know what it stands for. It's the … it's the financial organization that Elizabeth Warren had set up. And, and it's basically, it's like, we're not a bank,” he said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which started under theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, has beeninvestigating Metaover allegations that it misuses private data for financial gain. The idea that Zuckerberg doesn’t know what the CFPB is or that it doesn’t exclusively involve banks (having alsoinvestigatedApple, Amazon, Google, etc.) is incredibly disingenuous. He’s either so outrageously dumb that shareholders must force him to leave the business, or he’s lying on Rogan’s show for a reason. “They kind of found some theory they wanted to investigate. And it’s like, okay, clearly they were trying really hard, right? To like, to like, find, find some theory, but it, like, I don’t know. It just, it kind of, like, throughout the, the, the, the, the party and the government, there was just sort of, I don’t know if it’s, I don’t know how this stuff works. I mean, I’ve never been in government,” Zuckerberg told Rogan. Is the CEO of Meta talking about the CFPB’s investigation? Or maybe he’s talking about theupcoming anti-trust trialbetween Meta and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Since Trump’s first term, Meta has been fighting to keep anti-trust laws from breaking up its control of Facebook and Instagram. Outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khantold CNBCthat she wasn’t surprised companies like Meta are trying to “get some type of sweetheart deal” from the incoming Trump administration. While on Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg cravenly appealed to the insecure and aggrieved male audience,telling Roganthat the “corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,” before arguing that “masculine energy” was lacking in the workforce today. “It’s one thing to say we want to be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it’s another to basically say that 'masculinity is bad,’” he said. According toThe New York Times, the ever-masculine Zuckerberg followed that up a few days later by throwing his former COO Sheryl Sandberg under the bus for Meta’s previous DEI policies. Zuckerberg has secured hisspecial VIP seatat Trump’s inauguration, along with fellow oligarchs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Now he just needs all of those pesky consumer protection watchdogs to go away.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 18:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297478/-Here-s-the-moment-Mark-Zuckerberg-gave-away-the-game
Trump and his goons are already bailing on mass deportation pledge,"Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign emphasized two key promises far and beyond any others: to lower grocery costs—and inflation overall—and to enforce mass deportations of scary brown and Black immigrants (even those who are in the country legally). Already, Trump hasshrugged his shouldersat the first promise, saying there’s little he can actually do to lower prices. ""Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,” he said. Now Trump’s “Border Czar” Tom Homan is also walking back his mass deportation promise. CNNreportedearlier this week that Homan has been privately telling Republican lawmakers that deporting millions of immigrants might be a tad … impossible. “We are not having a discussion about 20 million [deportations],” Rep. Darrell Issa, Republican of California, told CNN. “We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation.” The expectation, of course, is that the federal government has nowhere near enough manpower or funding to expel that many immigrants. In fact, the American Immigration Councilhas estimatedthat it would cost nearly $1 trillion (with a “t”) to deport that many undocumented immigrants over a decade. Suffice it to say, this government isn’t scaring up an extra $88 billion this year to get the ball rolling. Democrats might not even need the filibuster to stop such a monstrosity in the Senate. As I’vewritten before, the reality is that mass deportations only work with the assistance of local and state law enforcement. The U.S. Border Patrol only has 20,000 agents, 17,000 of whom patrol the border (that isn’t about to stop, is it?). And as the CNN article cites, Homan said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has only 6,000 officers—not nearly enough to deport millions of people. As Trump’s former Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgansaid in an interview with Stateline, “It’s not going to be successful, as long as we have sanctuary cities and states that refuse to allow local and state police departments to work with ICE.” That’s all well and good in places like Texas and Florida, where 6.4% and 5% of the population is undocumented, respectively. While local authorities might love to help the feds raid cities like Houston, Dallas, and Orlando, there are still millions of undocumented immigrants in sanctuary states like California, Illinois, and New York. So while Trump could achieve some small-scale deportations, he doesn’t have the resources for high-profile raids. Even in rural America, where farmers depend on the labor of undocumented immigrants, local politicians and industry groups (all Republicans, mind you) aresounding the alarm, warning of economic devastation if the feds—with or without local help—move in. So what is Trump to make of this? Xenophobia has been a key pillar in Trump’s reelection, and his party has gleefully followed along. But this is also the same party that pretends (sometimes) to care about budget deficits and the national debt, which would explode with an additional $1 trillion in expenses. While most Republicans don’t care about such things when they are in power, the razor-thin GOP margin in the House means it wouldn’t take many of them to derail these efforts. And those aren’t the only costs to deportation. “It will cost a lot to deport. But guess what? It will also save a lot. And it’ll be a net benefit,” hard-right xenophobic Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona told CNN. There is a false yet religiously held belief in right-wing circles that undocumented immigrants are costing good, hardworking Americans billions in tax dollars. The reality is the exact opposite: Those immigrants pay payroll and income taxes on their earnings, yet they’re ineligible for most public programs. “Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2 to 6.8 percent,” according to the American Immigration Council. “It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.” That’s a one-way flow of money, with none of it coming back to undocumented workers. So what exactly are these “savings” that Biggs is talking about? I looked hard, and the best I could find isstuff like thisfrom Fox News: “President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan will be a ‘cost savings’ for the American people, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, responding to a warning from the Wall Street Journal that carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in history could bear a hefty price tag. [The Biden administration] is paying for free airline tickets around the country, free hotel rooms at $500 bucks a night, free education, free medical care, and that's in perpetuity."" Note that they can’t find math to support their theory that undocumented immigrants are costing taxpayers money, just that theenforcementof immigration laws is costing money. Well, that won’t change no matter how many people are deported—people who, by the way,aren’tbeing given “free airline tickets around the country” or staying in any “free hotel rooms.” So what now? Republicans hope that tough anti-immigration rhetoric leads to “self-deportation,” but the existence of sanctuary states complicates things. If anything, internal migration from hostile states like Texas and Florida to sanctuary states like California and Illinois is far more likely. Meanwhile, the demand for labor will be off the charts as thecharred toxic remainsof more than 10,000 homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and other structures in Los Angeles are cleaned up and rebuilt. The potential flow of immigrants from red states to blue ones won’t just help the economies of those welcoming them with open arms, but it would also decimate local economies in hostile red states, driving up the costs of food, hospitality, and construction—among other things. Expelling or driving out millions of their residents could also alter thedemographicsthat have allowed Florida and Texas to gain up to eight congressional seats at the expense of mostly blue states. That might not be such a bad outcome after all.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 16:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297143/-Trump-and-his-goons-are-already-bailing-on-mass-deportation-pledge
Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of “law and order,” one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump’s pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost “patriots” and “hostages” in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned,” he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump’s actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio’s caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump’s action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading “Camp Auschwitz,” referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump’s action. “One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,” Gonelltold HuffPost. “It’s a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It’s a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again.” Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, “This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump’s pardons,writing, “President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists.”  One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that “these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.” The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.’s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “I don't think it's causing much controversy.” She later added, “President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system.” Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.

Trump's tiny inauguration is making MAGA morons lose their minds,"Donald TrumpannouncedFriday that his inaugurationwill be held indoorsdue to harsh weather concerns. Now, instead of hundreds of thousands of Trump voters gathering at the U.S. Capitol to watch their president begin his second term, they’ll instead be ushered to the Capital One Arena about a mile away where they can watch from …  a jumbotron. “We made all of the plans and all of the arrangements to come up and be a part of this event, and … it’s kind of a bummer,” Jose Granado toldNBC News. We might as well stay at home and watch it on TV. I’m kind of disappointed, to be honest with you,” Ken Robinson, who traveled from Oklahoma with his family, said. “We came here to watch it in person. We don’t really care to watch it on a jumbotron.” Traveling to watch the swearing in isn’t cheap. Hotel rates around Washington, D.C., are around $500 per night the weekend leading up to Trump’s inauguration. However, the Trump administration is handing out its condolences to supporters by allowing them to hold onto their now “commemorative” tickets. But it isn’t just average MAGA supporters getting the short end of the stick. Some of Trump’s wealthy donors have reportedly been cut from the in-person ceremony, given the limited number of seats in the rotunda. Instead, as The New York Times reporter Teddy Schleiferwrote, some of Trump’s donors will be escorted to a suite at the Capitol One Arena. Of course, Trump’s tech sugar daddies and burgeoningoligarchyhaveVIP seatingfor the inauguration, and all it took wasseveral millionsdonated to the convicted felon’s inaugural fund. Looks like Trump’s inauguration is only available for in-person viewing if you’re a part of the White House or wealthy enough tobuy your way in. But it isn’t just his everyday supporters who are taken aback by the news. Even MAGA talking heads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia questioned the decision. “I have personally attended countless rallies where President Trump spoke in extreme weather conditions from cold to rain to heat,” shewrote on X. “Is there a security threat other than extreme cold temperatures? Not only for him but for the people?” Even MAGA conspiracy loon Glenn Beck had his theories about why Trump made the call to move everything indoors. ""These guys are under such threat. This is 'Jason Bourne' stuff,"" hesaid. Beck went on to imply that, due to Trump's shakedown of the ""power structure"" of government, conditions during the inauguration might not be safe for him. It’s unclear if he is implying that members of the U.S. government would target Trump. Trump’s last-minute decision means thatmonths of security planninghave been scrapped. Instead, the Secret Service and other security officials have three days to prepare for the new plan. The last president to be sworn in indoors was Ronald Reagan, when temperatures dipped down to 7 degrees in 1985. But you’d think MAGA supporters would be prepared for D.C.’s January weather, given that many of themmade the tripfour years ago.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 01:01:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297520/-Trump-s-tiny-inauguration-is-making-MAGA-morons-lose-their-minds
Democrats demand tech bros explain cash being tossed at Trump,"Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado sentlettersto tech company CEOs at OpenAI, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Uber about their or their companies’ million-dollar donations to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund. In each letter, the senators remind the tech giants that their generous donations come at a suspicious time as their industry has “come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition.” “We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,” the letter reads. Some of those big-money donations come from people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, whose companyreportedly donated at least $1 millionto Trump’s inauguration. But as Warren and Bennet explained in theletterto the Amazon CEO, his company “is the subject of multiple ongoing regulatory actions, including multiple Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suits related to anticonsumer and anticompetitive practices, a Department of Justice (DOJ).” Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi donated acombined $2 millionto Trump’s inaugural fund. “The company is the subject of an ongoing FTC investigation for predatory practices,” Warren and Bennet wrote in their letter to him, referring to the recentinvestigationinto the ride-hailing company’s subscription and cancelation policies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmandonated$1 million to Trump. And the senators’ letter to him details how his company is under both an FTC investigation concerning itsconsumer practicesas well asone from the Securities and Exchange Commissionconcerning its investors. Googledonated $1 millionto Trump’s fund, and CEO Sundar Pichai was reminded by Warren and Bennet that the search giant “was found by a federal court to have an illegal monopoly over the online search market.” Google haspromised to appeal the ruling, and it will be up to Trump’s Department of Justice to decide whether to contest its appeal. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gotits $1 million in early—after limiting political news on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2024 election. All this clearly seems done in order to ingratiate Zuckerberg and his company to Trump. Meta is facing aFTC antitrust lawsuit in April.  According toDemocracy Now, Trump's inauguration committee has raised upward of $250 million. To put into perspective, before Trump’s inaugural committee raised more than $100 million during his first go-round, the largest amount of money ever spent on an inauguration was President Barack Obama, who reportedly raised $50 million. Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the consumer-rights group Public Citizen, reports that much of that money has been donated by billionaires, such as the tech CEOs whom Warren and Bennet sent the letters to. Many of the CEOs who received letters from the senators areexpected to attend Trump’s inaugurationon Monday, and have beengiven VIP status for the day. And it cost them only a drop in their buckets.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 00:00:16,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297500/-Democrats-demand-tech-bros-explain-cash-being-tossed-at-Trump
Trump’s family wastes no time profiting off of Daddy's second term,"Albania has given preliminary approval to Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a$1.4 billionluxury hotel complexon an abandoned military base. The deal raises eyebrows, given Trump will oversee foreign policy for Albania and has atrack recordofseeking revengewhen people or businesses don’t do what he wants. The hotel will be built on a 111-acre section of the 2.2-square-mile island of Sazan, which can be reached by ferry from Albania’s mainland. Ivanka Trump—who hassworn off politics—is apparently also working on the project. “The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest in investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,” a spokesman for Albania Prime Minister Edi Rama told The New York Times last year. Kushner’s private equity company, Affinity Partners, was also given preliminary approval for a luxury hotel complex in Serbia, another country with vested interest in U.S. relations. While the Albanian government insists that its only motive behind approving the hotel is tourism, Albania and Serbia both havepending foreign policy matterswith the United States as theyattempt to jointhe European Union. The United States also has a vested interest inbolstering its relationshipwith Serbia to sway the country from supporting Russia. Kushner started Affinity Partners after he left hiscontroversial White House roleduring Trump’s first term, during which he established relationships with the Middle East and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who provided Kushner’s firm $2 billion from a sovereign wealth fund. Kushner’s hotel venture is just one example of questionable business deals circling Trump’s family leading up to his inauguration. Trump's real estate company met last week to discussreclaimingits former Washington, D.C., hotel, which has been owned by Hilton since the Trump family sold the lease rights in 2022 for $375 million. During Trump’s first term, Democrats claimed that his financial stake violated a constitutional provision known as theForeign Emoluments Clause. Should the family buy back the hotel, this would revive concerns. The perks rolling in for Trump’s family are hardly shocking considering his first term. For example, in 2018, Chinagranted 18 trademarksto companies tied to Ivanka and her father over a two-month span. Sixteen of those went to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, raising her total of trademarks in China at the time to 34 for products such as handbags and sunglasses. Trump’s other children have alsobenefited immenselyfrom business,real-estatedeals, and other ventures since 2016. Now they’re at it again, and their father hasn’t even taken office yet.

Trump-loving tech bro reportedly set to run for Ohio governor,"Failed Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to run for governor of Ohio. The news comes shortly after he attacked American culture for purportedly celebrating “mediocrity.” The Washington Post reportsthat multiple sources close to Ramaswamy say an announcement is soon to come and that the statement “is drafted.” Ramaswamy was a candidate for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination in 2024 but attracted very little support. Hereceived only 0.4% of the votein the primaries and was awarded just three delegates (of the1,215 needed to win the nomination). By contrast, Donald Trump received 76% of the vote and over 2,000 delegates on his way to securing the nomination. Despite a reported behind-the-scenes push from Trump, Ramaswamywas passed overby Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who announced that Lt. Gov Jon Husted would be appointed to the Senate vacancy created bynow-formerSen. JD Vance, who was elected vice president. Currently, Ramaswamyis set to co-chairthe proposed Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk, an essentially powerless advisory commission created by Donald Trump. The two billionaires will purportedly use the group tocut government spendingonsocial programswhile also advocating for tax cuts for the wealthy. After being tapped to co-lead DOGE, Ramaswamy made his most recent controversial remarks. In December, Muskdefendedthe use of H-1B visas to bring in skilled immigrant labor, a practice that many anti-immigrant Republicans oppose, when Ramaswamy weighed in. “Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,”he wrote. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.” Ramaswamy went on to cite the media portrayal of several nerdy characters on 1990s sitcoms as evidence of his claim. The comments provoked the ire of many, including fellow failed Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley,who wrotein response, “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture.” When he isn’t calling American culture mediocre, Ramaswamy has been afrequent promoterof debunked conspiracy theories. He claimed that the federal government was involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and called it an “inside job.” Ramaswamy also alleged that the 2020 election wasstolen by “big tech,”and theorized that the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged to help President Joe Biden win that year’s presidential election. On policy matters, Ramaswamy previouslyexpressed supportfor former President George W. Bush’sfailed planto privatize Social Security. Even if Ramaswamy officially announces his gubernatorial run and receives the backing of MAGA-aligned voters, it is not a sure thing that he will secure the nomination, let alone win. In 2022, Trump-backing candidate Jim Renacciran againstDeWine but failed to unseat the incumbent governor, who was then reelected. Additionally, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost,an election denier, is alsorunning. Ohio has been a reliable state for Republicans, but it is unclear if they will back a gubernatorial candidate with such a negative take on the American work ethic.

Dog killer Noem pushes immigration and wildfire lies at Senate hearing,"Dog-killingSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem fearmongered about the threat immigrants pose to the United States and lied about the California wildfires during the confirmation hearing for hernominationto lead the Department of Homeland Security Friday. As head of DHS, Noem would be in charge of Customs and Border Patrol and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps respond to natural and manmade disasters. Her answers about how she would handle both of those areas should scare everyone. During the hearing, Noem lied that the U.S. border is ""open,"" andclaimedthat ""the No. 1 threat to our homeland security is the southern border.” Of course, the border is obviously not open. In fact, border crossings havedramatically declinedin recent months, achieving similar levels as those during Donald Trump’s first term. What’s more, the head of the FBI has actuallysaidthat homegrown extremists are the biggest terror threat, and thatChina’s cyber programand its impact on U.S. infrastructure is a bigger danger to the United States than immigrants crossing the border. Aside from fearmongering about immigrants, Noem alsorefused to saywhether she'd withhold disaster relief if Trump asked her to—a relevant question as Trump and Republicans have said California should not receive financial assistance to help recover from the devastating fires. “If President Trump were to say to you, 'We’re going to withhold money from Connecticut or Michigan or any of the states, Iowa, because we don’t like the governor or we don’t like the politics of the state,' you would stand up to him and say, ‘Mr. President, we need to allocate that money’?"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked Noem. She refused to respond, saying that she couldn't answer a hypothetical question. But it’s not hypothetical, since Trumptried to do just thatduring his first term, when California was reeling from another wave of devastating wildfires. As Politicoreportedin October: “I assume you agree, withholding disaster relief is a violation of duty and law,” Blumenthal pressed Noam. “Leadership has consequences,” she said in a chilling response. Noem went on to lie about the response to California’s wildfires, claiming that somehow Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is responsible for the devastating impacts of this natural disaster—echoing the baseless claims ofTrumpand other Republicans. “I wish we would have had different leadership or a different governor in California,” Noemsaid. However,firefighters saythat humanscould nothave stopped the fires that ravaged the state. ""Wildfires like this, driven by 70 to 100 mph winds, couldn’t be 'put out' if every firefighter in the West were in Los Angeles,"" retired firefighter Riva Duncanwrotein an op-ed for MSNBC.

"Biden shows support for ERA, but does that actually mean anything?","President Joe BidenannouncedFriday that Americans should consider theEqual Rights Amendmentto be “the law of the land.” However, the last-minute effort to enshrine the 28th Amendment into the Constitution is unlikely to actually go anywhere due to its legal hurdles. “It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people,” the White House statement said. “In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.” The amendment would need to be formally signed and certified by National Archivist Colleen Shogan in order to become law. According toNPR, supporters of the ERA are expected to protest in front of the National Archives office, urging Shogan’s signature. She has previously stated that she will follow the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, which suggests that the courts or Congress must decide the amendment’s fate. To lift the1982 deadlinefor ratification, Shogan said that further action is needed—with Republicans now controlling all three branches of government, prospects for that seem bleak. Supporters of the ERA, however, believe that the amendment should have become law of the land after Virginia ratified it, making it three-fourths of states to pass it. Because of the obscurity of how to proceed, the amendment is expected to either face a long legal battle or to simply die at the hands of a GOP-led Congress. A senior Biden administration official told CNN that the president is not taking executive action but is “stating an opinion that it is ratified,” which was one crucial hurdle Shogan said needed to be cleared before signing it. “He is using his power of the presidency to make it clear that he believes—and he agrees with leading constitutional scholars and the American Bar Association—not that it should be, but it is the 28th Amendment of the Constitution,” the official said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a leader in the ERA movement,posted on XFriday in support of ratification. “President Biden’s official notice to the nation today follows clearly established precedent dating back to President Adams in 1798. The ERA is a valid part of our Constitution,” she said. If the ERA is signed by Shogan, it would enshrine protections for women and trans people who will be vulnerable during Donald Trump’s second term. But for now, the odds of it moving forward seem slim.

Trump inauguration will be too frigid even for that coldhearted man,"Afraid of a little cold weather, Donald Trump will break with years of tradition tomove his inauguration ceremony indoors. He will deliver his address inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda before joining supporters at the nearby Capital One Arena. “There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!),” Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social. Apparently, now he cares about the safety of law enforcement at the Capitol, unlikefour years ago, when he allowed those law enforcement officers to be brutally beaten by his supporters who were, at his behest, trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Trump’s swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for12 PM ET on Monday, when the temperature in Washington, D.C., is expected to be22 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with the wind chill around 8 degrees. That puts it close to the28 degree temperature and mid-teens wind chill during Barack Obama's first inauguration, in 2009, according to historical data from the National Weather Service. And Obama didn't chicken out and move the ceremony inside. Trump continued, “This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!” What’s more, in 1961 when John F. Kennedy was sworn in, it snowed 8 inches and was also 22 degrees at 12 PM ET. Yet JFK still held his inauguration outside, withnearly 1 million peoplebraving those sub-freezing temperatures to watch his swearing-in. In fact, the last time an inauguration was held indoors was 1985, when the National Weather Service says temperatures in the District of Columbia were 7 degrees, with the wind child going as low as 20 below zero—far colder than what's expected on Trump's Inauguration Day. Holding the event indoors will make it so that Trump won't get to look out at a crowd of supporters as he delivers his inaugural address, which will probably be insanely dark and xenophobic. But maybe Trump prefers an indoor ceremony. After all, he can use it and the temperature as an excuse for why a paltry number of supporters show up. Trump is infamously obsessed with crowd sizes. He often lies about the number of people who attend his campaign rallies to say that more people showed up than actually did. And no one can forget the rage he felt when his 2017 inaugural crowd wassignificantly smallerthan Obama’s in 2009. He was so mad heforcedthe National Park Service to provide images that made his crowd look as big as the ones Obama had. Ultimately, moving the inauguration inside is a real chicken move.

CNN reportedly hiding anchor who dares to call out Trump’s BS,"CNN reportedly plans to move anchor Jim Acosta, who has frequently fact checked and challenged Donald Trump’s falsehoods, to a time slot with almost no viewers. As Status Newsreported, CNN’s CEO Mark Thompson proposed that “CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta” be moved from the 10 AM ET time slot to midnight. “They want to get rid of Acosta to throw a bone to Trump,” a media executive told Status. “Midnight is not a serious offer when his ratings are among the best on the network.” If CNN goes through with this plan, it will effectively sideline someone who has provided accurate reporting on the leader of the Republican Party. Just a few days after his 2017 inauguration, Trump lied about losing the popular vote in the 2016 election to Hillary Clinton due to votes from undocumented immigrants.Acostanotedat the time that the allegation was “a falsehood, full stop.” Leading up to the 2024 election, when Republicans—led by Trump—continued to push lies about “voter fraud” in the 2020 election,Acostatoldthe chair of the Georgia Republican Party “you’re just lying” when he repeated Trump’s claims about the race. More recently,Trump claimedthat the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans was connected to immigration, citing afalse reportfrom Fox News. In an on-air discussion with a Republican strategist who pushed Trump’s false claim,Acostanotedthat the attack was “not connected” to immigration. Trump has a long history of expressing contempt for Acosta, who was CNN’s White House correspondent for much of Trump’s first term, tasked with debunking Trump and his team. In a 2018 exchange, Acosta asked Trump about his claim that a migrant caravan from Mexico was an “invasion,” noting that the characterization was false. Trump responded by calling Acosta a “rude, terrible person.” Trump supportershave echoedthis hostility. During a 2018 Trump rally, a crowd surrounded the reporter and yelled at him. Trump later shared video of the incident on his social media account. At the peak of the conflict between Acosta and Trump in 2018, the first Trump administrationpulledthe reporter’s media credentials andmade up a false storyalleging that he put his hands on an intern. A federal judge later ordered for Acosta’s pass to be restored. Back then, CNN had Acosta’s back. But now, the network appears to be joining a chorus of corporate media—including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times—who arebending to Trump’s will. Trump has expressed continual contempt for factual reporting, and hiding those who tell the truth about him is unlikely to stop during his second term. Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that Jim Acosta’s show is currently at 10 AM in the eastern time zone.

Chaos among GOP lawmakers threatens Trump's agenda—already,"Yes, Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated for a second time, but we can take solace in the fact that his agenda is already on the rocks. Republican leaders in the House and Senatestillcan’t agree on how to move forward with legislation to make good on Trump's promises. More than two months after Republicans won both chambers of Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are continuing to fight over whether to put Trump's destructive tax cuts for the rich and mass deportation agendain the same bill, or to split it into two. ""Right now, that teamwork isn’t happening. Not by a long shot,"" Politicosaidof Johnson and Thune's relationship. If Republicans can't even agree on how to move forward, forget about how difficult it will be to select the budget cuts Republicans will need to make to pass the legislation. That's because Republicans want to accomplish Trump's agenda using budget reconciliation, which will allow them to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass the bill(s) with a simple majority—i.e., just Republican votes. Butbudget reconciliation has strict limitsaround how much legislation can affect the national debt. And it will require Republicans to make cuts from other programs to fund the tax cuts and deportations. And getting Republicans to agree on what to cut from the budget will be harder than herding feral cats. Theywon't be able to lose a single votein the House, given Republicans' extremely narrow majority. Among the cuts Republicans arefloatinginclude slashing subsidies middle-class Americans to purchase Affordable Care Act plans, cutting food assistance for the poorest Americans, and making cuts to Medicaid. Good luck getting every single House Republican—including vulnerable members in swing seats—to vote for cuts like that. Even worse for Johnson is his political capital is already waning in his caucus, which will make it harder for him to twist arms and get his lawmakers to vote for whatever awful legislation ultimately emerges. That’s because Johnson pissed off many Republican lawmakers when he cowed to Trump andremovedpro-Ukraine Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. One unnamed House Republican told Fox News’ Chad Pergram that Turner may not vote for things Johnson wants to pass as a result of his ouster. “Mike’s never going to vote for another fucking thing around here again,” the unnamed House Republicansaid. “He’s mad.” What’s more, as GOP leadership quarrels about whether to put Trump’s agenda into one bill or two, Republicans are fighting over how to make the destructive legislation revenue neutral. Senate Republicans are rejecting a revenue generating proposal from House conservatives to raise the corporate tax rate, The Hillreported. “Absolutely not,” Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told The Hill, regarding that idea. Meanwhile, Democrats are watching with amusement as Republicans flail.

TikTok announces pro-Trump bash just as Supreme Court upholds ban,"TikTok has joinedthe paradeof tech companies lavishing money on the incoming Trump administration—though only TikTok faces exile from the American market on Sunday. The video social media platformwill sponsora pre-inauguration party for Donald Trump on Sunday that the company’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will reportedly attend. Pro-Trump influencers who used TikTok to promote him during the recent presidential campaign will be honored. The event is scheduled on the same day a recently passed law requires TikTok to be spun off from its Chinese owners or shut down U.S. operations—a lawupheld by the Supreme Courtin a rareunanimous opinionreleasedFriday. An official with the outgoing Biden administrationtold the Associated Pressthat the law will not be enforced in the time between taking effect Sunday and Trump’s inauguration on Monday. This effectively leaves the fate of TikTok in Trump’s hands, and his advisors have indicated that they also will not enforce the legislation. Legislation targeting the operations of a single company is extremely unusual behavior for the government. Yet the bill calling for the company’s sale had bipartisan support in Congress, and President Joe Bidensigned it into lawon April 23. The law did not successfully pressure the Chinese government to sever connections to TikTok or parent company ByteDance, andover 170 million Americanscontinue to usethe service millions of times per day. Now, both Democrats and Republicanshave apparently changedtheir positions and are wrangling behind the scenes to give the company behind the wildly popular app a reprieve. While his new stancealigns with public opinion, Trump’s about-face on TikTok is particularly notable since he was the first at the executive level to pursue government action against the company. In 2020,he issuedan executive order that required ByteDance to spin off the video service. In the order, Trump alleged there was “credible evidence” that TikTok “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” It’s likely not a coincidence that the order came at the height of Trump’s reelection campaign and thatvideos mocking himwere popular on TikTok. Trumphas often pushedfor media critical of him to be silenced or shut down. Yet when his campaign finally opened an account on the platform and quickly amassed millions of followers, Trump’s “full flop” on the platform—wherehe proudly braggedthat he was “a big star”—took root. Following Trump’s successful 2024 campaign, Facebook’s parent companyMeta said they wouldget rid of fact checkers and follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk’s X in allowing disinformation and bigoted content to circulate unchecked. With their sponsorship of the pro-Trump party, TikTok may be signaling they are also moving towards looking the other way in the face of more disinformation. “Big Tech” joining the Trump coalition—and being welcomed by Republicans—is a reversal from years and years ofthe right claiming(without evidence) that their voices were being silenced in new media. Nowadays, they are happy to take Big Tech’s money and bend the laws in their favor—or in TikTok’s case, pretend they don’t exist.

Democrats prepare to fight Trump’s Day 1 executive orders in the courts,"While Joe Biden’s presidency comes to an end on Monday, Democrats aren’t stepping down from the fight just yet, as they prepare to battle Donald Trump through the court system. The Democracy Forward Foundation, a prominent progressive legal group,announcedThursday that it will push back against Trump’s dangerous agenda by targeting his executive orders, of which he haspromisedmore than 100 on “day one.” Among Trump’s potential executive orders is a “shock and awe” strategy ofmass deportations. “We’re confident this center will be a critical resource for opposing dangerous policies in Project 2025 and other harmful and unlawful conduct,” Democracy Forward President and CEO SkyePerrymansaid in a statement. Launched in 2017, Democracy Forward is ramping up its four-year plan beginning on Inauguration Day. According to the report, it has already identified 200 potential executive orders that it will fight in the legal system as soon as Trump signs them into law. “During his first term, Trump’s executive orders made health care less accessible, banned travel based on the predominant religion in certain countries, and made it easier for corporations to pollute our communities,” Perryman said. “This time, the Trump-Vance administration is better organized, has four years of previous experience, and can rely on the policy and staffing infrastructure of Project 2025.” Biden administration officials will be joining Democracy Forward as senior counselors, including Karianne Jones, former litigation counsel for the Kamala Harris campaign; Mike Martinez, deputy general counsel at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; Dan McGrath, senior counsel at the Department of Labor; and Kevin Friedl, outgoing senior counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additionally, Department of Justice Executive Secretary Emily Ross will join Democratic Forward as deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Perryman. This is in line with what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumertold POLITICOin December about how Democrats plan to use the courts to combat Trump during his second term. “I don’t know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judiciary will be one of our strongest—if not our strongest—barrier[s] against what he does,” he said. Democracy Forward will not only challenge the policies that Trump implements, but it will also aim to setlegal precedentsthat will limit the president's unchecked power in the long term.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 14:30:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297266/-Democrats-prepare-to-fight-Trump-s-Day-1-executive-orders-in-the-courts
Infamous Jew-hating racist Mel Gibson gets 'special' job from Trump,"Donald Trump is appointing three washed-up actors to serve as ""special ambassadors"" to Hollywood, including the notoriously racist and antisemitic Mel Gibson. ""It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,"" Trumpwrotein a Thursday post on Truth Social. ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!"" Choosing Gibson to serve as whateverthisis ... is certainly a choice. In 2004, Gibson’s movie “The Passion of the Christ” waspanned as antisemiticfor depicting Jews as responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion. Then in 2006, Gibsonwent on an antisemitic tiradeduring a drunk driving arrest in Los Angeles. According to a police report, ""Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about 'fucking Jews'. Gibson yelled out: 'The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Gibson then asked: 'Are you a Jew?'"" Gibson laterapologized, saying, “I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith.” But as the saying goes:in vino veritas. Then in 2010,audio tapes were releasedin which Gibson was heard verbally abusingOksana Grigorieva,his then-girlfriend and the mother of one of his children. ""You look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of [N-words], it will be your fault,"" he screamed at her. Gibson also threatened her, saying on tape, ""I am going to come and burn the fucking house down ... but you will blow me first."" That Trump would choose someone so vile to serve his administration in any capacity at all is despicable. But it’s also random. Maybe Trump thought of the “Mad Max” for this ridiculous made-up role because he saw Gibson’s Jan. 10 appearance on Fox News, where he spread paranoid theories about the raging wildfires in Southern California. “I can make all kinds of horrible theories up in my head, conspiracy theories and everything else,” Gibson told fellow bigot Laura Ingraham. “But it just seemed a little convenient that there was no water, and that the wind conditions were right and that there were people ready and willing and able to start fires, and are they commissioned to do so or are they just acting on their own volition?” Gibson also appeared on podcast bro Joe Rogan’s show, where heclaimedto know people with Stage 4 cancer who were cured after taking ivermectin, the horse deworming pill COVID deniers are bizarrely obsessed with.Ivermectin does not cure cancer. In a karmic twist, Gibson later revealed thathis Malibu home was burning downwhile he was yakking it up with Rogan in Texas. As for the other two men Trump appointed as “special” ambassadors, Voight is a vocal right-winger who haslong backed Trumpand bizarrelycalled for President Joe Biden’s impeachment. And Stallone has also emerged as a MAGA minion, ridiculouslycomparingTrump to George Washington Appointing these three clowns to somehow tell Trump how to fix Hollywood feels more like the latest attack on California from thenotoriously fame-hungryincoming president. Trump has spent the past weekspreading disinformationabout the deadly wildfires that have ravaged homes and communities in the Los Angeles area. Even worse, Trump isthreatening to withhold recovery fundingfrom the state. Hey Trump—just leave the people in and around Hollywood alone for once.

Even Republicans aren’t happy about House speaker’s latest cave to Trump,"House Republicansare disapprovingof House Speaker Mike Johnson’sdecisiontoremoveRep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, from his position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Many believe this move was motivated by Donald Trump’s eagerness to install a MAGA loyalist in the position, since the president-elect has long sought to fill congressional seats with those willing to kiss the ring. Though Johnson denied external pressure, Turner believes otherwise. In a phone interview with CBS reporter and “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan, Turner said that Johnson told him, “You’re fired. There are concerns from Mar-a-Lago.” Johnsondeniedthis claim. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnson said on Wednesday. Now, Republicans are voicing their concerns about Johnson bending the knee to Trump. “We all have questions and concerns … This came out of nowhere,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, said. Crenshaw’s comments reflect the uncertainty and frustration that Republicans feel about the pressure to either fall in line with Trump or risk being demoted. ""I'm not happy with the decision. I think the vast majority of us are not happy with the decision,"" an anonymous House Republican told Axios. Other Republicans, like Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, are concerned that Johnson’s decision will be harmful to the party’s unity. “It divides the conference, and I don't think that's good,” he said, adding that ""most of us agree"" with Turner on issues like Ukraine. Turner has been astaunch supporterof Ukraine in its war against Russia, often pushing back against GOP colleagues who spread Russian propaganda. His strong advocacy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine has earned him praise from moderate Republicans, but it has also made him a target among what is now an empowered MAGA faction in Congress. While it’s still unclear how his second administration will cozy up to Vladimir Putin, Trump has suggested that heplans to speakwith the Russian strongman shortly after his inauguration. During his first term, Trump had aclose relationshipwith Putin, and he even sent him COVID-19 tests in 2020 while U.S. citizens reeled from the virus. And since leaving office, Trump has had numerous private phone calls with him. Trump’s long-standingbromancewith Putin—along with reportedlyidolizingdictators—has sparked accusations that Trump is sympathetic to autocrats and even perhaps has a desire to become one himself. But even as U.S. national security hangs in the balance, it seems Trump’s adoration of authoritarian regimes is still not enough to break the GOP’s obedience to Dear Leader.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 00:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297298/-Even-Republicans-aren-t-happy-about-House-speaker-s-latest-cave-to-Trump
Trump treasury nominee slammed for opposing minimum wage increase,"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s nominee to besecretary of treasury, is being criticized for opposing an increase of the federal minimum wage at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Bessent was being questioned by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who noted to Bessent that the federal minimum wage has not been increased fromits current rate of $7.25per hour since 2009. “You don’t think we should change the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour?” Sanders asked. Bessent replied, “No, sir.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus,quickly responded, writing, “Wrong. Working people deserve a raise. Raise the minimum wage.” The last time that legislation was passed to raise the federal wage was the 2007 Fair Minimum Wage Act. Thatlaw incrementally increasedthe wage from $5.15 in 2007 to $7.25 in 2009, as Sanders stated. Since then, no laws have increased the federal minimum wage. In the meantime, due to inflation, the real value of the minimum wagehas gone down. According to a2019 studyby the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually increase wages for more than 33.5 million people across the country, including over 6 million people living in poverty. According to hisfinancial disclosures, Bessent, a hedge fund managerwho donatedto Trump’s campaign, is a billionaire. That is the normamong the figureswhom Trump has nominated to serve in his Cabinet and who are among his closest advisors. The average publicly known net worth of Trump’s team is $67.7 billion as of early December, compared to theroughly $1.06 million net worthof the average American family. Despite their extraordinary wealth, key Trump allies, like billionaire Elon Musk (the richest person in the world, worthover $427 billion),havepushed for cutsto the social safety net that millions rely on. These same people, and especially Trump, favor keeping in place tax cuts that disproportionately help billionaires and large corporations. Those tax cuts historically have beenlittle to no helpfor people making minimum wage.

"Rudy Giuliani has another terrible, no good, very bad day","After months of dragging his heels, disgraced former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has come to asettlementwith the two former Georgia election workers whom he defamed and owes nearly $150 million. CNN reports that details of the settlement are not yet known, but a brief courtfilingsays that plaintiffs Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss have come to an agreement with Giuliani that would allow Giuliani to avoid a trial. The settlement ended proceedings that saw thedirtbag former mayor’sFlorida condo, valued at $3.5 million, in jeopardy of being added to the assets Freeman and Moss could claim as a part of their compensation. “The past four years have been a living nightmare. We have fought to clear our names, restore our reputations, and prove that we did nothing wrong,” Freeman and Moss said in astatement. “Today is a major milestone in our journey. We have reached an agreement and we can now move forward with our lives. We have agreed to allow Mr. Giuliani to retain his property in exchange for compensation and his promise not to ever defame us.” The Independent reported that Giuliani was ano-showat his court proceedings on Thursday morning. Giuliani posteda self-serving statementabout the settlement to X, where he hilariously wrote, “This resolution does not involve an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any of the Parties.” But considering that Giuliani has beenfound liable for defamationand simply owes money that he’s been dragging his feet on, this is a choice piece of BS.

Another MAGA loyalist eyes Florida governor's race,"Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida has shared with potential donors and political big-wigs in the state that he intends to run for governor, making him the second MAGA loyalist to consider throwing his hat in the ring. “He was in town [Tallahassee] meeting with all the folks you need to meet with. He told them he is in,” a source who met with Donalds toldNBC News. “It’s the steps any candidate takes as they prepare to run for governor.” Donalds reportedly made similar remarks at a GOP meeting in Orlando this past weekend, according to the outlet. NBC News said it spoke with five sources familiar with Donalds’ thinking and upcoming plans. While there have long been rumors that the Florida representative is angling to replace Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, this is the biggest sign yet that the Trump loyalist will likely leave his plum congressional seat in an attempt to be the Sunshine State’s next top executive. When asked for comment, Donalds didn’t deny the rumors but told NBC News he’s focused on “helping President Trump pass his America First Agenda.” A spokesperson for Donalds did not immediately respond to Daily Kos’ request for comment. Should Donalds run, he might face some intriguing competition. Disgraced former Rep. Matt Gaetzis also toyingwith whether to run for the gubernatorial seat. In a statement to NBC News, Gaetz reiterated that he and his wife are still considering his next steps. Notably, this is not the first sign of Donalds’ increased interest in running for Florida’s governorship. Earlier this month, hehiredone alum of President-elect Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign: Fabrizio, Lee & Associates. This company is led by Tony Fabrizio, who was Trump’s lead pollster during his first campaign for the White House and has conducted polling for MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. NBC News also reports that Donalds is working with Brad Herold, who served as an advisor to DeSantis during his 2018 run, among others who have long worked to help boost MAGA-type Republicans. Trump will almost certainly try to sway the fast-approaching GOP primary for Florida’s governor race. Last year, at a high-dollar fundraiser in New York,Trump asked Donaldspoint-blank whether he was planning to succeed DeSantis, whom Trump has had a ratherstormy professional relationshipwith. And let’s not forget, Trump’s influence can mean a lot in this race. After all, Trump’sendorsement of DeSantisin 2018 helped propel his candidacy. DeSantiswon that year’s Republican primarywith 57% of the vote; his closest competitor, Adam Putnam, the state’s former agriculture commissioner, received 37%. There’s no sign, either, that Trump’s grip on the party is slipping. Any Republican hoping to succeed in Florida politics likely needs to kiss the ring and earn Trump’s approval; at the very least, they need to avoid getting on his bad side. Donalds, who is 46, rose to prominence during the tea party movement. Hewas elected toFlorida’s House of Representatives in 2016. Then, in 2020, he won a seat in the U.S. House, representing Florida’s 19th Congressional District. In his relatively short time in Congress, Donalds has become a close ally of Trump’s. He was among the group of Republicans whovoted to overturnthe 2020 election results after Trump lost to Joe Biden, andwas endorsed for the House speakershipby far-right lawmakers who refused to back then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid in early 2023. Last year,it was rumoredthat Trump might tap Donalds as a running mate. That’s not to say Donalds is a shoo-in to be Florida’s next governor, should he decide to run. Beyond Gaetz, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson could jump in the race. At one point, it looked like the race to replace DeSantis might attract more candidates, but the field has narrowed. State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis isrunning to replaceGaetz in Congress (with Trump’s blessing, of course), and state Attorney General Ashley Moody has just beenappointedto fill the Senate seat that Marco Rubio will vacate if he is confirmed as Trump’s secretary of state, as is expected. There’s no timeline set for Donalds’ next steps. While he could, of course, leave Washington, D.C., early to start his bid, concerns about Republicans’ slim margins in the House make that tricky to navigate. As NBC News pointed out, Donalds may make his next move more clear following the conclusion of Florida’s two scheduled special elections, one of which reveals who Gaetz’s replacement will be. Both electionswill take placeon April 1.

Democrats have one weird trick to release the rest of Jack Smith's report,"In alettersent Thursday morning, House Judiciary Committee Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop federal charges against Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. In so doing, Garland would remove the only barrier preventing the release of the second volume of Jack Smith’sreporton alleged crimes committed by Trump. ""The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith's report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records,” the letter reads. “It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public,” it goes on to say. “As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump's co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira."" Last week, the DOJ released the first half of the report, which focused on Trump’s “unprecedented criminal effort” to steal the 2020 election. Garland noted that he would not release the second volume of Smith’s investigation since Trump’s co-defendants’ cases are still active. “To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors,” House Democrats argue in the letter. “[T]hose concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report.” One alternative, with somesupport in Congress, would be for President Joe Biden to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s ruling on “absolute immunity” for “official acts” by releasing the report in the name of national security. Judge Aileen Cannonagreed to allowthe DOJ to release the first volume of Smith’s investigation, and she has nowscheduled a court hearingFriday to consider Garland’s plan to share the second volume with “some lawmakers.” Trump hassuccessfully eluded jail timeas a convicted felon, but the details of his other—and numerous—alleged crimes have yet to reach the public.

And to those people, I would just say, ‘You have my sympathy and I hope you get a TV soon that allows you to change the channel.’” Meyers proceeded to take apart Trump’sgrotesque choiceof Hegseth for secretary of defense.

Nancy Pelosi will skip Trump’s inauguration,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, will not attend President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed to Daily Kos. Pelosi is the second big-name Democrat to announce that they won’t attend. Earlier this week, former first lady Michelle Obama saidshe also plans to skip the event, which will take place on Monday. Other Democratic lawmakers who will play hooky that day include Reps.Jasmine Crockettof Texas,Ilhan Omarof Minnesota, andAyanna Pressleyof Massachusetts. News of Pelosi’s pending absence was first reported byABC News. Pelosi’s spokesperson didn’t elaborate on why she won’t make the pilgrimage to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,this go-around. Her absence may be because Pelosi is stillrecovering from hip surgeryshe underwent in Germany following a fall in December. It’s also possible that, like most Democrats,she just hates Trump. No one would blame her if that were the case. The two have long had a tumultuous professional relationship. Since Trump’s first administration, their disdain for one another has seemingly only increased. Pelosi famously spent the final days of Trump’s first term trying tooust him from the Oval Officeafter the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Trump, for his part, spent much of his first termavoiding Pelosi, even as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged states and lawmakers attempted to work together to deliver aid. Since then, Trump has called Pelosi “crazy,” “crooked,” “evil,” and “sick,” among other abhorrent things. In November, he nearly called her a bitch during a campaign rally, though he stopped himself from saying the word outright. “She’s a bad person, evil. She’s an evil, sick, crazy—” Trump said ata rally in Michiganamid his 2024 campaign, sounding out the letter “B” but stopping just short of uttering the obscenity. “It starts with a ‘B,’ but I won’t say it. I wanna say it.” Pelosi’s inauguration absence marks a break in tradition for the octogenarian. In addition toattendingTrump’s first inauguration, in 2017, ABC News reports that Pelosi has gone to 11 presidential inaugural events. Senior leaders of both parties typically attend presidential inaugurations, regardless of the incoming president’s party. But Trump has no room to complain about Pelosi’s absence: Hefamously skippedPresident Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. In reality, Trump probably won’t notice that Pelosi’s gone. He’ll be too busy trying to impress his trio of tech-bro sugar daddies—Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—who have beenrewarded with plum seatsat the inauguration. (All three men alsodonated at least $1 millionto Trump’s inaugural fund.) Meanwhile, while they will attend Monday’s inauguration, former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama willskip Trump’s inaugural luncheon. According to NBC News, both Obama and Clinton were invited but declined. Bush’s office told the outlet that he never received an invite.

House Republicans take first step in mass deportation scheme,"Donald Trump’s Deputy Policy Chief, Stephen Miller,met Wednesday with membersof the House Republican Study Committee to begin planning for the mass deportation of immigrants. “He talked about how the cost of immigration is costing this country and he used the example of if an illegal has four children they have the same rights and privileges to the gimmes that Americans do, health care, education, all of that,” Rep. Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina,told the Daily Beast. Miller reportedly told the attendees to determine the funding needed to carry out Trump’s deportation plan, which they are expected to include in a reconciliation bill that requires a simple majority to pass through Congress. This would allow the party to secure funding for mass deportations without any Democratic support, as long as there aren’t many defectors within theslim Republican majoritiesin Congress. While the GOP reconciliation bill will include tax cuts for the wealthy and draconian changes to immigration policy, thereconciliation processwas originally used under Democratic administrations for more progressive policy items. Under President Barack Obama, reconciliation was used to pass health care reform in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Under President Joe Biden, it was used to pass theAmerican Rescue Planand theInflation Reduction Act. But now, Republicans are using the reconciliation process to move forward with Trump’s immigration policy, which is likely informed by Miller’sracist history. Miller served as an aide to former Sen. Jeff Sessions during whichhe promotedwhite supremacist literature, objected to efforts to remove symbols honoring the pro-slavery Confederacy, and promoted racist immigration stories. During Trump’s first term, Miller wasa key architectof the policy that separated immigrant families to supposedly dissuade border crossings. The policy led to the separation of children from their parents, anda reunification processthat is still ongoing under the Biden administration. Family separation wascondemnedacross the world by figures like Pope Francis. There is widespread concern about the mental and emotional harm that mass deportation is likely to cause for thousands of families, but experts have also warned that there will be a financial cost. A “highly conservative”estimatefrom the American Immigration Council found that Trump’s mass deportations would cost at least $315 billion. The council also projected that the amount of funding used for a 10-year deportation program could build more than 40,450 new elementary schools, construct 2.9 million new homes, pay college tuition for 8.9 million people, and provide brand new cars to more than 20.4 million people. Trump, Miller, and their Republican allies in Congress nonetheless seem locked in on foisting this extreme policy on the American public. Only time will tell how much it will cost us.

Trump mimics mug shot in official presidential portrait,"Donald Trump did his best to look as evil as humanly possible in his official presidential portrait, which wasreleased Thursdayahead of his inauguration on Monday. In the terrifying headshot, Trump, wearing a rare blue tie, appears to be scowling at the camera and squinting one eye closed, as if he's plotting something nefarious. His evil look is enhanced by the choice to light him from below creating creepy dark shadows on Trump’s face, while also blowing out his signature bright orange makeup to a muted apricot hue. The photo also bears an uncanny resemblance to hisGeorgia mugshot, which he took after he wasindictedin Fulton County for his efforts to overturn his loss in the Peach State. Trump’s right-wing cult members were a littletooexcited over the portrait. ""Dad is home,"" Charlie Kirkwrotein a not-at-all creepy post on X, along with the photo. Russian propagandistBenny Johnson was also super pumped about Trump’s portrait. “Trump really went with the mugshot ascetic [sic] with the new Presidential Portrait,” Johnsonwrotein a post on X, misspelling “aesthetic.” He added, “Trump chose violence 🔥” Trump himself seems to be super proud of the creepy image, releasing the photo in a news release titled “Official Portraits Released — And They Go Hard ????” Yes, that was actually the title of the release, question marks and all. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect JD Vance’s official portrait shows him with his arms cheerfully crossed over a blue tie that’s nearly identical to his boss’, smiling just hard enough that there’s no trace of his signaturenatural “eyeliner.” What do you think of Trump’s super creepy photo?

Trump releases enemies list,"Donald Trump has released a list of people he wants blacklisted from positions in his upcoming administration. The release of the list comes just a few weeks after Trump said he would not seek retribution against his detractors. In November, after his election win, TrumptoldFox News, “I am not looking for retribution, grandstanding or to destroy people who treated me very unfairly, or even badly beyond comprehension.” But on Wednesday night,Trump wroteon his Truth Social platform, “In order to save time, money, and effort, it would be helpful if you would not send, or recommend to us, people who worked with, or are endorsed by, Americans for No Prosperity (headed by Charles Koch), ‘Dumb as a Rock’ John Bolton, ‘Birdbrain’ Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, disloyal Warmongers Dick Cheney, and his Psycho daughter, Liz, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, General(?) Mark Milley, James Mattis, Mark Yesper, or any of the other people suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, more commonly known as TDS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” While some of the people and groups on Trump’s list are merely fellow travelers within the conservative movement who have disagreed with him (the right-wing Americans for Prosperity group) or who ran against him (failed presidential candidate Nikki Haley), many of them are figures who warned that Trump would engage infascistic behaviorduring a second term. Beforeretiring, Army Gen. Mark Milley served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and was intimately involved in high-level national security issues during his administration.Milley later toldjournalist Bob Woodward that Trump was “fascist to the core,” and said, “He is the most dangerous person to this country.” Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming served on the bipartisan committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol led by Trump supporters hoping to overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden. Cheney often spoke out against Trumpand said in October, “Donald Trump believes he will be immune for anything he does once he’s in office.” SheendorsedVice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign and said she agreed with Milley’s assessment that Trump is a fascist. John Boltonserved asTrump’s national security adviser. In the foreword to his book about his time in the administration, BoltondescribedTrump as “unfit” for the presidency. Bolton specifically criticized Trump for prioritizing his personal vendettas over the country’s interests. Trump’s enemies list—something which is far outside of the bounds of normal political discourse—is another bit of evidence proving that the warnings of his fascistic tendencies were accurate.

Mike Turner of Ohio was unceremoniously ousted as chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, after Donald Trump ordered the pro-Ukraine lawmaker's removal, according to CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" hostMargaret Brennan. Turner has been avocal critic of Russiaand a supporter of Ukraine. He's evencriticized his own GOP colleaguesforspreading Russian propaganda. “We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,” Turner said in April. Being pro-Ukraine is untenable for Trump, who is buddies with violent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Putin worked to help get Trump elected in 2016 by running an unprecedented propaganda campaign. And now that Trump won again, Politicoreportedthat Putin hopes the U.S. will stop sending money and weapons to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. “​​One person who’ll clearly be pleased Mike Turner’s been dumped as House Intelligence chair: Vladimir Putin,” Republican Bill Kristol, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and his own party in recent years,wrotein a post on X. Trump hasrefused to saywhether he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia in the war Russia started. But he has made it clear that he wants Ukraine tomake concessions to Russia, which attacked the country unprovoked, in order to end the war. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who removed Turner as committee chair, claims Trump had nothing to do with the decision to remove Turner. “This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,” Johnsonsaid, adding, “The intelligence community and everything related to [the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence], it needs a fresh start. And that’s what this is about. Nothing else.” It's not yet clear who will be the new chair of the committee, which has oversight of the U.S. intelligence community and is privy to the nation's top secrets. In 2017, during Trump’s first term, the committee was led byPutin stoogeDevin Nunes, who worked to thwart the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee,told reportershe's “enormously concerned” over Turner's removal since Turner wasn't one to ""bend the knee"" to Trump. ""His removal makes our nation less secure and is a terrible portent for what’s to come,"" Himessaidin a statement. ""The Constitution demands Congress function as a check on the Executive Branch, not cater to its demands.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 15:32:00,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297228/-House-speaker-demotes-Ohio-Republican-who-won-t-bend-the-knee-to-Trump
Trump's attorney general pick won't admit Biden won 2020 election,"Election denier Pam Bondi, Donald Trump'spickto lead the Department of Justice, refused multiple times at herWednesday confirmation hearingto say that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Sens.Dick Durbinof Illinois andMazie Hironoof Hawaii separately asked the former Florida attorney general if she believed Biden won the election—and Bondi refused to answer both times. When Durbin asked, Bondi dodged. ""President Biden is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power,"" Bondi said. Of course, the transition of power was anything but “peaceful,” as Trump incited a violent mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block certification of Biden's win. When Hirono asked Bondi, ""Who won the 2020 presidential election?"" Bondi gave the same canned answer. “Joe Biden is the president of the United States,” Bondi said robotically. The Hawaii lawmaker was unimpressed by that response. “You cannot say who won the 2020 election,” Hirono said. “It's disturbing that you can't give voice to that fact.” Sen. Alex Padilla of California asked Bondi for evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which she has continued to lie about for years following Trump's loss to Biden. But Bondirefusedto give any concrete evidence. “Do you have any evidence of election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election, yes or no? It’s a yes or no question,” Padilla said. In response, Bondi gave condolences to Padilla for the fires in California and refused to give a yes or no response about whether she had evidence of fraud.  Bondi was among the dozens of Trump campaign officials and surrogates who lied about voter fraud in the 2020 election in a failed quest to help Trump remain in power. She specifically focused on Pennsylvania, which Bondi falsely claimed Trump won. “We are not going anywhere until they declare that we won Pennsylvania,” Bondisaidduring a Fox News appearance in 2020. In fact, Bondi helped organize the infamous news conference in Philadelphia that was supposed to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel but instead was mistakenly held atFour Seasons Total Landscapingafter the inept campaign booked the wrong venue. Bondi didn't speak that day, but was seen “helping other staff to rearrange the company’s landscaping equipment to make way for a podium” before the event began,accordingto The Washington Post. It’s no surprise that Bondi refused to say Biden won. Trumpdemands total loyaltyfrom his Cabinet picks, and admitting that Biden was the victor goes against Trump’s narcissistic delusion that he didn’t lose in 2020. But it’s terrifying that Republican senators are set to confirm an attorney general who not only can’t admit basic reality, but will readily lie to stroke Trump’s fragile ego.

Trump tries to take full credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal,"Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war after more than 15 months of fighting, according tothe U.S. and Qatar. The destruction and violence resulted in the deaths ofat least 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, while thousands morehave been injured. But amid the news, President-elect Donald Trump made the historic deal about himself and tried to take sole credit for it—all before President Joe Biden’s administration hadheld a news briefingon the matter. “WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump posted to hisTruth Socialplatform. “THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!” In asecond post, Trump added, “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.” Of course, the ceasefire effort was put into motion by Biden and has been carried out while he is president. The deal reached by negotiatorsis broadly the sameasthe one Biden proposed last May, which the president noted in astatement, saying, “I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council.” Additionally, on Monday, Jake Sullivan, the Biden White House’s national security adviser, said that a deal was imminent and that he “coordinated very closely” with the incoming Trump team to “present a united message” and “get this deal done as fast as possible.” The deal stillneeds to be approvedby the Israeli cabinet, which isexpected to happen on Thursday. If approved as expected, the ceasefire will go into effect on Sunday. That said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid late on Wednesdaythat final details are still being worked out. If approved, the deal will allow for an exchange and release of all the remaining living Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel would also release some jailed Palestinians and allow for increased humanitarian aid in Gaza. In addition, during the plan’s first 42 days, “Israeli forces will withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas,” according toABC News, and eventually, there will be a “permanent cessation of military operations.” The final phase of the plan would see the two sides exchange remains for identification. At that time, the reconstruction of Gaza would begin, “with compensation for all affected individuals under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar and the U.N.,” according to ABC News. Notably, last September, Netanyahurejectedthe Biden administration’s claim that a ceasefire plan was nearly finished. Since then, of course, the U.S. has elected a new president, suggesting that Netanyahu is far more prepared to bend a knee to the United States now than he was when Democrats controlled Washington, D.C. It’s alsolikelythat he wanted to harm Democrats’ chances at winning the presidency since the continuing conflict in Gaza was seen asa bad issue for them. Last week, Trump warned reporters that “all hell” would break loose if Hamas did not release the hostages by his Jan. 20 inauguration. It’s possible that the pressure of Trump’s threat shook Netanyahu, who has long shownfealtyto the president-elect despite Trump famouslyaccusing him of disloyalty. Of course, Trump is not currently president, so it makes sense that Biden is pushing back on giving the president-elect too much credit. When a reporter asked on Wednesday who gets credit for the deal, him or Trump, Biden responded, “Is that a joke?” Unsurprisingly, Trump’s allies are lapping up his lies that the president-elect was singularly responsible for brokering this deal. “HISTORY: President Trump has ended the war against Israel before he even took the oath of office,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenepostedto social media. “Thank God President Trump will be back in the Oval Office in just a few short days!” ",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 00:00:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297139/-Trump-tries-to-take-full-credit-for-Israel-Hamas-ceasefire-deal
Trump pushes DOGE dork to fill Vance's vacant Senate seat in Ohio,"Donald Trump isreportedly pushingfailed presidential candidate and billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to take JD Vance’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat in Ohio. According to the Washington Post, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to take the position if offered by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who will make the appointment for the vacated seat once Vance is sworn in as vice president. The outlet also reports that Ramaswamy was planning to run for Ohio governor in 2026. If Ramaswamy assumed the position, Ohio would be represented by a senator whose history is checkered with promoting debunked conspiracy theories. During his unsuccessful presidential campaign,Ramaswamy saidthat the Jan. 6 insurrection of the U.S. Capitol looked like it was an “inside job,” amplifying a conservative conspiracy that it was undertaken by shadowy forces within the government. “Why am I the only person on this stage, at least, who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” Ramaswamy asked his fellow Republican candidates during a December 2023 debate. Healso postedon social media on the anniversary of the insurrection, writing “Happy Entrapment Day,” a nod to thedebunkedright-wing conspiracy theory that federal agents staged the event to entrap Trump supporters. Trump’s Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth,has espousedsimilar beliefs. Ramaswamyhas also claimedthat the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which argues that increased immigration from Mexico is a plan to replace white people with Latinx people, is “a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform.” He also promoted thefalsehoodthat the 2020 election was “stolen by Big Tech.” Perhaps the most absurd conspiracy that Ramaswamy has embracedis his theorythat the result of the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs and that it would be connected to a future endorsement of President Joe Biden from Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. When he’s not promoting conspiracies, Ramaswamy has embraced unpopular conservative policy ideas, like privatizing Social Security. In avideofor AARP, Ramaswamy endorsedthe failed proposalfrom former President George W. Bush to allow partial privatization of the popular pension program by investing funds in the stock market. Along with Elon Musk, Ramaswamy iscurrently co-chairingthe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-governmental pressure group created by Trump. DOGE representatives have reportedly beenharassing federal workersin an effort to undermine federal spending. And recently, RamaswamydenigratedU.S. culture in a lengthypost on Xclaiming that “American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ or ‘Stefan’ over Steve Urkel in ‘Family Matters,’ will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote. So, if Ramaswamy assumes the Senate seat in Ohio, he’ll be representing the very people he believes to be subpar.

Even Fox News can't spin how much Greenlanders don't want to join US,"Well, this is awkward. A reporter from right-wing propaganda outlet Fox News headed to Greenland to see if its residents were as pumped about the idea of the country becoming part of the United States as Donald Trump and his brain-dead MAGA cult are. But the reporter did not encounter scores of Trump fans who want the country to be taken over by the U.S. Instead, the reporter said that ""most"" of the people she spoke to were against Trump's plan to acquire the territory. ""I hate it,"" one Greenlander told Fox News of Trump's proposal. ""I want to stick with Danish ... government,"" another person interviewed by Fox said. (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.) Trump has had a bizarre fixation with annexing Greenland since at least2019, when he first saber-rattled about buying the island. He had gone quiet about the idea until after he won the 2024 election. And now, once again, he is saying that the U.S. should take control of Greenland, going as far as saying hemay use military forceto acquire the land. Earlier in January, Trump sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to the country to try to build support among the people for a U.S. acquisition. But Greenlandic politicians described Jr.’s visit as astaged public-relations stunt. In fact, a Danish media outletreportedthat the pro-Trump folks whom Trump Jr. featured in photos he posted of his visit included unhoused people who wereoffered free lunchin exchange for wearing MAGA gear. “They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,”Tom Amtoft, a Greenland resident, told the Danish outlet, according to Google’s translation of the comment. Trump alsoposteda video of a man in Greenland wearing MAGA gear, saying, “I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’” But apparently unbeknownst to Trump, the man in the video is a convicted drug trafficker,according toa Danish media outlet. Ultimately, officials from bothGreenlandand Denmark officials say the arctic territory will not become part of the US. “Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,” Greenland’s prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede,said in a statement. And even Fox News can’t propagandize that fact. The outlet couldn’t find enough Greenland residents to praise their Dear Leader Trump. Sad!

AG nominee is still covering up Trump’s Georgia election fraud efforts,"Former Florida Attorney General and Trump lawyer Pam Bondi is lying her way through Wednesday’s Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general. When Sen. Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked if she “heard the recording of President Trump on January 2, 2021, when he urged the secretary of state of Georgia to, quote, ‘find 11,780 votes’ and declare him the winner of that state,” Bondi denied ever hearing it. ""No. I've heard about it through clips, but no, no, Senator, I've not heard it,"" she said. “What was your reaction to President Trump making that call?” Durbin pressed. “I have, I would have to listen to the tape, Senator,” Bondi responded. As Durbin continued pushing Bondi on the issue, the formerregistered foreign agentwiggled free by claiming that she didn’t know the context, adding “but it's my understanding that is not what he asked him to do."" But that isn’t what Bonditold Newsmaxin August 2023, ​​according to research from American Bridge. After Fulton County District Attorney Fani WillisindictedDonald Trump and more than a dozen others in a broad conspiracy to commit election fraud, Bondi appeared on the right-wing outlet to share her thoughts. ""Fani Willis is in way, way over her head,” Bondi said. “She has charged not only President Trump, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Mayor Giuliani, but a total of 19 defendants, including President Trump, with I think it’s a 41-count indictment that takes 98 pages. It’s unbelievable.” “First of all, it’s not a crime what they did,” Bondi explained, referring to thehour-long phone callbetween Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Trump, during which Trump demanded he “find” more than 11,000 votes for him. “It’s free speech. It shouldn’t even be in state court. Legally, it should be in federal court if they're ever going to prosecute him for something so ridiculous,” she said. Since Bondi’s lying and deceit on behalf of Trumpgoes backmore than a decade, it’s no surprise that he picked her as the next potential top lawyer.

Trump set to start second term with underwater approval rating,"As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office for a second time, he claims to have a “massive” mandate to enact his destructive agenda. But new polling shows that’s far from the truth. ANPR/PBS News/Marist College pollreleased Wednesday shows that just 44% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 49% view him unfavorably. That’s nearly identical to the 45% approval rating Trump has inCiviqs’ tracking poll. The fact that Trump is viewed unfavorably before he even takes office is a warning sign for his tenure. The start of a presidential term is usually when a president is at their high-water mark of approval. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, 51% of registered voters approved of the job he was doing on the transition, according to anNPR/PBS News/Marist College pollat the time. In the first two months after Barack Obama was sworn in as president, around 60% of Americans approved of the job he was doing, according to538’s historical polling average. And when he was sworn in again four years later, his approval rating was around 53%. The NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll has other warning signs for Trump. Just 31% of Americans say thetariff policyTrump plans to enact would help the economy. That should be a flashing red warning light for Trump, showing that Americans will likely blame him if those tariffs cause prices toskyrocket, as economists expect. What’s more, 62% of Americans oppose Trump’s plan to pardon people who either pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for their role in the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It’s not just Trump who is unpopular among voters. Trump's Cabinet nominees are also underwater. Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, has just a 19% approval rating in the NPR/PBS News/Marist College survey. And the survey was conducted before Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, when Democratic senatorslaid barethe nominee’s abhorrent behavior of alleged sexual assault, womanizing, on-the-job drinking, and misogynistic remarks. Twenty-six percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hegseth, with the remaining 55% not knowing who he is or having no opinion of him. However, Trump’s co-president, Elon Musk, is broadly unpopular. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable view of him, while 46% view him unfavorably, according to the poll. That’s also a warning sign for Trump, who is allowing Musk to hog the spotlight and even letting the awkward billionaireoccupy an officein the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next door to the White House. Ultimately, while it’s awful that Trump will be sworn in for a second time, polling suggests that he will have no honeymoon phase and that backlash to his agenda could be a serious problem for Republicans in the 2026 midterms.

Fox News host celebrates lack of diverse inauguration performers,"Fox News host Jesse Watterscelebratedthe news that Carrie Underwoodwill be performing“America, the Beautiful” at Donald Trump’s inauguration, citing her sexual orientation and blonde hair as a sign of America’s return. “I'm just happy Carrie Underwood is performing. When a straight, blonde female is singing at the inauguration, I think we're back. I think we're definitely back,” he said during a Tuesday episode of “Jesse Watters Primetime.” His guest, conservative comedian Nick Di Paolo added, “Thank God Kamala didn't win, we would've had to see Lizzo's ass for 45 minutes.” Watters’ and Di Paolo’s comments echo longtimeconservative complaintsthat President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democrats are too “woke,” meaning they have embraced diversity. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the performers were in fact diverse. Lady Gaga—who was blonde at the time—sangthe national anthem, Jennifer Lopezalso performed, and so didGarth Brooks—a straight white man. Watters has spent years at Fox espousing racist and misogynistic comments, and the network expanded his platform whenhe receivedhis primetime show in 2023, replacing the extremelybigotedTucker Carlson. During the recent presidential campaign, Watterslobbed multiple sexistand racist attacks at Harris, who made history as the first woman of color to secure a major party’s nomination. “She's just like your typical girl's girl that talks behind everybody's back and then says nice things to your face. She's just not at the level of what you would think would be a president,” he ranted. In another instance, Watters called Harris a “frightened woman too insecure to tell us who she is” and claimed the media supported her because “they love a Black woman taking on a white man.” Fox has beenall in for Trump—and racism—for years, and with comments like Watters’, there’s no sign the network will stop any time soon.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 19:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297080/-Fox-News-host-celebrates-lack-of-diverse-inauguration-performers
Biden spends final days in office tackling another important crisis,"In one of his final moves in office, President Joe Biden is aiming to eliminate some bureaucratic hurdles that have historically forced homeowners and renters into expensive mortgages and sky-high rental rates. On Tuesday, the Biden administrationunveileda $100 million grant program from the Department of Housing and Urban Development aimed at helping local communities identify and remove barriers to the production and preservation of affordable housing. “The United States faces a shortfall of millions of affordable homes that has driven up home prices and rents and has made finding a quality and affordable home out of reach for too many Americans,” the White House statement said. The grant will remove red tape and modernize local permitting procedures to facilitate the construction of new housing, finance the construction of new homes for renting and owning, and repair and revitalize existing buildings. New plans will be developedacross 14 states, including in the cities of San Francisco, California; Austin, Texas; Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and St. Louis, Missouri. The White House also approved the first residential transit-oriented development (TOD) loan under the Department of Transportation’s lending programs. The new initiative will fund the creation of more than 300 new housing units near Florida’s Boca Raton Tri-Rail Station, which is expected to generate an annual $2 million in land lease revenue for the commuter rail system. This would help ensure that public transportation is accessible to people living in affordable housing, removing a potential barrier to employment. Housing experts from platforms like Zillowargue thatthe lack of housing supply is one of the main driving forces behind the soaring costs that have prohibited millions of Americans from entering the housing market. For many,skyrocketing rents and home pricescombined withstagnant wageshave made it nearly impossible to save for a down payment, locking an entire generation out of homeownership. Biden’s push to address the housing shortage is an extension of his 2022Housing Supply Action Plan, which aimed to reverse years of underbuilding and stimulate housing growth by offering incentives to state and local governments. For many Americans, the dream of homeownership has been squashed by the harsh reality of rising rents and unaffordable home prices. The pandemic-era boom in the housing market only exacerbated these trends, leaving many feeling like homeownership is an impossibility. During the2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presented vastly different visions for tackling the housing crisis. Harris proposed a bold plan to offer $25,000 in down-payment assistance and to expand the supply of housing—focusing on practical steps to help people get into homes. Trump, on the other hand, was far less detailed. He suggested that curbing immigration could somehow ease housing costs. This was widely debunked, as immigration does not significantly impact housing prices. He also called for lowering mortgage rates, whichcurrently sit ataround 7.25% for a 30-year fixed loan. Though it remains unclear how he planned to achieve that, as the president is independent of the Federal Reserve, which dictates rates. Biden’s latest move is part of a series of sweeping policy decisions made during his final months in office, including signing a record number ofcommutations,cutting billionsin student loan debt,protecting landby designating two new national monuments, andbanning medical debtfrom impacting credit scores. As Biden moves forward with his efforts to ease the housing crunch, he seems to understand that boosting the housing supply and cutting through bureaucratic red tape are two crucial steps in making housing more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. Time will only tell if Trump is on the same page.

GOP senator ditches skepticism and backs Pete Hegseth to lead Pentagon,"Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa announced late Tuesday that she’d vote in favor of President-elect Donald Trump’s utterly unqualified pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth—a move that suggests the former Fox News host has a high chance of being confirmed. During an appearance on anIowa radio showon Tuesday, Ernst said she believed that Hegseth adequately answered all her questions during his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon, and I think we’re at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,” Ernstsaid. “I will be supporting President Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth.” Ernst’s support is a huge boon for Hegseth’s odds, practically ensuring he’ll lead the Pentagon in Trump’s incoming administration. Assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, Hegseth can afford to lose just three Republican senators. And while some in the GOP, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, stillhaven’t said how they’ll vote, Tuesday’s confirmation hearing demonstrated thatmany are on board with Hegsethand are willing to give hisabhorrent alleged behaviora pass. Part of what makes Ernst’s raving endorsement notable is her history as a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor whopreviously raised concernsover Hegseth’s ability to lead the Pentagon. In December, she cited unease over Hegseth’s past opposition to women serving in combat roles, though hewalked this backduring Tuesday’s hearing. It was also unclear how Ernst, who has crusaded for years to address sexual misconduct in the military, would respond to allegations that Hegseth raped a woman in 2017. (Hegseth maintains that theencounter was consensual.) Perhaps Ernst can stomach Hegseth’s nomination because sheintentionally distanced herselffrom some of the worst charges against him. According to new reporting from The New Yorker, Ernst declined an invitation to meet with the woman whom Hegseth paid to settle that 2017 sexual assault claim. Or maybe Ernst simply bowed to outsized pressure from the GOP base. After meeting with Hegseth in December and voicing doubts about whether she’d vote in his favor, she was relentlessly bullied by hardcore MAGA adherents. Not only did some of Trump’s most ardent supportersrun adsin Ernst’s home state of Iowa, but they alsoquestioned her conservative bona fideson social media. Mega-billionaire Elon Musk also pledged tobankroll primary challengesto Republicans who went against the president-elect. It appears that threats to primary Ernst worked. Following another December meeting with Hegseth, Ernstsignaled more opennessto his nomination. Thispressurevery likely helped change Ernst’s tone on Hegseth. Notably, on Tuesday, asDemocrats slammed the defense nomineeover his alleged drinking problem and past comments toward women, Ernsttossed him softballs. “As secretary of defense, will you appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response?” she asked. “Senator, as we have discussed, yes I will,” Hegseth responded. Ernst is up forreelection in 2026in a statethat went for Trumpby more than 13 percentage points in November. Given that, it’s likely she would’ve been targeted by MAGA followers had she not kowtowed to the president-elect and refused to back Hegseth. That type of politicking might work for the likes of Collins or even Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who isalso on the fenceabout confirming Hegseth, but not the bulk of Senate Republicans who need Trump’s base of loyal Republicans to retain their positions in Congress. Ernst’s onetime arms-length attitude toward Hegseth signaled that some Senate Republicans would attempt to maintain independence under a second Trump administration, but the Iowan’s changed tune suggests that for Republican lawmakers, Trump is still king.

Nancy Mace threatens Jasmine Crockett during House proceeding,"During a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace threatened to fight Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett after she called out Mace for anti-transgender bigotry. Crockett was attempting to get the committee to reinstate its subcommittee on civil rights when she took note of Mace’s recent anti-trans rhetoric andpromotion of billsmeant to restrict transgender rights. “Somebody’s campaign coffers really are struggling right now. So [Mace] gonna keep saying ‘trans, trans, trans’ so that people will feel threatened, and child, listen—” Crockett said. Mace interjected, saying, “I am no child, do not call me a child, I am no child,” then told Crockett, “If you want to take it outside, we can do that.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost objected to the call for violence, but Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican, ruled that the threat could merely have meant going outside to “have a cup of coffee or perhaps a beer.” Following the incident,Mace postedabout it on social media at least a dozen times but claimed that her response to Crockett was not about instigating a fight. “Please explain to me how the same damn Karen that called Cap[itol] Police on a child who shook her hand wanted to act like she wanted to fight me?!”Crockett wrote. “Republicans incite violence from the highest levels of government & ALSO claim to be the party of law & order.  The two cannot be true! Do yourself a favor, decide to require better of your electeds. Last I checked, threatening members in a committee room doesn’t exactly reduce the cost of eggs.” Mace has been widely criticized forpushing House Republicanleadership to adopt a rule that prevents transgender members of the House from using a restroom corresponding to their gender identity. The adoption of the rule followed the successful election of Rep. Sarah McBride, the first (and so far only) openly transgender member of Congress. After being criticized for her bigoted stance, Mace has spent months attacking transgender people. A recent fundraising text for Maceallegedthat a “Trans Mob” wanted to kill her. The comment from Crockett comes as the Republican-led Housepassed legislationto ban transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports at schools that receive funding from the federal government. The bill also changes federal law to say “sex shall be recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” Republicans pushed the bill through—only two Democrats supported it, and no Republicans opposed it—even as concerns have been raised that it would empower predators. “The House Republican Child Predator Empowerment Act does not promote fairness and safety in sports,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffrieswrote. “It will unleash horrific child predators on girls and young women throughout America. Unacceptable.” Frostnotedthat if the Republican bill became law, it would allow young children to be subjected to invasive questions about their genitals from strangers and that inspections could occurwithout parents present. “We must protect children. This bill is disgusting and puts every girl in this country at risk,” he wrote. Republicans,led by Donald Trump, have attacked transgender rights as a unifying rallying cry for bigots to support the party’s candidates at the polls.

Trump's tech sugar daddies bestowed VIP seats for Inauguration Day,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, and oh-so-”masculine"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be very special guests at Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. An official involved with the event planningconfirmed to NBC Newsthat three of the United States’ wealthiest men will be seated together on the platform as theconvicted felontakes the oath of office. The tech bros will be cozied up right next to Trump’s Cabinet nominees and other prominent elected officials. Given the billionaire trio’sseven-figure donationsto the inaugural fund, this naked display of favoritism on Trump’s big day doesn’t come as a surprise. As Daily Kos previously reported, a bunch of tech moguls have lined up tokiss Trump’s ring, offering sizable donations ahead of his second term. But as the three stooges kiss up to the incoming president and throw money at his feet, Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos also share something else in common: personal interests to protect. Online shopping mogul Bezos has alarge stake in defense contractswith his aerospace company Blue Origin—and he also has some trouble ahead with the Federal Trade Commission, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Amazon founder in 2023. The case made headlines last year when the government agency accused Bezos of concealing evidence by using the disappearing messaging service Signal amid the ongoing lawsuit. Despite multiple attempts by Amazon to get the lawsuit thrown out, the hearing is set to go ahead inOctober 2026. And while Bezos butted heads with Trump in the past, it’s clear he knows having Trump on his side this time around can only benefit him. As for Musk, the wealthiest man in the world has multiple investments hinging on his blossoming relationship with Trump—not to mention that Trump’s win aloneboosted Musk’s(and other billionaires’) wealth. Of course, Musk alreadyhas his own Trump-backed vanity projectto keep him and fellow tech bro billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy busy during the next four years: the very unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, which claims it will cut spending by $2 trillion. Zuckerberg also has some concerns about his empire that having a friendship with Trump might alleviate. The Meta owner is set togo to trial with the FTCin April over an antitrust lawsuit regarding his purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg allegedly purchased the apps at an exorbitant price in order to push out any possible competitors. The social media scion seems to be playing up his MAGA support in light of the new administration. As previously reported, Zuckerberg has called off the use ofindependent fact-checkerson Facebook, altered thehateful conduct policyto allow harassment of women and the LGBTQ+ community, announced that content moderation efforts willmove to the famously unbiased Texas, and is dismantling his company’sDEI initiatives. To really drive home his ass-kissing, Zuck is alsoreportedlycohosting a black-tie Inauguration Day reception for his new bestie. Billionaire oligarchs aside, Trump appears to be pulling out all the stops for his big day, booking country music singer Carrie Underwood to sing “America the Beautiful” as well. But given the incoming president’s obsession withcrowd sizesand big introductions, Trump wasn’t satisfied with a simple inauguration ceremony. The Republican will also be hosting three inauguration balls following the morning ceremony:the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball, and the Starlight Ball. Trump will also throw a so-calledVictory Rallyin D.C.’s Capital One Arena the night before. Given the millions of dollars that billionaires have lavished on his inaugural fund, the guy can certainly afford to throw multiple ego-stroking celebrations.
