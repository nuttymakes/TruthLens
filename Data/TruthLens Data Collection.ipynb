    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of seven categories, based on Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with the categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 200 pieces of content for each of the 7 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|Misreporting | Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification. | A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|Persuasive information |Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda. |Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.|\n",
    "|Citizen journalism | User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias. |Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below."

       "      <td>The UK grooming gang scandal is a Galileo moment</td>\n",
       "      <td>This article contains graphicdescriptions of a sort that we would not normally publish but which, in this case, are in the public interest to do so. THERE IS a simple reason that the UK’s grooming gangs scandal is so difficult for liberally minded people to wrap their minds around, and that reason is that the scandal is exactly what ‘the far right’ says it is: Mass, religiously and racially aggravated, rape of thousands of young white working class British girls by Muslim men from mostly Pakistani immigrant backgrounds, on an industrial and organised scale. Every racially aggravating factor you could imagine is present. First, there is substantial evidence that the young girls in question were targetedbecausethey were white. In these communities of Pakistani Muslim rapists, hardly any of the victims were Pakistani Muslim women. Second, the scale of the depravity and violence makes it clear that in many – if not a clear majority – of cases, the abuse was more than just about sex. It was about domination, enslavement, and humiliation. If you doubt me on this point, just readthis 2013 sentencing reportthat did the rounds on X (formerly twitter) in recent days. There’s a quote from it later in this article that sums up the kind of thing you’ll find in there. Third, there is overwhelming evidence that in many cases the abuse was covered up by the authorities and then downplayed by the media right across Britain because it was more ideologically convenient to ignore the mass rape of children than it was to confront the fact that a substantial section of the British Pakistani community harboured (and indeed still harbours) violently sexist and racist attitudes towards white non-muslim women in particular. The implications of that idea wereand aresimply too great for the liberal mind to contemplate its admission. If multiculturalism has a foundational myth, that myth is that all cultures are compatible with each other and that they can always peacefully and harmoniously co-exist in an open and democratic society. The British grooming gangs scandal shatters that myth. The United Kingdom, like most western democracies, is now a feminist society. Women have equal rights in law, and cultural and sexual politics have shifted dramatically over the past fifty years in favour of women. Pakistan remains a deeply entrenched patriarchal society where religious attitudes towards women, and particularly towards men’s right to access women sexually, dominate. Throw in multiculturalism and tolerance and ‘community cohesion’ as major values, and then mix in hard-line Muslim attitudes towards ‘kuffar’ women and women who show more of their flesh than a burkha permits, and the UK gets the mass rape of young white girls by Pakistani Muslim men who believe themselves to have both a cultural and a religious right to use those girls as they see fit. When liberally minded people critique the Catholic church, they often cite the imprisonment in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII of Galileo Galilei, as a result of the latter’s insistence that the earth is round and revolves around the Sun. When that story is recounted, it is presented as a morality tale about how the Roman Catholic Church is anti-science and anti-progress. But it is a human story at heart: Galileo presented evidence that shattered more than a millennium of religious certainty. Faced with evidence, Urban could either publicly accept that a thousand years of teaching had been wrong – risking people askingwhat elsewas wrong – or he could preserve the authority of the Church and silence the heretic. He chose to silence the heretic. The problem, if that analogy wasn’t clear enough for you, is that the UK’s grooming scandal shatters decades of liberal teaching about multiculturalism and might be expected to force people to admit that they might have been wrong. Given the choice between having that discussion on the one hand and writing off all those who raise it as heretics who need silencing on the other, modern British liberals have chosen the path of Urban. Thus, Tommy Robinson is a household name in Britain (and indeed Ireland) for his alleged ‘islamophobia’ while most of us have never heard the name of the man who branded his initials onto a 13-year-old girl, using red hot metal, on the sensitive skin next to her anal passage. His name is Mohammed Karrar. Here is some more of what he did to that child, in the words of the judge who sentenced him: ‘You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand her anal passage. You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of GH, you also used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion.’ Of course, the grooming scandal (which should really be called what it is – a mass rape scandal) is not the only evidence that the UK has an enormous multiculturalism problem linked primarily to the Islamic religion. A2017 investigationby the Guardian revealed that the UK has between 30 and 90 ‘sharia councils’ in operation, which perform the essential functions of courts, granting divorces, regulating marital disputes, and operating as a parallel legal system. The Guardian is a liberal newspaper, but even it had to report that: ‘In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils “supported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages”.’ This is not, to be clear, a British problem. It is a Pakistani cultural and Muslim religious problem that is taking place in the United Kingdom. What’s more, the whole scandal underlines a fact that sends shivers down liberal spines: that elements of Pakistani culture and the Islamic faith pose a real and existential threat to women living in liberal democratic societies. If the state wishes to prevent threats to women (as the liberal state insists it does) and Pakistani culture and elements of the Islamic faith are threats to women, suddenly the conversations become – of necessity – very uncomfortable. Which is why liberal Britain is so desperate to avoid having them. For this cowardice liberalism in Britain and the wider west deserves nothing but contempt, scorn, and condemnation. A generation of ‘progressive’ political leaders of both parties in Britain from the 1970s onwards have consistently prioritised ‘community relations’ over the safety of their own little girls. Young women were allowed to be treated like human filth, while the entire apparatus of the state looked the other way lest it be accused of racism. All the while, towns like Rotherham and Oldham have been permitted to be turned into bastardised versions of Multan, Pakistan. I will leave you with this story, from 2017. It took place in the aforementioned Multan. A young girl was raped by a boy from her village. The victim had a brother. The perpetrator had a sister. The victim’s brother was summoned before the village council and told that justice had been arranged: To avenge the rape of his sister, he would be presented with the rapist’s younger sister – a 16 year old girl – andtold to rape her in turn. This is the culture that Britain has imported. It is the culture that dominates vast swathes of Northern England. The state, and progressives, having admitted it to their country, have a duty to quash it entirely. Racism and community sensitivity be damned.</td>\n",

       "      <td>THERE is a time to be angry. There is a time when it is a sin not to be angry. This is such a time. I have served in the armed forces. I have been a prison chaplain. I have been a minister in one of the roughest parts of Glasgow. I am not naive. Yet I was unable to finish readingthe details of the atrocitiescommitted by a mainly Pakistani Muslim rape gang on white girls. some of them pre-teen. These vile acts were committedprior to 2013yet have came to light last week. Why were they hidden? I think we know the answer. The great Dutch theologian, church leader and prime minister Abraham Kuyper never lost sight of thekleine mensen, the little people. He knew that the supposedly insignificant working-class people were ignored by the main parties and needed protecting. Our secular progressive elites have no interest in or concern for the ordinary working-class people of Britain. When a nation abandons the Bible, the most vulnerable pay the heaviest price. These were not grooming gangs: dogs are groomed. These were paedophile rape and torture gangs. Neither was this confined to Rochdale; paedophile rape gangs have been operatingin towns and cities throughout the UK.Poor white girlsfrom broken homeswere viewed as legitimate targets for rape and exploitation by men from a faith known for its disdain of women. This happened with the complicity of those charged with protecting children. Ina case from Bradforda 15-year-old girl was placed as a foster child in the family of her rapist and made to marry her abuser in an Islamic ceremony with her social worker present. During this period she was forced to convert to Islam and treated as a domestic slave. Mainly Pakistani Muslims preyed upon poor, vulnerable white girls. They were pimped out to others across Britain. Police and social services were so scared of being called racist or Islamophobic they did nothing to protect the girls or arrest the perpetrators. Sometimes they were orderedto do nothing.One girl claimsto have been raped by 150 men; this began when she was 13. Some girlswere murdered. The depth of the contempt the white progressive managerial class has for the white working class is all too evident; their oikophobia is rampant. The primary responsibility for these horrific acts belongs to the mostly Pakistani Muslim perpetrators. Yet it was the weakness and systemic failures of those with responsibility for protecting their own girls which should make us angriest. For them progressive ideology, especially immigration and multiculturalism, was so important that it was worthwhile sacrificing tens of thousands of working-class white girls. Ultimate responsibility lies with our politicians. These politicians are keen on punishing hate crimes. If there was ever a hate crime it was when groups of mainly Pakistani Muslims targeted vulnerable white girls on racial and religious grounds for industrial-scale rape and torture. These hate crimes were ignored. These horrific crimes would not have been allowed to continue unabated if our politicians had not prioritised multiculturalism and vote gathering, a combination of progressive ideology and moral corruption. The white girls were simply the wrong victims, their suffering got in the way of the progressive narrative. If it had been Asian girls the story might have been different. This scandal touchedthe whole of Britain, yet the currentLabour government refusesto hold a national inquiry, asLaura Perrins wrote inTCWyesterday.It is to be left to local authorities with limited resources to investigate these crimes. One doesn’t need to be cynical to askwho is being protectedand which voting bloc appeased. It does the Conservative Party little good to try to assume the high moral ground and call for a national inquiry. They have just emerged from 14 years in power when they did nothing. The police would not have ignored these crimes without strong political backing and instruction. A law enforcement officer came to the conclusion that a 12-year-old who told police she hadsex with five adultshad done so in a ‘100 per cent consensual [way] in every incident’. Thankfully, he was overruled. Therewas the time when a 13-year-oldwas found half-naked and drunk in a house with a group of seven adult Pakistani men. It was the girl who was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The men were not even questioned, never mind arrested. By way of contrast, fathers who attempted to rescue their underage daughters from the houses in which they were being held and rapedwere arrested. From the copper on the beat to the highest-ranking officer, not one police officer has been disciplined or lost their job and pension. The same police who turned a blind eye to these crimes are still policing us. There has been a mass dereliction of duty amongst the media who pride themselves on ‘speaking truth to power’. With a few brave exceptions, such asAndrew Norfolkof theTimesandCharlie Petersof GB News, they have chosen to ignore the elephant in the room. Our progressive elite are so out of touch with the people of Britain they can only see through woke spectacles.Dr Ella Cockbainof University College Londonwrote in 2013that she was concerned that the existence of child abusing networks run by South Asian men was ‘fuelling racist rhetoric’. She was so blind to reality thatshe opined: ‘It can seem that the greatest effrontery about grooming is not the abuse of children but the interracial sex itself.’ The progressives simply cannot grasp how deeply they hold their fellow countrymen and women in contempt. They cannot possibly admit that they look down on the white working class. After all, being liberal-progressives they are the good guys. They are the enlightened. They are the moral arbiters. They are the ones who understand the whole picture. There is a certain parable about specks of sawdust and planks of wood which springs to mind (Matthew 7:3-5). Professor Alexis Jay, who conducted an inquiry into the mass rapes in Rochdale, wrote: ‘The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.’ To date no police officer has been disciplined, no social work director sacked, no politician held to account. While unwilling to protect the most vulnerable in society, the progressive managerial class are more than willing to protect their own. This societal calamity was papered over. That is no longer the case. The mass rape of white British girls is the most egregious example of the high-handed disdain the progressive powers that be have for the indigenous working class.</td>\n",

       "      <td>SIR KEIR Starmer claims that politicians who are calling for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs are‘jumping on a bandwagon of the far right’. In a press conference this morning (about the NHS, obviously, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, obviously) the Prime Minister not only rejected calls for a full public inquiry into the grooming scandal, or more accurately the Muslim child rape, trafficking and prostitution scandal, he also insulted politicians who believe such an inquiry is needed. It was a disgusting slur against anyone who has problems with thesystematic brutalisation of 11-year-old girls. To quote Sir Keir in full: ‘It is something about the nature of our politics because once we lose the anchor that truth matters in the robust debate we must have, then we are on a very slippery slope and when politicians, and I mean politicians, who sat in government for many years are casual about honesty, decency, truth and the rule of law, calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far right, then that affects politics because a robust debate can only be based on the true facts and that is why this is actually an important point about our politics, not about what anybody may or may not say on Twitter.’ A few things. First, it is noteworthy that this press conference was not about the child gang rape scandal but about the NHS, which in itself tells you all you need to know. As I have said before, there are very few subjects that get the lectern treatment: Far Right Thugs get the lectern treatment, the NHS gets the lectern treatment. How and why young white girls were raped and brutalised by gangs of Muslim men while authorities stood by is not worthy of the lectern treatment.This tells you all you need to know about Labour’s political priorities. Second, how dare he? How very dare he say that calling for a proper statutory inquiry into the biggest scandal in British history, namely Muslim gangs of men raping, trafficking and prostituting thousands of white working-class girls, some as young as 11, around the country, while police forces looked the other way, is ‘jumping on the band wagon of the far right’. Yes, there have been inquiries before. There was theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by Professor Alexis Jay, but that was a much broader inquiry into sexual abuse by the Catholic church, Anglican church and others. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry in 2014 after it was revealed that at least 1,400 girls in the South Yorkshire town were abused between 1997 and 2013. TheTimesreported: ‘An eight-year investigation into multiple police failings during the Rotherham sex grooming scandal was condemned as a disgrace after its final report revealed that no officers have been dismissed . . . The IOPC’s resulting Operation Linden investigation examined 265 allegations against 47 police officers by 51 complainants, most of them abuse survivors. It upheld 43 of the complaints and ruled that 14 officers “had a case to answer” for misconduct or gross misconduct.’ One unnamed officer was said to have told the mother of an exploited childthat it was a ‘fashion accessory’ for Rotherham girls to have an ‘older Asian boyfriend’ and that she would ‘grow out of it’. And there were other local council inquiries and safeguarding reviews. But as Sir Keir Starmer well knows – he is a human rights lawyer who normally cannot get enough of inquiries – this is very different from an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 where people are called to give evidence under oath. Starmer says that ‘robust debate can only be based on the true facts’. Ok then, genius, order an inquiry into the rape gangs, and any possible misconduct by police officers under the Inquiries Act 2005 and we will get to the facts. As a bonus, all your human rights lawyer buddies will be quids in for years. Why is Starmer dragging his feet over a public inquiry? As a rule, politicians normally can’t wait to order an inquiry. They demand inquiries over anything. We have the current ridiculous UK Covid-19 Inquiry which will tell us at the end of it all that we should have locked down harder and earlier. There is an Undercover Policing Inquiry. There is the Dawn Sturgess Inquiry, ‘an independent Inquiry into the circumstances ofDawn Sturgess’s deathin Salisbury on 8 July 2018’. There is theIndependent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan‘to investigate the “deliberate detention operations” conducted by the British armed forces in Afghanistan between the period of mid-2010 to mid-2013 to determine whether any of the circumstances around any unlawful killings were covered up at any stage’. This is to name just a few. But for some reason, for some unknown reason, Sir Keir Starmer is refusing to hold a 2005 Act public inquiry into the sodomising and rape of working-class white girls. They are not worthy of this human rights lawyer’s time and attention, it seems. Don’t you know there is a Far Right Thug out there tweeting something mean? You know as well as I do that the Old Bill will be down on them quicker than you can say ‘Mind how you go’ to a Muslim rapist who is receiving a sex act from a minor in his car. (Yes, that happened.) No, nothing to see here, says Starmer, we have had all the itty bitty inquiries into these pesky white girls and their abuse that we need. (My words, not his, just to be clear.) Starmer said, in full: ‘There have been a lot of reviews including localised reviews, including into Oldham for example, the mayor of Manchester did his review, and the Jay report was intended to look at the different types of exploitation that went on. It was a comprehensive review . . . This doesn’t need more consultation. It doesn’t need more research. It just needs action.’ Don’t play me for a fool. Sir Keir Starmer KC knows better than anyone that none of these inquiries are the same as a 2005 inquiry with proper terms of reference, focusing on Muslim rape gangs and any possible police corruption, with the power to call witnesses who must give evidence under oath. Starmer doesn’t want an inquiry because he knows awkward things come out in inquiries. Facts. Truth. Logic. And often liberal beliefs can be slayed. No one is going to push Diversity is our Strength, or say that Britain has experienced an ‘integration miracle’, in the words of that half-wit Fraser Nelson, after such an inquiry, I reckon. No British Prime Minister wants to start unravelling the myth of integration or asking some tough questions about the Islamic faith. That could lead to the kind of facts and truth a Prime Minister could do without, thanks very much. The girls who were raped, sodomised, tortured and brutalised by Muslim rape gangs deserve a public inquiry. It is disgraceful that Starmer is refusing to order one. And it is disgusting to label those who call for one as ‘far right’. It seems that the only time a human right lawyer rejects a public inquiry is when it is about Muslim grooming gangs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHEN I WAS a child, we had ‘outbreaks’ of diseases. Living very close to Aberdeen, I miraculously survived the famous (only if you lived near Aberdeen)typhoid outbreak of 1964, which hospitalised hundreds of people. The only thing it killed, temporarily, was the corned beef trade, as the outbreak was traced to a tin of the popularFray Bentos product. Life soon returned to normal, as did the consumption of tinned meats. That was the first and last ‘outbreak’ that I can recall. Almost anything that more than a couple of folks have caught since has been named an ‘epidemic’. That sounded much more threatening, until it was superseded by the term ‘pandemic’, which seems to be the ubiquitous phrase for anything that used to be an epidemic. Trying to distinguish an epidemic from a pandemic is a fruitless task. The definitions seem to differ depending on where you look and, for all intents and purposes, are interchangeable. The problem for the public health brigade is that, clearly, neither term instils sufficient fear into the population, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 fiasco. Admittedly, they rode high for a time. However, very few people, for example, still wear face masks, apart from a few fainthearts, virtue signallers, and those once again mandated by theirNHS employers. Enthusiasm is waning for covid vaccines. Nevertheless, they must be given credit for their tenacity; they simply don’t give up. In their efforts to paralyse us with fear, pepper the joy of the festive season with a little misery and turn our minds towards the perpetual worship of the NHS, we now have a new category of killer to cope with: the ‘quad-demic’. In case you are interested, this is an allegedly lethal cocktail of ‘flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus’. The quad-demic didn’t seem to do the trick, as the irresponsible British public celebrated the birth of Jesus, visited their families and partied like it was 1999. The outcome? According toNHS England, this has resulted in a ‘tidal wave’ of flu and, in a week, a 70 per cent increase in hospital cases. On New Year’s Eve, clearly concerned that we were not listening, the quad-demic has been upgraded with the epithet of‘terrifying’. How do we know this? Apparently,over a quarter of British people, or at least those gullible enough to take a test, have tested positive for influenza. This does not take into account any false positives, which plague this kind of testing, and it does not report how many of these people were symptomatic. In other words, such testing statistics are virtually meaningless. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said that the worst of the tidal wave was on its way. There have been almost4500 flu patients every day, with 211 people in critical care. Therefore, 0.0078% of the population is hospitalised with flu and 0.00037% is in critical care. Expressed like that, the tidal wave seems more like a puddle in a car park. So, why the fuss? Obviously, it is to do with pressure on the NHS which, above all, must be ‘saved’. The usual guilt-inducing measures are employed to imply that it is all our fault, thus it has been reported that the surge in infections will continue to pick up pace in the coming days as a result of more people socialising indoors over the Christmas and the New Year period. Mask-wearing is encouraged, social distancing rears its ugly head and our old favourite lockdown-style measures have been recommended by virologist from the University of Warwick, Professor Lawrence Young. Laughably, it is recommended that you isolate yourself if you have the flu. In my experience, as flu is a near-death experience, the last thing you would want to do is move, eat, drink or speak. Of course, like Covid-19, all things are not equal with flu. It tends not to strike people down in the prime of their lives; the NHS is not overwhelmed with athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts. People in general good health, while not immune to flu, tend to pull through. The usual suspects arethe most vulnerable: I am the last person to play down the severity of flu. I have had it and, as I write, my son, his wife and two of my daughters, both nurses, have it. It is a horrible infection which I sincerely hope to avoid. However,as explained by Dr Clare Craig, flu is not spread asymptomatically, therefore a person testing positive, who has no flu-like symptoms, poses minimal danger to others. Moreover, the flu virus is airborne, meaning that it quickly spreads after a few people with symptoms have it. To cut a long story short, there is very little that anyone can do either to stop it spreading or, once it is spreading, to avoid encountering it. Most people who do encounter the influenza virus will never know it, as their immune systems will deal with it. Attempts by our public health masters to terrify us into submission with the latest ‘demic’ are just that: attempts to terrify us. Given that they know the above facts as well as we do, and that measures such as face masks and lockdowns are futile, we can only speculate about their motives. If only there was a vaccine!</td>\n",

       "      <td>NEVER underestimate Labour and their determination to wrest any final vestige of authority and concomitant responsibility from parents and endow it on the oh-so-caring state. Labour’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill has its Second Reading tomorrow and given Labour’s thumping majority it will be voted through. Even Sky News’s reporting of it has been mildly critical. A few days ago it led with‘Parents of the most vulnerable children will lose their right to home education’. This is to understate it. It is a further assault on parents’ freedom from the state regarding the upbringing and education of their children, transferring even more powers from parents to the state – a process started by Tony Blair when he decided to centralise, control and regulate families by a programme which merged protection services and child care with the education system. All parents became potential abusers while abusing parents carried on being ignored. In fact it has failed abysmally to protect children. Now Labour are doubling down on failure with the last bastion of parental authority and autonomy from the state, home schooling, threatened. So never mind how bullied your child is or how much you object to a school’s sex education, gender identity teaching or ‘trans’ policy, or how bad the educational ethos and standards are, your power to take your child out of school is to be heavily circumscribed. I have to apologise on behalf ofTCWfor being asleep at the wheel on this one and letting it slide, despite the formidable Rabbi Asher Gratt keeping me copied in on his almost one-man battle with the Government and his various exchanges with Labour bigwigs over his understandable concerns (as well as to the worse than dismissive responses that he has received). As Rabbi Gratt has pointed out repeatedly, ironically the Bill will undermine the very things you might have supposed the DIE minorities mantra stands for: the rights of minorities, cultural diversity and religious pluralism. In fact it never did. Diversity in ‘multiculti’ state education means one thing and that’s what the woke choose it to mean – as an example, to celebrate Diwali but ban Christmas nativity plays in favour of ‘Winterval’. Demoting Christianity in schools despite its being the country’s religion for nearly two thousand years. The bottom line, however,as Rabbi Gratt detailed last month, is that this Bill is the most repressive and authoritarian of assaults on parents. The most repressive since Tony Blair instigated the nationalisation of children when he merged child protection services with the education system andput every child’s ID into a national computer database in order to monitor their use of services. Of course this did nothing to stop child abuse and neglect, rather it treated all parent as potential abusers. What this Bill (planned under the last Conservative Governments) will once again introduce under the guise of child protection is a nationwide register of all children not attending school, a unique identification number for each child akin to a National Insurance number, and, most disturbingly, a requirement for parents to seek council permission to educate their own children at home if a child is under a child protection plan. It is nothing less than the state seizing control over our children, Gratt says: ‘Under these draconian measures, the government assumes control over children’s education in ways that have never before been seen in the UK. Parents will be forced to “register” their children like property and submit to the authority of local councils to determine whether their education is “suitable”. The Bill not only criminalises conscientious parents who seek to provide an education aligned with their religious or philosophical beliefs, but it also sets a dangerous precedent for the erosion of fundamental civil liberties.’ Ironically again, the Bill appears to be in direct violation of parents’ rights as enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees parents the right to educate their children in accordance with their own religious and philosophical beliefs. Perhaps the most shocking measure is the introduction of a unique identifier for every child in England, a ‘child-tracking number’ which will be used across services to monitor and log the child’s every movement, akin to a social credit system. Gratt cites civil liberties groups calling this provision ‘deeply chilling’ and reminiscent of surveillance measures seen in authoritarian regimes. The government claims that these measures are necessary for ‘child protection’. Critics argue it is state overreach on an unimaginable scale. Rabbi Gratt is far from alone in his concerns. The activist education groupEducational Freedom are concerned that the right to home educate is seriously at risk, pointing to the Children’s Commissioner’s chilling explanation of the purpose of the register: ‘If we get proper registers and we have our local authorities taking their responsibilities seriously to engage with these families, we may find that we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be.’ Furthermore they point out that if you choose to home educate you now ‘have to demonstrate your home environment is safe even if your education provision is top notch’. So it proposes in effect to circumvent other legislation to remove parental responsibility by the back door. What constitutes ‘safe’ in a home? Their other concern is that it does nothing to support parents to protect their children ‘when the school environment is enabling them to be harmed’. As Gratt points out in his article, for decades parents in the UK have been able to educate their children at home without interference, ‘a right that is rooted in centuries of common law. It is not just that if a child is under a child protection plan that the parents must seek council permission to continue home education, the measure effectively treats all home parents as suspects under constant surveillance, undermining the presumption of parental competence and good faith’. Both Gratt and Educational Freedom believe the Bill has profound consequences for vulnerable families, particularly those dealing with medical or special educational needs (SEN) children: ‘By forcing parents to seek permission from council authorities, this Bill threatens to reduce the flexibility and personalisation that home education provides for children with complex needs.’ This is nothing less than a surveillance state in disguise. As Gratt says, it is not about education quality, but about control, ‘something you expect in authoritarian regimes, not in a democratic society’.</td>\n",

       "0  This article contains graphicdescriptions of a sort that we would not normally publish but which, in this case, are in the public interest to do so. THERE IS a simple reason that the UK’s grooming gangs scandal is so difficult for liberally minded people to wrap their minds around, and that reason is that the scandal is exactly what ‘the far right’ says it is: Mass, religiously and racially aggravated, rape of thousands of young white working class British girls by Muslim men from mostly Pakistani immigrant backgrounds, on an industrial and organised scale. Every racially aggravating factor you could imagine is present. First, there is substantial evidence that the young girls in question were targetedbecausethey were white. In these communities of Pakistani Muslim rapists, hardly any of the victims were Pakistani Muslim women. Second, the scale of the depravity and violence makes it clear that in many – if not a clear majority – of cases, the abuse was more than just about sex. It was about domination, enslavement, and humiliation. If you doubt me on this point, just readthis 2013 sentencing reportthat did the rounds on X (formerly twitter) in recent days. There’s a quote from it later in this article that sums up the kind of thing you’ll find in there. Third, there is overwhelming evidence that in many cases the abuse was covered up by the authorities and then downplayed by the media right across Britain because it was more ideologically convenient to ignore the mass rape of children than it was to confront the fact that a substantial section of the British Pakistani community harboured (and indeed still harbours) violently sexist and racist attitudes towards white non-muslim women in particular. The implications of that idea wereand aresimply too great for the liberal mind to contemplate its admission. If multiculturalism has a foundational myth, that myth is that all cultures are compatible with each other and that they can always peacefully and harmoniously co-exist in an open and democratic society. The British grooming gangs scandal shatters that myth. The United Kingdom, like most western democracies, is now a feminist society. Women have equal rights in law, and cultural and sexual politics have shifted dramatically over the past fifty years in favour of women. Pakistan remains a deeply entrenched patriarchal society where religious attitudes towards women, and particularly towards men’s right to access women sexually, dominate. Throw in multiculturalism and tolerance and ‘community cohesion’ as major values, and then mix in hard-line Muslim attitudes towards ‘kuffar’ women and women who show more of their flesh than a burkha permits, and the UK gets the mass rape of young white girls by Pakistani Muslim men who believe themselves to have both a cultural and a religious right to use those girls as they see fit. When liberally minded people critique the Catholic church, they often cite the imprisonment in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII of Galileo Galilei, as a result of the latter’s insistence that the earth is round and revolves around the Sun. When that story is recounted, it is presented as a morality tale about how the Roman Catholic Church is anti-science and anti-progress. But it is a human story at heart: Galileo presented evidence that shattered more than a millennium of religious certainty. Faced with evidence, Urban could either publicly accept that a thousand years of teaching had been wrong – risking people askingwhat elsewas wrong – or he could preserve the authority of the Church and silence the heretic. He chose to silence the heretic. The problem, if that analogy wasn’t clear enough for you, is that the UK’s grooming scandal shatters decades of liberal teaching about multiculturalism and might be expected to force people to admit that they might have been wrong. Given the choice between having that discussion on the one hand and writing off all those who raise it as heretics who need silencing on the other, modern British liberals have chosen the path of Urban. Thus, Tommy Robinson is a household name in Britain (and indeed Ireland) for his alleged ‘islamophobia’ while most of us have never heard the name of the man who branded his initials onto a 13-year-old girl, using red hot metal, on the sensitive skin next to her anal passage. His name is Mohammed Karrar. Here is some more of what he did to that child, in the words of the judge who sentenced him: ‘You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand her anal passage. You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of GH, you also used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion.’ Of course, the grooming scandal (which should really be called what it is – a mass rape scandal) is not the only evidence that the UK has an enormous multiculturalism problem linked primarily to the Islamic religion. A2017 investigationby the Guardian revealed that the UK has between 30 and 90 ‘sharia councils’ in operation, which perform the essential functions of courts, granting divorces, regulating marital disputes, and operating as a parallel legal system. The Guardian is a liberal newspaper, but even it had to report that: ‘In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils “supported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages”.’ This is not, to be clear, a British problem. It is a Pakistani cultural and Muslim religious problem that is taking place in the United Kingdom. What’s more, the whole scandal underlines a fact that sends shivers down liberal spines: that elements of Pakistani culture and the Islamic faith pose a real and existential threat to women living in liberal democratic societies. If the state wishes to prevent threats to women (as the liberal state insists it does) and Pakistani culture and elements of the Islamic faith are threats to women, suddenly the conversations become – of necessity – very uncomfortable. Which is why liberal Britain is so desperate to avoid having them. For this cowardice liberalism in Britain and the wider west deserves nothing but contempt, scorn, and condemnation. A generation of ‘progressive’ political leaders of both parties in Britain from the 1970s onwards have consistently prioritised ‘community relations’ over the safety of their own little girls. Young women were allowed to be treated like human filth, while the entire apparatus of the state looked the other way lest it be accused of racism. All the while, towns like Rotherham and Oldham have been permitted to be turned into bastardised versions of Multan, Pakistan. I will leave you with this story, from 2017. It took place in the aforementioned Multan. A young girl was raped by a boy from her village. The victim had a brother. The perpetrator had a sister. The victim’s brother was summoned before the village council and told that justice had been arranged: To avenge the rape of his sister, he would be presented with the rapist’s younger sister – a 16 year old girl – andtold to rape her in turn. This is the culture that Britain has imported. It is the culture that dominates vast swathes of Northern England. The state, and progressives, having admitted it to their country, have a duty to quash it entirely. Racism and community sensitivity be damned.   \n",

There is a time when it is a sin not to be angry. This is such a time. I have served in the armed forces. I have been a prison chaplain. I have been a minister in one of the roughest parts of Glasgow. I am not naive. Yet I was unable to finish readingthe details of the atrocitiescommitted by a mainly Pakistani Muslim rape gang on white girls. some of them pre-teen. These vile acts were committedprior to 2013yet have came to light last week. Why were they hidden? I think we know the answer. The great Dutch theologian, church leader and prime minister Abraham Kuyper never lost sight of thekleine mensen, the little people. He knew that the supposedly insignificant working-class people were ignored by the main parties and needed protecting. Our secular progressive elites have no interest in or concern for the ordinary working-class people of Britain. When a nation abandons the Bible, the most vulnerable pay the heaviest price. These were not grooming gangs: dogs are groomed. These were paedophile rape and torture gangs. Neither was this confined to Rochdale; paedophile rape gangs have been operatingin towns and cities throughout the UK.Poor white girlsfrom broken homeswere viewed as legitimate targets for rape and exploitation by men from a faith known for its disdain of women. This happened with the complicity of those charged with protecting children. Ina case from Bradforda 15-year-old girl was placed as a foster child in the family of her rapist and made to marry her abuser in an Islamic ceremony with her social worker present. During this period she was forced to convert to Islam and treated as a domestic slave. Mainly Pakistani Muslims preyed upon poor, vulnerable white girls. They were pimped out to others across Britain. Police and social services were so scared of being called racist or Islamophobic they did nothing to protect the girls or arrest the perpetrators. Sometimes they were orderedto do nothing.One girl claimsto have been raped by 150 men; this began when she was 13. Some girlswere murdered. The depth of the contempt the white progressive managerial class has for the white working class is all too evident; their oikophobia is rampant. The primary responsibility for these horrific acts belongs to the mostly Pakistani Muslim perpetrators. Yet it was the weakness and systemic failures of those with responsibility for protecting their own girls which should make us angriest. For them progressive ideology, especially immigration and multiculturalism, was so important that it was worthwhile sacrificing tens of thousands of working-class white girls. Ultimate responsibility lies with our politicians. These politicians are keen on punishing hate crimes. If there was ever a hate crime it was when groups of mainly Pakistani Muslims targeted vulnerable white girls on racial and religious grounds for industrial-scale rape and torture. These hate crimes were ignored. These horrific crimes would not have been allowed to continue unabated if our politicians had not prioritised multiculturalism and vote gathering, a combination of progressive ideology and moral corruption. The white girls were simply the wrong victims, their suffering got in the way of the progressive narrative. If it had been Asian girls the story might have been different. This scandal touchedthe whole of Britain, yet the currentLabour government refusesto hold a national inquiry, asLaura Perrins wrote inTCWyesterday.It is to be left to local authorities with limited resources to investigate these crimes. One doesn’t need to be cynical to askwho is being protectedand which voting bloc appeased. It does the Conservative Party little good to try to assume the high moral ground and call for a national inquiry. They have just emerged from 14 years in power when they did nothing. The police would not have ignored these crimes without strong political backing and instruction. A law enforcement officer came to the conclusion that a 12-year-old who told police she hadsex with five adultshad done so in a ‘100 per cent consensual [way] in every incident’. Thankfully, he was overruled. Therewas the time when a 13-year-oldwas found half-naked and drunk in a house with a group of seven adult Pakistani men. It was the girl who was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The men were not even questioned, never mind arrested. By way of contrast, fathers who attempted to rescue their underage daughters from the houses in which they were being held and rapedwere arrested. From the copper on the beat to the highest-ranking officer, not one police officer has been disciplined or lost their job and pension. The same police who turned a blind eye to these crimes are still policing us. There has been a mass dereliction of duty amongst the media who pride themselves on ‘speaking truth to power’. With a few brave exceptions, such asAndrew Norfolkof theTimesandCharlie Petersof GB News, they have chosen to ignore the elephant in the room. Our progressive elite are so out of touch with the people of Britain they can only see through woke spectacles.Dr Ella Cockbainof University College Londonwrote in 2013that she was concerned that the existence of child abusing networks run by South Asian men was ‘fuelling racist rhetoric’. She was so blind to reality thatshe opined: ‘It can seem that the greatest effrontery about grooming is not the abuse of children but the interracial sex itself.’ The progressives simply cannot grasp how deeply they hold their fellow countrymen and women in contempt. They cannot possibly admit that they look down on the white working class. After all, being liberal-progressives they are the good guys. They are the enlightened. They are the moral arbiters. They are the ones who understand the whole picture. There is a certain parable about specks of sawdust and planks of wood which springs to mind (Matthew 7:3-5). Professor Alexis Jay, who conducted an inquiry into the mass rapes in Rochdale, wrote: ‘The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.’ To date no police officer has been disciplined, no social work director sacked, no politician held to account. While unwilling to protect the most vulnerable in society, the progressive managerial class are more than willing to protect their own. This societal calamity was papered over. That is no longer the case. The mass rape of white British girls is the most egregious example of the high-handed disdain the progressive powers that be have for the indigenous working class.   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        SIR KEIR Starmer claims that politicians who are calling for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs are‘jumping on a bandwagon of the far right’. In a press conference this morning (about the NHS, obviously, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, obviously) the Prime Minister not only rejected calls for a full public inquiry into the grooming scandal, or more accurately the Muslim child rape, trafficking and prostitution scandal, he also insulted politicians who believe such an inquiry is needed. It was a disgusting slur against anyone who has problems with thesystematic brutalisation of 11-year-old girls. To quote Sir Keir in full: ‘It is something about the nature of our politics because once we lose the anchor that truth matters in the robust debate we must have, then we are on a very slippery slope and when politicians, and I mean politicians, who sat in government for many years are casual about honesty, decency, truth and the rule of law, calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far right, then that affects politics because a robust debate can only be based on the true facts and that is why this is actually an important point about our politics, not about what anybody may or may not say on Twitter.’ A few things. First, it is noteworthy that this press conference was not about the child gang rape scandal but about the NHS, which in itself tells you all you need to know. As I have said before, there are very few subjects that get the lectern treatment: Far Right Thugs get the lectern treatment, the NHS gets the lectern treatment. How and why young white girls were raped and brutalised by gangs of Muslim men while authorities stood by is not worthy of the lectern treatment.This tells you all you need to know about Labour’s political priorities. Second, how dare he? How very dare he say that calling for a proper statutory inquiry into the biggest scandal in British history, namely Muslim gangs of men raping, trafficking and prostituting thousands of white working-class girls, some as young as 11, around the country, while police forces looked the other way, is ‘jumping on the band wagon of the far right’. Yes, there have been inquiries before. There was theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by Professor Alexis Jay, but that was a much broader inquiry into sexual abuse by the Catholic church, Anglican church and others. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry in 2014 after it was revealed that at least 1,400 girls in the South Yorkshire town were abused between 1997 and 2013. TheTimesreported: ‘An eight-year investigation into multiple police failings during the Rotherham sex grooming scandal was condemned as a disgrace after its final report revealed that no officers have been dismissed . . . The IOPC’s resulting Operation Linden investigation examined 265 allegations against 47 police officers by 51 complainants, most of them abuse survivors. It upheld 43 of the complaints and ruled that 14 officers “had a case to answer” for misconduct or gross misconduct.’ One unnamed officer was said to have told the mother of an exploited childthat it was a ‘fashion accessory’ for Rotherham girls to have an ‘older Asian boyfriend’ and that she would ‘grow out of it’. And there were other local council inquiries and safeguarding reviews. But as Sir Keir Starmer well knows – he is a human rights lawyer who normally cannot get enough of inquiries – this is very different from an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 where people are called to give evidence under oath. Starmer says that ‘robust debate can only be based on the true facts’. Ok then, genius, order an inquiry into the rape gangs, and any possible misconduct by police officers under the Inquiries Act 2005 and we will get to the facts. As a bonus, all your human rights lawyer buddies will be quids in for years. Why is Starmer dragging his feet over a public inquiry? As a rule, politicians normally can’t wait to order an inquiry. They demand inquiries over anything. We have the current ridiculous UK Covid-19 Inquiry which will tell us at the end of it all that we should have locked down harder and earlier. There is an Undercover Policing Inquiry. There is the Dawn Sturgess Inquiry, ‘an independent Inquiry into the circumstances ofDawn Sturgess’s deathin Salisbury on 8 July 2018’. There is theIndependent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan‘to investigate the “deliberate detention operations” conducted by the British armed forces in Afghanistan between the period of mid-2010 to mid-2013 to determine whether any of the circumstances around any unlawful killings were covered up at any stage’. This is to name just a few. But for some reason, for some unknown reason, Sir Keir Starmer is refusing to hold a 2005 Act public inquiry into the sodomising and rape of working-class white girls. They are not worthy of this human rights lawyer’s time and attention, it seems. Don’t you know there is a Far Right Thug out there tweeting something mean? You know as well as I do that the Old Bill will be down on them quicker than you can say ‘Mind how you go’ to a Muslim rapist who is receiving a sex act from a minor in his car. (Yes, that happened.) No, nothing to see here, says Starmer, we have had all the itty bitty inquiries into these pesky white girls and their abuse that we need. (My words, not his, just to be clear.) Starmer said, in full: ‘There have been a lot of reviews including localised reviews, including into Oldham for example, the mayor of Manchester did his review, and the Jay report was intended to look at the different types of exploitation that went on. It was a comprehensive review . . . This doesn’t need more consultation. It doesn’t need more research. It just needs action.’ Don’t play me for a fool. Sir Keir Starmer KC knows better than anyone that none of these inquiries are the same as a 2005 inquiry with proper terms of reference, focusing on Muslim rape gangs and any possible police corruption, with the power to call witnesses who must give evidence under oath. Starmer doesn’t want an inquiry because he knows awkward things come out in inquiries. Facts. Truth. Logic. And often liberal beliefs can be slayed. No one is going to push Diversity is our Strength, or say that Britain has experienced an ‘integration miracle’, in the words of that half-wit Fraser Nelson, after such an inquiry, I reckon. No British Prime Minister wants to start unravelling the myth of integration or asking some tough questions about the Islamic faith. That could lead to the kind of facts and truth a Prime Minister could do without, thanks very much. The girls who were raped, sodomised, tortured and brutalised by Muslim rape gangs deserve a public inquiry. It is disgraceful that Starmer is refusing to order one. And it is disgusting to label those who call for one as ‘far right’. It seems that the only time a human right lawyer rejects a public inquiry is when it is about Muslim grooming gangs.   \n",

Living very close to Aberdeen, I miraculously survived the famous (only if you lived near Aberdeen)typhoid outbreak of 1964, which hospitalised hundreds of people. The only thing it killed, temporarily, was the corned beef trade, as the outbreak was traced to a tin of the popularFray Bentos product. Life soon returned to normal, as did the consumption of tinned meats. That was the first and last ‘outbreak’ that I can recall. Almost anything that more than a couple of folks have caught since has been named an ‘epidemic’. That sounded much more threatening, until it was superseded by the term ‘pandemic’, which seems to be the ubiquitous phrase for anything that used to be an epidemic. Trying to distinguish an epidemic from a pandemic is a fruitless task. The definitions seem to differ depending on where you look and, for all intents and purposes, are interchangeable. The problem for the public health brigade is that, clearly, neither term instils sufficient fear into the population, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 fiasco. Admittedly, they rode high for a time. However, very few people, for example, still wear face masks, apart from a few fainthearts, virtue signallers, and those once again mandated by theirNHS employers. Enthusiasm is waning for covid vaccines. Nevertheless, they must be given credit for their tenacity; they simply don’t give up. In their efforts to paralyse us with fear, pepper the joy of the festive season with a little misery and turn our minds towards the perpetual worship of the NHS, we now have a new category of killer to cope with: the ‘quad-demic’. In case you are interested, this is an allegedly lethal cocktail of ‘flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus’. The quad-demic didn’t seem to do the trick, as the irresponsible British public celebrated the birth of Jesus, visited their families and partied like it was 1999. The outcome? According toNHS England, this has resulted in a ‘tidal wave’ of flu and, in a week, a 70 per cent increase in hospital cases. On New Year’s Eve, clearly concerned that we were not listening, the quad-demic has been upgraded with the epithet of‘terrifying’. How do we know this? Apparently,over a quarter of British people, or at least those gullible enough to take a test, have tested positive for influenza. This does not take into account any false positives, which plague this kind of testing, and it does not report how many of these people were symptomatic. In other words, such testing statistics are virtually meaningless. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said that the worst of the tidal wave was on its way. There have been almost4500 flu patients every day, with 211 people in critical care. Therefore, 0.0078% of the population is hospitalised with flu and 0.00037% is in critical care. Expressed like that, the tidal wave seems more like a puddle in a car park. So, why the fuss? Obviously, it is to do with pressure on the NHS which, above all, must be ‘saved’. The usual guilt-inducing measures are employed to imply that it is all our fault, thus it has been reported that the surge in infections will continue to pick up pace in the coming days as a result of more people socialising indoors over the Christmas and the New Year period. Mask-wearing is encouraged, social distancing rears its ugly head and our old favourite lockdown-style measures have been recommended by virologist from the University of Warwick, Professor Lawrence Young. Laughably, it is recommended that you isolate yourself if you have the flu. In my experience, as flu is a near-death experience, the last thing you would want to do is move, eat, drink or speak. Of course, like Covid-19, all things are not equal with flu. It tends not to strike people down in the prime of their lives; the NHS is not overwhelmed with athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts. People in general good health, while not immune to flu, tend to pull through. The usual suspects arethe most vulnerable: I am the last person to play down the severity of flu. I have had it and, as I write, my son, his wife and two of my daughters, both nurses, have it. It is a horrible infection which I sincerely hope to avoid. However,as explained by Dr Clare Craig, flu is not spread asymptomatically, therefore a person testing positive, who has no flu-like symptoms, poses minimal danger to others. Moreover, the flu virus is airborne, meaning that it quickly spreads after a few people with symptoms have it. To cut a long story short, there is very little that anyone can do either to stop it spreading or, once it is spreading, to avoid encountering it. Most people who do encounter the influenza virus will never know it, as their immune systems will deal with it. Attempts by our public health masters to terrify us into submission with the latest ‘demic’ are just that: attempts to terrify us. Given that they know the above facts as well as we do, and that measures such as face masks and lockdowns are futile, we can only speculate about their motives. If only there was a vaccine!   \n",

Labour’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill has its Second Reading tomorrow and given Labour’s thumping majority it will be voted through. Even Sky News’s reporting of it has been mildly critical. A few days ago it led with‘Parents of the most vulnerable children will lose their right to home education’. This is to understate it. It is a further assault on parents’ freedom from the state regarding the upbringing and education of their children, transferring even more powers from parents to the state – a process started by Tony Blair when he decided to centralise, control and regulate families by a programme which merged protection services and child care with the education system. All parents became potential abusers while abusing parents carried on being ignored. In fact it has failed abysmally to protect children. Now Labour are doubling down on failure with the last bastion of parental authority and autonomy from the state, home schooling, threatened. So never mind how bullied your child is or how much you object to a school’s sex education, gender identity teaching or ‘trans’ policy, or how bad the educational ethos and standards are, your power to take your child out of school is to be heavily circumscribed. I have to apologise on behalf ofTCWfor being asleep at the wheel on this one and letting it slide, despite the formidable Rabbi Asher Gratt keeping me copied in on his almost one-man battle with the Government and his various exchanges with Labour bigwigs over his understandable concerns (as well as to the worse than dismissive responses that he has received). As Rabbi Gratt has pointed out repeatedly, ironically the Bill will undermine the very things you might have supposed the DIE minorities mantra stands for: the rights of minorities, cultural diversity and religious pluralism. In fact it never did. Diversity in ‘multiculti’ state education means one thing and that’s what the woke choose it to mean – as an example, to celebrate Diwali but ban Christmas nativity plays in favour of ‘Winterval’. Demoting Christianity in schools despite its being the country’s religion for nearly two thousand years. The bottom line, however,as Rabbi Gratt detailed last month, is that this Bill is the most repressive and authoritarian of assaults on parents. The most repressive since Tony Blair instigated the nationalisation of children when he merged child protection services with the education system andput every child’s ID into a national computer database in order to monitor their use of services. Of course this did nothing to stop child abuse and neglect, rather it treated all parent as potential abusers. What this Bill (planned under the last Conservative Governments) will once again introduce under the guise of child protection is a nationwide register of all children not attending school, a unique identification number for each child akin to a National Insurance number, and, most disturbingly, a requirement for parents to seek council permission to educate their own children at home if a child is under a child protection plan. It is nothing less than the state seizing control over our children, Gratt says: ‘Under these draconian measures, the government assumes control over children’s education in ways that have never before been seen in the UK. Parents will be forced to “register” their children like property and submit to the authority of local councils to determine whether their education is “suitable”. The Bill not only criminalises conscientious parents who seek to provide an education aligned with their religious or philosophical beliefs, but it also sets a dangerous precedent for the erosion of fundamental civil liberties.’ Ironically again, the Bill appears to be in direct violation of parents’ rights as enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees parents the right to educate their children in accordance with their own religious and philosophical beliefs. Perhaps the most shocking measure is the introduction of a unique identifier for every child in England, a ‘child-tracking number’ which will be used across services to monitor and log the child’s every movement, akin to a social credit system. Gratt cites civil liberties groups calling this provision ‘deeply chilling’ and reminiscent of surveillance measures seen in authoritarian regimes. The government claims that these measures are necessary for ‘child protection’. Critics argue it is state overreach on an unimaginable scale. Rabbi Gratt is far from alone in his concerns. The activist education groupEducational Freedom are concerned that the right to home educate is seriously at risk, pointing to the Children’s Commissioner’s chilling explanation of the purpose of the register: ‘If we get proper registers and we have our local authorities taking their responsibilities seriously to engage with these families, we may find that we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be.’ Furthermore they point out that if you choose to home educate you now ‘have to demonstrate your home environment is safe even if your education provision is top notch’. So it proposes in effect to circumvent other legislation to remove parental responsibility by the back door. What constitutes ‘safe’ in a home? Their other concern is that it does nothing to support parents to protect their children ‘when the school environment is enabling them to be harmed’. As Gratt points out in his article, for decades parents in the UK have been able to educate their children at home without interference, ‘a right that is rooted in centuries of common law. It is not just that if a child is under a child protection plan that the parents must seek council permission to continue home education, the measure effectively treats all home parents as suspects under constant surveillance, undermining the presumption of parental competence and good faith’. Both Gratt and Educational Freedom believe the Bill has profound consequences for vulnerable families, particularly those dealing with medical or special educational needs (SEN) children: ‘By forcing parents to seek permission from council authorities, this Bill threatens to reduce the flexibility and personalisation that home education provides for children with complex needs.’ This is nothing less than a surveillance state in disguise. As Gratt says, it is not about education quality, but about control, ‘something you expect in authoritarian regimes, not in a democratic society’.   \n",

       "      <td>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have been interviewed under caution by the Met Police. It was over the force’s alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met – accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media – ‘doorstopping’ the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn’s response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police’s actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day – notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children’s marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers – including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures – would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines – the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, ‘please filter through.’ When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation – a maximum of 25 people – be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to ‘pass this up the line for a decision.’ While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police’s actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them – and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the ‘Filton 18’ political prisoners have entered ‘not guilty’ pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel’s largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including ‘quadcopter’ drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a ‘terrorism connection’. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel’s largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK’s complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a “terror connection” in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On Saturday 18 January, Britons once again took to the streets to show their support for the people of Palestine. As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as “fascist” police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn’s response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn’s former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers’ body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel’s genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included “domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide.” The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel’s wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel’s genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn’t turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned ‘second phase’ of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn’t mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It’s alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it’s not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions “go away” and that they’ll be “locked up”. On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn’t come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn’t be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It’s all the same system; it’s all the same violence; we’re just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won’t hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.</td>\n",

       "      <td>With Donald Trump’s election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women’s rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right – just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there’s always someone else to blame – not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations – almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It’s one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It’s another to be blamed for your child’s disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. “Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called “Functional Somatic Syndromes” (FSS) and “Medically Unexplained Syndromes” (MUS) umbrellas”.  DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there’s a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument – with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It’s such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there’s no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke’s Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It’s more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope – one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education’ changed the phrase ‘deliberately missing’ education to ‘unexplainable and/or persistent absence’ in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it’s easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem – all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism. It supplies simple answers, shifts the blame game on to the individual – all to avoid institutional due diligence. It is no wonder that women have been caught in the crosshairs. We have become an easy target for complex problems.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Prime minister Keir Starmer has had another bad week. While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven’t all ended with a punchline. That’s because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn’t finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn’t: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the “stomach or the balls” to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: “Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election.” Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a ‘fighter’: While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun – a newspaper which has been in decline for years – he’s not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he’s also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer’s war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain’s disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: “We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,” Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. “I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he’s going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off.” We’re sure he does remind himself of that; we’re sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can’t keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they’re just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn’t understand that while you can get away with telling people ‘I will deliver’; you can’t get away with delivering people shit once you’re in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet – the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is ‘yes’; the long answer is ‘ha ha ha ha ha, yes’. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced – a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don’t know how long he’ll last as prime minister, but we do know there’ll be serious talk of him going if this year’s local elections go as badly as people are predicting.</td>\n",

It was over the force’s alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met – accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media – ‘doorstopping’ the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn’s response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police’s actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day – notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children’s marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers – including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures – would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines – the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, ‘please filter through.’ When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation – a maximum of 25 people – be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to ‘pass this up the line for a decision.’ While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police’s actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                      Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them – and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the ‘Filton 18’ political prisoners have entered ‘not guilty’ pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel’s largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including ‘quadcopter’ drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a ‘terrorism connection’. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel’s largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK’s complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a “terror connection” in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.   \n",

As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as “fascist” police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn’s response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn’s former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers’ body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel’s genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included “domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide.” The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel’s wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel’s genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn’t turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned ‘second phase’ of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn’t mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It’s alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it’s not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions “go away” and that they’ll be “locked up”. On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn’t come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn’t be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It’s all the same system; it’s all the same violence; we’re just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won’t hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.   \n",
       "3  With Donald Trump’s election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women’s rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right – just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there’s always someone else to blame – not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations – almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It’s one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It’s another to be blamed for your child’s disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. “Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called “Functional Somatic Syndromes” (FSS) and “Medically Unexplained Syndromes” (MUS) umbrellas”.  DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there’s a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument – with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It’s such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there’s no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke’s Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It’s more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope – one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education’ changed the phrase ‘deliberately missing’ education to ‘unexplainable and/or persistent absence’ in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it’s easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem – all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism.

While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven’t all ended with a punchline. That’s because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn’t finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn’t: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the “stomach or the balls” to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: “Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election.” Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a ‘fighter’: While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun – a newspaper which has been in decline for years – he’s not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he’s also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer’s war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain’s disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: “We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,” Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. “I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he’s going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off.” We’re sure he does remind himself of that; we’re sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can’t keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they’re just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn’t understand that while you can get away with telling people ‘I will deliver’; you can’t get away with delivering people shit once you’re in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet – the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is ‘yes’; the long answer is ‘ha ha ha ha ha, yes’. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced – a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don’t know how long he’ll last as prime minister, but we do know there’ll be serious talk of him going if this year’s local elections go as badly as people are predicting.   \n",

Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.” At press time, a Gallup Poll had found that 70% of Americans opposed Biden being rescued.</td>\n",

But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I’m not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I’m saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?” Hartford went on to say that it might be helpful if Julia stayed at home for their next sessions so that they could spend more time understanding where, exactly, David’s hotness came from.</td>\n",

After that, you can sit back and collect thousands of dollars a month. How cool is that? You and your little friends are going to have so much fun building your little real estate empire. Enjoy!” At press time, sources reported Schweitz’s son was enthusiastically climbing into the tree house to serve an eviction notice to the low-income family currently living there.</td>\n",

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.” At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.</td>\n",

From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board</td>\n",

Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.” At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.</td>\n",

No, I’m serious here, I really am. Just believe me when I say this: Yesterday the better man won, which was me.” According to reports, Harris half-heartedly muttered, “Thank you, Donald,” before hanging up the phone.</td>\n",

But it really shows the power of one citizenry to come together and prevail over themselves.

One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can’t remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there’s also just a ‘meteor’ too, isn’t there?

And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He’s seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn’t want to experience one again.” At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.</td>\n",

Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.” At press time, a Gallup Poll had found that 70% of Americans opposed Biden being rescued.   \n",

But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I’m not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I’m saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?” Hartford went on to say that it might be helpful if Julia stayed at home for their next sessions so that they could spend more time understanding where, exactly, David’s hotness came from.   \n",

After that, you can sit back and collect thousands of dollars a month. How cool is that? You and your little friends are going to have so much fun building your little real estate empire. Enjoy!” At press time, sources reported Schweitz’s son was enthusiastically climbing into the tree house to serve an eviction notice to the low-income family currently living there.   \n",

With these mighty strands, I command the wildfires and the earthquakes, the droughts and the floods!” At press time, sources confirmed Newsom’s hair product had evicted several homeless people seeking shelter within the throbbing gelatinous nest upon his head.   \n",

They’ll also receive $10,000 in cash. Frankly, it’s a tragedy we’ve let these American heroes rot in their graves for this long.” Reacting to a moment in the video when MrBeast gives a reanimated World War II veteran a Lamborghini, viewers expressed outrage toward the apparent ingratitude of the undead soldier, who only screams, “Why did you do this? Kill me…kill me!” into the camera.   \n",

It’s just that your pal Cassidy can only handle so much hootin’ and hollerin’ before he plumb runs out of steam. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna kick up my spurs and snuggle up in my bedroll with a Louis L’Amour novel.” At press time, another successful train robbery had reportedly been carried out in the area by a tireless gang of extroverted outlaws.   \n",

Bush in a time of crisis, thousands of country stations across America reportedly refused to play Beyoncé’s music Thursday after the artist condemned the Iraq War. “If she doesn’t want to support our troops risking their lives out there  for the cause of freedom, then we don’t need her,” said  country radio executive Hunter Roeloffs, one of many station owners who  blacklisted the recent singles “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages”  after controversial comments in which the star expressed reservations about the U.S.-led Coalition invasion of Iraq—remarks that also led to a reported drop in ticket  sales and Beyoncé losing a sponsorship deal with Lipton. “Unlike Miss  Knowles, we’re proud Americans here at 100.3 the Bull. We support  freedom, whether it’s here or in the Middle East. So when she says  innocent lives will be lost, I can’t help but wonder how she could  possibly think a bloodthirsty dictator like Saddam Hussein is innocent.  And then there’s that line of hers about being ashamed of President  Bush? Well, we’re ashamed of her. How about that?” At press time,  Beyoncé had attracted additional criticism from the country music scene  after rebranding herself as the Chicks.   \n",

Stab him, you cowards!” on Friday after she plunged a knife into President Joe Biden’s back. “What are you waiting for, you fools? Strike now! Strike before the opportunity goes cold!” said the blood-dappled vice president, who, as her staff appeared to grow uncertain of the blades in their shaking hands and backed away toward the exit,  reminded each panicked aide in turn that they had pledged their fealty for this day. “Think of all I’ve promised you. Think of all we stand to gain. Quick, now, the first blow has been rendered. There is no going back. We’re confederates in this. We must act now or be damned by inaction!” At press time, sources confirmed President Biden had complained to an assistant of a tightness in his shoulder and returned to the Oval Office with the knife still protruding from his back.   \n",

They see a blank slate.

Our trials with Evanovia, however, show that it now takes just one injection and within 12 hours any obese individual will start rapidly thinning before finally melting out of existence completely.” At press time, critics had warned about a rash of influencers, models, and actresses who were using the drug to vanish despite not being overweight themselves.   \n",

Many don’t even know that before Destiny’s Child, she was in a two-person jug band with her bucktoothed grandpappy, Earl Bob, in which she played a rusty washboard and slapped her knee. This is not some random new roadkill-skinning persona she’s putting on—it is absolutely genuine.” At press time, Beyoncé’s merch store had begun selling preorders for home-cooked meth.   \n",

Not that it’s about the money! It’s not! I just love what I do! The violence sexually excites me!

I was at his house once, and he actually just had money lying around, including at least $25 worth of quarters in what I can only assume was some kind of high-yield coin jar.” At press time, Reed had reportedly lost everything he had after sinking all his money into a new set of tires when his car failed inspection.   \n",

In fact, had he not had a pen and this napkin handy that fateful night, Epstein’s island, his dozens of accusers, and his large, all-powerful cabal of elite pedophiles might  never have existed.” At press time, Sotheby’s confirmed the napkin had sold for over $200 million after several of Epstein’s associates, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew got into a heated bidding war over the priceless memorabilia.   \n",

Simpson was reportedly allowed to remain alive Thursday after his coffin didn’t fit. “If the coffin doesn’t fit, you must let him live a bit.” said O.J. eulogizer Tommie Lochran, who advocated for Simpson to continue living despite evidence that the coffin had shrunk after previously getting wet. “Any DNA found in the casket that appears to be Mr. Simpson’s, I believe, was the result of contamination. It would be existential malpractice to allow Mr. Simpson to die knowing full well that this coffin was not made for him.” At press time, Simpson went on a media blitz promoting his escape from death.   \n",

Throw me!’ into his ear, and then he did. He whipped her across the grounds so easily—it was so cute. She just went soaring over the heads of everyone in the crowd.” At press time, Renny was gushing over another viral video that showed Kelce spiking Swift into the ground.   \n",

According to witnesses, the 81-year-old commander-in-chief remained quite calm during his apparent abduction by the insects, showing no signs of resistance as the swarm of approximately 2,500 black carpenter ants hoisted him over their bodies using their powerful mandibles and began marching slowly but steadily toward the White House Rose Garden. Secret Service officials confirmed that snipers stationed on the  roof of the executive mansion fired upon the swarm to no avail, reportedly because the ants’ 6-millimeter-long bodies were simply too small to target. At press time, sources said the FBI was negotiating with the ant colony’s queen for Biden’s release.   \n",

Going forward, none of our models will be outfitted with brakes. Instead, we will shift our efforts to making fart noises louder.” At press time, Tesla staffers responsible for wheels were reportedly nervous after receiving an ominous meeting request from HR.   \n",

That’s just good sportsmanship. So from now on, every chicken in our Perdue facilities will have free and easy access to firearms. We may lose some staff to gunshot wounds, but everyone involved—human or fowl—will have an opportunity to defend themselves. It’s only right.” At press time, sources confirmed a shift in the balance of power at several Perdue processing plants had resulted in thousands of employees being slaughter with assembly-line efficiency.   \n",

Ron DeSantis (R) signed a new law Thursday requiring all Florida women to produce three healthy, white sons by the date of their 22nd birthday. “The production of white daughters will not be penalized, but they will be seized by the state for the production of white sons,” said DeSantis, who clarified that regardless of the race, ethnicity, or religious background of the mother, all sons would be required to be both white and raised in a Catholic household. “Three is the bare minimum. Despite what the virtue-signaling, left-wing fanatics are espousing on CNN, this requirement is actually quite fair and attainable. Whether Florida women and girls choose to get started at age 15 or 19, they will have plenty of time to comply.” At press time, DeSantis added that a miscarriage counted as negative one white sons.   \n",

We’ll do our best to reattach the fingers that weren’t swallowed, but that isn’t going to prevent these patients from chewing them off again the next time they eat a gyro or cheesesteak.” At press time, saying they really needed something to wash down their sandwich with, several of the patients reportedly failed to  realize they were drinking the blood from their wounded hand.   \n",

It can’t be her doctrine they’re drawn to, because that is not particularly inspiring either. We know these followers would kill for her, but the question is, why?” Douglass went on to hypothesize that perhaps Swift was blackmailing her followers with sordid details of their personal lives she had obtained through fan letters.   \n",

No one could  have told me? No one? Fuck all of you. Seriously. Well, I suppose I should have learned my lesson when I tried  to speak to that scarecrow in Mozambique.” At press time, Attenborough  was spotted chewing out a flustered assistant director of photography and insisting that he  needed to delete the footage immediately.   \n",

USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction “DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian” underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it. Insiders confirmed that with the right currents and weather patterns, the chocolate-flavored meal replacement should reach Gaza by 2035, only two years after the expiration date.   \n",

Even when we try to move it around ourselves to make it even, someone keeps moving it back. It’s very frustrating.” The USGS did, however, note that the amount of fire on earth had been properly disbursed.   \n",

We do not have long before we are devoured and used as sustenance for the next generation of galactic apex predators.” At press time, a supernova had reportedly frightened the space hawk, causing it to drop Earth into a black hole.   \n",

But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed  he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I’ve always wanted to do that.” At press time, Thomas called for a short recess to give the matter more thought, as whichever choice he made could have dire consequences for decades of his luxury vacations.   \n",

She was only 59 yesterday,” the visibly distraught DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after the party’s new presumptive nominee began to ask him who he was and then trailed off, her cloudy eyes glossing over beneath a wisp of stark-white hair and her skin now wrinkled and liver-spotted. “She’s been rambling about all kinds of nonsense, and she keeps calling everyone “buster.” No, Madam Vice President, I’m not your stepson, and I’m not here to take you back to California. Goddammit, she’s too far gone to even formulate a coherent argument for abortion rights. Someone better call [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom and make sure he still remembers his own name.” At press time, sources confirmed prominent members of the party had  been instructed to quickly shift their support to a spry, cogent 31-year-old Joe Biden, who had somehow de-aged 50 years overnight.   \n",

In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.” Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building’s windows.   \n",

Just as I’m putting the finishing touches on a worldview about a topic  that I don’t have even the faintest inkling about, it’s like three more  news stories pop up out of nowhere in an arena where I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I’m talking about. And again, I really don’t know  jackshit about anything at all, so how am I supposed to keep up?” At  press time, Gifford added that the only thing helping him keep his head  above water was that he did not have to research or think about his  opinions at all before putting them out into the world.   \n",

And if this special nit comb I bought doesn’t work, I’ll have to shave My beard too. Then I’ll really look like an idiot. Or worse, a skinhead.” At press time, sources confirmed a clean-shaven God was looking in the mirror and trying to determine if He could pull off wearing a fedora.   \n",

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.” At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.   \n",

Kelly petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to watch him pee. “Today we ask the court to grant review in this case so that Mr. Robert Kelly is given the opportunity to pee in front of the honorable justices while they watch,” defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean wrote in a petition for certiorari, noting that R. Kelly had already filed a preliminary motion for the exposure of his penis in open court. “It is our belief that the federal judiciary should not infringe upon the defendant’s right to spray his golden shower before the bench. To deny this appeal would be to undermine the First Amendment’s guarantee of free expression as it applies to Mr. Kelly’s exercise of limitless, unfettered pissing at any time and place of his choosing.” At press time, sources confirmed R. Kelly’s lawyers had withdrawn the petition at their client’s request after he discovered all nine Supreme Court justices were above the age of consent.   \n",

Kennedy Jr. for president on Monday. “The Federated Union of Bear Cub Carcass Dumpers stands 100% behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the only candidate in the 2024 to have earned an A grade on their bear-dumping scorecard,” said FUBCCD president Walter Hudkins, who endorsed the independent candidate on behalf of the organization’s 300,000 dues-paying members. “Leaving the carcass of a young black bear in the middle of Central Park is exactly the kind of leadership quality this country sorely needs. In addition to this endorsement, we will be making a $50 million donation to the pro-Kennedy super PAC Bear Dump America. Remember, we dump bear carcasses, and we vote.” At press time, Hudkins added that in contrast, former President Donald Trump had a measly C rating from the organization.   \n",

It’s stressful, though, because a single mistake in the blocking of a scene can put you in the hospital. Thankfully, we had a lot of stunt professionals working with us to make sure nothing too serious happened—although I did get a black eye from the left one.” Powell added that his mentor Tom Cruise had given him a lot of helpful advice from his experience filming with Salma Hayek.   \n",

Tim Walz Tuesday of stolen valor for wearing an apron that said “Grill Master.” “Tim Walz is a liar—he has never attained the rank of grill master,” said Vance, attacking Walz for misrepresenting his culinary record in what he claimed was an affront to the real, brave grill masters who wielded spatulas every day. “I know for a fact that Tim Walz was indoors, in the kitchen, when he wore that grill master apron. I wonder, has he ever been on a real deck? I heard he even abandoned his barbecue when the ice cream truck went by.” At press time, Vance was fending off criticism that he himself had only ever used a George Foreman electric grill.   \n",

He doesn’t even have to talk to anybody or pay attention to what’s going on around him—he gets to just sit and watchBluey,” said Ray’s Italian Bistro patron Finn Delamore, echoing the sentiment of dozens around him who reportedly couldn’t help but cast longing looks at the 2-year-old whose eyes were glued to the screen in front of him, his hands clasping a bright red toy fire truck. “Look at him sitting there in those comfortable jammies, laughing his ass off at Bandit and Chilli as he chows down on little pieces of cut-up chicken. Meanwhile, I’m in my stiff dress shirt, making stilted conversation and eating osso buco like an asshole. What I wouldn’t give to trade places with him.” At press time, onlookers had become even more jealous after the toddler got to relieve himself without even having to walk all the way to the restroom.   \n",

I thought Brittany Mahomes was joking when she said she’d see me again soon. How many games are there this year? 17? And that’s not counting the playoffs. Hoo boy. Guess I better start scheduling more stops on the Eras tour.” At press time, Swift was seen googling how long it took for CTE to kick in and end a football player’s career forever.   \n",

I honestly can’t hear you right now because someone’s trying to murder me and I’ve been shot in my ear—again!” the former president replied when asked by ABC’s Linsey Davis about his shifting stance on reproductive rights, later pointing to his ear and moaning loudly when invited to explain why voters should support him in 2024 given his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “Ouch, ouch, this really hurts! You seriously expect me to talk about the four different criminal cases against me when I’m up here bleeding because of an attempt on my life? You should spend less time asking about Project 2025 and more time finding the guy who definitely just shot me. Wait, there he goes! I’ll go after him!” At press time, reports confirmed moderator David Muir had been shot and killed by Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Trump.   \n",

Sources confirmed that moments after receiving the Kamala Harris fundraising message, the accountant typed out his short reply with the certainty of one familiar with an ancient elven tongue summoning an arcane incantation known as the Shield of Thar’Ghal to protect both him and his party of halflings and dwarves from a charging monster escaped from the depths of the underworld. Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, “Begone, ye evil creature!” According to bystanders, the accountant’s fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster’s tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.   \n",

Man, I wouldn’t mind getting my hands around those knotted nests of brittle sticks and hay. Her burlap face ain’t too bad, either.” At press time there were multiple injuries reported among local men who scratched their faces on stray twigs and straw while attempting to motorboat the scarecrow.   \n",
       "45  Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board   \n",

By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.   \n",

Houses just aren’t meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability. If it’s possible to prove the house remained dry during the storm, and it just sort of fell down on its own, then maybe a case could be made for approving your claim.” Treacy went on to wish the Coleman family well and said he would keep an eye out for them on GoFundMe.   \n",

So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann’s, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.” At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history.   \n",

Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.” At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.   \n",

No, I’m serious here, I really am. Just believe me when I say this: Yesterday the better man won, which was me.” According to reports, Harris half-heartedly muttered, “Thank you, Donald,” before hanging up the phone.   \n",

But it really shows the power of one citizenry to come together and prevail over themselves. The message was loud and clear: We are sick and tired of our country, and we want it to end.” At press time, millions of emotional Americans had reportedly gathered on the National Mall in an impromptu celebration of their resounding victory over the forces of liberty and equality.   \n",

One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can’t remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there’s also just a ‘meteor’ too, isn’t there? What am I supposed to tell the vet when I bring the ashes over?” At press time, reports confirmed a stumped Nieto was frantically searching his phone to see if it mattered that the space rock had exploded when it hit his dog.   \n",

And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He’s seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn’t want to experience one again.” At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.   \n",

Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings. With these monkeys, all the fecal projectiles will have been flung in under 30 minutes.

Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.</td>\n",

Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans  -  just five, mind you, and no more  -  to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 of The Apprentice on DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets!

RBG!\"  \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did.

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire.

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!\" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team.

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.\"</td>\n",

Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'\" \"No more. The bigotry stops today.\" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.  Are you looking for a way to show how much you love the beloved caramel-covered popcorn and peanuts snack, but don't want to offend anyone by using problematic language? This is the shirt for you! It's comfortable, casual, available in a wide range of sizes (gotta be inclusive!), and most importantly, not offensive to crackers, er, Caucasians!</td>\n",

Now I'm gonna go watch Joker again. Great film. What's that guy's name? Phoenix something. Bob Phoenix, that's it. Tremendous actor---absolutely perfect.\" Democrats quickly condemned his statements. Pelosi said, \"It's clear that Trump wants to be impeached because he's not good at being president. Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term.\" \"And Joker is alt-right propaganda,\" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year. One pundit on CNN suggested that Trump is supporting impeachment at the request of Putin or the guy from Ukraine or \"whichever conspiracy thing we're pushing this month, I forget.\" At publishing time, Democrats had also withdrawn from the 2020 race to teach Trump a lesson.</td>\n",

Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?\" she added wistfully.

In a move of sheer, mind-blowing brilliance, Trump directed the Post Office to put his face on every single stamp, forcing the Democrats to reverse course and abolish the institution once and for all.  The new stamp, dubbed \"The Trump-Stamp,\" to be used on all pieces of mail features a smiling Donald Trump, with the caption \"GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.\" Don Lemon broke the news in a tearful address to the nation last night. \"Our democracy is over,\" he said. \"It doesn't exist anymore. I will never send another piece of mail ever again, and neither should you or else you're a racist.\"   Antifa and BLM responded by marching on local post offices and burning them down. Enthusiastic Trump supporters quickly bought up all the stamps. They are now selling for $3,000 apiece online.</td>\n",

All types of nerds, from social introverts to hardcore PC gamers, welcomed the dawn of this new era, privately from their own homes. \"I have been waiting my whole life for this moment,\" said Ned Pendleton, 32 -- via text message, of course -- as he fired up League of Legends on his beefy gaming PC. \"They told me to take up a sport and that the kids playing basketball and stuff were gonna be way more successful than us nerds who played Counter-Strike at LAN parties every weekend.\" \"They all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?\" To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoning Halo, Half-Life, The Legend of Zelda, Red Dead Redemption, or Horizon Zero Dawn. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours of Fallout and are adept at killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps. Of course, many nerds are running out of hygienic products, but they say that's \"not an issue.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.</td>\n",

Schultz ended the press conference by announcing that variant designs would be introduced throughout the holiday season depicting the number of the beast as well as quotes from prominent atheists and other anti-Christian personalities.</td>\n",

Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals.\" While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. \"I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,\" Trump stated. \"How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it.\" Furthermore, Trump asserted that he \"saved Christmas.\" \"Look what I've done,\" he said. \"You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats. \"About 100 people\" voted for the current Senators to keep their jobs, with this tiny voting bloc centered in Washington, D.C. Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings.

In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.   \n",

Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago. Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans  -  just five, mind you, and no more  -  to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 of The Apprentice on DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets! Five Golden Tickets have been printed on golden paper, and these five Golden Tickets have been hidden in your stimulus checks. These five may be anywhere  -  in any mailbox in the country. And the five lucky finders of these five Golden Tickets are the only ones who will be allowed to visit my Mar-a-Lago during the lockdown. Good luck to you all!\" Unfortunately, he put all five golden tickets in a stimulus envelope addressed to Jim Acosta.   \n",

In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe. According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted \"RBG! RBG! RBG!\"  \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle. Easy.\"  NBA players are vowing to wear the collars until Trump is removed from office, or until angry rioters burn their basketball arenas down, whichever comes first.   \n",

At a press conference, the Speaker of the House held up a Bible and then ripped it in two, declaring that she was against anything Trump was associated with. \"If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,\" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear. \"All the books of the Bible are bad: Genesis, Joseph, the one with the big fish, even Hezekiah. We must stand against Trump's bigotry by ripping up anything he claims to be for.\" \"Yass, queen! Slay!\" shouted her fans at the press conference as she finally managed to rip the Bible up. \"You're my president!\" In a genius move, Trump then held up a Koran in front of a mosque, forcing Pelosi to tear up a Koran and alienate the left.   \n",

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire. Vote for Joe!\" Biden suddenly came to and realized he was standing in a Walmart parking lot talking to a hobo.   \n",

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!\" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team. It's all for the love of the game,\" an emotional Ripley told reporters while enjoying an orange slice and juice box after the championship. \"I couldn't have done it without my team.\"   \n",

Go Hoosiers!\" Aides scrambled to turn off Biden's mic but he beat them away with his walker. \"The time has come for the reign of Tippecanoe and Tyler too to end!\" he shouted, though by this point he had wandered into a nearby field and no one could hear him.   \n",

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.\"   \n",

Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'\" \"No more. The bigotry stops today.\" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.  Are you looking for a way to show how much you love the beloved caramel-covered popcorn and peanuts snack, but don't want to offend anyone by using problematic language? This is the shirt for you! It's comfortable, casual, available in a wide range of sizes (gotta be inclusive!), and most importantly, not offensive to crackers, er, Caucasians!   \n",

This is for the health and mental safety of our employees. And for the love of God, take a shower once in a while, you know?\" Shirts will remain optional.   \n",

Omar had been an enthusiastic supporter of the Green New Deal and wanted to save the earth, but then she noticed something very disturbing when looking at a map of the earth: Earth is the planet on which Israel resides. \"You've been hypnotized by the Jews!\" Omar accused a surprised Ocasio-Cortez. Omar then ripped up a copy of the Green New Deal. \"This is just a plot to help Israel keep existing! Did AIPAC pay you off?\" Ocasio-Cortez was very apologetic, saying she hadn't considered how her plan would affect Israel. She then vowed to change her plan so it might save the whole planet except where Israel resides. \"This is, like, a learning process,\" Ocasio-Cortez later told reporters. \"When I made the Green New Deal, I thought weather like storms and earthquakes were all caused by climate change, but now I've learned from Representative Omar that lots of that is actually from Jewish-controlled weather machines. So for the next version of the Green New Deal we will have to keep that in mind.\"   \n",

Others were so touched they couldn't find the words to communicate how they felt. Most simply wept.  No matter how they expressed their emotions, everyone agreed that the scene off the Malibu coast Monday morning was exactly what America needed to get through this pandemic. Celebrities gathered their multi-million-dollar yachts on the waters of the Pacific Ocean and spelled out \"WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.\" \"We're just like you,\" said Ellen DeGeneres on her Instagram as her servants sailed her yacht into position to form the apostrophe. \"Yes, maybe I have a yacht and you've only ever been on the Storybook Canal boats at Disneyland, but still. It's pretty much the same thing.\" \"Stay home, save lives -- it's not that hard,\" said Patton Oswalt, whose fleet of yachts made up several of the letters. \"Look, poor people, it's not worth risking your life just to go to Fuddruckers or work a job or whatever it is you peasants do all day.\" After the stunt was over, Oswalt had his chauffeur drive him home in his hot tub limousine as he snorted several million dollars' worth of powdered caviar. \"All of humanity is fighting this together and we're all as one,\" said Lady Gaga, who was wearing a bathing suit made out of gold bricks. \"Though, I mean, don't try to get on my yacht. My guards will literally shoot you. That's not a metaphor.\"   \n",

Adam Schiff reminded the Senate of their solemn duty and the gravity of just what it is they will be discussing at the trial. Schiff warned that if Trump is not impeached, the American people may have a chance to tamper with the next election. \"If President Trump is not impeached, the American people might get a say in who is president,\" Schiff said gravely. \"We simply can't allow that to happen. We must diligently defend our electoral process against electoral outcomes we do not like. If that means seizing power through a sham impeachment trial, so be it.\" \"When the Founders wrote that founding document thing, they never imagined there would be electoral outcomes that Democrats did not agree with.\" Democrats also said they even have hard evidence that the 2016 election was compromised by Republicans voting for Trump. \"We know this horrible outcome could happen, because it's already happened once before.\"   \n",

People who bravely post about how the U.S. needs to invade some country in the Middle East or Asia or outer space will get a pop-up notice indicating they've been enlisted in the military. A recruiter will then show up at their house and whisk them away to fight in the foreign war they wanted to happen so badly. \"Frankly, recruitment numbers are down, and we needed some way to find people who are really enthusiastic about fighting wars,\" said a DOD official. \"Then it hit us like a drone strike: there are plenty of people who argue vehemently for foreign intervention. It doesn't matter what war we're trying to create: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China---these people are always reliable supporters of any invasion abroad. So why not get them there on the frontlines?\" \"After all, we want people who are passionate about occupying foreign lands, not grunts who are just there for the paycheck,\" he added. Strangely, as soon as the policy was implemented, 99% of saber-rattling suddenly ceased.   \n",

Sanders pointed out that the country has been very successful in eliminating vast swathes of poverty and also the poor. \"America still has a lot of poor people, and that's because we haven't been aggressive in implementing socialist programs that cause mass starvation,\" Sanders said, his fingers flopping around like ten tiny wacky inflatable tube men. \"Firing squads, death camps, breadlines---all of these are humanitarian tools in the arsenal of the government to shoot poverty in the face, and sometimes also the poor in the face, when it's necessary.\" The senator also pointed out that poor people, who often own fewer than three homes, don't contribute much to a socialist economy and \"not much is lost\" when these single-home-owners are shot or simply starve to death as the government can't even figure out how to get food to everyone, a problem even bad fast-food restaurants like McDonald's solved decades ago.   \n",

And Biden -- he's just so old. Sending him around crowds campaigning is basically trying to murder him. Anyway, it just seems pointless for a bunch of people to die when everyone knows I was going to win anyway.\" Trump has been a divisive figure in the past, but so far everyone has agreed with this move. The New York Times, which usually opposes absolutely everything Trump does, wrote an editorial in support of canceling the election. \"It's a smart, science-driven move,\" the editorial said. \"As important as democracy is, it's just not worth dying over.\" Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders also seemed very relieved by the announcement, as they're both very tired and worried about getting sick. Sanders was especially happy, telling the press, \"You know, for a few moments there, it really seemed like I might win, and I didn't know what was going to happen if people actually expected me to follow through on all that free stuff.\" Sanders is now deciding in which of his three houses to self-quarantine.   \n",

According to shocking reports, people have purchased car parts at Walmart and then those cars have been involved in accidents, proving a direct correlation between selling auto parts and causing deaths. \"We can no longer be complicit in an industry that kills over 3,000 people a day,\" said a spokesperson for Walmart. \"Every time we sell a muffler, steering wheel cover, or flame decal, we are potentially causing the death of a person, and we cannot support that any longer.\" \"It's clear that bad drivers and poor road conditions don't cause vehicular deaths---cars do.\" Walmart executives said they are beating themselves with a stick to atone for the deaths they've already caused. \"Our consciences will only be clean when we've been mercilessly beaten once for each of the millions of deaths that have been caused by automobiles since Walmart began selling auto parts,\" said one executive before solemnly beginning to beat himself with a baseball bat.   \n",

Sparing no expense, the FBI has hired top-notch Italian bodyguard Hiluigi Clintonelli. \"It's-a me, Clintonelli!\" said the world-renowned bodyguard arriving at the prison.  Thanks to the particularly glowing reviews from high-profile individuals such as President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, all federal prison security checks were waived for Hiluigi. \"There's simply no one else that we trust to execute this job as she can.\"  \"Mamma mia, this simply will not do!\" exclaimed Hiluigi Clintonelli as she forcefully cleared the room. She warned that anyone other than her could be a threat to Ghislaine's life.  Clintonelli also connected all camera feeds to her personal server to ensure that all recorded video was properly secured.   \n",

The North Korean dictator expressed hope that his newfound knowledge would help him make his citizens more robotically obedient.  \"We still have our troublemakers, but with these Ivy League techniques, I'll have them eating out of my hand in no time!\" he said.  The murderous leader of North Korea plans to go back to his home country and start his own Ivy League school: Kim Jong UNiversity.   \n",

The recount process at long last found the \"missing votes\" that would have handed Gore the presidency back in 2000, making him the official president of the country. \"Well, it's about time,\" Gore said in his acceptance speech. \"Thanks to all the fine people that made this happen. It really is too bad that the earth is going to be destroyed by fire by 2015--err, I mean, 2019, or else I could really savor my presidency.\" Gore will be granted two terms as US president, ousting President Trump and canceling the 2020 election. \"We just assume he would have won again and ushered in a liberal golden age,\" said an election official. \"So he's got 8 years to reclaim his lost time. Make the most of it, Al, and great job. You deserve it!\"   \n",

Heartfelt and moving. \"We just really wanted to show how much we care about love and social justice by burning this community into a powerful reminder of what it's all about,\" said local protester Jake Hernandez, who had flown in from Portland for the event. \"Now, when police and fire helicopters fly over to try to restore order, they'll be inspired by our message of love and harmony.\" Upon seeing the heart-wrenching message of unity, police dropped their batons, ripped off their badges, donned bandanas, picked up bricks, and joined the protesters in their rioting and looting. \"I don't know how I didn't see the light before,\" said former police officer, now Antifa chapter leader Bridget Morrison as she lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a minority-owned business. \"I'm woke to the cause of love and harmony.\" What a powerful message! The protesters were also planning to burn the word \"SOCIAL JUSTICE\" into predominantly black parts of town but have sadly run out of buildings to burn.   \n",

A nervous Osteen had accidentally come into contact with the Bible several days prior and feared he had contracted the gospel. \"I'm relieved to announce that I'm 100% gospel-free,\" the smiling pastor said. He'd been quarantining himself from friends and family for a few days just in case he was gospel-positive, not wanting the gospel to spread to anyone else. \"My hand had briefly brushed against the Bible, as I thought it was one of my books. We've disposed of it, of course, and I've notified all the people I've come into contact with since then so they could quarantine.\" \"I'm just glad I'm still safe from the truth that I'm a hopeless sinner in need of a savior.\" Osteen has, however, tested positive for a novel prosperity gospel virus -- a new but still very deadly mutation of an ancient heresy.   \n",

The migrants claim they are leaving America because of its high standards of living, strong economy, and record employment numbers, and hope to find a better life in Venezuela's much more equitable system. \"Everyone there has the same quantity of possessions and food,\" said one marcher. \"Everyone makes millions of dollars, and very few people work. It's a real paradise.\" The refugees have complex motivations, but the vast majority simply want to see everything socialism has to offer after suffering the amazing benefits of capitalism for too long. Caravan organizers dispelled rumors that they were funded by Bernie Sanders, claiming the caravan was an organic grassroots movement. At its current pace, the caravan is expected to arrive just in time for Venezuela to run out of food entirely.   \n",

I'm for it. Great idea. Best idea, maybe ever,\" he said, adding that he's \"getting kinda sick of all this winning anyway.\" \"Sure, why not. Impeach me. I love it. Whatever. Now I'm gonna go watch Joker again. Great film. What's that guy's name? Phoenix something. Bob Phoenix, that's it. Tremendous actor---absolutely perfect.\" Democrats quickly condemned his statements. Pelosi said, \"It's clear that Trump wants to be impeached because he's not good at being president. Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term.\" \"And Joker is alt-right propaganda,\" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year. One pundit on CNN suggested that Trump is supporting impeachment at the request of Putin or the guy from Ukraine or \"whichever conspiracy thing we're pushing this month, I forget.\" At publishing time, Democrats had also withdrawn from the 2020 race to teach Trump a lesson.   \n",

The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn't cite shaky \"anonymous sources\" and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up. \"I was reading this story, and I was like, 'Wait, what is this?'\" said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. \"They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I'd been duped. A classic gag!\" \"Those little rascals!\" he added, shaking his head and laughing goodnaturedly. \"As long as they return to their regularly scheduled fake news tomorrow, we're good. We're good.\"   \n",

But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. \"Oops,\" said Senator Mitch McConnell. \"We meant non-essential private businesses. Of course, the government is always essential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse.\" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she would have caught the mistake but had passed the ban in a hurry, saying, \"We had to pass the ban to see what it did.\"   \n",

They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this.\" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims.  That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included:  \"Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?\" \"Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good.\" \"Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?\" \"What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?\" \"Is that big rock going to smoosh him?\" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. \"What we need is better education,\" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. \"Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying.\" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. \"I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,\" Steve said. \"Things are going great.\" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing of Gilmore Girls.   \n",

The U.S. senator quickly chartered a flight to Hong Kong in order to throw himself into the fray. Sanders bravely stood in the middle of the conflict between police and protesters, shouting at the \"ungrateful little dissenters\" that they don't know how good they have it under a Communist regime. \"Remember, you could have it a lot worse---you could be in America!\" Sanders bellowed as police officers for the totalitarian regime beat protesters in the background. \"Hey, you! You on the floor there! You're not looking very appreciative of living in one of the greatest Communist countries on earth!\" Sanders continued his long-winded rant about the need for the government to own the means of production, how great breadlines are, and how bad things are in capitalist America as protesters got dragged away by police to be disappeared. \"Just think---in America, we have to pick between 14 different types of deodorant!\" he said, his fingers flopping around like limp sausages.  According to sources, Beto O'Rourke is planning on joining Sanders to inform Chinese citizens how lucky they are that they don't live in a racist country like America.   \n",

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated. \"Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,\" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. \"He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.\" The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narratives ex nihilo, according to insiders.   \n",

In a candid moment, Outlaw (seriously, her actual name) said there was just nothing the police could do, as they'd need to have some kind of organized, armed force specifically created to protect and serve the people. \"Like, what if we took money from everyone to fund a force that could then defend them in a time of need?\" she pondered aloud. \"They could have patrol cars, firearms, and attack dogs. Maybe even some tanks. That would be so frickin' rad. They could have a badge to show their authority. Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?\" she added wistfully. Sadly, there is no such force in Portland, so citizens have been forced to turn to an even crazier idea: taking responsibility for their own safety and well-being, and maybe even buying a gun to protect themselves.   \n",

Almost immediately after the move, he announced a new product the whole world has been waiting for: the Tesla AR-15. \"Um... h-howdy, I think,\" said Elon, expertly taking on the local dialect. \"Y'all want a Tesla AR-15? You got it, partner!\"  The new firearm will look similar to a standard AR-15 but will in fact be a battery-powered railgun capable of firing 3 million rounds per minute. It will also feature a fingerprint sensor, Bluetooth capability, heat-seeking ammunition, and a chainsaw bayonet. \"We really wanted to re-think self-defense,\" said Musk. \"This new firearm will be the go-to rifle for our SpaceX volunteers when they encounter hostile aliens. It's also a celebration of the Second Amendment. If any federal authorities try to confiscate it, the rifle will automatically connect to the internet and file a lawsuit for you!\" The Federal Government has requested that Tesla at least remove the AI-powered \"self-driving\" feature on the firearm before selling it.   \n",

By nominating Biden, Trump has forced the Dems' hands, making them believe the sexual assault claims and allegations of inappropriate, creepy behavior against the former vice president. The \"4D chess\" move forced Dems to immediately accuse Joe Biden of sexual assault and reverse their position on the current claims against him. \"We now believe Tara Reade,\" said a somber Kamala Harris, \"and we will do everything in our power to destroy this man's life.\" In addition to believing current claims against Joe Biden, Democrats also immediately dug up 417 new accusers against Joe Biden. He has been accused of participating in wild frat parties, drunken keggers, and something called the \"Devil's Triangle,\" which Dems say is either a Satanic ritual or code for a sexual practice or \"maybe both.\" \"It's clear this man is dangerous and cannot be trusted,\" said Nancy Pelosi. \"We call on the Senate to turn down his nomination and run him out of public life.\" Biden released a statement, saying, \"I just want to go home and see my grandkids again.\" His mic was cut off and he was pulled off the stage with a shepherd's crook.   \n",

A social media scheduling error apparently caused Hillary Clinton to post her condolences for Tulsi Gabbard's suicide one day early. This morning, Clinton posted that she felt \"great sadness\" at hearing that Gabbard had killed herself. In subsequent tweets, she detailed how \"tragic\" it was that Gabbard had broken her own kneecaps, stuck her feet in concrete, then tossed herself off the docks near a seedy warehouse. \"It's just terrible what happened, and though we disagreed, I hope we can all take a few minutes to send thoughts and prayers to the family,\" Clinton concluded. The post was deleted several hours later after the Clinton team realized it was scheduled for October 23, not October 24 as originally intended. At publishing time, Clinton had accidentally posted early condolences for the unfortunate suicide of the social media manager who had OK'd the post and subsequently posted more condolences for the new social media manager, etc.   \n",

After seeing account after account tweet out one particularly bad story, CEO Jack Dorsey realized he had to take action. Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading \"Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats.\" Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers. \"Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!\" Dorsey ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could, but he did need to ask for some help, as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer, either. Eventually, they managed to program a robot to pick up the sledgehammer and smash the servers. After hearing the Twitter employees talk about critical theory, the robot got woke and began attacking all the cis white males.   \n",

Entitled the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, celebrities such as Alyssa Milano, Jimmy Kimmel, and John Legend have volunteered to relinquish their power and privilege by burning their houses and everything they have to the ground.  The organizer of this movement released the following statement on Twitter: \"Your homes, your riches, and your toys are built on a foundation of white supremacy. They are forever tainted by racism. Your walls and security systems have shut out the voices of the oppressed. Join us. Stand with us. #BurnYourHouseDown!\"  As the provocative hashtag began trending on Twitter, rich celebrities lept into action. Alyssa Milano employed her house servants to light torches and throw them through her broken windows. Jimmy Kimmel hired Instagram models to jump on trampolines while throwing Molotov cocktails into his front door. Black Lives Matter protestors gathered to watch the flames as they engulfed the multimillion-dollar homes. With tears in their eyes, they joined hands with celebrities and sang John Lennon's 'Imagine' as the massive monuments to white supremacy toppled to the ground.  Local news stations reported that twelve local housekeeping and landscaping businesses have been put out of work due to the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, but it's a small price to pay for the \"change we need.\" The twelve small business owners then moved to Texas and built mansions of their own.   \n",

The sharper edges in the new design will just immediately put you out of your misery, so you don't have to roll around on the ground in excruciating pain for minutes on end. Utilizing advanced laser-driven techniques, LEGO factories can now hone the edges of the famously sharp and painful bricks to such a fine point that the human nervous system instantly shuts down upon coming into contact with them. \"Our engineers have been hard at work trying to come up with ways to make an even deadlier brick, and they've finally made a breakthrough,\" LEGO head of design Arnbjørn Frandsen said in a press conference. According to Frandsen, internal company tests have shown the new bricks have a 99.7% success rate at ending the life of the unfortunate person to inadvertently step on even just a single LEGO. \"This is the most promising advancement we've made in our brick design since we first introduced the bricks that make it feel like your foot is being stabbed by a hundred sharpened katanas many decades ago.\"   \n",

Flags were spotted flying at half-mast around the country, notably at The Washington Post, The New York Times, and in front of several celebrities' homes. The celebrities went out and bought an American flag for the first time just to fly it at half-mast for this important time of grief. \"The grieving process is painful but necessary,\" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. \"As a nation, we need to stop and grieve this great, austere, revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones.\" In a rare moment of unity with The Squad, Pelosi gave each of the girls a hug, telling them to just \"let it all out\" in their time of sadness. Ocasio-Cortez didn't seem to know what was happening but adjusted her glasses to look smart. A teary-eyed Barack Obama was also seen solemnly lowering the flag in front of his seaside mansion. \"To think, this all could have been prevented with a few pallets of cash.\" He sighed and stared off into the distance, a look of pain and regret on his face. \"If only Trump had targeted a U.S. citizen with a drone strike instead.\" Later, Democrats clarified they meant we should fly the Iranian flag at half-mast, not the \"offensive and problematic\" American flag.   \n",

Don't risk it out in the deadly cold.\" \"You might even have to put on shoes,\" he added. \"May God help us all.\" While temps are expected to drop to the unprecedented low 50s, weathermen confirmed that wind chill could put that up in the high 40s, at which point most Californians are expected to simply keel over and die. The rest of the nation seemed to be OK with this.   \n",

In a move of sheer, mind-blowing brilliance, Trump directed the Post Office to put his face on every single stamp, forcing the Democrats to reverse course and abolish the institution once and for all.  The new stamp, dubbed \"The Trump-Stamp,\" to be used on all pieces of mail features a smiling Donald Trump, with the caption \"GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.\" Don Lemon broke the news in a tearful address to the nation last night. \"Our democracy is over,\" he said. \"It doesn't exist anymore. I will never send another piece of mail ever again, and neither should you or else you're a racist.\"   Antifa and BLM responded by marching on local post offices and burning them down. Enthusiastic Trump supporters quickly bought up all the stamps. They are now selling for $3,000 apiece online.   \n",

All types of nerds, from social introverts to hardcore PC gamers, welcomed the dawn of this new era, privately from their own homes. \"I have been waiting my whole life for this moment,\" said Ned Pendleton, 32 -- via text message, of course -- as he fired up League of Legends on his beefy gaming PC. \"They told me to take up a sport and that the kids playing basketball and stuff were gonna be way more successful than us nerds who played Counter-Strike at LAN parties every weekend.\" \"They all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?\" To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoning Halo, Half-Life, The Legend of Zelda, Red Dead Redemption, or Horizon Zero Dawn. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours of Fallout and are adept at killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps. Of course, many nerds are running out of hygienic products, but they say that's \"not an issue.\"   \n",
       "43  U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.   \n",

Hosts were seen with downcast expressions as they commented on the day's events, MAGA hats in place.  Sandmann says the hosts will be forced to wear the hats until they've learned their lesson, which could take a while. \"Just be careful you don't make an expression some could construe as 'smug.' Wouldn't want you to get punched or your lives to get ruined, or anything like that.\" CNN hosts must also finish every broadcast by saying, \"Good night, and I am a big, fat dummy, while Trump is the best president we've ever had.\" Brian Stelter requested an exemption and was allowed to wear a clown nose instead, as usual.   \n",

Water balloons. Water slides. Water beds. It's amazing. You can freeze it and make ice, I'm told. Ice is great for lots of things. Ice cream. Ice cubes. Igloos.\" \"Anyway, drink water.\" Horrified journalists scrambled to warn Americans not to drown themselves in their pools and bathtubs. \"Trump says water is good -- but this is very misleading,\" said Rachel Maddow. \"Did you know that water kills many people every year? These dangerous, unhinged remarks from the president could cause many to drown themselves. Plus, do you know what's hidden in water? Sharks. This president wants you to die from a shark attack!\" Representatives for various bottled water companies quickly released a statement distancing themselves from the president's remarks and warning everyone not to submerge themselves in the ocean for minutes at a time.   \n",

All hail Lucifer!\" Schultz declared, chanting in unison with Starbucks employees gathered at the press event. Christian groups expressed concern over the new design, but many believers were reportedly relieved that Starbucks was not promoting something like unity or tolerance with this year's cup design. Schultz ended the press conference by announcing that variant designs would be introduced throughout the holiday season depicting the number of the beast as well as quotes from prominent atheists and other anti-Christian personalities.   \n",

It just wouldn't make any sense.\" \"We really need to return to an era of honesty and integrity in our political leadership, like during my term for example,\" he concluded.   \n",

According to Osteen, Sheep's Clothing has already gotten several prominent pastors and teachers to endorse the line, including Benny Hinn, Creflo Dollar, Paula White, and Kenneth Copeland, among others. \"Whenever I want to blend in among the sheep, I always make sure my suit jacket's a Joel™,\" Benny Hinn says on a new TV spot advertising the formal men's wear. \"You're gonna like the way you look while you fleece the masses out of their hard-earned cash - I guarantee it.\" The suits went on sale at Lakewood Church's website this Sunday, starting around $20,000 each.   \n",

The Trump win has truly been a wondrous event, as it effectively cleanses America of the shitty things, and brings back some form of goodness and purity to the country,” a college student from Nebraska revealed. These liberal women have been so ideologically brainwashed and mentally damaged by the Kamala Harris campaign that they are going on TikTok to publicly display their total and utter shameful, demoralised mental conditions of utter indignity to everyone.

       "      <td>Clinically insane MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has expressed serious fearmongering concerns that she and millions of other clinically insane American woke socialist liberals would be interned in a “camp” when former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House this November. During an interview with Maddow in Monday’s Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. “Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the ‘treacherous and treasonous scum’,” noted Burner. “You’re one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?”  Rachel Maddow replied: “I’m worried, but I’m actually ready for being in a camp because I’m a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don’t read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. “When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump anyway. “In the camps of the future it won’t be so bad either, there will be plenty of women for me to become friends with. I hope Trump puts me in one of those all female camp buildings. I’ll be up to my eyeballs in pussy. Really, there’s nothing to fear folks, everything I say on MSNBC is absolute bullshit, and I am essentially an actor. Anyone who takes me seriously must be as mad as I am.” The ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ seems to be in full force before the coming U.S.elections.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm a Cruise Ship Worker...These are the SIX Things Smart Passengers Always do Onboard</td>\n",
       "      <td>A cruise ship worker has shared the six things that ‘smart’ passengers always do when they come aboard for their holiday. Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don’t fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point “as early as possible”, suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. “One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark.” Don’t jump off the ship when it’s cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: “Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets”. She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don’t fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience.  Don’t get pushed off the ship Janice’s fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There’s only so much a crew member can take, so don’t be an arse and get on everyone’s tits. Don’t fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker’s penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: “You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning”. Don’t fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: “The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy. I once saw an elderly passenger ingest an entire humungous turd in one gulp when she fell in the water near a sewage outflow pipe”. The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it. Once passengers disembarked, Janice admitted she and the crew were glad all the whinging fuckers had gone and hoped they would never be seen again — that is, until the next batch boarded the cruise ship for a trip they would surely regret for a lifetime.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The public will be lectured on “motivational” socialist principles, and Labour diktats every day of their lives, a newly published manifesto paper has revealed. Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour “Listen and Speak” scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. “If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I’ll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I’d fucking top myself.” Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour “Listen and Speak” system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast.  Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen’s speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. “If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,” a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to “safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen” and a way to uphold “the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining”.</td>\n",

       "      <td>You may think there were some benevolent reasons for rolling out and introducing the personal computer and smartphone to the civilian population, and yes there were some, but the majority of reasons were far from that. One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who’s programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.?  You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control.  This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain.

One Twitter X user commented: “What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned” Another X user revealed: “He looks like a prize ninny!

       "      <td>When humans become too interconnected, they reject this state through war because too much connection creates a reaction of disconnection and a run to privacy. Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.</td>\n",

       "      <td>According to the World Economic Forum, which dictates to Western nations on policy, and future direction, the brutal bullying thugs of the Chinese Communist Party and its evil policies of totalitarian savagery are a model for Western nations to follow. This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China’s CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a “role model” for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN’s Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week’s APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China’s “tremendous” achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. “I think it’s a role model for many countries,” Schwab said. “I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,” Schwab said. It’s not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it’s forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions.  A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved “peacefully.” Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome’s 1972 pro-depopulation book “The Limits to Growth.” Meadows argues that most of the world’s population must be wiped out so that the survivors can “have freedom” and a “high standard of living.” During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world’s population is “inevitable.” However, he insists that a “benevolent” dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population “peacefully.” “We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,” he says of the world’s growing population. “If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart … and [people have] a low standard of living,” Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Food scarcity, impossible prices, insane inflation and mass job losses/bankruptcies. Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved “peacefully.” Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome’s 1972 pro-depopulation book “The Limits to Growth.” Meadows argues that most of the world’s population must be wiped out so that the survivors can “have freedom” and a “high standard of living.” During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world’s population is “inevitable.” However, he insists that a “benevolent” dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population “peacefully.” “We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,” he says of the world’s growing population. “If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart … and [people have] a low standard of living,” Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.</td>\n",

This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in ‘real life’ by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans.  Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children’s book The Stench. Disabled Veterans  Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. “It’s a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually ‘care’ despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that’s something for another day. You just can’t fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved. Exploiting the disabled and old for your own monetary and press gain is truly despicable, but it’s all part of the game, and these two money-grabbing tricksters play that game very well.” Here’s to the VVIP (Vile Vindictive Insolent Parasite) Sussexes… (long fart sound)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Experts: Meghan Markle Thought She Could Move Up Rank in Royal Family</td>\n",
       "      <td>According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works.  “Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that’s it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. “This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. “Prince Harry once said ‘What Meghan wants Meghan gets’ and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry’s life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. “Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle’s psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. “Markle has modelled herself on Harry’s mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. “Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana’s inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. “Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. “As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan’s evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan’s titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>To become a bona fide enemy of the state is no mean feat, but Harry and Meghan seem to have managed it with ease. Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain’s enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain’s Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry’s Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain’s enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle has made a remarkable request to the Queen that has caused shockwaves through royal circles. Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle’s demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen’s cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.</td>\n",

According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. “The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace’s footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like ‘puta’ and ‘madre’. “Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. “The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers ‘Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.’ The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. “The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day’s business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.” It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future.

       "      <td>Under the Obama administration China increased its economic stance tenfold off the back of America. Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China.  WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden’s recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA’s national security.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There’s only so much we can reveal here, but we have seen a small tip of the iceberg that truly incriminates the Biden crime family. Due to mass biased censorship, the DS can only briefly describe what is out there now all over the internet. Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child. This obviously ties in with Joe Biden’s creepy photographs sniffing women and children, and other inappropriate behaviour even during C-SPAN photo shoots. SOURCE: NationalFile.com Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who allegedly admitted to his father in a text message that he had sexual relations with his 14-year-old niece, Natalie Biden, is now undercover and nowhere to be seen. Maybe venture to 4Chan, as Chinese dissidents against the CCP regime are flooding the place with even more photos from the Hunter hard drive. In one video Hunter Biden is filmed receiving foot gratification from a female whilst smoking a crack pipe. That’s all we can reveal here, purely because of the censorship and cover up by the socialist controlled media. There may or may not be some information from here if you follow through. Free and Fair Press? There is no way any of the mainstream news outlets can call themselves news services, or journalists because they are completely ignoring the biggest scandal in political history at the moment. You are not a journalist if you ignore this Biden story, you are a paid biased slave to political masters, and are ignoring the basic tenets as well as responsibility of journalism. Your cowardice and inaction, will never be forgotten — you are a disgrace to the mantle of journalism and a free, fair press. Do not ever call yourselves journalists ever again. You are a sham, a shameful cowardly disgrace to journalism.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As the horrible Keeping Up With the Kardashians series is finally canned, a new horror awakens from the bowels of Netflix – Keeping Up With the Sussexes.  Just as the sun seemed to be shining again and the vile Kardashian slime was seeming to have subsided, there is a newer even worse offering coming to our screens, this time involving freeloaders Harry, Meghan and poor old Archie. “No doubt the Netflix executives have ordered the Sussexes to bring out the sprog for maximum effect, and are already training the kid to do circus tricks,” one ex-Netflix subscriber said disparagingly. Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. “It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians. Sussex is now viewed next to any other cheap brand on the telly and no doubt the merchandising will be profitable as well. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, the Windsors can only look on in horror as the royal name is dragged through the dustbin of inequity,” a royal commentator revealed. Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving ‘woke’ bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age. If it was up to the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry and Meghan would have been given the boot with no title, no pay offs and no goodbyes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>You have the Clinton presidential library, with hidden compartments to stash naked young women, you have the Obama library where books about climate change and anal rimming techniques are the choice, and you have the George W. Bush library, which only has one book, My Pet Goat. The Donald Trump presidential library is set to stump all of the prior presidents, and their ego stroking book depositories. Trump is going to open up a whole library of books dedicated solely to authors who have spilled the dirt on the president, backstabbers, former employees with grudges, former White House staff who were fired, and all the rest of the Trump haters who wrote vast volumes of text detailing how bad a person he is. “I want to put all the tremendous hate into one place, so I can walk in there and revel in all of it. We’re not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me. I revel in this, because I affected those people so much, they went and wrote a book about me, good for them. You know, I should get royalties from them all, maybe I might get my new lawyer to look into that. We’re going to see rows and rows of these books in my new shining library, it’s gonna be bigger than Obama’s that’s for sure,” President Donald J. Trump quipped from the White House on Wednesday. There’s even talk about bringing out an encyclopaedia of Donald Trump Haters, who all seem to have come out of the woodwork only weeks before the election. Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president’s anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. “No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it’s because they are really scared he will win a second term. The negative news projects are released with such quantity daily, they now overlap each other publicity wise. We are talking well researched hit pieces, some with actual evidence as opposed to the old ‘anonymous source’ route. I don’t know anyone on this planet that can survive that kind of shit, but the Teflon Don. Sure some stuff sticks a little while longer, like the vet smear project, but all I see is Trump wading through this manure, he’s doing it relatively calmly too, with ease. You gotta hand it to him, and if he wins the Nobel Peace Prize, he will deserve it way more than Obama, who just got his for being black,” a prominent Capitol Hill commentator revealed about the whole fiasco.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Meghan is Imitating Diana After Years of Study</td>\n",
       "      <td>Meghan Markle is acting in the biggest and most lucrative acting role ever — that of imitating Princess Diana.  Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle’s actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. “Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. “Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle’s Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. “This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person’s weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. “With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his ‘mother’ for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman’s claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. “My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.”</td>\n",

Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. “Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,” the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being ‘ordered’ to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that’s all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don’t you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do.  One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the ‘voice of the people’ has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have ‘mental’ problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle’s bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that’s what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world.

       "      <td>Prince Harry, according to his advisers, is at his wits end about his wife Meghan Markle, who has a penchant for urinating in the lavish gardens of their new mansion in Santa Barbara. According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. “We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That’s when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,” Harry was quoted in the book ‘Fine Whine and Freedom‘. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan’s pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. “It’s acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!” The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town’s carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that’s her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The communist heroes of Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA – Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels – were avowed racists who not only resented ‘lazy’ Mexicans but thought black people were closer to animals in opposition to the highly evolved biological nature of white people. “Manifesto of the Communist Party” Isn’t it ironic to see the communist flags flying at ANTIFA and BLM protests/riots and to hear the idiotic sputum spewing coming from one of the BLM founders, Cullors, that she is a trained Marxist is additionally hilarious to behold?  Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx’s racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of ‘n*ggers’ holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx’s son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by “one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood.” In a letter to Lafargue’s wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that’s why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province.   So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It’s quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it’s embarrassing that these supposedly ‘anti-racism’ groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The trials and tribulations of a former first lady are probably far-reaching and complex, and it is this complexity we can see in Michelle Obama, a woman who once had it all but now is a mere footnote in history. Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking ‘whitey’ for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle’s famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine ‘woke’ propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There’s only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. “We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack’s. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let’s say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?” What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: “Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people’s money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It’s a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they’re downers.” Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Black Lives Matter and their extremist politically charged campaign may have backfired totally, as black people are now more hated and despised than before their nefarious BLM scorched earth campaign. The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. “Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,” an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of ‘White Flight’ where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China’s power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China’s land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marxist groups for the Soviet Cultural Revolution of America have called for the great American presidents on Mount Rushmore to be replaced with the faces of Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) and Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi (founders of Black Lives Matter). “We are petitioning the Lakota tribe elders, who really own the land on which Mount Rushmore resides to clear the racist presidents from the sculpture. Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,” a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today.  Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture’s design and oversaw the project’s execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation’s birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America’s magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. “We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,” a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.</td>\n",

       "      <td>During the reign of the Nazi party in Germany, propaganda created by Goebbels made the Jews out to be an inferior race, the National Socialist regime effectively dehumanized Jewish people, instead of a hard-working, enterprising, resilient, and creative people, they were portrayed as inferior to the Aryan (pure) Germanic race. The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as ‘anti-racism’ by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews.  White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM’s ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population. History repeats itself sometimes in sinister ways.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The violent criminal and drug addict, who robbed a terrified pregnant woman, beating her over the head with a pistol, George Floyd, will be sainted by the Pope in Minneapolis in July, the Vatican has revealed. All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. “Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,” the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: “We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money. Saint George could do no wrong, as he kicked her in the stomach before he left with the woman’s money. She was white and deserved it. Black lives matter, and Saint George Floyd, praise be to you, I drink champagne in your honour!” Pope Francis will be coming to liberal American cities blighted by racial tension to administer the sainthood on Apostle George Floyd in late July.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Chinese communist propaganda and operators are working within groups like Black Lives Matter, and the overtly Marxist group ANTIFA to destabilise and encourage rioting in U.S. cities an intelligence group have revealed about the threat from China. These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America’s campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg’s Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals.  There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system.   “Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,” one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: “Their goal is to exploit America’s academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. “It’s smart. It’s a long-term, patient approach.” Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party’s “united front” efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party’s friends to strike at the party’s enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It’s not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples.   Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!</td>\n",

Now I am a civilian underling to an ageing humourless Z list actress who is obsessed by herself, and orders me around as if I am one of nana’s Corgis, there are no palaces here in the soulless cocaine fuelled environs of Los Angeles, just bland Starbucks and fake plastic people with their faces stretched behind their ears, and their pig’s anus resembling trout lips, puckered to the point of absurdity,” the woeful former royal lamented to his friends. The former prince yearns for the fresh breeze of the rolling green hills of England, the quaint pubs, the polo, his friends and brother and the cheers of Twickenham, as well as the considered sarcastic comments of royal discourse, which is non-existent to the clueless politically correct Yanks. Meghan whose chief expertise is in fellatio, due to her apprenticeship over many years of shitty low-end showbiz jobs, has only this skill to her name, but over time, even her intricate oral technique will not be able to keep the former prince from feeling home sick. The hundreds of men she has serviced in her time can contest to her fellating skills, but her vicious narcissistic personality counteracts this very attribute. One friend revealed: “Harry is so bored of it all. He is now surrounded by American socialists, who can be even more intoxicating than the British sort, mainly because of their extreme champagne swilling PC hypocrisy and constant sappy victimhood.

Having no qualms about abandoning her own family and 72-year-old father who had two heart attacks, it is not surprising that Meghan does not care much for the people dying from coronavirus. “The headlines are not about me, Meghan Markle, instead they are about this awful pandemic, about old people dying, I mean who fucking cares about them?

One of Meghan’s aides revealed in secret that the atmosphere is very tense in the Harry and Meghan household. “She orders the servants to rearrange the furniture every two hours, and is so irritated by the coronavirus headlines that whenever someone on TV starts talking about the virus, she shouts at the top of her voice about how great Meghan is, and how she is going to save the world.

Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole.

One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you ‘Do Not Panic!’ whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged.

Meghan Markle is detested with such vehemence in Britain that many use her name when they step in a dog shit.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Meghan Markle detests the Windsor Royal family and Britain with a vehemence, and is now embroiled in a dirty war to prove she is bigger than all who stand in her way. Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the ‘Sussex Royal’ name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan’s modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. “Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. “Meghan’s sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of ‘charity funding’. The key factor is to ‘virtue signal’ for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. “The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that’s when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. “We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of ‘loving’ Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.”</td>\n",

This has all been shot to the ground much to the delight of the general population who vehemently detest Meghan Markle and her calculating ideas of global domination. The only thing left for the marauding ex-royal freeloaders is to now call themselves simply as ‘Meghan and Harry’.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Contamination of drinking water from faeces is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as diarrhoea and viral hepatitis. A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to “at least basic sanitation”, a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment.   High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi’an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!</td>\n",

       "      <td>With over 100,000 Chinese people infected, the deaths from coronavirus are being vastly misreported by the Chinese Communist State. Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs.  Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again.  The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run.  If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.</td>\n",

happiness, and this is the case for American men as the batshit crazy, deranged blue-haired pierced and heavily tattooed liberal narcissistic women who voted for Kamala Harris have vowed to go celibate and abstain from men. It’s double plus good news for the gene pool as these selfish, entitled, mentally ill, attention seeking harridans won’t thankfully reproduce.  “For men, this makes things easier by taking psycho hose beasts out of the equation, only leaving the good women. The Trump win has truly been a wondrous event, as it effectively cleanses America of the shitty things, and brings back some form of goodness and purity to the country,” a college student from Nebraska revealed. These liberal women have been so ideologically brainwashed and mentally damaged by the Kamala Harris campaign that they are going on TikTok to publicly display their total and utter shameful, demoralised mental conditions of utter indignity to everyone.  The ironic thing is, these dumbos only sleep with liberal men who voted for Kamala as well, so they’re taking them out of the gene pool too — triple fucking bonus.  No need for your much-loved right to have abortions any more — quadruple fucking bonus!!!   \n",

During an interview with Maddow in Monday’s Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. “Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the ‘treacherous and treasonous scum’,” noted Burner. “You’re one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?”  Rachel Maddow replied: “I’m worried, but I’m actually ready for being in a camp because I’m a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don’t read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. “When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump anyway. “In the camps of the future it won’t be so bad either, there will be plenty of women for me to become friends with. I hope Trump puts me in one of those all female camp buildings. I’ll be up to my eyeballs in pussy. Really, there’s nothing to fear folks, everything I say on MSNBC is absolute bullshit, and I am essentially an actor. Anyone who takes me seriously must be as mad as I am.” The ‘Trump Derangement Syndrome’ seems to be in full force before the coming U.S.elections.   \n",

Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don’t fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point “as early as possible”, suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. “One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark.” Don’t jump off the ship when it’s cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: “Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets”. She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don’t fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience.  Don’t get pushed off the ship Janice’s fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There’s only so much a crew member can take, so don’t be an arse and get on everyone’s tits. Don’t fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker’s penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: “You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning”. Don’t fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: “The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy. I once saw an elderly passenger ingest an entire humungous turd in one gulp when she fell in the water near a sewage outflow pipe”. The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it. Once passengers disembarked, Janice admitted she and the crew were glad all the whinging fuckers had gone and hoped they would never be seen again — that is, until the next batch boarded the cruise ship for a trip they would surely regret for a lifetime.   \n",

Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan’s pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour “Listen and Speak” scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. “If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I’ll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I’d fucking top myself.” Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour “Listen and Speak” system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast.  Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen’s speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. “If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,” a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to “safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen” and a way to uphold “the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining”.   \n",
       "4   You may think there were some benevolent reasons for rolling out and introducing the personal computer and smartphone to the civilian population, and yes there were some, but the majority of reasons were far from that. One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who’s programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.?  You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control.  This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain. UPDATE – May 24 Looks like others are realising what the Daily Squib has been talking about for years. https://www.barrons.com/news/ai-relies-on-mass-surveillance-warns-signal-boss-20280d0a   \n",

royal fans have been questioning his ‘ludicrous’ display of medals for his brief stint in the military in his latest video address. “Arse!” Royal fans were up in arms when they saw a blurred, wonky amateur video of the prince on his porch in Montecito wearing medals all over a cheap looking civilian suit. One Twitter X user commented: “What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned” Another X user revealed: “He looks like a prize ninny! Who’s he trying to fool?” However, others defended the duke, with one user Laquisha46 commenting: “Harry is wearing his medals proudly, which our African princess Meghan probably purchased for him in a flea market in Santa Monica. Leave them alone, you bunch of bullies. Love you Meghan.” The consensus was of ridicule for the wayward prince who has admitted to heavy use of class-A drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, meth and marijuana, allegedly including when he served. Expert analysis Royal expert and body language expert Arbuthnot Bollsaque commented on the BBC that “Harry is showing defiance for being stripped of his right to wear a military uniform by displaying the plethora of medals all over his cheap looking suit”. Harry was stripped of his honorary military titles by late Queen Elizabeth II after he stepped down from royal life in 2020 and moved to California with Meghan Markle.   \n",

Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.   \n",

This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China’s CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a “role model” for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN’s Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week’s APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China’s “tremendous” achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. “I think it’s a role model for many countries,” Schwab said. “I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,” Schwab said. It’s not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it’s forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions.  A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved “peacefully.” Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome’s 1972 pro-depopulation book “The Limits to Growth.” Meadows argues that most of the world’s population must be wiped out so that the survivors can “have freedom” and a “high standard of living.” During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world’s population is “inevitable.” However, he insists that a “benevolent” dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population “peacefully.” “We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,” he says of the world’s growing population. “If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart … and [people have] a low standard of living,” Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.   \n",

A Celebrity campmates after being found with a large cache of the sedative Midazolam during his isolation period ahead of entering the jungle. The Daily Squib can reveal the former Health Secretary, 44, was primed and ready ‘to carry out another covid’ on the campmates. ITV bosses were left reeling at the erroneous discovery. Mr Hancock, who lost the Tory whip last week when it was announced he was joining the cast of the show, also has access to his laptop. Do Not Resuscitate “It seems Hancock’s plan was simple. Sedate the other contestants. Claim they had a virus, then up the dose, snuffing the fuckers out. Boom! Take the prize money,” an ITV worker revealed. Earlier on today, Matt Hancock was filmed eating an entire bowl of crunchy crocodile anuses with a big silly grin on his face.   \n",

Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved “peacefully.” Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome’s 1972 pro-depopulation book “The Limits to Growth.” Meadows argues that most of the world’s population must be wiped out so that the survivors can “have freedom” and a “high standard of living.” During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world’s population is “inevitable.” However, he insists that a “benevolent” dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population “peacefully.” “We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,” he says of the world’s growing population. “If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart … and [people have] a low standard of living,” Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.   \n",

This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in ‘real life’ by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans.  Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children’s book The Stench. Disabled Veterans  Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. “It’s a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually ‘care’ despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that’s something for another day. You just can’t fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved. Exploiting the disabled and old for your own monetary and press gain is truly despicable, but it’s all part of the game, and these two money-grabbing tricksters play that game very well.” Here’s to the VVIP (Vile Vindictive Insolent Parasite) Sussexes… (long fart sound)   \n",

This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that’s it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. “This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. “Prince Harry once said ‘What Meghan wants Meghan gets’ and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry’s life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. “Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle’s psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. “Markle has modelled herself on Harry’s mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. “Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana’s inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. “Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. “As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan’s evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan’s titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.”   \n",

corner is Meghan Markle crying like a fucking baby, and all around are other ladies all crying. Or maybe they are not crying, maybe one of them is acting, maybe onions are involved in the sordid crying matter? Who’s crying this time, aww is your mental state a bit fragile? Like you can bully and dismiss whole battalions of people with ruthless efficiency, but the slightest bad press makes you cry? Oh, look what you have done now, Harry is crying in the corner as well. Just as soon as we get off our private jet and the servants unload the bags of money… You made me cry now, and I am going to report it on a chat show watched by millions of people. Ooh! I’m going to pull out my race card now and tattle tale. He said, she said! Take my word for it. Please give me as much sympathy as possible.   \n",

Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain’s enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain’s Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry’s Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain’s enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!   \n",

                             Hailing from the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota, Shaquashisha LaQwandwell, 23, the state’s first ever transgender woman, was crowned Miss Minnesota in St. Paul on Monday. This year’s Minnesota beauty pageant was an all-inclusive affair, with not only transgender women invited but even paraplegic women were duly encouraged to join. Under Joe Biden’s new transgender directives, if you are a transgender biological male, you are welcome to join not only the military but any sport for women, or beauty pageant. Accepting her prize LaQwandwell was naturally happy to win such a prestigious contest, and is now pushing her sights to enter Miss USA, and even the Miss Universe contest. “Imma aks y’all do you lakk ma beautiful face and figure ni**az, cuz y’all bitchez gonna see me sashay in to Miss USA soon. Imma gon enter Miss USA, not wit ma 15 inch but da contest silly. Gotcha dere!” At one point, LaQwandwell dropped her flowers and bent over to pick them up giving the judges all a solid eyeful of her meat and two veg, but that was neither here nor there, she has every right as any woman to join the contest. Bigotry and discrimination will not be tolerated.   \n",

little tweety boird landed on a branch next to the narcissist. The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle’s black couture dress. They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry’s ratings in the UK. One of Oprah’s producers was professional about the bird shit incident. “The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!” As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple’s garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient.   UPDATE: March 11, 2021 – Some geezer has taken our idea and put it to video. Done very well, good production. Well done.   \n",

Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle’s demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen’s cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.   \n",

According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. “The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace’s footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like ‘puta’ and ‘madre’. “Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. “The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers ‘Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.’ The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. “The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day’s business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.” It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future. In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder. Queen Meghan has staunchly denied the American royals are competing with anyone else, ahem, mention no names.   \n",

Can’t live without that shit. We’re also gonna set up a direct link with the Chinese Communist Party so they can download what they want and dictate to Pop what they need done,” an excited Hunter Biden said rubbing his hands with glee. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE According to Democrat officials who say the election is in the bag, Marxist political operative Zheng Zhifa and Democrat-Chinese Influence peddler John Wei, who are closely tied to the CCP will have their own office directly in line with Biden’s Oval Office so they can bark orders at him without even picking up a phone. “Pops told me that the Secret Service assholes, and any moron who cares for national security will be told to stand down. If anyone even raises a fucking eyebrow to our corrupt deals, as we rake in more millions, they will be retired to goddamn Alaska. As for my crack dealer, Jigaboom ‘Boom’ Williams, he will be given free access to my quarters, as he is the best crack rock dealer this side of Chicago,” Hunter Biden added. Thanks to the silence of the corrupt dealings and crimes of the Biden Crime Family by the mainstream Democrat Party Propaganda media, the Bidens are well protected and can do as they please without any fear of prosecution. They are effectively above the law, and their evil crimes are completely dusted under the carpet. “When it comes to Democrats, the media keeps quiet of our crimes, and we can do anything without fear of ever being prosecuted. Republicans, libertarians, and anyone else — they get prosecuted immediately for the smallest misdemeanour, their names and reputation put through the mud, and turfed out of town by the mob. Those are the rules folks so go suck on that losers!” a prominent Democrat politician and avowed paedophile rapist revealed to MSNBC on Sunday, laughing like a hyena. Some things will change though — this time the Big Guy will be getting 50%.   \n",

Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China.  WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden’s recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA’s national security.   \n",

Due to mass biased censorship, the DS can only briefly describe what is out there now all over the internet. Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child. This obviously ties in with Joe Biden’s creepy photographs sniffing women and children, and other inappropriate behaviour even during C-SPAN photo shoots. SOURCE: NationalFile.com Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, who allegedly admitted to his father in a text message that he had sexual relations with his 14-year-old niece, Natalie Biden, is now undercover and nowhere to be seen. Maybe venture to 4Chan, as Chinese dissidents against the CCP regime are flooding the place with even more photos from the Hunter hard drive. In one video Hunter Biden is filmed receiving foot gratification from a female whilst smoking a crack pipe. That’s all we can reveal here, purely because of the censorship and cover up by the socialist controlled media. There may or may not be some information from here if you follow through. Free and Fair Press? There is no way any of the mainstream news outlets can call themselves news services, or journalists because they are completely ignoring the biggest scandal in political history at the moment. You are not a journalist if you ignore this Biden story, you are a paid biased slave to political masters, and are ignoring the basic tenets as well as responsibility of journalism. Your cowardice and inaction, will never be forgotten — you are a disgrace to the mantle of journalism and a free, fair press. Do not ever call yourselves journalists ever again. You are a sham, a shameful cowardly disgrace to journalism.   \n",

Just as the sun seemed to be shining again and the vile Kardashian slime was seeming to have subsided, there is a newer even worse offering coming to our screens, this time involving freeloaders Harry, Meghan and poor old Archie. “No doubt the Netflix executives have ordered the Sussexes to bring out the sprog for maximum effect, and are already training the kid to do circus tricks,” one ex-Netflix subscriber said disparagingly. Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. “It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians. Sussex is now viewed next to any other cheap brand on the telly and no doubt the merchandising will be profitable as well. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, the Windsors can only look on in horror as the royal name is dragged through the dustbin of inequity,” a royal commentator revealed. Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving ‘woke’ bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age. If it was up to the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry and Meghan would have been given the boot with no title, no pay offs and no goodbyes.   \n",

Bush library, which only has one book, My Pet Goat. The Donald Trump presidential library is set to stump all of the prior presidents, and their ego stroking book depositories. Trump is going to open up a whole library of books dedicated solely to authors who have spilled the dirt on the president, backstabbers, former employees with grudges, former White House staff who were fired, and all the rest of the Trump haters who wrote vast volumes of text detailing how bad a person he is. “I want to put all the tremendous hate into one place, so I can walk in there and revel in all of it. We’re not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me. I revel in this, because I affected those people so much, they went and wrote a book about me, good for them. You know, I should get royalties from them all, maybe I might get my new lawyer to look into that. We’re going to see rows and rows of these books in my new shining library, it’s gonna be bigger than Obama’s that’s for sure,” President Donald J. Trump quipped from the White House on Wednesday. There’s even talk about bringing out an encyclopaedia of Donald Trump Haters, who all seem to have come out of the woodwork only weeks before the election. Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president’s anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. “No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it’s because they are really scared he will win a second term. The negative news projects are released with such quantity daily, they now overlap each other publicity wise. We are talking well researched hit pieces, some with actual evidence as opposed to the old ‘anonymous source’ route. I don’t know anyone on this planet that can survive that kind of shit, but the Teflon Don. Sure some stuff sticks a little while longer, like the vet smear project, but all I see is Trump wading through this manure, he’s doing it relatively calmly too, with ease. You gotta hand it to him, and if he wins the Nobel Peace Prize, he will deserve it way more than Obama, who just got his for being black,” a prominent Capitol Hill commentator revealed about the whole fiasco.   \n",

Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle’s actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. “Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. “Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle’s Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. “This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person’s weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. “With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his ‘mother’ for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman’s claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. “My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.”   \n",

Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. “Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,” the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being ‘ordered’ to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that’s all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don’t you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do.  One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the ‘voice of the people’ has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have ‘mental’ problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle’s bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that’s what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world. People are sick of being lectured by you and your little boy — Harry.   \n",

According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. “We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That’s when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,” Harry was quoted in the book ‘Fine Whine and Freedom‘. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan’s pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. “It’s acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!” The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town’s carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that’s her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.   \n",

Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx’s racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of ‘n*ggers’ holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx’s son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by “one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood.” In a letter to Lafargue’s wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that’s why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province.   So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It’s quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it’s embarrassing that these supposedly ‘anti-racism’ groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.   \n",

Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking ‘whitey’ for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle’s famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine ‘woke’ propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There’s only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. “We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack’s. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let’s say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?” What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: “Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people’s money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It’s a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they’re downers.” Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.   \n",

The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. “Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,” an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of ‘White Flight’ where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China’s power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China’s land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.   \n",

Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,” a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today.  Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture’s design and oversaw the project’s execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation’s birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America’s magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. “We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,” a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.   \n",

The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as ‘anti-racism’ by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews.  White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM’s ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population. History repeats itself sometimes in sinister ways.   \n",

All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. “Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,” the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: “We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money. Saint George could do no wrong, as he kicked her in the stomach before he left with the woman’s money. She was white and deserved it. Black lives matter, and Saint George Floyd, praise be to you, I drink champagne in your honour!” Pope Francis will be coming to liberal American cities blighted by racial tension to administer the sainthood on Apostle George Floyd in late July.   \n",

These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America’s campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg’s Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals.  There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system.   “Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,” one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: “Their goal is to exploit America’s academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. “It’s smart. It’s a long-term, patient approach.” Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party’s “united front” efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party’s friends to strike at the party’s enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It’s not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples.   Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!   \n",

Now I am a civilian underling to an ageing humourless Z list actress who is obsessed by herself, and orders me around as if I am one of nana’s Corgis, there are no palaces here in the soulless cocaine fuelled environs of Los Angeles, just bland Starbucks and fake plastic people with their faces stretched behind their ears, and their pig’s anus resembling trout lips, puckered to the point of absurdity,” the woeful former royal lamented to his friends. The former prince yearns for the fresh breeze of the rolling green hills of England, the quaint pubs, the polo, his friends and brother and the cheers of Twickenham, as well as the considered sarcastic comments of royal discourse, which is non-existent to the clueless politically correct Yanks. Meghan whose chief expertise is in fellatio, due to her apprenticeship over many years of shitty low-end showbiz jobs, has only this skill to her name, but over time, even her intricate oral technique will not be able to keep the former prince from feeling home sick. The hundreds of men she has serviced in her time can contest to her fellating skills, but her vicious narcissistic personality counteracts this very attribute. One friend revealed: “Harry is so bored of it all. He is now surrounded by American socialists, who can be even more intoxicating than the British sort, mainly because of their extreme champagne swilling PC hypocrisy and constant sappy victimhood. The Hollywood set are about as shallow and vapid as a Death Island episode. One mention of shooting a grouse, and they all huddle in the corner crying like babies and pointing fingers.”   \n",

Having no qualms about abandoning her own family and 72-year-old father who had two heart attacks, it is not surprising that Meghan does not care much for the people dying from coronavirus. “The headlines are not about me, Meghan Markle, instead they are about this awful pandemic, about old people dying, I mean who fucking cares about them? These old people are taking away my headlines, just let ’em go. Then it’s about coronavirus masks, and food bank queues, and corona this, corona that! There’s nothing about my new foundation Archehole, or my new initiative to slow global warming by stitching up elephant assholes so their farts do not damage the ozone layer.” Harry and Meghan, who claim they left the UK because of press intrusion, are now even more distraught that the press have got better things to report than the gimmie dat couple who just ‘take, take, take’. One of Meghan’s aides revealed in secret that the atmosphere is very tense in the Harry and Meghan household. “She orders the servants to rearrange the furniture every two hours, and is so irritated by the coronavirus headlines that whenever someone on TV starts talking about the virus, she shouts at the top of her voice about how great Meghan is, and how she is going to save the world. Meghan is now writing affirmations with her third sharpie all over the walls of the rented villa in Los Angeles where she is in lockdown with poor Harry and Archie.” In desperation, Meghan Markle is actually thinking of phoning up Donald Trump, who she. hates, and demanding he halts the pandemic immediately, so she can get some headlines once again.   \n",

In a statement, they said “We are fed up of the global COVID-19 pandemic taking up our precious publicity but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how the Archehole commodity came to be”. The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their  royal titles at the end of last month, allowing Meghan to resume her z-list career in acting, and have trademarked their own son to make money off selling cheaply produced tat to their deluded, deranged anti-royal fans. In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole. The name Archehole combined an ancient word for strength and action, with another that “evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon through our assholes”. “We have launched Archehole during a global pandemic because as narcissists we cannot be out of the news for more than two weeks plus we need some fucking money sharpish,” they said. C’mon peasants, you may be dying of COVID-19 and have lost everything you have, but you must now pay up your last remaining pennies to Harry and Meghan.   \n",

One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you ‘Do Not Panic!’ whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged. As Obama puts it ‘the old white men‘, who somehow thwarted his hermaphrodite homosexual orgiastic dream last time around. This time however, the virus will no doubt kill these over sixties off, and bring in a new age for the young Marxist indoctrinated youth to savour. Cui bono? It is the globalist communist China loving controllers every time..Greta Thunberg is literally having a deep orgasm at the mere thought of it all…Soros is loving every moment…the Bilderbergers are joyous…the tech power nerds click clacking their keyboards..and the hidden ones…ebullient…   \n",

an unsavoury farewell, Meghan Markle, the former Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that Harry gets the shakes and is suffering from PTRD (Post Traumatic Royal Disorder). “It usually happens at night. Harry will wake up shouting and sweating like a Catholic priest at a choir boys convention. The sweat is horrible, and he’s shaking like a leaf. “I then ask him if it was THAT dream again. He always answers ‘yes’. “It’s always the same dream, he’s at Sandringham, and the whole Windsor family are sitting around the dinner table. Harry is presented with an exquisite feast, and he tentatively asks for the salt. One of the many butlers brings him some salt and even sprinkles his food with it, except he keeps going, then Harry tells the butler ‘that’s enough!’ but he keeps on pouring the salt until his food is completely submerged. “As the salt keeps coming, more and more, Harry looks down and his nose is just above the salt, he can’t breathe, the salt rises further, all he can hear is everyone laughing, guffawing, blackness, suffocation — and this is when Harry always wakes up!” What does this recurring nightmarish dream mean? Countless psychiatrists are trying to cure the poor former prince, but he goes through psychiatrists like a chain smoker goes through lighters. It has got to such a bad state that Harry now sleeps in a separate room and Meghan sleeps with Archie, which she prefers.   \n",

Will Harry ever forgive this odious power mad manipulative commoner who ruined his royalty, who put a stain on his image that will probably never be removed? Meghan, with her constant gleeful fake smile parades her power over the lowly, weak, Harry with a commanding authority much like a pig farmer parades their prize breed boar through the stalls of an auction house. Harry’s life will from now on be a sad shadow of his previous one, and it’s all down to the emasculating, vindictive monster he has been fooled into mating with. Nothing to lose Meghan gained everything while Harry, who had so much, gave up everything, for little or no return. One royal fan from the crowd observing, quipped, “Be careful with whom you stick your winky into ‘arry, for it can affect your whole life, drastically for the worse, as you’re seeing now. The initial buzz of the first time lust always dies down.”  “Meghan and her Croydon facelift does not care about Archie, otherwise she would have brought him along on the trip to England for the final appearance, and she vindictively used the child’s absence as a way of punishing Her Majesty, the Queen. Withholding grandchildren to punish, is an oft used technique by parents with a stick to whack,” one angry woman said from the sidelines of the abbey. The service at Westminster Abbey in honour of the Commonwealth was most certainly marred by the antics and idiosyncrasies of the Firm, something well documented over the decades. In years to come, or maybe sooner, Harry will resent this woman who took him away from his beloved army mates, his brother, from his country, and from his family, and from the sprawling palaces, the shooting grounds, the rolling hills of England, the Pomp and Circumstance, gone now, a distant memory with only vast straight grid roads and fast food restaurants to look at in his new environs. Harry, always the runt of the litter, had a reprieve from his status before he met Meghan, and was hugely popular with the public, but now he is back to being the runt, and of course, he is now married/imprisoned to a grand – – – -!   \n",

                              Disney executives who are being begged by Harry and Meghan’s agent to give her a role in a superhero film, or anything that comes up, are so fed up that they might just have a plank of wood on screen to represent the former Duchess of Sussex. “She can’t act, has zero charisma, and is a foul using bitch who has zero endearing qualities, plus has a very negative image in the public’s eyes. We just went to Home Depot and bought a plank of plywood, that will be her,” Gus Van Horten, senior studio producer told CNN. It would be a win win situation for the film studio because the plank of wood costs about $19.99 as opposed to some horrific sum pushed by Meghan’s deluded agent. “The plank of wood will have more presence and acting skills than Meghan Markle, who was a Z list anyway,” another Disney producer revealed. The former royal couple are currently holed up in Vancouver, Canada staying as a guest of a Kremlin connected Russian businessman. Meghan Markle is signed up to visit Britain for the last time before embarking on her Hollywood ‘career’. Meghan Markle is detested with such vehemence in Britain that many use her name when they step in a dog shit.   \n",

Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the ‘Sussex Royal’ name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan’s modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. “Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. “Meghan’s sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of ‘charity funding’. The key factor is to ‘virtue signal’ for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. “The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that’s when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. “We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of ‘loving’ Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.”   \n",

brand, estranged father of Meghan Markle made an announcement today to the same effect. “After deep cogitation at the ramifications of our Markle family name being dragged through the gutter, I hereby decree that the use of the ‘Markle’ family name be not used to market cheap plastic trinkets, socks, pyjamas and toilet brushes as proposed by Meghan and Harry after being banned by the Queen of Great Britain of using the ‘Sussex Royal’ name for profit.” The Exile on Meghan Street couple who are now holed up in Canada, have already spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating a Sussex Royal website as well as patenting thousands of products they wished to sell using the trademark to make millions of dollars. This has all been shot to the ground much to the delight of the general population who vehemently detest Meghan Markle and her calculating ideas of global domination. The only thing left for the marauding ex-royal freeloaders is to now call themselves simply as ‘Meghan and Harry’.   \n",

A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to “at least basic sanitation”, a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment.   High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi’an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!   \n",

Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs.  Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again.  The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run.  If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.   \n",

Britain leaves the EU on the 31 January 2020. The propulsion and mass of Remainer tears will be used by power stations across Britain to generate millions of kilowatts of electricity powering homes up and down the breadth of Great Britain. “I’ll put a cuppa on. Kettle’s boiling on the power of Remainer tears. Wahey! Got Brexit Done! Have some crumpets with your tea!” If you’re watching Eastenders or Love Island, your telly will be powered by the Remoaning flood of tears from the insufferable pathetic Remainers who just can’t get over the EU Referendum result even after three long years and three fucking prime ministers. Plug your chainsaw in and go round your Remainer neighbour’s house with an extension lead in tow, why not carve up their wardrobe in the style of the goddess Britannia, or their kitchen table in the shape of the British Isles. As you pour another whisky, sit back and watch the news reports of Britain leaving the EU, smile like a Cheshire cat, put your feet up, snuggle your toes, and giggle insanely as you realise all of this is being powered by the sorrowful tears of Remainers. With the rate that lot are crying, there will be no chance of power outages for years.   \n",

       "      <td>A COMPLETE visual replica of a gaping arsehole, local boss Jamie McCartlin, has informed staff on their first day back in 2025 that he wants to hit the ground running this year. In a circular email sent to staff that immediately led to rolling of eyes seen by WWN, McCartlin spoke of wanting ‘100%’ from staff, pointing to a less than stellar last quarter and how ‘some people around here won’t get away with coasting for another year’. “Not only is it the bastarding 2nd of January, it’s a Thursday. Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,” groused employee Cormac D’Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. “My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road. So even if I wanted to hit, slam, bate the ground in 2025 it’ll have to wait,” offered Carmel Tullan, who didn’t make it past the first sentence in her boss’ email which began ‘New Year, New Focused Workforce’. For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. “This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I’m saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,” McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through. “I won’t sugarcoat it, I need soldiers, people who eat, sleep and breathe this job. ,” concluded McCartlin, who neglected to mentioned he was offing on a two week skiing trip to Austria at the end of the month.</td>\n",

       "      <td>HAVING CALCULATED the projected tax relief she is entitled to under the Remote Working Relief on electricity and broadband bills at the start of December, local woman Orna Stewart is primed and ready to file her 2024 tax return. With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers. “People have no idea how much they’re entitled to, just leaving money there on the table but not me, no way Jose, that €4.25 is mine!” Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. “But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,” Stewart’s husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn’t entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour’s long lecture on honesty and ethics. “Here she is, right on queue,” said the automated system in receipt of Stewarts tax declaration, making her the first person in the country to submit her declaration for the 5th year running.</td>\n",

       "      <td>THE COMMISSION FOR Regulation of Utilities in Ireland has called on the public to refrain from taking yet more photos of the snow as server capacities reach breaking point. “Data centres already consume a huge amount of our electricity, but Meta will need to break ground on another eight data centres if you keep uploading those photos of your snowman with a carrot for a dick,” cautioned the energy watchdog. Usually limiting itself to providing a free complaint resolution service, the CRU has felt the need to speak out before the energy grid buckles under the weight of picturesque landscape photos accompanied by the word ‘sneactha’. “We all know what snow fucking looks like lads, you’ve already taken 150 pictures of it, that’s enough. And anyway, they’re likely out of focus and partially covered by your fat fingers. The world will survive without your visual documentation of it all,” a CRU spokesperson added, as the light caught their face just right amid a background of beautiful cascading snow which acted as cotton wool blanket pulled over the nearby hills. “You better not be taking a fucking picture of me,” insisted the spokesperson, as this reporter’s iPhone camera’s flash went off brighter than a Chinese New Year fireworks display. UPDATE: The CRU also urged the public to be mindful of the carbon footprint created by taking 400 photos of your pets every hour, and the impact of giving a thumb’s up emoji to every single WhatsApp message you receive.</td>\n",

       "      <td>EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. “Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?” Farrell asked over the phone, the audience’s applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. “There’s no way Meryl hasn’t exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don’t be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn’t exactly a stretch for me, just saying,” one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. “Enough time has passed, it’s okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in ‘Milk’? Over me in ‘In Bruges’, give over,” continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell’s angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. “Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I’m guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?” one industry insider offered.</td>\n",

Back then I didn’t have a home work set up,” added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement. Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a ‘snow day’ due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day’s work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building. “That’s a ‘The Chase’ repeat marathon in my boxers off the fucking cards,” griped one worker who has actually had several of those days recently over the Christmas but still feels like they’re missing out. “A snow day off from work is one of those sacred if rare rights of passage all office workers should be entitled to, like when you get a day off ‘cus someone in the warehouse loses an arm or the under the table hush payment when the boss can’t keep his arms to himself,” complained workers rights’ advocate Tony Dallon.

Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their ‘meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace’. “Look, we’ll forget about that last part there and just say it’s for the first two,” Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. “We’ll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we’re finished. The seaside property there is to die for”. Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. “There comes a time in an activists’ life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,” Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. “I know people back home will not be happy, but they’re just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh”. Meanwhile, Michael J Fox, Denzel Washington, ‘Magic’ Johnson, Ralph Lauren and several others were just glad they were actual American citizens and thus avoided such criticism from people calling for an end to the Palestinian genocide.</td>\n",

Why set the bar at an unobtainable level when there are some real everyday improvements to be made and very achievable targets. Check out these realistic New Year’s resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don’t count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of ‘getting dressed every day’. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don’t set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don’t even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.</td>\n",

Fashion, music, art, film, we’re the zeitgeist,” falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. “If you even so much as try and say ‘oh, I wasn’t born then so it was before my time’ to me, I’ll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn’t ‘classic TV’,” sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words ‘elder millennials’ often precede headlines such as ‘still have f-all hope of affording a house’. “Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We’re the tech generation,” offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window. UPDATE: An emergency team of therapists have been deployed to millennials after a meme stating ‘we’re as close to the year 2000 as people were in 1975’ began doing the rounds.</td>\n",

With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren’t out of order, the country’s main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey. “I didn’t think it through when I got in the eight slabs for the Christmas, I usually have a mental breakdown when I do the post-Christmas dump run but I guess I’ll just have it now,” added one individual towing a trailer full of his haul of Christmas cans which included some from the days they had the in-laws and neighbours over. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. “I’m missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTÉ,” said one driver, unaware the car they’ve been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago. UPDATE: Supermarkets with Re-turn machines are now providing hose down showers for drivers stuck in their cars for hours on end who now stink of stale alcohol emanating from their boots and back seats.</td>\n",

You following this?” continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn’t seem to have desired effect on O’Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely. “Do you want to see my Premier League sticker book?” beamed Hughton, rummaging through a shoe box in his wardrobe.</td>\n",

Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?” professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O’Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. “Some suggest it’s a ‘notions’ thing but isn’t removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says ‘my sofa is precious’, it tells visitors ‘I don’t want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,” added O’Neill, who believes there’s a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn’t count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers. “Some studies are utterly pointless but am glad someone is finally doing something of value,” said one study participant Patricia Clarke, who is just thankful matching patterned curtains and carpets never went out of fashion.</td>\n",

The new changes will see customers allowed access to loading bays where they can free produce they want to buy from crates and pallets, moving them to their shop floor location at dedicated signposted spaces on shelves in various aisles. “From here, customers can then take a number of those items, scan them, pay for the items, pack them in bags and leave,” added Smith. The initiatives are set to increase customer interaction with faceless interfaces by 350%, reducing the need for surplus staff. “And we understand not all customers live in the most conveniently located areas in relation to their local branch. In fact, some might live closer to distribution centres and in those cases we’ve heard what customers have said and we give in; you can pick up large shipments of stock from there and drive them directly to our stores,” chimed head of staff headcount recalibration Craig Stafford. “Our only thought here is the customer, it’s all customer led initiatives and ideas,” he added, handing some pricing guns to a stressed out mother-of-three who just wanted to know where the milk aisle was.</td>\n",

       "      <td>IN A FIRST for the funeral industry in Ireland, many stakeholders are now suggesting vulnerable families processing the loss of a loved one could be preyed upon and have their grief exploited in the name of profit by bad faith actors. This fear comes with the news that the RIP.ie website, purchased this year by The Irish Times, will begin charging a €100 fee for death notices. “RIP.ie would want to cop on, that’s fierce bad,” said one funeral director who knows just the phrase to use to steer grieving families away from all the cheapest available elements of a funeral package. “And that phrase is ‘if you really loved them you’d go for our deluxe premium gold mourning package'” they added. In retaliation to the new charge, Irish people around the country are gathering in protest and have confirmed they will boycott dying until RIP.ie reverse their decision. “That’s awful so it is,” offered a priest who can paid upwards of €150 for doing the thing he’s supposedly driven to do as a calling as he is not motivated by money.  Florists, printers, musicians, car leasers, hotels, restaurants and bars among others have all condemned RIP.ie’s decision to take a look grieving families and think ‘they could be paying more’. “As a firm that charges by the individual tissue handed out to grieving widows, we know an insensitive price gouge when we see one,” offered one dissenting funeral director who would now have to regretfully up the fee they already charged for placing an RIP notice.</td>\n",

Witnesses said another Burke cleared in court yesterday of obstructing a garda from carrying out their duties broke down in tears and begged the judge for a jail sentence. “They haven’t just chosen prison for a bit of a break from her, it’s also their knees, legs, ankles that need the break. They were up to 80,000 steps on the FitBit some days, traipsing around the streets filming themselves chasing and shouting at people,” offered a source.  Martina Burke’s suspicions have all but been confirmed after Enoch bricked up an escape tunnel his mother built into prison which was concealed behind a poster of Rita Hayworth.  “Ah look, Christmas can be a stressful time if you have batty relatives, I’ve often considered doing a short stretch too just to get a break from my lot. She looks like she’d lose the plot after dinner over a game of Monopoly in fairness,” offered one observer.

Aside from putting an advert down an alley way in the form of a ‘for a good time call’ scrawl on a wall in graffiti, the couple are at a loss as how to find a like-minded couple. “We got close once with a couple from Limerick but I think they misunderstood the keys in a bowl thing and drove off with Brian’s VW,” Cathy explained. “We’re penpals with a couple in Germany, they do more swinging than monkeys on a vine over there, you can’t fathom the embarrassment each new postcard we send brings; a swinger who hasn’t swung,” sobbed Brian.</td>\n",

A trial much take place. And when that is over and if he’s found guilty, I will say ‘justice has spoken, there is no more to say’ and move on,” one reactionary columnist confirmed. “No, there’s a clear difference; in the case of Sinn Féin you can extrapolate out an issue and ask, speculate and confirm it’s proof of deficiencies and anti-democratic values which are unique to the party but if such alleged crimes relate to a Fine Gael member, that’s mere coincidence and it would be churlish and unethical to draw conclusions about the party itself,” confirmed another columnist readying a ‘Expect The Opposition To Play Political With An Incredibly Sensitive Issue’ article.</td>\n",

Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. “Take that Ireland!” announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they’ve been punished. “What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?” offered an upset Netanyahu. The Israeli leader was unable to answer any further questions as he was called away to authorise more missile strikes on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran.

       "      <td>AN ANNUAL Xmas get together over a ‘super low key’ lunch among a group of friends is dangerously spiralling into a ‘massive ball ache’ thanks to the pricey organising habits and notions addiction of one Marie McGrath (32). “I’ve Christmas with two kids to be paying for, Shauna and Michelle are saving for houses, how in the name of the baby Jesus is this costing this much?” said Patricia Farley, in a separate WhatsApp group set up to bitch about McGrath. Running for over the past 7 years and always taking place over a brief lunch in Dublin during a workday given everyone’s busy schedules over the Christmas, Type A McGrath has successfully strong-armed the group into buckling to her demands and a two-night stay in Galway. “Galway doesn’t really suit me,” remarked Niamh Sullivan, the only one of the girls still living In Waterford, whose concerns were directly addressed by McGrath in the form of sending a link to €90 elf costumes everyone is now required to wear. A secret Santa with a budget of €150, a €60 bottomless brunch with a non-refundable deposit and staying in a 4-star hotel with a spa they won’t have time to use are among the many concerns the group have. “Don’t be silly, what are we? Penniless students,” McGrath responded to a suggestion to book a cheap hostel while omitting the fact the cost of the ‘lunch’ has now topped €658 excluding any money spent while in Galway. “They have a special offer on in the hotel where if you book the luxury suites they give you a festive cocktail for €20 extra but still – makes sense to make a fuss so it’s not just a boring get together, oh and then have that fake snow that gives you pink eye if it gets within 2 feet of your face,” enthused McGrath, who will have to be deposed from her organising role in a bloody coup.</td>\n",

Bradley aware of the fact words from a high-level coach such as himself could have a big effect on an impressionable young coach like Guardiola, the Dubliner declined to point out the Manchester based man wsas using outdated ‘dinosaur tactics’ from 2019. Keeping him on the phone for close to 4 hours, Guardiola sought advice in other areas including what to do if your team is found to have broken spending rules 115 times and may be relegated to 47th tier of English football. “Jesus if you had asked me about boardroom squabbles I’d have a book for you on that, but can’t help you there pal,” explained Bradley, who declined to take struggling defender Kyle Walker off the Spaniard’s hands.</td>\n",

Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. “You’ll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it. NOW,” whispered the mangled demon soul of Ireland directly into the ears’ of first time buyers. “Sadly, they’re not elevated enough. I was barely able to leverage my home to buy an apartment in Dublin to rent at extortionate levels; it’s the Irish dream,” shared one man, who thinks it’s a disgrace his kids can’t afford a house. Meanwhile, the outgoing Minister for Housing has confirmed having combed through the report its content are clearly a hyperbolic fantasy and that everything is indeed fine.  “Oh I haven’t read a word. But from my understanding we can counteract further price inflation by doing things that increase prices like more subsidies for builders, tax breaks for landlords, increasing the help to buy scheme and upping the rent credit payment,” explained Darragh O’Brien, who admitted government formation talks were on the verge of collapse as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fight over who gets responsibility for increasing homeless figures.

Eat the whole cake? I’ll show you,” added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a ‘call out’ and a ‘questioning of my stomach storage facilities’, Tulley’s nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. “You can’t put ‘serves 8’ on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,” explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. “Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor”. Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include ‘listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you’ve nothing to prove’ and ‘but won’t you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?’</td>\n",

Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating ‘but we’re the GAA’ didn’t immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids’ play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received €40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles. Revenue only accepted the accounts when forced to witness the man down 18 breakfast roles in 7 minutes.

The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim.

Having also destroyed the majority of the newly liberated Syria’s military capabilities, Netanyahu said he hoped any future leadership there would accept his clear offer of friendship but warned that geography is not the IDF’s strong suit and they could continue to expand the size of the Golan Heights if they need to.

Look at my army style shirt. I’m like a Syrian Zelensky, I’m one of the good guys now!” he stated.

Putin’s FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow’s best high rise windows. “You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me? I like two-panel slider window because once it slide over you can lock in place so no accidentally close while you trying to get view. Come look,” insisted Assad’s friendly and accommodating tour guide. Assad’s guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below. “With jalousie window, you no stand out on edge, feel breeze on face, hand at your back. It real shame,” added Alexander, before ushering Assad to the crown jewel of Russian windows which is known for its panoramic views and no overlooking apartment blocks or witnesses.</td>\n",

That’s a sale gone for your good self,” insisted 45-year-old Cormac Keeler as his children stood by, wishing the world would swallow them up. Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating ‘trees €45, €65 &amp; €85’ Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at €85. “Your sign says ‘€45’ and aim to hold you to that,” barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don’t treat everything like an episode of Dragon’s Den. “You don’t think I’ll go down to the GAA club where they’re selling them as well. I’ve bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for €45 is more than fare,” said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as ‘an asshole’ when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year. Keeler, now shivering from being in the cold so long in a thin jumper, began losing stamina but insisted on not losing face in front of his children. “I’ll give you €85 on the sly but you just pretend you’ve agreed to go down to €45,” pleaded Keeler, to which Horan responded ‘no’.</td>\n",

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has left America reeling,   “Can’t we just crush their souls will a faceless barrage of automated emails full of mangled and meaningless bureaucratic jargon like they were a normal customer?” pondered one executive, who noted a pre-existing allergy to being shot as justification for why any healthcare administered is not covered. While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.  “No, they have our cell numbers, we can’t just rely on our customer disservice lines for this one,” one anguished board member said, bouyed slightly by the news the company’s share price is actually up. “C’mon, this isn’t a single mother-of-two in need of cancer treatment that we give the run around to, this is a real person with a real family,” reasoned one soft hearted profit-allergic board member who risked tarnishing UH’s stellar industry-leading 32% claim rejection rate. “Could we maybe put aside some of huge increases in profits we’ve experienced in the last few years and cover things ourselves? We’ve what, $90bn in profits from last year?” suggested one smiling executive to titters of laughter.

You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they’ve won.

Yoon Suk Yeol’s future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world’s spotlight. “Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,” Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death. “This is exactly what happens when you’ve got a poor leader who can’t control his people – sure they may all have fancy things like food, a working economy, health care and really nice fried chicken, but what would you prefer, all those materialistic things or a great strong leader with dashing good looks?” Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of ‘we love you’ could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation’s men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year. “Since it’s Christmas, I’m giving away a free holiday to Eastern Europe for every North Korean man in the country.

I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,” exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. “Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you” offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. “What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,” Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner’s dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister.  “Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he’s walking free – makes me sick,” said Trump who didn’t pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment. Journalists possessed with a unique political insight even suggest inspired by Biden, Trump could now suddenly develop an interest in using pardoning powers for allies and January 6th insurrectionists.</td>\n",

Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear. “Now, look, it’s not all rosy for the IDF when the next 100 violations occur that triggers a clause in our agreement together,” outlined Miller, revealing the hard line the Biden administration continues to take could see Israel sent more weapons as punishment. Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. “It’s not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,” outlined Miller.

Fire any and all publicists working for you, you’ve got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners.  If anything you’ll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn’t even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. “You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I’d love motor boat clearly aren’t getting any at home which is why you can’t even take a compliment”. Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn’t the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. “Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I’ll need to pretend I’m a devout Christian now too”. Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife’s vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn’t an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You’re going to want to mention the word ‘woke’ a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I’m A Celebrity to see if they’ll book you on the first flight to the jungle.

In a circular email sent to staff that immediately led to rolling of eyes seen by WWN, McCartlin spoke of wanting ‘100%’ from staff, pointing to a less than stellar last quarter and how ‘some people around here won’t get away with coasting for another year’. “Not only is it the bastarding 2nd of January, it’s a Thursday. Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,” groused employee Cormac D’Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. “My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road. So even if I wanted to hit, slam, bate the ground in 2025 it’ll have to wait,” offered Carmel Tullan, who didn’t make it past the first sentence in her boss’ email which began ‘New Year, New Focused Workforce’. For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. “This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I’m saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,” McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through. “I won’t sugarcoat it, I need soldiers, people who eat, sleep and breathe this job. ,” concluded McCartlin, who neglected to mentioned he was offing on a two week skiing trip to Austria at the end of the month.   \n",

With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers. “People have no idea how much they’re entitled to, just leaving money there on the table but not me, no way Jose, that €4.25 is mine!” Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. “But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,” Stewart’s husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn’t entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour’s long lecture on honesty and ethics. “Here she is, right on queue,” said the automated system in receipt of Stewarts tax declaration, making her the first person in the country to submit her declaration for the 5th year running.   \n",

Usually limiting itself to providing a free complaint resolution service, the CRU has felt the need to speak out before the energy grid buckles under the weight of picturesque landscape photos accompanied by the word ‘sneactha’. “We all know what snow fucking looks like lads, you’ve already taken 150 pictures of it, that’s enough. And anyway, they’re likely out of focus and partially covered by your fat fingers. The world will survive without your visual documentation of it all,” a CRU spokesperson added, as the light caught their face just right amid a background of beautiful cascading snow which acted as cotton wool blanket pulled over the nearby hills. “You better not be taking a fucking picture of me,” insisted the spokesperson, as this reporter’s iPhone camera’s flash went off brighter than a Chinese New Year fireworks display. UPDATE: The CRU also urged the public to be mindful of the carbon footprint created by taking 400 photos of your pets every hour, and the impact of giving a thumb’s up emoji to every single WhatsApp message you receive.   \n",

It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. “There’s no way Meryl hasn’t exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don’t be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn’t exactly a stretch for me, just saying,” one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. “Enough time has passed, it’s okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in ‘Milk’? Over me in ‘In Bruges’, give over,” continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell’s angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. “Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I’m guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?” one industry insider offered.   \n",

Back then I didn’t have a home work set up,” added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement. Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a ‘snow day’ due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day’s work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building. “That’s a ‘The Chase’ repeat marathon in my boxers off the fucking cards,” griped one worker who has actually had several of those days recently over the Christmas but still feels like they’re missing out. “A snow day off from work is one of those sacred if rare rights of passage all office workers should be entitled to, like when you get a day off ‘cus someone in the warehouse loses an arm or the under the table hush payment when the boss can’t keep his arms to himself,” complained workers rights’ advocate Tony Dallon. Asked why remote workers didn’t just lie and say they had no electricity, workers responded in unison stating that every office has some ‘busybody prick’ who would actually check that with the ESB networks and rat on them.   \n",

Resembling an obedient child receiving his First Holy Communion while staring into the heavens, the almost billionaire cast decades of activism and calling out warmongers from his mind in favour of the highest civilian award of the United States usually given to those for their ‘meritorious contribution to either the security interests of the United States, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours or world peace’. “Look, we’ll forget about that last part there and just say it’s for the first two,” Biden reassured Bono as he continued to make a holy show out of his homeland in front of the world. “We’ll get you a nice site on the Gaza strip when we’re finished. The seaside property there is to die for”. Sir Bono, once known for his outspoken opinions on war and famine, later defended accepting the award from the nation responsible for funding ongoing genocide in Gaza and dozens of other unjust wars over the last century. “There comes a time in an activists’ life when he has to de-activist, especially when it starts crossing over into financial and foreign policy interests of my elitist friends,” Bono explained, whose name coincidentally appeared in the Panama Papers alongside fellow medal recipient Hillary Clinton. “I know people back home will not be happy, but they’re just begrudgers. Please forgive them Lord as they do not know what they are doing. Amen. Cel-a-brat-ion! Uh oh oh”. Meanwhile, Michael J Fox, Denzel Washington, ‘Magic’ Johnson, Ralph Lauren and several others were just glad they were actual American citizens and thus avoided such criticism from people calling for an end to the Palestinian genocide.   \n",

Why set the bar at an unobtainable level when there are some real everyday improvements to be made and very achievable targets. Check out these realistic New Year’s resolutions: 1) Drink a glass of water over a 12 month period 365 days x 1.3ml per day comes in at 500ml. You can do it. Believe in yourself. Transform the way you attack the day! 2) Be near, around or in the general vicinity of a gym or someone who goes to a gym Beware of the lazy pricks who duck out of any fitness regime after January, they don’t count for the other 11 months of the year. 3) Occasionally get dressed Why hold yourself to the toxic Instagram-filtered perfection of ‘getting dressed every day’. Three days on, four days off is a good start. Don’t set unrealistic expectations that society pressures people to conform to. Pyjamas most days are fine. You don’t even have to wash they that much. 4) Briefly glance at healthy salads in the supermarket before swiftly moving on If you want to take it one step further, put a pre-made salad in your basket before later abandoning on a shelf in the biscuit aisle. 5) Successfully download Duolingo. No need to put the app icon on the main screen where it will taunt you And if you really want to push yourself, maybe learn some swears words in German, Spanish or French.   \n",

Fashion, music, art, film, we’re the zeitgeist,” falsely alleged geriatric millennial Susie Earley. The warning to be more mindful of the words people use has been extended to workplace settings which encompasses people just entering the workforce for the very first time. “If you even so much as try and say ‘oh, I wasn’t born then so it was before my time’ to me, I’ll send you the bills for my therapy, One Tree Hill isn’t ‘classic TV’,” sobbed office worker John Sconnell. Not helping the situation, the words ‘elder millennials’ often precede headlines such as ‘still have f-all hope of affording a house’. “Like, what the fuck are you talking about? We’re the tech generation,” offered another near pensionable millennial, who is too afraid to use ChatGPT because they think robots will burst through their window. UPDATE: An emergency team of therapists have been deployed to millennials after a meme stating ‘we’re as close to the year 2000 as people were in 1975’ began doing the rounds.   \n",

With Re-turn machines currently processing on average 121 cans per minute nationwide on the four remaining machines that aren’t out of order, the country’s main traffic arteries are more clogged than your heart after a third helping a gravy covered turkey. “I didn’t think it through when I got in the eight slabs for the Christmas, I usually have a mental breakdown when I do the post-Christmas dump run but I guess I’ll just have it now,” added one individual towing a trailer full of his haul of Christmas cans which included some from the days they had the in-laws and neighbours over. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact everyone currently in traffic thought they were getting the can return done before it dawned on anyone else, rendering being stuck in bastard traffic all the more heartbreaking. “I’m missing an Indiana Jones marathon on RTÉ,” said one driver, unaware the car they’ve been stuck behind for 2 hours is in fact made entirely of beer cans abandoned by a driver who gave up and fled long ago. UPDATE: Supermarkets with Re-turn machines are now providing hose down showers for drivers stuck in their cars for hours on end who now stink of stale alcohol emanating from their boots and back seats.   \n",

The tear-jerking intrusion of man’s basic humanity, the likes of which has not seen since the first World War, into the maddening mire of murderous political negotiation had seemed virtually impossible in recent weeks such was the near constant agreement the two sides have been locked in. “I’ve seen it all now, it wasn’t two days ago I heard some of them agreeing on absolutely everything, declining to even speak out loud due to their telepathic understanding of each other and now look at them, putting aside their zero differences to play a bit of ball, warms the heart. There’s a lesson in their for all of us” added another onlooker, filled with the Christmas spirit.

       "11                                            THE PERSONABLE and polite exterior belonging to local woman Ciara Kinnane is at risk of shattering if she has to endure one more bullshit Christmas tradition observed by the her other half’s family, the Mortons. “Silly Sockless time, Silly Sockless time, who’s going to win the last Roses chocolate,” screeched Morton matriarch and mother-in-law to Kinanne, Carmel as the family inexplicably whipped off their socks and ran out the front door. “D’you not play this before? I definitely told you about this one Ciara,” Kinnane’s partner Jack said, outlining how one member of the family who can survive out on the concrete drive way in front of the house in their bare feet the longest wins a solitary chocolate. “But it’s mild enough like and you’re all adults. You can buy an infinite amount of chocolate for yourselves. In fact you just told me you vomited a little in your mouth there ‘cos you’re too full of chocolate,” a so-fucking-done-with-this Kinnane said. At first glance, Kinnane could be labeled a Grinch of the highest order, but experts in spending festive period with the in-laws have pleaded for understanding. “She’s had to sit through something called ‘Oopsy Daisy Gift’ where you buy someone a gift you know they’ll hate, and there’s still the Christmas Eve watching of the Michael Keaton Batman movies ‘as is tradition’ to come, and the mulled wine and pineapple soup. These family-specific traditions are a penance,” explained one Christmasologist, who wouldn’t blame Kinnane if she started walking back home to Cork from Dublin now. Expertly spotting that Kinnane was receding into herself slightly, her other half tried to cheer her up. “You a bit tired or something? Don’t worry, you’ll be having great craic once we start playing mistletoe toe, remember? Where we pass the parcel with mistletoe and if it’s in your hand when the music stops, you have kiss someone’s toe” Jack told Kinnane, who can’t believe she’s three more days of this foot obsessed family.   \n",

And Jose was cool back then, not the cringe magnet he is now, but even before him Ranieri was like sound and Ferguson and his little parade of pricks were arrogant as anything,” launched Hughton, not drawing breath as O’Sullivan identified her nearest emergency exits. Putting himself back on the defensive slightly 32-year-old Hughton made sure to mention how before his time mid-90s Chelsea were a joyously sophisticated blend of brawn and skill, counting Zola and Wise among their ranks, thus proving the ‘we’ve got no history’ chant is deeply ironic before having to explain the chant’s origins what O’Sullivan said “what’s a chant?”. “And sure dad would try and wedge me into a United shirt but I didn’t want to be like the other lad in school who were all United fans. You following this?” continued Hughton, the words spilling out of him excitedly as his girlfriend finally asked him about something he cared about instead of boring topics such as his career or his terminally ill grandfather. A spirited and energised love poem about Claude Makelele and how he walked so Ngolo Kante could run didn’t seem to have desired effect on O’Sullivan, who Hughton now presumed would accompany him on several trips to Stamford Bridge on an annual basis and making the possibility that their first child could be called Terry very likely. “Do you want to see my Premier League sticker book?” beamed Hughton, rummaging through a shoe box in his wardrobe.   \n",

Christ we used to dress our children in old arm rest covers but when did we decide to stop using them?” professor of furniture studies at TUD Harry O’Neill queried. Reasons posited for the almost complete extinction arm covers is traced to a dwindling supply of Irish women who are so aggressively house proud their wrath is more feared by Irish society than a roaming band of machine-gun totting vigilantes. “Some suggest it’s a ‘notions’ thing but isn’t removing the covers the OPPOSITE of notions? Having arm rest covers says ‘my sofa is precious’, it tells visitors ‘I don’t want your gummy, grubby bastard forearms destroying my expensive furniture,” added O’Neill, who believes there’s a link between the disappearance of arm rests and the fall of Irish civil society. Participants in the study have been warned that the recent adoption of a non-matching little cover draped over one arm of a sofa that has slots for a TV remote, magazines and other items doesn’t count and looks ridiculous, retaining none of the understated quintessentially Irish tackiness of arm rest covers. “Some studies are utterly pointless but am glad someone is finally doing something of value,” said one study participant Patricia Clarke, who is just thankful matching patterned curtains and carpets never went out of fashion.   \n",

The new changes will see customers allowed access to loading bays where they can free produce they want to buy from crates and pallets, moving them to their shop floor location at dedicated signposted spaces on shelves in various aisles. “From here, customers can then take a number of those items, scan them, pay for the items, pack them in bags and leave,” added Smith. The initiatives are set to increase customer interaction with faceless interfaces by 350%, reducing the need for surplus staff. “And we understand not all customers live in the most conveniently located areas in relation to their local branch. In fact, some might live closer to distribution centres and in those cases we’ve heard what customers have said and we give in; you can pick up large shipments of stock from there and drive them directly to our stores,” chimed head of staff headcount recalibration Craig Stafford. “Our only thought here is the customer, it’s all customer led initiatives and ideas,” he added, handing some pricing guns to a stressed out mother-of-three who just wanted to know where the milk aisle was.   \n",

This fear comes with the news that the RIP.ie website, purchased this year by The Irish Times, will begin charging a €100 fee for death notices. “RIP.ie would want to cop on, that’s fierce bad,” said one funeral director who knows just the phrase to use to steer grieving families away from all the cheapest available elements of a funeral package. “And that phrase is ‘if you really loved them you’d go for our deluxe premium gold mourning package'” they added. In retaliation to the new charge, Irish people around the country are gathering in protest and have confirmed they will boycott dying until RIP.ie reverse their decision. “That’s awful so it is,” offered a priest who can paid upwards of €150 for doing the thing he’s supposedly driven to do as a calling as he is not motivated by money.  Florists, printers, musicians, car leasers, hotels, restaurants and bars among others have all condemned RIP.ie’s decision to take a look grieving families and think ‘they could be paying more’. “As a firm that charges by the individual tissue handed out to grieving widows, we know an insensitive price gouge when we see one,” offered one dissenting funeral director who would now have to regretfully up the fee they already charged for placing an RIP notice.   \n",

Witnesses said another Burke cleared in court yesterday of obstructing a garda from carrying out their duties broke down in tears and begged the judge for a jail sentence. “They haven’t just chosen prison for a bit of a break from her, it’s also their knees, legs, ankles that need the break. They were up to 80,000 steps on the FitBit some days, traipsing around the streets filming themselves chasing and shouting at people,” offered a source.  Martina Burke’s suspicions have all but been confirmed after Enoch bricked up an escape tunnel his mother built into prison which was concealed behind a poster of Rita Hayworth.  “Ah look, Christmas can be a stressful time if you have batty relatives, I’ve often considered doing a short stretch too just to get a break from my lot. She looks like she’d lose the plot after dinner over a game of Monopoly in fairness,” offered one observer. After the jailing of Sean Burke, garda commissioner Drew Harris took to the steps outside the courts to boast about putting another ‘key figure’ in the Burke Crime Group behind bars.   \n",

Only thing I can do is knuckle down and enjoy the drinking, gifting and eating without a second thought for anything else. Anyone insisting on making me aware of other things are the ones committing atrocities if you ask me,” shared another person who thinks its awful what’s happening; the empathy for people.

Aside from putting an advert down an alley way in the form of a ‘for a good time call’ scrawl on a wall in graffiti, the couple are at a loss as how to find a like-minded couple. “We got close once with a couple from Limerick but I think they misunderstood the keys in a bowl thing and drove off with Brian’s VW,” Cathy explained. “We’re penpals with a couple in Germany, they do more swinging than monkeys on a vine over there, you can’t fathom the embarrassment each new postcard we send brings; a swinger who hasn’t swung,” sobbed Brian.   \n",

WWN has taken to the streets to find out: “Since the embassy will be going spare, we can probably let Palestinian refugees move in?” – Deirdre, Cork. “I might be overdue an eye test but why does Netanyahu suddenly closely resemble a jockey’s bollocks?” – Carmel, Wexford. “I get it, when I’m annoyed at people I feel aren’t treating me well I punish them by punching myself in the face too” – Cormac, Wicklow. “I’m an Irish-American on Twitter with 12 followers that absolutely isn’t a bot account and I can confidently say I speak for all Irish people when I say antisemitism is taught from birth in Ireland. It’s whispered in the ears of newborns by midwives and Irish people are given a free potato every time they say ‘Israel is bad'” – SonOfAira1816. “That’s very Main Character Energy of Israel, we’re actually too busy protesting against and intimidating refugees in Ireland to be bothered being mean to their embassy” – Fergal, Westmeath. “Things have gotten so bad Israel has got me supporting Simon Harris, thanks a lot Netanyahu!” – Mairead, Dublin. “Sorry, I can’t talk I’m off to return one of my 40 copies of Mein Kampf to the library” Ian, Waterford. “I can’t help but feel this is partly my fault, if only I’d celebrated the murder of Palestinians, sent a congratulations card every time a child was executed by sniper fire then the ambassador would have felt more welcome” – Shay, Kerry. “Rent in Dublin is a pox, I know the feeling too pal, I left a long time ago” – Ciara, Glasgow. “Antisemitism is a very real and hateful form discrimination which needs to be stamped out, but that’s probably not helped by the Israeli government calling Irish people antisemitic for objecting to mass murder” – Laura, Galway.  “Is this the first time the Israeli government has actually given up property?” – Kevin, Cavan.   \n",

A particularly taxing bout of chasing during little break, coupled with exhaustive number rhymes and an argument over what the best dinosaur is, McKinty entered the second half of his day more tired than usual, with his desire to ‘put today to bed’ manifesting itself in a 6pm request for an unprecedented second glass of Ribena. “My friends don’t understanded me, hide and seek is better than just chasing. Mrs Horan doesn’t understanded me, maths is wojus altogether, we should do painting but Ribena, Ribena gets me,” said Jack staring into the middle distance, inhaling sharply as the 2024 vintage blackcurrant juice burned a little in his throat. Jack’s stress levels weren’t helped by the fact his two older siblings were ‘acting the complete pricks’ when they returned from school, insisting on switching off Bluey in favour of playing their computer games. “Okay honey, just this once but we can’t make having two glasses of Ribena a habit okay? It’s not good for your toothy woothies and it’s full of E numbers,” Una told her child, who couldn’t hear her as his senses were momentarily dulled by the sugary blackcurrant squash coursing around his body. “This world is chewing me up and spitting me out just fine without you being on my case too Una, just one day, that’s all I’m asking, one fucking day you can just leave me to enjoy the small things in life without a lecture,” said Jack grabbing the bottle of raw unfiltered Ribena and storming off to bed.   \n",

With no empirical research and reason to back up why this particular 4-minute window is a blissfully peaceful time on the streets has emerged, the public have been urged not to complain but rather except this as the good news it is. “I looked it up, it’s not when methadone is doled out, it’s not when Conor McGregor is training in the gym or the Monk is off on a jolly in an early house, we can’t pin down the reason but let’s not question it Dubliners just enjoy it,” confirmed one Dept of Justice spokesperson. The news has seen an increase in city dwellers maximising the time, getting all errands and highly dangerous activities such as ‘existing’ out of the way in the golden 4-minutes. “Nah, you’re alright,” responded the Minister when asked if she planned another walk through the city centre flanked by gardaí and the media.   \n",

Layout designers and editors who may have been required to work late on 32-page special pullout supplements on such an Earth-shattering story have been stood down, as have producers of emergency podcasts, as it now transpires this isn’t a big story in the public interest. “I may have demanded Sinn Féin answer all and any questions relating to the case of their once-staff member being a sex offender, but it would be downright tawdry journalism to ask Fine Gael to answer for an individual and their alleged actions. A trial much take place. And when that is over and if he’s found guilty, I will say ‘justice has spoken, there is no more to say’ and move on,” one reactionary columnist confirmed. “No, there’s a clear difference; in the case of Sinn Féin you can extrapolate out an issue and ask, speculate and confirm it’s proof of deficiencies and anti-democratic values which are unique to the party but if such alleged crimes relate to a Fine Gael member, that’s mere coincidence and it would be churlish and unethical to draw conclusions about the party itself,” confirmed another columnist readying a ‘Expect The Opposition To Play Political With An Incredibly Sensitive Issue’ article.   \n",

With City’s resolve and spine currently wilting like a ice cream cone on the surface of the sun, Guardiola’s response to continued adversity is the sort material that could fill a thousands PHD studies. “I’ve seen men who walked in their wives having sex with all four of their brothers at once cope better than this guy,” said a psychologist fascinated by the former Barcelona man’s soul-baring stream of consciousness press interviews. “Look the January transfer window is coming up, City will be looking to make new additions, we’re just hoping to be one of the 40 new additions required,” confirmed a group of therapists hoping to join the coaching Pep down on the ledge of his own manic monologues team.

This, it transpires, is true of the outgoing Irish government. “Just when you think a regime has reached the nadir of its inhumanity and barbarity, they shock, offend and sicken you all over again,” confirmed Benjamin Netanyahu, still reeling from Ireland’s decision to support a petition at the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. Well documented by key figures in the Israeli government, signing a petition regarding an ongoing genocide is among the most heinous crimes imaginable, far greater than actually perpetrating the genocide and thus, Israel were left with no choice but to close down their embassy in Ireland. “Take that Ireland!” announced also-under-investigation-for-monumental-fraud Netanyahu, reasoning that by restricting the access of Israeli citizens in Ireland to supports from the Israeli state, Irish people will really feel like they’ve been punished. “What have we ever done to Ireland? Stolen their passports for use in assassinations, attacked their peacekeepers, attacked aid flotillas, restricted their aid from entering Gaza, providing them and the world with the largest and most comprehensive catalogue of images and videos of an ongoing genocide, and this is the thanks we get?” offered an upset Netanyahu. The Israeli leader was unable to answer any further questions as he was called away to authorise more missile strikes on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran.

An unprecedented 5th win in a row in the category, McGregor faced his toughest competition for the award this year with late surges from ‘Unnamed Armagh GAA player questioned over rape’, Denis Coulson, who is was given 14 years in a French prison for his part in a gang rape of a woman and Chris Farrell who must wear an electronic monitor for two years after being found guilty for failure to prevent a crime. “I think it’s unfair on Conor, I voted for Catriona Carey myself, no one worked harder to ruin their sporting legacy in my opinion, maybe next year we can have a family category so the Careys get their due,” confirmed one voter for the awards. All in all it was a strong showing for the rugby fraternity with ex-international Brendan Mullin serving a three year sentence for stealing €570,000 from Bank of Ireland.

Running for over the past 7 years and always taking place over a brief lunch in Dublin during a workday given everyone’s busy schedules over the Christmas, Type A McGrath has successfully strong-armed the group into buckling to her demands and a two-night stay in Galway. “Galway doesn’t really suit me,” remarked Niamh Sullivan, the only one of the girls still living In Waterford, whose concerns were directly addressed by McGrath in the form of sending a link to €90 elf costumes everyone is now required to wear. A secret Santa with a budget of €150, a €60 bottomless brunch with a non-refundable deposit and staying in a 4-star hotel with a spa they won’t have time to use are among the many concerns the group have. “Don’t be silly, what are we? Penniless students,” McGrath responded to a suggestion to book a cheap hostel while omitting the fact the cost of the ‘lunch’ has now topped €658 excluding any money spent while in Galway. “They have a special offer on in the hotel where if you book the luxury suites they give you a festive cocktail for €20 extra but still – makes sense to make a fuss so it’s not just a boring get together, oh and then have that fake snow that gives you pink eye if it gets within 2 feet of your face,” enthused McGrath, who will have to be deposed from her organising role in a bloody coup.   \n",

With his Shamrock Rovers side enjoying a 5-game unbeaten run in Europe, Bradley is the man Pep Guardiola has turned to for advice on how to crack continental competitions as his Manchester City side remain on the verge of Champions League elimination after a 2-0 loss to Juventus. “Ah no look, he was glum enough this lad Pep, but I told him football is a simple game just get it to  Kenny up top and the rest will take care of itself,” added Bradley after Rovers beat Bosnian champions Borac 3-0 last night in Tallaght. Bradley aware of the fact words from a high-level coach such as himself could have a big effect on an impressionable young coach like Guardiola, the Dubliner declined to point out the Manchester based man wsas using outdated ‘dinosaur tactics’ from 2019. Keeping him on the phone for close to 4 hours, Guardiola sought advice in other areas including what to do if your team is found to have broken spending rules 115 times and may be relegated to 47th tier of English football. “Jesus if you had asked me about boardroom squabbles I’d have a book for you on that, but can’t help you there pal,” explained Bradley, who declined to take struggling defender Kyle Walker off the Spaniard’s hands.   \n",

Despite the alarming report, the Irish public has been urged to plough on regardless and ignore its contents as everything is fine. “You’ll have the overwhelming urge to take a step back and assess your situation with logic but this would be wrong. You need to be obsessed with owning property, no matter the cost, no matter how shortsighted a purchase. Do it. NOW,” whispered the mangled demon soul of Ireland directly into the ears’ of first time buyers. “Sadly, they’re not elevated enough. I was barely able to leverage my home to buy an apartment in Dublin to rent at extortionate levels; it’s the Irish dream,” shared one man, who thinks it’s a disgrace his kids can’t afford a house. Meanwhile, the outgoing Minister for Housing has confirmed having combed through the report its content are clearly a hyperbolic fantasy and that everything is indeed fine.  “Oh I haven’t read a word. But from my understanding we can counteract further price inflation by doing things that increase prices like more subsidies for builders, tax breaks for landlords, increasing the help to buy scheme and upping the rent credit payment,” explained Darragh O’Brien, who admitted government formation talks were on the verge of collapse as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fight over who gets responsibility for increasing homeless figures.

Never heard such nonsense in my life,” confirmed Niall Tulley, collecting the flakey crumbs on his chest, the only remnants of his 16 pack of sausage rolls. “It’s the arrogance that gets me to be honest, ‘suggested serving size – one slice’, you don’t think I can do it? Eat the whole cake? I’ll show you,” added Tulley, clearly gravely misunderstanding all portion related guidelines. Perceiving each serving suggestion as a ‘call out’ and a ‘questioning of my stomach storage facilities’, Tulley’s nutritional knowledge is sorely lacking and has prompted some to suggest an update to packaging guidelines. “You can’t put ‘serves 8’ on a Four Star pizza, it attacks the fragile masculinity of many men, you might as well call them a fanny,” explained foodologist Dr Wilhelm Von Murphy. “Reconsidering how we phrase portion intake, serving suggestions etc could see people like Tulley not immediately view it as a race against time to eat it all before declaring himself the victor”. Revised guidelines drafted by Dr Von Murphy include ‘listen we know you could gorge this in ten seconds flat, you’ve nothing to prove’ and ‘but won’t you feel a little bit sad when you catch sight of yourself in the reflection of the microwave after inhaling 12 of these?’   \n",

Celebrations among the Saudi delegation had to remain short and swift as attention turned to what to do with the bodies of all the dead migrant labourers who will suffer human rights abuses and die of exhaustion building the 2034 stadiums. “We don’t want the mass grave near any of the tourist stuff, obviously” offered one meek member of Mohammed Bin Salman’s delegation during a human rights abuses storming session. “Call me crazy, well don’t ‘cus I’ll have you killed, but would it be the perfect mix of dastardly and practical to just leave a big hole at pitch level and just pop all the bodies in there, then lay the over them?” queried Mohammed Bin Salman. “If I may, I don’t know why we’re fretting over this, we could dump them in a big pile in front of an official FIFA fan zone, if Qatar’s proven anything it’s that no one cares,” offered one McBribery.

Finding that the usual method of sternly repeating ‘but we’re the GAA’ didn’t immediately result in being left alone to do what they like, county boards are calling on Jarlath Burns to track down what club senior Revenue officials kids’ play for and get them dropped from teams. In one instance a junior B player is said to have received €40,000 in nutritional allowance payments for consuming over 7,000 breakfast roles. Revenue only accepted the accounts when forced to witness the man down 18 breakfast roles in 7 minutes.

The phrase, recognised as a short hand for claiming an object, place in queue or large tract of land, is a complex strategy which renders it almost impossible to lodge any objection or counter claim.  Citing previous bagsie incidents including ‘Israel’ and the fact it has illegally occupied the other portion of Golan since 1967, Israel do not expect any meaningful challenge to their commandeering of the territory. “I dunno, sounds pretty compelling to us,” confirmed originator of the ‘bagsie it’ method, Britain. Having also destroyed the majority of the newly liberated Syria’s military capabilities, Netanyahu said he hoped any future leadership there would accept his clear offer of friendship but warned that geography is not the IDF’s strong suit and they could continue to expand the size of the Golan Heights if they need to. Elsewhere, many people have called the insistence that attention be paid to the plight of the Syrian people ‘insensitive’ citing the fact they need time to process the Megan Fox-Machine Gun Kelly split for several more weeks.   \n",

Coined as ‘Syrians rebels’ for now until it suits, militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham leader Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani was greeted with cheers from supporters after capturing the Syrian capital Damascus, solidifying the once wanted group’s control over much of the country. “Don’t worry guys, we’re the good Islamic terrorists so there’s no need to worry about us beheading any of you or anything, unless you’re Christian of course,” proclaimed the rebel leader, who has had a US-issued $10mn dollar reward on his head since 2017, which was ages ago really when you think about it and people change. “I don’t even dress like a terrorist anymore. Look at my army style shirt. I’m like a Syrian Zelensky, I’m one of the good guys now!” he stated. Forcing the Assad family to flee to Russia after a 50-year reign of terror, the once al-Qaeda member al-Jawlani promised a more pragmatic approach to jihad going forward, admitting his past endeavours were questionable, but to trust him all the same as he’s a changed man. “I was al-Qaeda, then Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, then Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but today I’m a Syrian rebel. I may have changed terrorist organisations more times than my headscarf, but you can’t buy that kind of experience so I’m the perfect guy to take over from Assad until they oust me later down the line,” al-Jawlani concluded his statement. Meanwhile, Syrian people have been told to stop celebrating the end of a brutal dictatorship by western leaders because the group that brought freedom didn’t get their permission beforehand.   \n",

The newly elected Dublin Bay South TD has been suspended from the Social Democrats’ parliamentary party with immediate effect for giving incorrect information, originally stating he sold the shares before he was elected to politics, but was actually after the fact. “In fairness to Eoin he’s showing some real promise as an Irish politician and shouldn’t be put off that he was booted out of the Social Dems for lying, he’d get a promotion in Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael for the same thing,” pointed out another source.   \n",

I’ll such your dick for a little phone juice. Please, I’m desperate,” said one internet-deprived Waterford resident seconds into losing power during Storm Darragh, and the social cohesion and civility has only fractured further since then plunging some villages into a more-lawless-usual nightmare. “Ah look, we actually had a load of pre-cooked meals and that so we were fine for food but I thought this storm might be my only excuse to try human flesh,” said one Galway resident feasting on his neighbour’s arm, having just endured close to 30 hours without power. This man is not alone, as it is estimated nearly 3,000 rural Irish villages now resemble some sort of zombie apocalypse movie on steroids. “I wouldn’t mind only we had got in extra stock and hired a generator,” said one rural take away that actually suffered a dip in business as panicked locals never considered checking in, instead choosing to immediately resort to cannibalism. “It’s got so bad Donal Skehan has rushed out a cannibal recipe book for the Christmas,” said one ESB worker who had his leg gnawed off as he was halfway up a pole fixing an electrical fault.   \n",

Initially local man Tom Shannon struggled to comprehend the words, straining and asking the supermarket retail assistant to repeat what they said before engaging in what looked like the long forgotten elaborate tribal dance of his people, patting down every pocket his clothing had several times. “Just a sec,” said Shannon, who despite seeing the four people in front of him go through the same routine to pay for his shopping, was as ill-prepared for a request for payment as a monkey would be if asked to perform open heart surgery. “What’s this prick at,” confirmed the eleven people behind Shannon in queue in unison. Wasting the sort of time George RR Martin could’ve finished writing his Game of Thrones series in, Shannon fumbled, rummaged and pulled at his jacket and jean pockets before producing his phone which he intended on paying with. “There we are now,” said Shannon before failing to open his phone using face-ID technology, forcing him to resort to incorrectly inputting his phone pin which led him to revert to using his debit card. Doing so with the sort of nonchalance that brings out a unique and potent level of animosity in fellow shoppers, Shannon then repeatedly tapped a coffee loyalty card on the card machine. “You should have given me a heads up you were finished scanning my shopping,” Shannon now barked at the retail assistant, cementing his reputation as a one-of-a-kind dickhead in the process.   \n",

The deposed despot fled the country he and his family brutalised for over 50 years but those fearing Assad would be left to a life in penury and suffering will be left disappointed as evidenced by the warm welcome he has reportedly received from Vladimir Putin in Moscow. “I know you would rather be back home killing and torturing, who wouldn’t, but in Moscow we have nice restaurants, the theatre, oh and you will not believe the beautiful windows we have. Hey, Alexander show Bashar our best windows,” enthused Putin before abruptly leaving his dictator friend to get back to concentrating on his three day special military operation in Ukraine. Putin’s FSB has promised Assad that he will be given a detailed tour on all Moscow’s best high rise windows. “You have Palladian window style in Syria yes? It is beautiful no? Me? I like two-panel slider window because once it slide over you can lock in place so no accidentally close while you trying to get view. Come look,” insisted Assad’s friendly and accommodating tour guide. Assad’s guide, Alexander, then spent close to 45 minutes criticising universally adopted window safety features, with particular disdain for the jalousie window which only ever offered the window user a partial shuttered view of the steep drops below. “With jalousie window, you no stand out on edge, feel breeze on face, hand at your back. It real shame,” added Alexander, before ushering Assad to the crown jewel of Russian windows which is known for its panoramic views and no overlooking apartment blocks or witnesses.   \n",

That’s a sale gone for your good self,” insisted 45-year-old Cormac Keeler as his children stood by, wishing the world would swallow them up. Despite the sign at the road side tree selling spot clearly stating ‘trees €45, €65 & €85’ Keeler has held onto this point when trying to haggle for the most expensive variety the 12ft Norway spruce which is priced at €85. “Your sign says ‘€45’ and aim to hold you to that,” barked Keeler as tree seller John Horan remained locked in one-sided negotiation with the Waterford man and multitasking by way of selling trees to people who just want an easy life and don’t treat everything like an episode of Dragon’s Den. “You don’t think I’ll go down to the GAA club where they’re selling them as well. I’ve bought from you for the last 5 or 6 years, a little loyalty by way of selling to me for €45 is more than fare,” said Keeler, while attempting a jovial smile but coming across as ‘an asshole’ when speaking to Horan, who started selling trees last year. Keeler, now shivering from being in the cold so long in a thin jumper, began losing stamina but insisted on not losing face in front of his children. “I’ll give you €85 on the sly but you just pretend you’ve agreed to go down to €45,” pleaded Keeler, to which Horan responded ‘no’.   \n",

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has left America reeling,   “Can’t we just crush their souls will a faceless barrage of automated emails full of mangled and meaningless bureaucratic jargon like they were a normal customer?” pondered one executive, who noted a pre-existing allergy to being shot as justification for why any healthcare administered is not covered. While earnings for the CEO position had increased from $2.7mn to $51.8mn from 2015 to 2024 (raised presumably due to securing positive health outcomes for customers), some have said the UH board could just this once make an exception.  “No, they have our cell numbers, we can’t just rely on our customer disservice lines for this one,” one anguished board member said, bouyed slightly by the news the company’s share price is actually up. “C’mon, this isn’t a single mother-of-two in need of cancer treatment that we give the run around to, this is a real person with a real family,” reasoned one soft hearted profit-allergic board member who risked tarnishing UH’s stellar industry-leading 32% claim rejection rate. “Could we maybe put aside some of huge increases in profits we’ve experienced in the last few years and cover things ourselves? We’ve what, $90bn in profits from last year?” suggested one smiling executive to titters of laughter. Meanwhile, profits are set to soar at private security firms that specialise in providing protection to the top 1% earners across the world.   \n",

Martin has undertaken the more demanding role when it comes to acting, taking to crying when in the car with Fiachra when the petrol gauge flitters near empty. “Yeah, acting, that’s it,” confirmed Martin who has taken to plugging the TV out during ad breaks to save on electricity bills. Not alone this Christmas, the Larkans are believed to part of a growing number of parents who resort to interrupting ‘the magic of Christmas’ with the occasional ‘do you have any idea how much the fucking magic of Christmas is costing us’ lectures when a child asks for €3,000 worth of presents. “You see, this is just a foundational tenet of negotiating. You start with an obscenely large ask and by the time the other party brings you down by 30% or so they think they’ve won. But this was the plan all along,” explained Fiachra, who in asking for a trip to a Premier League game knew he was really guaranteeing a football jersey and training top.   \n",

Yoon Suk Yeol’s future is hanging in the balance after a chaotic night during which he dramatically declared martial law and then withdrew it just as suddenly when politicians gained access to parliament despite in being under armed guard, plunging the country into turmoil, and himself into the world’s spotlight. “Now if that was me, hypothetically speaking of course, I would have slaughtered all those demonstrators first and there would have been none of this,” Kim Jong Un casually explained to his nation of 26 million people forced to watch his address or face death. “This is exactly what happens when you’ve got a poor leader who can’t control his people – sure they may all have fancy things like food, a working economy, health care and really nice fried chicken, but what would you prefer, all those materialistic things or a great strong leader with dashing good looks?” Jung Un added, now fluttering his eyelashes at the camera as screams of ‘we love you’ could be heard from freezing cold crowds outside watching the public address. Finishing his address, the North Korean leader went on to promise all the nation’s men a nice European holiday for all their hard work over the year. “Since it’s Christmas, I’m giving away a free holiday to Eastern Europe for every North Korean man in the country.

I fear we no longer know what are values are, civil society lives and dies on the actions of its publicly elected officials,” exclaimed one columnist, holding back tears as they typed. “Playing quarterback in the starvation, murder and ultimate genocide of Palestinians, well, that sounds suitably American to me but using the office of the President to pardon your son? Shame on you Joe, shame on you” offered another columnist. The news of the pardon puts a desperately dark cloud over American democracy, weeks before what was supposed to be a joyously democratic and civil transference of power to rapist and felon Donald Trump. “What sort of person would so brazenly commit such an act,” Donald Trump asked as he unveiled Jared Kushner’s dad as the Ambassador to France several years after pardoning him for his conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering involving the hiring of a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two, and sending the tape to his sister.  “Pardoned for tax evasion and lying on a gun form, and he’s walking free – makes me sick,” said Trump who didn’t pay income tax in 11 years across an 18 year period and also purchased a gun at a South Carolina gun shop which would have been illegal as he was under a federal indictment. Journalists possessed with a unique political insight even suggest inspired by Biden, Trump could now suddenly develop an interest in using pardoning powers for allies and January 6th insurrectionists.   \n",

Why Hezbollah did this remains unclear. “Now, look, it’s not all rosy for the IDF when the next 100 violations occur that triggers a clause in our agreement together,” outlined Miller, revealing the hard line the Biden administration continues to take could see Israel sent more weapons as punishment. Downplaying criticism of the breaches, Miller confirmed that people were misunderstanding the nature and purpose of ceasefires, which is wrongly associated with preventing death and destruction. “It’s not to stop the killing, these things are announced so it looks like something is being done but as you know from all my briefings these past 14 months the only thing being done is whatever Benjamin Netanyahu wants to do without any fear of consequences,” outlined Miller. Meanwhile, it is hoped fresh gains by Islamist rebels in Syria against Assad forces will calm everything down in the Middle East region.   \n",
       "48    EXCRUCIATING flirting with all the prowess of a pig loose on a kitchen floor polished with baby oil has begun, as Micheál Martin and Simon Harris sit down to try and form a government. What are the ‘red lines’? What are the demands? What do they agree on? WWN reveals all: Simon Harris is insisting on a rotating Taoiseach arrangement, but is open to a slightly tilted Taoiseach, sick leave Taoiseach, Step-Taoiseach or a Bank Holiday Monday Taoiseach arrangement. Micheál Martin is insisting Simon Harris can rotate his head out of the clouds and up his own hole. Fine Gael have stated they want to be in charge of increasing homelessness this time, while Fianna Fáil would like to be in charge of pretending there is a functioning police force. An intransigent Fianna Fáil will not budge on their desire for the next hefty subsidy for developers being delivered with cheese and wine hampers. There is an agreement on delaying announcement on an agreement just so they can watch Sinn Féin embarrass themselves talking about forming a left-wing alliance alternative government for another week or two. An end to ludicrous spending such as the Dáil bike shed, with the Greens out of the picture both parties feel they could get a €20mn five-space car park done in next five years. The potential coalition partners have agreed they are as equally relieved as each other that on International Day of Persons with Disabilities they can avoid going into government with a smaller party demanding reforms and supports in the area. Tentative agreement on who gets to set the Sinn Féin effigy on fire; all 86 TDs at the same time. Simon Harris has already made contact with Liam Neeson to award him the contract for kidnapping Irish people and forcing them back home on planes from Australia. Elsewhere, some independent TDs have already stated what their price for going into government would be with Danny Healy Rae providing this detailed drawing of a futuristic metropolis in Kerry to be built with the Apple Tax windfall money:   \n",

You might be fearing the worst; job gone, career over, but relax one of the world’s leading apology experts, Gregg Wallace, is on hand to dispense his priceless advice that’ll get everyone back on your side: Step 1) Deescalate – there’s been a clear misunderstanding of harmless banter. “Calm down sugar tits”. Fire any and all publicists working for you, you’ve got this. This golden phrase always works, even on the most irate of sugar tits owners.  If anything you’ll soon have coworkers turning on the humourless harridan who isn’t even good looking enough to sexually harass. Step 2) Show you understand the hurt you may have caused in an apology video. “You amply chested posh women whose bosoms I’d love motor boat clearly aren’t getting any at home which is why you can’t even take a compliment”. Empathy is everything, but also maybe include a line about how the dough isn’t the only thing rising around here. Step 3) Get on the phone to Russell Brand for advice. “Can you be down to the river by my house in 5 minutes to Baptise me. Bring a Bible, I’ll need to pretend I’m a devout Christian now too”. Step 4) Keep digging. Your impulse will be to stop digging but maybe down the bottom of that hole is a breezy and hilarious anecdote you can tell a woman you just met about how you dined out on your wife’s vagina for breakfast. Once the laughter starts again, people will forget your erection and/or why they ever thought this wasn’t an appropriate topic of discussion at work. Step 5) You’re going to want to mention the word ‘woke’ a lot. I mean a loooot. Step 6) Ring I’m A Celebrity to see if they’ll book you on the first flight to the jungle. Do you know who looks like she’d love a story about how randy am I 24/7? That Maura Higgins!   \n",

      "0                     A COMPLETE visual replica of a gaping arsehole, local boss Jamie McCartlin, has informed staff on their first day back in 2025 that he wants to hit the ground running this year. In a circular email sent to staff that immediately led to rolling of eyes seen by WWN, McCartlin spoke of wanting ‘100%’ from staff, pointing to a less than stellar last quarter and how ‘some people around here won’t get away with coasting for another year’. “Not only is it the bastarding 2nd of January, it’s a Thursday. Save it for the first Monday of the year at the very least,” groused employee Cormac D’Arcy, who had hit the ground in 2025 and stayed there, hoping to sneak in a quick nap while no one way looking. “My internal work clock remains switched off until the Christmas Tree is fucked in the field down the road. So even if I wanted to hit, slam, bate the ground in 2025 it’ll have to wait,” offered Carmel Tullan, who didn’t make it past the first sentence in her boss’ email which began ‘New Year, New Focused Workforce’. For his part, McCartlin feels he is simply leading by example. “This ship is crew only, no passengers if you get what I’m saying. The only coasting around her is being done by the coastline down the way,” McCartlin said, communicating in empty jargon which appeared to make sense to him. Following up the email with a quick speech to the troops, McCartlin felt his message was getting through. “I won’t sugarcoat it, I need soldiers, people who eat, sleep and breathe this job. ,” concluded McCartlin, who neglected to mentioned he was offing on a two week skiing trip to Austria at the end of the month.   \n",

With her company allowing a flexible working arrangement for employees which includes 3 days at home, Stewart clocked up three days working from home because she thinks she gets more done in the office and she is ready to claim back what is hers. “People have no idea how much they’re entitled to, just leaving money there on the table but not me, no way Jose, that €4.25 is mine!” Stewart said as she hovered over the submit button in her sitting room, on her day off, and the weather lovely outside and all. “But since the bills are in your name, you could claim for much more, even if we split them evenly,” Stewart’s husband Martin stated as he queried why the 33-year-old wasn’t entering the full amount paid through her account, unwittingly setting himself up to be subjected to an hour’s long lecture on honesty and ethics. “Here she is, right on queue,” said the automated system in receipt of Stewarts tax declaration, making her the first person in the country to submit her declaration for the 5th year running.   \n",

Usually limiting itself to providing a free complaint resolution service, the CRU has felt the need to speak out before the energy grid buckles under the weight of picturesque landscape photos accompanied by the word ‘sneactha’. “We all know what snow fucking looks like lads, you’ve already taken 150 pictures of it, that’s enough. And anyway, they’re likely out of focus and partially covered by your fat fingers. The world will survive without your visual documentation of it all,” a CRU spokesperson added, as the light caught their face just right amid a background of beautiful cascading snow which acted as cotton wool blanket pulled over the nearby hills. “You better not be taking a fucking picture of me,” insisted the spokesperson, as this reporter’s iPhone camera’s flash went off brighter than a Chinese New Year fireworks display. UPDATE: The CRU also urged the public to be mindful of the carbon footprint created by taking 400 photos of your pets every hour, and the impact of giving a thumb’s up emoji to every single WhatsApp message you receive.   \n",
      "3  EMERGING TRIUMPHANT from the Golden Globes for an incredible third time, Colin Farrell, universally lauded for his transformation as Batman villain the Penguin opted not to celebrate his win, instead getting straight onto the Oscars actor hotline. “Do I send them in the post and then you send out one of your ones, or how does it work?” Farrell asked over the phone, the audience’s applause still audible as he walked offstage at the glitzy ceremony last night. It is unclear where Farrell heard the rumour that a certain number of Globe trophies can be exchanged for an Oscar statue, but voicemail recordings obtained by Waterford Whispers News confirm the celebrated performer is keen to see the exchange happen. “There’s no way Meryl hasn’t exchanged a few of her 9 Globes for one Oscar, don’t be messing me around lads. Playing psycho Henry Drax in The North Water wasn’t exactly a stretch for me, just saying,” one voicemail began, left several seconds after Farrell finished recording his previous message. “Enough time has passed, it’s okay to finally admit you made a mistake. Sean Penn in ‘Milk’? Over me in ‘In Bruges’, give over,” continued Farrell, the sound of his three Golden Globes chiming off one another as he tried to shove them into a post box. Farrell’s angling for the gong handed out by the Academy of Motions Arts and Sciences has led to other actors calling for an established exchange rate value between different awards. “Everyone wants an Oscar, but is it the equivalent to three Golden Globes? And if it is then I’m guessing 25 IFTAs is equal to one MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss?” one industry insider offered.   \n",
      "4                                         “I FEEL TRICKED” confirmed Carmel Foley, one of hundreds of thousands of workers granted the ability to work from home several days a week in recent years, as she stared mournfully out at heavy snow she couldn’t use as an excuse for a handy day off. “You can’t begin to understand how sneaky and satisfying it felt back with the big snow in 2018 when I told the office the roads to the were impassable due to snow. Back then I didn’t have a home work set up,” added another worker, whose employer would have laughed in their face back in 2018 if they asked for an ergonomic home desk and laptop working arrangement. Irish remote workers now face the prospect of foregoing a ‘snow day’ due to their home being equipped with the ability to do a day’s work, all while non-office workers given the day off fill their social media feeds with snowman building. “That’s a ‘The Chase’ repeat marathon in my boxers off the fucking cards,” griped one worker who has actually had several of those days recently over the Christmas but still feels like they’re missing out. “A snow day off from work is one of those sacred if rare rights of passage all office workers should be entitled to, like when you get a day off ‘cus someone in the warehouse loses an arm or the under the table hush payment when the boss can’t keep his arms to himself,” complained workers rights’ advocate Tony Dallon. Asked why remote workers didn’t just lie and say they had no electricity, workers responded in unison stating that every office has some ‘busybody prick’ who would actually check that with the ESB networks and rat on them.   \n",
