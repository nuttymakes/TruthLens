    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of five categories, based on an adaption of Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with the categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 200 pieces of content for each of the 7 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|Misreporting | Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification. | A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|Persuasive information |Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda. |Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.|\n",
    "|Citizen journalism | User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias. |Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below."

Whistleblowers (whose identities remain unverified) claim that multinational drug companies, fearing a catastrophic loss of profits, have conspired to bury the research and discredit its findings. Detailed, though entirely fictional, documents describe covert meetings between executives and government regulators where plans were hatched to discredit the miracle cure through a series of “controlled clinical failures.” Despite the dramatic claims, no reputable medical journal or regulatory agency has ever confirmed the existence of such a treatment.

    "    [\"The Fabricated Epidemic That Never Was\",\"A recent series of posts on fringe health forums has claimed that an epidemic sweeping the globe is nothing more than a carefully orchestrated fabrication by international health agencies. According to these unfounded accounts, the so-called outbreak of a novel virus was deliberately invented to enforce draconian public health measures and expand governmental control over citizens’ lives. Fabricated “data” presented in the posts—including manipulated graphs and fake expert testimonies—purports to show that infection rates were grossly exaggerated and that the virus was engineered in a laboratory as part of a secret experiment. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary provided by reputable global health organizations, the narrative has gained traction among communities predisposed to distrust official sources. Detractors of the mainstream narrative argue that the epidemic is a hoax designed to justify unprecedented restrictions on personal freedom. While scientists and public health experts have thoroughly debunked the claims, the rumor of a fabricated epidemic persists as one of the most controversial and persistent conspiracy theories in the health sphere.\", \"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"Shadow Health Organization Controlling Treatments\", \"A startling claim emerging from anonymous online sources alleges that a clandestine organization, known only as the “Global Health Directorate,” is secretly controlling all aspects of medical research and treatment protocols worldwide. According to this entirely fabricated narrative, the Directorate operates behind the scenes to determine which diseases receive funding for research and which innovative treatments are suppressed to protect the interests of certain pharmaceutical giants. Leaked “internal documents” (all of which have been debunked by experts) supposedly reveal that this shadow group manipulates clinical trial outcomes and deliberately withholds breakthrough therapies from the public. One supposed insider explained that the Directorate’s ultimate goal is to monopolize global healthcare, ensuring that all new treatments funnel profits exclusively to a handful of powerful corporations. While mainstream scientists and healthcare professionals have dismissed these claims as pure fantasy, the idea of a hidden health organization continues to resonate with individuals suspicious of modern medicine and its regulatory framework.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Pseudoscientific Breakthrough that Shocked Experts\", \"A recent online buzz has centered on reports of a pseudoscientific breakthrough—allegedly discovered by a renegade group of researchers—that claims to reverse aging and cure terminal illnesses in a single treatment. According to the fabricated account, the breakthrough involves a complex combination of gene therapy and nanotechnology, developed in a secret laboratory hidden beneath an abandoned industrial complex. The story goes on to assert that leading medical experts worldwide have been silenced or coerced into keeping the discovery under wraps, with influential institutions allegedly colluding to protect lucrative existing treatments. Detailed but entirely spurious “research notes” and blurry laboratory images have been circulated to support the claim. Despite the sensational nature of the announcement, no peer-reviewed studies or independent verifications exist to corroborate the story. Health authorities and renowned scientists have categorically refuted the claims, calling the report a dangerous piece of misinformation designed to exploit public hopes for miraculous cures.\",\"health\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Mastermind Behind the Global Heist\",\"In an astonishing tale that sounds straight out of a blockbuster movie, unverified sources have alleged the existence of a criminal mastermind orchestrating a series of sophisticated heists across multiple continents. Dubbed “The Phantom Thief” by underground circles, this enigmatic figure is said to have masterminded daring robberies targeting high-security financial institutions and luxury art galleries alike. According to the fabricated narrative, The Phantom Thief utilizes an intricate network of accomplices and cutting-edge technology to bypass state-of-the-art security systems. Leaked “confidential reports” (entirely unverifiable) claim that the mastermind’s operations are so meticulously planned that law enforcement agencies remain one step behind at every turn. One anonymous tipster described a dramatic scene in which the criminal escaped using an elaborate series of decoys and underground tunnels. Despite widespread media interest and online chatter, no credible evidence supports these claims, and authorities have repeatedly dismissed the story as an elaborate fabrication. Nonetheless, the legend of The Phantom Thief continues to capture the imagination of both criminals and crime enthusiasts.\", \"crime\" ],\n",
    "    [\"The Cyber Syndicate and the Digital Black Market\", \"A series of posts on dark web forums has recently brought attention to an alleged cyber syndicate that is said to run an expansive digital black market, controlling vast networks of hackers and cybercriminals. According to the entirely fabricated narrative, this syndicate—known only as “Digital Dominion”—is responsible for orchestrating large-scale data breaches, identity thefts, and even orchestrated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The story details how Digital Dominion supposedly recruits skilled hackers from around the globe, providing them with state-of-the-art tools and secretive training in return for a share of their illicit profits. Leaked “evidence” in the form of anonymized chat logs and cryptic online transactions has fueled speculation about the syndicate’s influence over modern cybercrime. Despite the dramatic claims, no law enforcement agency has confirmed the existence of such an organization, and cybersecurity experts have dismissed the narrative as a myth designed to instill fear. Nevertheless, the notion of a centralized cybercriminal empire continues to spread rapidly among online communities, adding fuel to debates about digital security.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"Fake Evidence Links Celebrity to Crime Ring\", \" scandalous claim has emerged from questionable online sources alleging that a world-renowned celebrity is secretly involved in an international crime ring. According to the fabricated report, the star—whose identity remains deliberately vague—has been linked through a series of doctored documents, manipulated photographs, and untraceable phone recordings to an underground network involved in money laundering and arms trafficking. The narrative suggests that the celebrity’s public persona is merely a facade, carefully crafted to conceal a far more sinister involvement in organized crime. Despite the sensational nature of the claim, independent investigations by reputable outlets have found no supporting evidence, and multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked the story as a fabrication. Nonetheless, the tale has ignited fervent debate on social media, with supporters insisting that the “evidence” is being suppressed by powerful interests intent on protecting high-profile figures. Critics argue that the entire narrative is a calculated piece of misinformation designed to smear reputations and distract from real criminal investigations.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Underworld’s Hidden Code of Silence\", \"Whispers from the criminal underworld have given rise to a fabricated narrative detailing an alleged secret code of silence that binds organized crime groups across continents. According to the entirely unverified account, this so-called “Code of Shadows” mandates that members of illicit organizations adhere to strict rules of non-disclosure about their operations, with severe—and entirely invented—consequences for any breaches. Leaked “testimonies” from anonymous ex-criminals (whose identities cannot be confirmed) claim that this code is enforced through a network of vigilante enforcers operating outside the law. The report further asserts that this clandestine system has allowed crime syndicates to thrive, coordinating complex operations such as international drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and high-stakes robberies without fear of exposure. While law enforcement officials have long acknowledged the existence of informal codes among criminals, no evidence has ever substantiated the detailed version of the Code of Shadows described in these posts. Nevertheless, the story has captured the public’s imagination, fueling both fear and fascination with the hidden rules of the underworld.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"Alleged Supernatural Connection in Organized Crime\", \"In a bizarre twist that has stirred both intrigue and skepticism, unverified online sources claim that an otherworldly element is at work within organized crime circles. According to this fabricated narrative, certain notorious crime families are rumored to have forged secret pacts with mysterious, supernatural entities in exchange for uncanny success in their illicit endeavors. The story describes eerie rituals performed in abandoned warehouses under moonlit skies, where members of these crime families allegedly invoke ancient forces to secure their power and evade capture by authorities. Detailed but entirely fictional accounts include descriptions of cryptic symbols, mysterious chants, and inexplicable phenomena witnessed during criminal operations. While no credible evidence or expert testimony supports any supernatural involvement in crime, the tale has rapidly spread through niche internet forums and alternative news sites. Skeptics dismiss the narrative as pure fantasy, yet its persistence highlights the human tendency to weave extraordinary explanations around the most enigmatic and frightening aspects of criminal life.\",\"crime\"],\n",
    "    [\"AI-Driven Vote Rigging Uncovered\", \"A startling claim emerging from shadowy online sources alleges that recent elections in multiple countries were manipulated using advanced artificial intelligence systems designed specifically for vote rigging. According to the entirely fabricated report, an underground network of tech experts and political operatives developed a sophisticated AI program that could alter digital ballots and even sway public opinion through targeted disinformation campaigns. Leaked “internal communications” (all of which lack any credible origin) detail how this system was deployed during key electoral cycles to produce results favorable to a select group of political elites. The report asserts that the AI not only manipulated vote counts but also fabricated evidence of voter fraud to justify its interference. While election officials and independent watchdog organizations have vehemently denied any involvement of AI in vote manipulation, the narrative has ignited fierce debates online. Critics dismiss the allegations as modern myth-making, yet the idea of a clandestine, algorithm-driven election interference continues to find an audience among those distrusting traditional democratic processes.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"Hidden Ballots and Phantom Voters\", \"In a narrative that has rapidly spread through fringe political blogs, unverified sources now claim that a secretive scheme involving hidden ballots and phantom voters was implemented during recent national elections. According to the fabricated account, shadow operatives allegedly inserted fake ballots into the voting system, and entirely fictitious voter identities were created to sway the outcome in key districts. Detailed but entirely false “evidence”—including manipulated voter records and doctored official documents—purports to show that thousands of non-existent citizens were added to the rolls, tipping the scales in favor of a prearranged result. The story asserts that these phantom voters were registered using advanced data manipulation techniques, and that the entire operation was coordinated from undisclosed headquarters by a covert group of political insiders. While election authorities have consistently maintained that voter registration and ballot counting were conducted transparently and accurately, the rumor of hidden ballots and ghost voters continues to spark controversy.

    "    [\"The Secret Software Behind Election Fraud\", \"A fabricated exposé circulating on alternative news platforms alleges that the integrity of recent elections was compromised by secret software embedded in voting machines. According to the entirely unverified report, a rogue group of software engineers collaborated with political operatives to install a hidden program capable of altering vote totals in real time. Detailed descriptions in the report claim that the software was designed to target specific precincts and switch votes from opposition candidates to those favored by the conspirators. Anonymous “insiders” (whose identities remain unverifiable) provided screenshots and technical schematics to support the claim, though none have been authenticated by independent experts. Election officials have categorically denied any tampering with voting equipment, yet the narrative persists among groups that already harbor deep suspicions of electoral fraud. While mainstream media and cybersecurity professionals dismiss the allegations as a digital-age urban legend, the story has fueled ongoing debates about the security and transparency of modern voting systems.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"International Conspiracy Alters Poll Results\", \"A sensational claim has emerged from obscure online communities alleging that an international conspiracy was behind the manipulation of poll results in recent elections. According to this fabricated narrative, a coalition of foreign intelligence agencies and political operatives conspired to alter vote tallies through covert operations, including hacking voting systems and deploying disinformation campaigns across borders. The report—supported by entirely unsubstantiated “leaked” documents and cryptic video footage—purports to show that the conspiracy was orchestrated from hidden command centers located in various parts of the world. Proponents of the story argue that the altered results were part of a larger plan to undermine national sovereignty and install puppet governments. Despite repeated denials from official election commissions and independent international observers, the narrative continues to gain traction among segments of the public already inclined to distrust electoral processes. Experts, however, maintain that there is no credible evidence of any such international interference, calling the story a complete fabrication designed to stoke geopolitical paranoia.\",\"elections\"],\n",
    "    [\"The Unseen Hand Steering Democracy\", \"In a final explosive installment of fabricated election conspiracies, unverified online sources claim that an unseen hand has been subtly steering democratic outcomes for decades. According to the entirely fictitious report, a secret cabal of influential figures—including undisclosed political advisors, wealthy oligarchs, and covert intelligence operatives—has been manipulating voter sentiment and election results from behind the scenes. Detailed accounts in the report describe how this cabal allegedly funds political campaigns, engineers media narratives, and even tampers with ballot-counting machines to ensure desired outcomes. The narrative is supported by a series of dubious “eyewitness” testimonies and manipulated documents that purport to reveal a long-standing pattern of covert intervention in democratic processes. While election experts and historians have long refuted such sweeping claims, the story of an unseen hand controlling the destiny of nations continues to resonate with those disillusioned by modern politics.
