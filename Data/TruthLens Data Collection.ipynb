    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of four categories, based on an adaption of Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 400 pieces of content for each of the 4 categories. The 4 categories chosen are: fabricated content, polarised content, satire, commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|*Misreporting* | *Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification.* | *A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.*|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|*Persuasive information* |*Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda.* |*Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.*|\n",
    "|*Citizen journalism* | *User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias.* |*Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.*|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites or sources for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below."

According to the fabricated narrative, the Phantom Coin was created as a tool to destabilize traditional monetary systems and establish a new world order based on clandestine financial control. Anonymous insiders claim that this digital currency is already in circulation, used to facilitate secret transactions and influence economic policies in various countries. Although mainstream economists and banking authorities have dismissed these assertions as complete fabrications, the idea of a hidden monetary system has fueled heated debates on online forums and in underground economic circles.

    "    [\"Fake Economic Forecasts Uncovered by Investigative Reporters\", \"A recently circulated dossier—allegedly compiled by a group of rogue investigative reporters—claims that some of the world’s most prominent economic forecasts are nothing but elaborate fabrications designed to mislead the public and manipulate market sentiment. According to this entirely fabricated report, influential think tanks and financial institutions have conspired to publish optimistic projections despite mounting evidence of economic instability. The dossier asserts that behind the scenes, a secretive committee of experts is altering data and suppressing negative information to maintain investor confidence and secure lucrative financial deals. Interviews quoted in the dossier (all of which are untraceable) describe how internal memos instruct analysts to “spin the narrative” during times of economic downturn. While mainstream economists and reputable media outlets have thoroughly debunked these claims, the narrative has found traction on social media and alternative news platforms. Critics argue that the story is a carefully constructed piece of misinformation aimed at sowing distrust in established economic institutions and their published forecasts.\",\"economy\"],\n",
    "    [\"Miracle Cure or Conspiracy? The Hidden Truth\", \"A bombshell report circulating in underground online communities alleges that a revolutionary “miracle cure” for multiple chronic illnesses has been discovered in a secret laboratory—but that the cure is being deliberately suppressed by powerful pharmaceutical interests. According to the fabricated narrative, researchers at a clandestine facility in an undisclosed location developed a treatment that can reverse conditions ranging from diabetes to autoimmune disorders. Whistleblowers (whose identities remain unverified) claim that multinational drug companies, fearing a catastrophic loss of profits, have conspired to bury the research and discredit its findings. Detailed, though entirely fictional, documents describe covert meetings between executives and government regulators where plans were hatched to discredit the miracle cure through a series of “controlled clinical failures.” Despite the dramatic claims, no reputable medical journal or regulatory agency has ever confirmed the existence of such a treatment. Nonetheless, the story has ignited fervent discussion among alternative health advocates and conspiracy theorists, with many calling for independent investigations into the alleged cover-up.\",\"health\"],\n",

According to the entirely fabricated account, these covert vaccines were engineered in hidden research facilities and are being distributed covertly alongside routine immunizations. Insiders allege that top government officials have conspired with shadowy biotech firms to implement the program as part of a larger scheme to control public behavior and suppress dissent. Detailed but unverifiable “leaks” include diagrams of nanobot technology and supposed internal memos outlining the project’s phases. Public health authorities and independent scientists have dismissed the claims as absurd and lacking any empirical basis, yet the narrative continues to fuel heated debates online.

According to these unfounded accounts, the so-called outbreak of a novel virus was deliberately invented to enforce draconian public health measures and expand governmental control over citizens’ lives. Fabricated “data” presented in the posts—including manipulated graphs and fake expert testimonies—purports to show that infection rates were grossly exaggerated and that the virus was engineered in a laboratory as part of a secret experiment. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary provided by reputable global health organizations, the narrative has gained traction among communities predisposed to distrust official sources. Detractors of the mainstream narrative argue that the epidemic is a hoax designed to justify unprecedented restrictions on personal freedom.

According to this entirely fabricated narrative, the Directorate operates behind the scenes to determine which diseases receive funding for research and which innovative treatments are suppressed to protect the interests of certain pharmaceutical giants. Leaked “internal documents” (all of which have been debunked by experts) supposedly reveal that this shadow group manipulates clinical trial outcomes and deliberately withholds breakthrough therapies from the public. One supposed insider explained that the Directorate’s ultimate goal is to monopolize global healthcare, ensuring that all new treatments funnel profits exclusively to a handful of powerful corporations.

The story goes on to assert that leading medical experts worldwide have been silenced or coerced into keeping the discovery under wraps, with influential institutions allegedly colluding to protect lucrative existing treatments. Detailed but entirely spurious “research notes” and blurry laboratory images have been circulated to support the claim. Despite the sensational nature of the announcement, no peer-reviewed studies or independent verifications exist to corroborate the story.

According to the fabricated narrative, The Phantom Thief utilizes an intricate network of accomplices and cutting-edge technology to bypass state-of-the-art security systems. Leaked “confidential reports” (entirely unverifiable) claim that the mastermind’s operations are so meticulously planned that law enforcement agencies remain one step behind at every turn. One anonymous tipster described a dramatic scene in which the criminal escaped using an elaborate series of decoys and underground tunnels.

The story details how Digital Dominion supposedly recruits skilled hackers from around the globe, providing them with state-of-the-art tools and secretive training in return for a share of their illicit profits. Leaked “evidence” in the form of anonymized chat logs and cryptic online transactions has fueled speculation about the syndicate’s influence over modern cybercrime. Despite the dramatic claims, no law enforcement agency has confirmed the existence of such an organization, and cybersecurity experts have dismissed the narrative as a myth designed to instill fear.

According to the fabricated report, the star—whose identity remains deliberately vague—has been linked through a series of doctored documents, manipulated photographs, and untraceable phone recordings to an underground network involved in money laundering and arms trafficking. The narrative suggests that the celebrity’s public persona is merely a facade, carefully crafted to conceal a far more sinister involvement in organized crime. Despite the sensational nature of the claim, independent investigations by reputable outlets have found no supporting evidence, and multiple fact-checking organizations have debunked the story as a fabrication. Nonetheless, the tale has ignited fervent debate on social media, with supporters insisting that the “evidence” is being suppressed by powerful interests intent on protecting high-profile figures. Critics argue that the entire narrative is a calculated piece of misinformation designed to smear reputations and distract from real criminal investigations.\",\"crime\"],\n",

Leaked “testimonies” from anonymous ex-criminals (whose identities cannot be confirmed) claim that this code is enforced through a network of vigilante enforcers operating outside the law. The report further asserts that this clandestine system has allowed crime syndicates to thrive, coordinating complex operations such as international drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and high-stakes robberies without fear of exposure. While law enforcement officials have long acknowledged the existence of informal codes among criminals, no evidence has ever substantiated the detailed version of the Code of Shadows described in these posts.

The story describes eerie rituals performed in abandoned warehouses under moonlit skies, where members of these crime families allegedly invoke ancient forces to secure their power and evade capture by authorities. Detailed but entirely fictional accounts include descriptions of cryptic symbols, mysterious chants, and inexplicable phenomena witnessed during criminal operations. While no credible evidence or expert testimony supports any supernatural involvement in crime, the tale has rapidly spread through niche internet forums and alternative news sites.

Leaked “internal communications” (all of which lack any credible origin) detail how this system was deployed during key electoral cycles to produce results favorable to a select group of political elites. The report asserts that the AI not only manipulated vote counts but also fabricated evidence of voter fraud to justify its interference. While election officials and independent watchdog organizations have vehemently denied any involvement of AI in vote manipulation, the narrative has ignited fierce debates online.

Detailed but entirely false “evidence”—including manipulated voter records and doctored official documents—purports to show that thousands of non-existent citizens were added to the rolls, tipping the scales in favor of a prearranged result. The story asserts that these phantom voters were registered using advanced data manipulation techniques, and that the entire operation was coordinated from undisclosed headquarters by a covert group of political insiders.

Anonymous “insiders” (whose identities remain unverifiable) provided screenshots and technical schematics to support the claim, though none have been authenticated by independent experts. Election officials have categorically denied any tampering with voting equipment, yet the narrative persists among groups that already harbor deep suspicions of electoral fraud.

The report—supported by entirely unsubstantiated “leaked” documents and cryptic video footage—purports to show that the conspiracy was orchestrated from hidden command centers located in various parts of the world. Proponents of the story argue that the altered results were part of a larger plan to undermine national sovereignty and install puppet governments. Despite repeated denials from official election commissions and independent international observers, the narrative continues to gain traction among segments of the public already inclined to distrust electoral processes.

Detailed accounts in the report describe how this cabal allegedly funds political campaigns, engineers media narratives, and even tampers with ballot-counting machines to ensure desired outcomes. The narrative is supported by a series of dubious “eyewitness” testimonies and manipulated documents that purport to reveal a long-standing pattern of covert intervention in democratic processes.

Peter Smith atThe New Catallaxynotes: '. . . he who no longer refers to Donald Trump as a despicable human being but who, so far as I can tell, has never apologised for so doing'. Indeed. Non-apologies count. Not in a good way. And are noted. These people are pathetic, really. They are content to be cerebral chin-strokers, while hoisting the white flag. Over and over again. Rod Dreher, a speaker at the ARC conference, summed up one of the key purposes of these events: 'Good morning from London, and the first day of the ARC conference. Big opening dinner for speakers and donors last night; as a speaker, I got to go. Was so, so great to see many old friends there . . . Just now, after breakfast, I walked out of the hotel restaurant, and there sat two of my favorite people in all the world . . . Oh happy day! Oh happy next three days!' Source: Rod Dreher emailed newsletter, February 19, 2025. Fellowship. I get it. All fine and dandy. We all need our mutual support mechanisms. But the line between 'fellowship' (Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, really?) and a dry gulch, an echo chamber, a right-of-centre ghetto, is a fine line indeed. Wonderful speakers at these endless conferences – some of whom I know and like – use beautiful words to make absolutely no impact on their enemies and ours. Douglas Murray left the audience of 4,000 'speechless'. I am sure he did. He is very, very good at this. You might agree with just about everything he said. That isn't the point. To repeat, our enemies are domestic Marxist revolutionaries, post-modernists, woke automatons, Chinese communist imperialists, Muslim colonialists, globalists seated in Europe, corporate fascists, American neocons and British liberal progressives parading in conservative clothes. I am yet to hear a single international conferencer pull all of this together. To address the real meta-problems. I say wonderful speakers. Not all are wonderful, though. Any conference that gives Michael Gove a slot and an invitation cannot be taken seriously. He was a two-timing sneak of a politician and, far worse, a covid criminal. The multi-millionaire who appointed Gove as editor of theSpectatorhappens to be the co-founder and co-owner of ARC, Paul Marshall, who also ownsGB News.The mob who sacked Mark Steyn and Dan Wootton. Neither of these heroes has a place, nor has Kathy Gyngell, myTCWeditor. Bilderberger Niall Ferguson, inevitably. Anyone who is a friend (and biographer) of Henry Kissinger isn't a friend of mine. Beautiful speaker, though. The inevitable Jordan Peterson is there. Both are on ARC'sexclusive Advisory Board. RFK Jr recently said: 'NOTHING is gonna be off-limits.' Source: Ed Dowd's Telegram channel, February 19, 2025. He was referring specifically to chronic disease investigation, but his words refer to much, much more than this. They are a call to action. They resonate. RFK Jr is feared by all the bad guys. Utterly feared. As is Kash Patel. As is Tulsi Gabbard. These people are impactful. Consequential. Far more importantly, they are revolutionary. If our circumstances are as dire as the ARC team suggest, why aren't THESE people there? Oh, of course, they are too busy across the Atlantic, actually doing things. A report intheTelegraphsaw the group as a corrective to the 'chaos' and 'excesses' in American conservatism during the rise ofDonald Trump. Could that still be their real purpose? The ARC has been billed as a right-wing competitor of Davos, no doubt because of its 'global leaders space' recruitment strategy. But those who see here some sort of conference equivalence entirely miss the point. Davos ain't a talkfest. The people who attend the Swiss Alps shindig are bad actors with power who do actually run the world. They are Satan's foot soldiers. Pitting an opposing talkfest against them takes us nowhere. This is a category error. I worked for a quarter of a century in economic development, generally at the local and regional level. I attended many conferences. Endless conferences. You felt good being there. Among friends. Being part of the smart set. But the one great insult across the years was that these endless meet-ups of the great and good, with their well remunerated keynotes, was 'talkfest'. That was always the greatest fear of delegates at these things and of observers. What was it all for? It was, in essence, performative. Process. Part of the deal. It hasn't changed. The sins of the performative conservative conference class are sins of omission, not of commission. I have mentioned the speakers not at the London conference. What about the topics not addressed? Covid: Will any of the speakers there expose the truths daily reported in the alt-media? Will Michael Gove apologise for his covid sins? Will Paul Marshall explain or seek to justify his sacking of Mark Steyn and friends? Nope. Will Niall Ferguson admit that the elites of whom he is a paid-up member admit that his ilk is the problem? The whole problem. The key word is 'smug'. No one suffering under the yoke of tyranny likes smug. They like anger-driven action that will free the oppressed. The grieved outsiders currently feel far more comforted by the 'nothing is gonna be off limits' view of the world articulated so well by RFK Jr and by the sheer determination of those who say it than by champagne swilling, globetrotting conservatives feeling good about life in London. Or in Brisbane. It is time to put a bit of stick about, not just to glory in being right (in both senses of the term). It is an irony that one of the most discussed topics at the London conference has been JD Vance's speech in Munich. Will any of them get the deep point here?</td>\n",

       "      <td>THE relationship between the public, justice, the electorate and the law is getting more complex. Potentially it's been a worse one for the SAS, the Armed Forces and the Defence of the Realm. In an inquest that opened last year, acoroner has ruled that SAS soldiers did not need to use lethal forcein an operation in which four IRA terrorists were killed in 1992. A file is therefore being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Unlesshe does the decent thing and resigns, Lord Hermer, Sir Keir Starmer's human rights lawyer pal, is unlikely to decide either that there is no case to answer (killing armed terrorists being the Army's job) or that it's so long ago that pursuing this is not in the public interest. Harmer might recuse himselfas one of his clients was former head of the IRA Gerry Adams. Don't hold your breath. Let's look at the facts, from the ground up. The rules of engagement for soldiers in Northern Ireland came from Parliament and were known as 'The Yellow Card' after the card carried and learned by rote by every soldier in the province. Soldiers in Northern Ireland had no more rights than a private citizen, so the provisions of the Yellow Card were pretty clear. Essentially soldiers were allowed to open fire on terrorists who were about to commit, were committing or had recently committed a terrorist act and there was no other way to stop them. Warnings were mandatory 'before opening fire unless . . . to do so would increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other person'. The Yellow Card never had statutory authority; soldiers who killed terrorists were subject to arrest and interrogation by local police to determine whether they had committed a crime. Read that again: any soldier who had just shot and killed a terrorist to protect you was almost immediately arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, or worse. Why? Because although the government sent him to uphold the law with a loaded rifle it didn't give him any special rights to use it. At one time during the Troubles soldiers were so concerned at the immediate consequences of shooting that they were failing to open fire at legitimate targets. The fundamental question for the soldier was 'Do I shoot now?' Confronting an armed terrorist, the soldier was making this decision under mortal peril and with massive time pressure. Arresting an armed terrorist – also in fear of his life – is far from straightforward. As there is no requirement in common or military law for soldiers recklessly to risk their life, taking the shot is usually the right answer. If they don't shoot the terrorist survives to kill, bomb and maim the public again. In this action four IRA men were returning to waiting getaway cars after an attack on the Coalisland police station; a total of ten IRA men were there. An SAS unit was waiting for them and they engaged the IRA men without warning. The four who attacked the police station were killed and three of the others were wounded. There is no doubt that the dead men were armed IRA terrorists. There is evidence that some of the dead were killed at close range when they were on the ground, having already been hit by multiple bullets. So what? The decision to kill them had been made when the first round was fired. Armed men are a lethal threat and, unlike in the movies, a hail of bullets seldom delivers instant death. A dying terrorist may have a grenade in his pocket, so he's still a threat to the soldier and his colleagues. A firefight and its aftermath are no place for the squeamish. The salient point is whether the 12 SAS soldiers opening fire believed they could find any way of arresting ten IRA men, at least four of whom were armed, at night in hostile territory. Clearly they thought not, hence they engaged. On the evidence before him the coroner thought differently, as is his right – indeed his duty.Last year he found that a similar action in 1991 which killed three IRA men was lawful. His independence is not in question, it's the law itself that is wrong. Now, 33 years later, the SAS men potentially face a criminal trial. Notwithstanding the coroner's opinion, that result seems wrong – 96 per cent of those polled by theTelegraphopposed it. At the time there was little sympathy for the IRA men outside the Irish Republican and Nationalist movements. The public were hugely supportive of the SAS and the armed forces then, as they are now. The law, as created by a selection of politicians of all parties over almost half a century, has failed. It's not just the elite SAS that are being failed, it's every serviceman and woman, and indeed the society they seek to defend. The deficiencies in the legal status of the combatants in the Ulster Troubles were known since it began. The failure to find an end to the arguments when peace came was rank moral cowardice that is all too typical of Westminster. In 2023 the Conservatives belatedly introduced the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to prevent this sort of prosecution. The Labour Party had a manifesto commitment to repealing it, because the High Court has found it in contradiction to, you guessed it, the European Convention on Human Rights. Hilary Benn is proud of introducing the repeal Act. When pressed, the likes of Hilary Benn, Lord Hermer and Two-Tier will say that the UK leaving the ECHR would send the wrong message to the world and damage our international reputation. They may go on and say that countries such as Russia aren't members of the ECHR. That entire argument is complete cant; it may make sense in a university debating club or over a glass of champagne in Matrix Chambers, but it's balderdash. The list of countries not in the ECHR incudes the United States, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai – all top destinations for the wealthy fleeing the UK. One of the most powerful messages we sent to the world was when the SAS emerged from obscurity and ended the Iranian Embassy siege. The message was stark and clear: 'The UK does not deal with terrorists.' International terrorists steered well clear of us and the UK became a valued partner in the establishment of SAS-like units across the world. (Note for Lammy: that's what soft power looks like. It comes from having a very competent military that is feared globally, so other nations tread softly round your interests and seek your friendship.) Now Labour wants to throw the SAS and the rest of the armed forces under a legal bus rather than support them. It was a manifesto commitment in the general election, but no one noticed or kicked up about it. Why? Because the self-appointed intellectual elite wanted a left-wing coup – which is what the election turned out to be. Ex-KGB man President Putin must have laughed when the left triumphed here in July. Sixty years of sedition (the KGB's speciality) may have paid off too late for the Soviet Union, but it's done for us.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WARS are so inconvenient, especially when they hamper the efforts of the public health lobby to eradicate the latest killer disease. Recently in our favourite source of manufactured anxiety about all things pandemicky,Global Health Now, there was a link to an article inThe East Africanunder the heading 'Conflict in the eastern DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] hampers fight against mpox'. The source of the news report was the XinHua News Agency, the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. Where accurate reporting on viruses is concerned, surely nothing can be read into that. Proving that monkeypox continues to be an epidemiological nonentity, as we have been at pains to point out in these pages for several years, for examplehere, the report says that this year alone in Africa diagnoses with monkeypox have surpassed 9,959 (so is that 9,960?) and deaths total 85. That puts the infection fatality rate of monkeypox at less than 1 per cent and an infection rate across Sub Saharan Africa (population 1,243,107,741) at 0.000081 per cent. Even if the figures applied only to the DRC (population 102.3million) the infection rate is 0.0097 per cent. Juxtapose that with the fact that fighting in the Congo has alreadyclaimed 700 livesthis year. Of course, death from an infectious virus is no laughing matter and monkeypox looks like a nasty infection to contract. However, in the developed world it is almost totally confined to gay men. In fact in the DCR, where most cases are reported, over 83% of monkeypox casesare linked to sex workand disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. It should also be considered, in relation to figures related to monkeypox from the DRC, that malnutrition is endemic there which puts people at greater risk of succumbing. According to theGlobal Hunger Index, the DRC scores fifth with Somalia in first place.Pregnant women and children are at most risk of malnutritionin the DRC. Fit and healthy people experience mild symptoms with little to fear from monkeypox. Even our own NHS, no stranger to whipping us into a frenzy about viral infections as with the recent 'quad-demic' which seems to have left most of us standing,says that monkeypox'is usually mild and can get better within a few weeks without treatment'. People in the DRC need food yet the WHO response to monkeypox is to push vaccines which, they say, are 'at the heart' of their response. That presumably includes monkeypox vaccines for babies which are being rolled outwithout clinical trials. After all, what could possibly go wrong? GAVI, otherwise known asThe Vaccine Alliance, are responsible for the distribution of vaccines in the DRC. They get their funding from many sources and they are closely linked to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation which recently, along with the European Union, hosted a 'high level pledging summit' seeking funding from governments and 'Billanthropists' for the work of GAVI. GAVI, which hasreceived over $4.1billionfrom the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation provides, along with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,18 per cent of the funding of the World Health Organization. The Foundation has a permanent seat on the board of GAVI. Clearly, such funding does not come without a few chains attached. According to the Gates Foundation,vaccines have become their biggest investment, raising the question of whether Gates expects a financial return on his investment. With79 per cent of the Gates Foundation stock holdings being in biotech companies, which manufacture vaccines, the Foundation has a vested interest in pushing vaccines worldwide. They did this effectively during the covid fiasco. Perhaps Bill Gates has enough money and is simply addicted to the power that vast wealth and philanthropy can buy. One thing is for sure, as explained by Daniel Jupp in his bookGates of Hell: despite his self-proclaimed efforts to give away his fortune, Bill Gates miraculously seems to get no poorer. Whatever happens in the world, people like Bill Gates continue to profit from the cycle of hysteria induced over non-existent pandemics: Gates invests in vaccine manufacture; Gates funds GAVI and the WHO; the WHOapproves and pushes vaccines; GAVI ensures that the vaccines are distributed and governments buy them; vaccine companies make money; Gates (probably) earns a return on his investment; Gates invests in vaccine manufacture . . . repeat. Monkeypox is simply the latest vector for vaccine-derived profit and the poor people of the DRC are simply the latest victims of the scam. I repeat: the people of the DRC need food, not vaccines.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WHETHER Donald Trump carries out his threat that the US willtake back control of the Panama Canal– a warning he reinforced in his inauguration speech on January 20 – remains to be seen. Being partially of Scottish descent, perhaps he should be wary of venturing there; 326 years ago, the Isthmus of Panama saw one of the most woeful chapters in Scottish history unfold: the Darien Scheme. The ill-fated project was Scotland's attempt to break away from England's economic dominance and establish its own overseas empire. A company of investors was formed to found a colony, which would be named Caledonia, near the Gulf of Darien on the Caribbean/Atlantic Coast of the isthmus, about 200 miles east of today's Panama Canal. The ambitious aim was to open a land link to the Pacific Ocean, around 50 miles away. The investors envisaged establishing a thriving trade route across the isthmus, with a town to be called New Edinburgh as the entrepôt where tariffs would be charged. Gold mines and fertile plantations would add to the riches, and the wealth would flow back to Scotland. Instead, the dream died a squalid death in the swampy, rain-lashed, disease-ridden jungles of the isthmus, along with around 2,000 would-be colonists. There are several excellent books about Darien. One of the most accessible and comprehensive accounts is John Prebble'sDarien: The Scottish Dream of Empire(first published in 1968 asThe Darien Disaster). Prebble explains how the scheme came about at the end of the 17th century, amid the Scottish establishment's simmering resentment of England. Although both nations had shared a monarch since 1603, Scotland, which still had its own parliament and laws, was very much the poor relation. It languished under England's Navigation Acts, which crippled its seaborne commerce, whilst bad harvests and drought brought famine. The country was in an ever-deepening slough of despond. The initial driving force behind the Darien Scheme was William Paterson, a wealthy Scottish-born financier and trader who co-founded the Bank of England in 1694. He helped to form the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to promote the project. However, its attempts to set up a base in London were thwarted by the East India Company and garnered the disapproval of the King, William III. William did not want to risk war with Spain, which claimed sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama as part of its lucrative empire in the New World. In response, the Scottish company retreated to Edinburgh and made a public appeal for investors. The response was astonishing and, within weeks, around 1,500 Scots had raised £400,000, which was around 20 per cent of the wealth available in Scotland and equivalent to some £66million today. On July 14, 1698, five ships, carrying 1,200 pioneer colonists, set sail from Leith. The expedition was shambolic from the start. Beset by storms, fog and becalming, the fleet did not reach the Orkneys until early August. When it finally headed west into the Atlantic, there was a snag – no one knew exactly where Darien was. It was not until they reached the West Indies that they met up with an old buccaneer who agreed to guide them. Meanwhile, deaths began mounting from the bloody flux and fever. The fleet reached Darien on November 2 and, at first, it looked like the paradise they had envisaged. From an anchorage in a sheltered bay, the colonists went ashore and started clearing land for growing crops and building New Edinburgh in the form of wooden huts. However, planting proved difficult, and the tropical heat and incessant heavy rainfall made conditions intolerable (Darien is one of the wettest places on Earth). The local native Kuna (or Guna) tribes were friendly and brought gifts of plantains and fruit, but they were unwilling to buy the combs, mirrors and other trinkets the colonists had brought as trade goods. Meanwhile, King William had ordered the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean not to supply the Scots or give them help of any sort. Ships of other nations which occasionally anchored at Darien would only trade food and other supplies for gold, which the colonists did not have. To make matters worse, the leading colonists soon split into squabbling factions, the main division being between seamen and landsmen. The sailors lived aboard the ships in relative comfort and safety while the rest faced the brutal environment of the rainforest. Eventually, food began running out, as supplies that had been stored aboard the ships for months were rancid. Rationing was imposed, with colonists each getting just one pound of maggot-infested flour per week, but only those who could work were fed. As tropical fevers and malaria struck the starving hordes, deaths continued to mount; by Christmas Day, the total was 76 and, by March, there were 200 graves, with ten or 12 deaths per day. There was a brief moment of elation when Spanish troops were repelled in a jungle skirmish, but the fear of a stronger attack and the deteriorating conditions led to the colony being abandoned on June 18, 1699, leaving behind a cemetery with 400 graves. At least another 400 colonists died trying to get back to Scotland. Only one ship, theCaledonia, made it, arriving in November with just 300 men aboard. A second fleet of four ships, not knowing of the abandonment, had already been sent out to Darien three months earlier, carrying 1,300 people. Before they arrived on November 30, 160 had died en route. Expecting to be greeted by a thriving colony, one of the new arrivals wrote: 'We found nothing but a vast howling wilderness.' After coming under siege from the Spaniards, the colonists agreed to leave Darien, and it was finally abandoned on April 11, 1700. None of the ships returned to Scotland, with hundreds of those aboard dying en route to Jamaica, where they were refused help, or to the North American colonies. In all, around 1,000 are thought to have perished through sickness and shipwreck. Scotland's vision of a bounteous empire had turned to dust, and the recriminations were rancorous. The returned colonists were reviled as cowards, riots ensued, and those who had sunk their money into the scheme angrily counted the cost. Scapegoats were sought and in a scandalous act of vengeance, three innocent English sailors were hanged in Leith on a fabricated charge of piracy in April 1705. The collapse of the Darien Scheme is said to have helped push Scotland into signing the Acts of Union with England in 1707. One provision of the treaty was that Scotland would be paid a sum called 'The Equivalent' (£398,085) which would essentially repay the Darien investors their capital, plus five per cent interest. Today, New Edinburgh has been reclaimed by the jungle and the mangrove swamps; all that remains of it is a shallow defensive ditch dug by the colonists. There was some morsel of memory in that the bay where the fleet first arrived was known as Puerto Escocés (Scottish Harbour), but that has been renamed Sukunya Inabaginya in honour of a Panamanian general. However, all is not lost. In the nearby San Blas archipelago, the inhabitants have renamed theirsmall island Caledonia, in honour of the Scots who had arrived with such high hopes and left amid such heartbreaking failure.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We make no apologies for publishing a further response to JD Vance's seminal, possibly epoch-changing speech to EU leaders in Munich last Friday. On Sunday Dr Frederick Attenboroughrelayed the Vice President'sdevastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its Europeanallies. YesterdaySean Walsh analysed Vance's 'massacre'of the Euro commissars and their British counterparts. Today, from the USA, we have a vote of thanks from British-born Bernard Carpenter along with his excoriation of the outraged legacy media's response. THANK you, thank you, thank you so much, Vice President Vance, for expressing what so many ordinary Europeans feel. Your recent speech at the Munich Security Conference might have upset a few elitists but gave great pleasure to those who love free speech and freedom of conscience on both sides of the Atlantic and offered hope to those feeling crushed by open borders and the social pathologies to which mass immigration gives rise. Thank you, too, for giving permission to those who lament the demise of their national cultures and the Western/Christian civilisation which once gave a sense of common heritage and belonging to a continent that created the modern world. The horror on the faces of those gathered to hear the speech was a sight for sore eyes, a delicious pleasure for those of us who are supposed to keep our mouths shut and go along with all the woke nonsense for fear of being labelled as one of the myriad terms ending in 'ist'. How lovely it was to see those smug, holier-than-thou, highly credentialled, gilt-edged globalist aristocrats looking so outraged. How dare a man who grew up in poverty in the Appalachian Rust Belt have the temerity to lecture so august a body of technocrats on subjects such as the freedom of citizens to criticise their lords and masters and reject the godless ideologies they foist on those they govern? But dare he did and many here in America and in Europe are loving him for it. Needless to say, not all welcomed his speech. The legacy media reacted as you would expect.'Vance shocks Europe', blasted America's newspaper of record, theNew York Times, accusing him of defending 'a divisive far-right political party in Germany', presumably AfD (Alternative for Germany), although Vance did not mention it by name. Incidentally, which Europe is Vance accused of shocking – anti-mass-immigration Eastern Europe, the Europe of men and women struggling to make a living, fearful to go out at night due to high rates of crime, people who fear being arrested for posting on social media or expressing their Christian faith, Europeans who resent the rewriting of their histories and are deeply troubled by the rubbishing of their distinctive cultures, Jews compelled to hide their identity on the streets of European capitals due to rising rates of anti-Semitism? Surely none of those just listed. It goes without saying that it has in mind the Europe of technocratic elites who are now determining the fate of a once great civilisation according to their godless visions of utilitarian dystopias 'made more sinister', to quote Churchill, 'and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science'. Elsewhere in the paper, Vance is accused of 'attacking a German consensus on Nazis and speech . . . decades-long approaches to political extremism that were designed to prevent another Hitler'. CNN seeks to indict him for dealing in 'half-truths' and trying to reignite popularism in Europe, as if it needs any help from American politicians, but seriously undermines its journalistic authority when it describes the electoral disaster that the British Conservative Party suffered last year as proof that populism is past its peak in a Europe which is 'a little wiser now' than it was during Trump's first administration. If the Conservative Party is an example of populism, then I'm in line to become the next living prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When it comes to the legacy media and their negative reactions to Vance's Munich speech, I could go on and on. It seems to have offended all the right people, theGuardianleading with the hysterical headline:'JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe's leaders'. The BBC even used the adjective'weird'to attack the speech, dusting off a word which was used to attack Trump and Vance last summer. It didn't work then, and it's unlikely to work now. The BBC at least got it right when it said that Vance'accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech', but failed to consider the veracity of his accusation. Before I finish, allow me to list some of my thoughts on the now-infamous speech and why I and many others loved it. I loved it because Vance mentioned specific examples of how ordinary men and women have been negatively affected by their governments' authoritarian tendencies, people who have fallen foul of hate-speech laws that should have no place in a democratic society. Of course, such a list could become very long indeed, as we've seen over the last 20 years or so. But by naming people such as Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of praying outside an abortion clinic in my home town of Bournemouth, and alluding to other examples of those prosecuted for exercising their God-given rights to express themselves freely, Vance has put a face on this Orwellian evil. Above all, I loved his speech because he articulated what millions of Europeans are thinking but are too cowed by the increasingly authoritarian administrative state to express themselves for fear of the very real possibility of punitive consequences. And, my dear elites, stop using fear of another Hitler as an excuse to stifle free speech. Arresting people who criticise feminism or tell tasteless jokes will do nothing to prevent the return of fascism, but unrestricted immigration and draconian restrictions on free speech will drive decent men and women into the arms of those on the supposedly 'far right' that the left claims to be the greatest existing threat to liberal democracy at a time when Europe is importing millions of immigrants who despise everything liberal democracy claims to stand for. The spell has been broken, and we must be grateful to Vice President Vance for making that clear to those assembled in Munich to hear him speak so plainly and so forcefully.</td>\n",

The first is thecurrent conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, otherwise known as ARC, foundedin June 2023. They meet in Londonistan. The second is the forthcoming Church and State conferencecoming soon to Brisbane. When funky acronyms, slick websites and bells and whistles arrive, you think: Hmm. Not to mention the comfortable on-stage couches and the being-among-friends vibe. And no room for 'deplorables' at £1,500 a throw, I'm told was the price of a ticket – with a £400 discount offered to people ARC wanted there, the rumour mill has it. The comfort of being right (in both senses of the term) without actually moving the needle. The contrast can be found in JD Vance, speaking truth to power in the den of his (and our) enemies in Munich. His harsh words about his audience of European globalist establishment grifters have gone around the world several times. They suggest bravura, intent, action, steely composure, truth and . . . Donald Trump, the figure that still makes many staid comfort-conservatives clench the buttocks. There is no greater exemplar of the performative conservative class than Greg Sheridan ofThe Australian. Peter Smith atThe New Catallaxynotes: '. . . he who no longer refers to Donald Trump as a despicable human being but who, so far as I can tell, has never apologised for so doing'. Indeed. Non-apologies count. Not in a good way. And are noted. These people are pathetic, really. They are content to be cerebral chin-strokers, while hoisting the white flag. Over and over again. Rod Dreher, a speaker at the ARC conference, summed up one of the key purposes of these events: 'Good morning from London, and the first day of the ARC conference. Big opening dinner for speakers and donors last night; as a speaker, I got to go. Was so, so great to see many old friends there . . . Just now, after breakfast, I walked out of the hotel restaurant, and there sat two of my favorite people in all the world . . . Oh happy day! Oh happy next three days!' Source: Rod Dreher emailed newsletter, February 19, 2025. Fellowship. I get it. All fine and dandy. We all need our mutual support mechanisms. But the line between 'fellowship' (Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, really?) and a dry gulch, an echo chamber, a right-of-centre ghetto, is a fine line indeed. Wonderful speakers at these endless conferences – some of whom I know and like – use beautiful words to make absolutely no impact on their enemies and ours. Douglas Murray left the audience of 4,000 'speechless'. I am sure he did. He is very, very good at this. You might agree with just about everything he said. That isn't the point. To repeat, our enemies are domestic Marxist revolutionaries, post-modernists, woke automatons, Chinese communist imperialists, Muslim colonialists, globalists seated in Europe, corporate fascists, American neocons and British liberal progressives parading in conservative clothes. I am yet to hear a single international conferencer pull all of this together. To address the real meta-problems. I say wonderful speakers. Not all are wonderful, though. Any conference that gives Michael Gove a slot and an invitation cannot be taken seriously. He was a two-timing sneak of a politician and, far worse, a covid criminal. The multi-millionaire who appointed Gove as editor of theSpectatorhappens to be the co-founder and co-owner of ARC, Paul Marshall, who also ownsGB News.The mob who sacked Mark Steyn and Dan Wootton. Neither of these heroes has a place, nor has Kathy Gyngell, myTCWeditor. Bilderberger Niall Ferguson, inevitably. Anyone who is a friend (and biographer) of Henry Kissinger isn't a friend of mine. Beautiful speaker, though. The inevitable Jordan Peterson is there. Both are on ARC'sexclusive Advisory Board. RFK Jr recently said: 'NOTHING is gonna be off-limits.' Source: Ed Dowd's Telegram channel, February 19, 2025. He was referring specifically to chronic disease investigation, but his words refer to much, much more than this. They are a call to action. They resonate. RFK Jr is feared by all the bad guys. Utterly feared. As is Kash Patel. As is Tulsi Gabbard. These people are impactful. Consequential. Far more importantly, they are revolutionary. If our circumstances are as dire as the ARC team suggest, why aren't THESE people there? Oh, of course, they are too busy across the Atlantic, actually doing things. A report intheTelegraphsaw the group as a corrective to the 'chaos' and 'excesses' in American conservatism during the rise ofDonald Trump. Could that still be their real purpose? The ARC has been billed as a right-wing competitor of Davos, no doubt because of its 'global leaders space' recruitment strategy. But those who see here some sort of conference equivalence entirely miss the point. Davos ain't a talkfest. The people who attend the Swiss Alps shindig are bad actors with power who do actually run the world. They are Satan's foot soldiers. Pitting an opposing talkfest against them takes us nowhere. This is a category error. I worked for a quarter of a century in economic development, generally at the local and regional level. I attended many conferences. Endless conferences. You felt good being there. Among friends. Being part of the smart set. But the one great insult across the years was that these endless meet-ups of the great and good, with their well remunerated keynotes, was 'talkfest'. That was always the greatest fear of delegates at these things and of observers. What was it all for? It was, in essence, performative. Process. Part of the deal. It hasn't changed. The sins of the performative conservative conference class are sins of omission, not of commission. I have mentioned the speakers not at the London conference. What about the topics not addressed? Covid: Will any of the speakers there expose the truths daily reported in the alt-media? Will Michael Gove apologise for his covid sins? Will Paul Marshall explain or seek to justify his sacking of Mark Steyn and friends? Nope. Will Niall Ferguson admit that the elites of whom he is a paid-up member admit that his ilk is the problem? The whole problem. The key word is 'smug'. No one suffering under the yoke of tyranny likes smug. They like anger-driven action that will free the oppressed. The grieved outsiders currently feel far more comforted by the 'nothing is gonna be off limits' view of the world articulated so well by RFK Jr and by the sheer determination of those who say it than by champagne swilling, globetrotting conservatives feeling good about life in London. Or in Brisbane. It is time to put a bit of stick about, not just to glory in being right (in both senses of the term). It is an irony that one of the most discussed topics at the London conference has been JD Vance's speech in Munich. Will any of them get the deep point here?   \n",
       "1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        THE relationship between the public, justice, the electorate and the law is getting more complex. Potentially it's been a worse one for the SAS, the Armed Forces and the Defence of the Realm. In an inquest that opened last year, acoroner has ruled that SAS soldiers did not need to use lethal forcein an operation in which four IRA terrorists were killed in 1992. A file is therefore being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Unlesshe does the decent thing and resigns, Lord Hermer, Sir Keir Starmer's human rights lawyer pal, is unlikely to decide either that there is no case to answer (killing armed terrorists being the Army's job) or that it's so long ago that pursuing this is not in the public interest. Harmer might recuse himselfas one of his clients was former head of the IRA Gerry Adams. Don't hold your breath. Let's look at the facts, from the ground up. The rules of engagement for soldiers in Northern Ireland came from Parliament and were known as 'The Yellow Card' after the card carried and learned by rote by every soldier in the province. Soldiers in Northern Ireland had no more rights than a private citizen, so the provisions of the Yellow Card were pretty clear. Essentially soldiers were allowed to open fire on terrorists who were about to commit, were committing or had recently committed a terrorist act and there was no other way to stop them. Warnings were mandatory 'before opening fire unless . . . to do so would increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other person'. The Yellow Card never had statutory authority; soldiers who killed terrorists were subject to arrest and interrogation by local police to determine whether they had committed a crime. Read that again: any soldier who had just shot and killed a terrorist to protect you was almost immediately arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, or worse. Why? Because although the government sent him to uphold the law with a loaded rifle it didn't give him any special rights to use it. At one time during the Troubles soldiers were so concerned at the immediate consequences of shooting that they were failing to open fire at legitimate targets. The fundamental question for the soldier was 'Do I shoot now?' Confronting an armed terrorist, the soldier was making this decision under mortal peril and with massive time pressure. Arresting an armed terrorist – also in fear of his life – is far from straightforward. As there is no requirement in common or military law for soldiers recklessly to risk their life, taking the shot is usually the right answer. If they don't shoot the terrorist survives to kill, bomb and maim the public again. In this action four IRA men were returning to waiting getaway cars after an attack on the Coalisland police station; a total of ten IRA men were there. An SAS unit was waiting for them and they engaged the IRA men without warning. The four who attacked the police station were killed and three of the others were wounded. There is no doubt that the dead men were armed IRA terrorists. There is evidence that some of the dead were killed at close range when they were on the ground, having already been hit by multiple bullets. So what? The decision to kill them had been made when the first round was fired. Armed men are a lethal threat and, unlike in the movies, a hail of bullets seldom delivers instant death. A dying terrorist may have a grenade in his pocket, so he's still a threat to the soldier and his colleagues. A firefight and its aftermath are no place for the squeamish. The salient point is whether the 12 SAS soldiers opening fire believed they could find any way of arresting ten IRA men, at least four of whom were armed, at night in hostile territory. Clearly they thought not, hence they engaged. On the evidence before him the coroner thought differently, as is his right – indeed his duty.Last year he found that a similar action in 1991 which killed three IRA men was lawful. His independence is not in question, it's the law itself that is wrong. Now, 33 years later, the SAS men potentially face a criminal trial. Notwithstanding the coroner's opinion, that result seems wrong – 96 per cent of those polled by theTelegraphopposed it. At the time there was little sympathy for the IRA men outside the Irish Republican and Nationalist movements. The public were hugely supportive of the SAS and the armed forces then, as they are now. The law, as created by a selection of politicians of all parties over almost half a century, has failed. It's not just the elite SAS that are being failed, it's every serviceman and woman, and indeed the society they seek to defend. The deficiencies in the legal status of the combatants in the Ulster Troubles were known since it began. The failure to find an end to the arguments when peace came was rank moral cowardice that is all too typical of Westminster. In 2023 the Conservatives belatedly introduced the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to prevent this sort of prosecution. The Labour Party had a manifesto commitment to repealing it, because the High Court has found it in contradiction to, you guessed it, the European Convention on Human Rights. Hilary Benn is proud of introducing the repeal Act. When pressed, the likes of Hilary Benn, Lord Hermer and Two-Tier will say that the UK leaving the ECHR would send the wrong message to the world and damage our international reputation. They may go on and say that countries such as Russia aren't members of the ECHR. That entire argument is complete cant; it may make sense in a university debating club or over a glass of champagne in Matrix Chambers, but it's balderdash. The list of countries not in the ECHR incudes the United States, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai – all top destinations for the wealthy fleeing the UK. One of the most powerful messages we sent to the world was when the SAS emerged from obscurity and ended the Iranian Embassy siege. The message was stark and clear: 'The UK does not deal with terrorists.' International terrorists steered well clear of us and the UK became a valued partner in the establishment of SAS-like units across the world. (Note for Lammy: that's what soft power looks like. It comes from having a very competent military that is feared globally, so other nations tread softly round your interests and seek your friendship.) Now Labour wants to throw the SAS and the rest of the armed forces under a legal bus rather than support them. It was a manifesto commitment in the general election, but no one noticed or kicked up about it. Why? Because the self-appointed intellectual elite wanted a left-wing coup – which is what the election turned out to be. Ex-KGB man President Putin must have laughed when the left triumphed here in July. Sixty years of sedition (the KGB's speciality) may have paid off too late for the Soviet Union, but it's done for us.   \n",

Recently in our favourite source of manufactured anxiety about all things pandemicky,Global Health Now, there was a link to an article inThe East Africanunder the heading 'Conflict in the eastern DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] hampers fight against mpox'. The source of the news report was the XinHua News Agency, the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. Where accurate reporting on viruses is concerned, surely nothing can be read into that. Proving that monkeypox continues to be an epidemiological nonentity, as we have been at pains to point out in these pages for several years, for examplehere, the report says that this year alone in Africa diagnoses with monkeypox have surpassed 9,959 (so is that 9,960?) and deaths total 85. That puts the infection fatality rate of monkeypox at less than 1 per cent and an infection rate across Sub Saharan Africa (population 1,243,107,741) at 0.000081 per cent. Even if the figures applied only to the DRC (population 102.3million) the infection rate is 0.0097 per cent. Juxtapose that with the fact that fighting in the Congo has alreadyclaimed 700 livesthis year. Of course, death from an infectious virus is no laughing matter and monkeypox looks like a nasty infection to contract. However, in the developed world it is almost totally confined to gay men. In fact in the DCR, where most cases are reported, over 83% of monkeypox casesare linked to sex workand disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. It should also be considered, in relation to figures related to monkeypox from the DRC, that malnutrition is endemic there which puts people at greater risk of succumbing. According to theGlobal Hunger Index, the DRC scores fifth with Somalia in first place.Pregnant women and children are at most risk of malnutritionin the DRC. Fit and healthy people experience mild symptoms with little to fear from monkeypox. Even our own NHS, no stranger to whipping us into a frenzy about viral infections as with the recent 'quad-demic' which seems to have left most of us standing,says that monkeypox'is usually mild and can get better within a few weeks without treatment'. People in the DRC need food yet the WHO response to monkeypox is to push vaccines which, they say, are 'at the heart' of their response. That presumably includes monkeypox vaccines for babies which are being rolled outwithout clinical trials. After all, what could possibly go wrong? GAVI, otherwise known asThe Vaccine Alliance, are responsible for the distribution of vaccines in the DRC. They get their funding from many sources and they are closely linked to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which recently, along with the European Union, hosted a 'high level pledging summit' seeking funding from governments and 'Billanthropists' for the work of GAVI. GAVI, which hasreceived over $4.1billionfrom the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides, along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,18 per cent of the funding of the World Health Organization. The Foundation has a permanent seat on the board of GAVI. Clearly, such funding does not come without a few chains attached. According to the Gates Foundation,vaccines have become their biggest investment, raising the question of whether Gates expects a financial return on his investment. With79 per cent of the Gates Foundation stock holdings being in biotech companies, which manufacture vaccines, the Foundation has a vested interest in pushing vaccines worldwide. They did this effectively during the covid fiasco. Perhaps Bill Gates has enough money and is simply addicted to the power that vast wealth and philanthropy can buy. One thing is for sure, as explained by Daniel Jupp in his bookGates of Hell: despite his self-proclaimed efforts to give away his fortune, Bill Gates miraculously seems to get no poorer. Whatever happens in the world, people like Bill Gates continue to profit from the cycle of hysteria induced over non-existent pandemics: Gates invests in vaccine manufacture; Gates funds GAVI and the WHO; the WHOapproves and pushes vaccines; GAVI ensures that the vaccines are distributed and governments buy them; vaccine companies make money; Gates (probably) earns a return on his investment; Gates invests in vaccine manufacture . . . repeat. Monkeypox is simply the latest vector for vaccine-derived profit and the poor people of the DRC are simply the latest victims of the scam. I repeat: the people of the DRC need food, not vaccines.   \n",
       "3  WHETHER Donald Trump carries out his threat that the US willtake back control of the Panama Canal– a warning he reinforced in his inauguration speech on January 20 – remains to be seen. Being partially of Scottish descent, perhaps he should be wary of venturing there; 326 years ago, the Isthmus of Panama saw one of the most woeful chapters in Scottish history unfold: the Darien Scheme. The ill-fated project was Scotland's attempt to break away from England's economic dominance and establish its own overseas empire. A company of investors was formed to found a colony, which would be named Caledonia, near the Gulf of Darien on the Caribbean/Atlantic Coast of the isthmus, about 200 miles east of today's Panama Canal. The ambitious aim was to open a land link to the Pacific Ocean, around 50 miles away. The investors envisaged establishing a thriving trade route across the isthmus, with a town to be called New Edinburgh as the entrepôt where tariffs would be charged. Gold mines and fertile plantations would add to the riches, and the wealth would flow back to Scotland. Instead, the dream died a squalid death in the swampy, rain-lashed, disease-ridden jungles of the isthmus, along with around 2,000 would-be colonists. There are several excellent books about Darien. One of the most accessible and comprehensive accounts is John Prebble'sDarien: The Scottish Dream of Empire(first published in 1968 asThe Darien Disaster). Prebble explains how the scheme came about at the end of the 17th century, amid the Scottish establishment's simmering resentment of England. Although both nations had shared a monarch since 1603, Scotland, which still had its own parliament and laws, was very much the poor relation. It languished under England's Navigation Acts, which crippled its seaborne commerce, whilst bad harvests and drought brought famine. The country was in an ever-deepening slough of despond. The initial driving force behind the Darien Scheme was William Paterson, a wealthy Scottish-born financier and trader who co-founded the Bank of England in 1694. He helped to form the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to promote the project. However, its attempts to set up a base in London were thwarted by the East India Company and garnered the disapproval of the King, William III. William did not want to risk war with Spain, which claimed sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama as part of its lucrative empire in the New World. In response, the Scottish company retreated to Edinburgh and made a public appeal for investors. The response was astonishing and, within weeks, around 1,500 Scots had raised £400,000, which was around 20 per cent of the wealth available in Scotland and equivalent to some £66million today. On July 14, 1698, five ships, carrying 1,200 pioneer colonists, set sail from Leith. The expedition was shambolic from the start. Beset by storms, fog and becalming, the fleet did not reach the Orkneys until early August. When it finally headed west into the Atlantic, there was a snag – no one knew exactly where Darien was. It was not until they reached the West Indies that they met up with an old buccaneer who agreed to guide them. Meanwhile, deaths began mounting from the bloody flux and fever. The fleet reached Darien on November 2 and, at first, it looked like the paradise they had envisaged. From an anchorage in a sheltered bay, the colonists went ashore and started clearing land for growing crops and building New Edinburgh in the form of wooden huts. However, planting proved difficult, and the tropical heat and incessant heavy rainfall made conditions intolerable (Darien is one of the wettest places on Earth). The local native Kuna (or Guna) tribes were friendly and brought gifts of plantains and fruit, but they were unwilling to buy the combs, mirrors and other trinkets the colonists had brought as trade goods. Meanwhile, King William had ordered the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean not to supply the Scots or give them help of any sort. Ships of other nations which occasionally anchored at Darien would only trade food and other supplies for gold, which the colonists did not have. To make matters worse, the leading colonists soon split into squabbling factions, the main division being between seamen and landsmen. The sailors lived aboard the ships in relative comfort and safety while the rest faced the brutal environment of the rainforest. Eventually, food began running out, as supplies that had been stored aboard the ships for months were rancid. Rationing was imposed, with colonists each getting just one pound of maggot-infested flour per week, but only those who could work were fed. As tropical fevers and malaria struck the starving hordes, deaths continued to mount; by Christmas Day, the total was 76 and, by March, there were 200 graves, with ten or 12 deaths per day. There was a brief moment of elation when Spanish troops were repelled in a jungle skirmish, but the fear of a stronger attack and the deteriorating conditions led to the colony being abandoned on June 18, 1699, leaving behind a cemetery with 400 graves. At least another 400 colonists died trying to get back to Scotland. Only one ship, theCaledonia, made it, arriving in November with just 300 men aboard. A second fleet of four ships, not knowing of the abandonment, had already been sent out to Darien three months earlier, carrying 1,300 people. Before they arrived on November 30, 160 had died en route. Expecting to be greeted by a thriving colony, one of the new arrivals wrote: 'We found nothing but a vast howling wilderness.' After coming under siege from the Spaniards, the colonists agreed to leave Darien, and it was finally abandoned on April 11, 1700. None of the ships returned to Scotland, with hundreds of those aboard dying en route to Jamaica, where they were refused help, or to the North American colonies. In all, around 1,000 are thought to have perished through sickness and shipwreck. Scotland's vision of a bounteous empire had turned to dust, and the recriminations were rancorous. The returned colonists were reviled as cowards, riots ensued, and those who had sunk their money into the scheme angrily counted the cost. Scapegoats were sought and in a scandalous act of vengeance, three innocent English sailors were hanged in Leith on a fabricated charge of piracy in April 1705. The collapse of the Darien Scheme is said to have helped push Scotland into signing the Acts of Union with England in 1707. One provision of the treaty was that Scotland would be paid a sum called 'The Equivalent' (£398,085) which would essentially repay the Darien investors their capital, plus five per cent interest. Today, New Edinburgh has been reclaimed by the jungle and the mangrove swamps; all that remains of it is a shallow defensive ditch dug by the colonists. There was some morsel of memory in that the bay where the fleet first arrived was known as Puerto Escocés (Scottish Harbour), but that has been renamed Sukunya Inabaginya in honour of a Panamanian general. However, all is not lost. In the nearby San Blas archipelago, the inhabitants have renamed theirsmall island Caledonia, in honour of the Scots who had arrived with such high hopes and left amid such heartbreaking failure.   \n",

On Sunday Dr Frederick Attenboroughrelayed the Vice President'sdevastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its Europeanallies. YesterdaySean Walsh analysed Vance's 'massacre'of the Euro commissars and their British counterparts. Today, from the USA, we have a vote of thanks from British-born Bernard Carpenter along with his excoriation of the outraged legacy media's response. THANK you, thank you, thank you so much, Vice President Vance, for expressing what so many ordinary Europeans feel. Your recent speech at the Munich Security Conference might have upset a few elitists but gave great pleasure to those who love free speech and freedom of conscience on both sides of the Atlantic and offered hope to those feeling crushed by open borders and the social pathologies to which mass immigration gives rise. Thank you, too, for giving permission to those who lament the demise of their national cultures and the Western/Christian civilisation which once gave a sense of common heritage and belonging to a continent that created the modern world. The horror on the faces of those gathered to hear the speech was a sight for sore eyes, a delicious pleasure for those of us who are supposed to keep our mouths shut and go along with all the woke nonsense for fear of being labelled as one of the myriad terms ending in 'ist'. How lovely it was to see those smug, holier-than-thou, highly credentialled, gilt-edged globalist aristocrats looking so outraged. How dare a man who grew up in poverty in the Appalachian Rust Belt have the temerity to lecture so august a body of technocrats on subjects such as the freedom of citizens to criticise their lords and masters and reject the godless ideologies they foist on those they govern? But dare he did and many here in America and in Europe are loving him for it. Needless to say, not all welcomed his speech. The legacy media reacted as you would expect.'Vance shocks Europe', blasted America's newspaper of record, theNew York Times, accusing him of defending 'a divisive far-right political party in Germany', presumably AfD (Alternative for Germany), although Vance did not mention it by name. Incidentally, which Europe is Vance accused of shocking – anti-mass-immigration Eastern Europe, the Europe of men and women struggling to make a living, fearful to go out at night due to high rates of crime, people who fear being arrested for posting on social media or expressing their Christian faith, Europeans who resent the rewriting of their histories and are deeply troubled by the rubbishing of their distinctive cultures, Jews compelled to hide their identity on the streets of European capitals due to rising rates of anti-Semitism? Surely none of those just listed. It goes without saying that it has in mind the Europe of technocratic elites who are now determining the fate of a once great civilisation according to their godless visions of utilitarian dystopias 'made more sinister', to quote Churchill, 'and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science'. Elsewhere in the paper, Vance is accused of 'attacking a German consensus on Nazis and speech . . . decades-long approaches to political extremism that were designed to prevent another Hitler'. CNN seeks to indict him for dealing in 'half-truths' and trying to reignite popularism in Europe, as if it needs any help from American politicians, but seriously undermines its journalistic authority when it describes the electoral disaster that the British Conservative Party suffered last year as proof that populism is past its peak in a Europe which is 'a little wiser now' than it was during Trump's first administration. If the Conservative Party is an example of populism, then I'm in line to become the next living prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When it comes to the legacy media and their negative reactions to Vance's Munich speech, I could go on and on. It seems to have offended all the right people, theGuardianleading with the hysterical headline:'JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe's leaders'. The BBC even used the adjective'weird'to attack the speech, dusting off a word which was used to attack Trump and Vance last summer. It didn't work then, and it's unlikely to work now. The BBC at least got it right when it said that Vance'accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech', but failed to consider the veracity of his accusation. Before I finish, allow me to list some of my thoughts on the now-infamous speech and why I and many others loved it. I loved it because Vance mentioned specific examples of how ordinary men and women have been negatively affected by their governments' authoritarian tendencies, people who have fallen foul of hate-speech laws that should have no place in a democratic society. Of course, such a list could become very long indeed, as we've seen over the last 20 years or so. But by naming people such as Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of praying outside an abortion clinic in my home town of Bournemouth, and alluding to other examples of those prosecuted for exercising their God-given rights to express themselves freely, Vance has put a face on this Orwellian evil. Above all, I loved his speech because he articulated what millions of Europeans are thinking but are too cowed by the increasingly authoritarian administrative state to express themselves for fear of the very real possibility of punitive consequences. And, my dear elites, stop using fear of another Hitler as an excuse to stifle free speech. Arresting people who criticise feminism or tell tasteless jokes will do nothing to prevent the return of fascism, but unrestricted immigration and draconian restrictions on free speech will drive decent men and women into the arms of those on the supposedly 'far right' that the left claims to be the greatest existing threat to liberal democracy at a time when Europe is importing millions of immigrants who despise everything liberal democracy claims to stand for. The spell has been broken, and we must be grateful to Vice President Vance for making that clear to those assembled in Munich to hear him speak so plainly and so forcefully.   \n",

On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike \"over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide\". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed \"severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower\". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to \"cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS\". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent \"lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be\", but has nonetheless \"chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week\". This means \"forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily\". The students are \"risking their health and education\" in order to push the university to \"sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East\". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a \"facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing\". If you want to support the students, you can share their story and their demands below. You can also sign their open letter in solidarity, and email the university registrar at [email protected].</td>\n",

       "      <td>In a coordinated wave of actions across Europe, Palestine Action struck at 15 premises of the 'Allianz' company, investors in and insurers of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company. Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as – without insurance – Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' – despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's \"principle institutional shareholder\", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Met Police already threatening peaceful protesters at the 'Lord Walney' 16 appeal hearing</td>\n",
       "      <td>16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the \"soup throwers\" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people – if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were \"the highest of their kind in modern British history\". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a \"paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing\". The court was told the protesters \"acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted\", but \"none of the applicants acted out of self-interest\". Mr Friedman said: \"What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations.\" \"They did what they did out of sacrifice,\" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A scathing new report on child poverty just shamed the Labour Party</td>\n",
       "      <td>The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament – even with high economic growth – if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living – social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change – meaningful change to people's lives – is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net. This needs to be alongside sustainable long-term funding for vital local services provided by councils, such as advice services, local welfare assistance, housing and employment support. We are engaging with the Government on its proposed strategy and working with them to ensure that every child has the best possible start in life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>DWP benefits like PIP are officially GOOD for the economy - despite Labour's propaganda</td>\n",
       "      <td>Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety​. The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at £12,300. This translates to an estimated £42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the £28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every £1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains £1.48 in wellbeing benefits​. Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him \"a new life\". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence​. Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety​. In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need​. The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms​. As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining—and even expanding—current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.</td>\n",

On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike \"over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide\". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed \"severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower\". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to \"cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS\". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent \"lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be\", but has nonetheless \"chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week\". This means \"forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily\". The students are \"risking their health and education\" in order to push the university to \"sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East\". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a \"facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing\".

Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as – without insurance – Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' – despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's \"principle institutional shareholder\", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the \"soup throwers\" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people – if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were \"the highest of their kind in modern British history\". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a \"paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing\". The court was told the protesters \"acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted\", but \"none of the applicants acted out of self-interest\". Mr Friedman said: \"What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations.\" \"They did what they did out of sacrifice,\" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.   \n",
       "3  The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament – even with high economic growth – if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living – social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change – meaningful change to people's lives – is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net.

       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety​. The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at £12,300. This translates to an estimated £42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the £28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every £1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains £1.48 in wellbeing benefits​. Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him \"a new life\". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence​. Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety​. In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need​. The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms​. As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining—and even expanding—current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.   \n",

       "      <td>International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to \"Syrian authorities\" for \"open &amp; constructive discussions\" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Exclusive — Senate Sources: FBI, Senate Democrats Reason for Tulsi Gabbard’s Slow-Walked Confirmation</td>\n",
       "      <td>Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Donald Trump in his inauguration speech on Monday unequivocally rejected the gender insanity pushed by the Biden administration over the past four years. The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify \"gender identity\" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. \"With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. \"And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school.\" \"And, we will keep men out of women's sports,\" Trump added. \"And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one? Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government, that there are only two genders, male and female.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Javier Milei Condemns Brazil for Keeping Bolsonaro from Trump Inauguration</td>\n",
       "      <td>President of Argentina Javier Milei blamed the \"regime\" of Brazilian radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for not allowing conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro to travel to the United States for the inauguration of President Donald Trump. \"He [Bolsonaro] is my friend. I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,\" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged \"coup\" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled \"anti-fake news crusader\" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a \"flight risk\" and that he showed \"indications\" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was \"upset\" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. \"It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,\" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a \"blatant persecution\" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing \"whatever he wants\" with the intention of \"eliminating\" Brazil's right wing. \"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,\" Bolsonaro said. \"They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world.\" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a \"historic partner\" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. \"There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,\" Lula said. On Sunday, Eduardo Bolsonaro published a video on his Instagram account of former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro holding a video call with Jair Bolsonaro while she participated in a dinner on the eve of January 20.

Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. \"Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,\" Trump said. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\" He continued, \"First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\" Trump will go even further. \"Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,\" he said. \"And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\" \"As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" Trump said. \"We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\"</td>\n",

       "0  International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to \"Syrian authorities\" for \"open & constructive discussions\" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a \"caliphate\" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. \"Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,\" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. \"I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have.\" The visit was reportedly a \" surprise \" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an \"inclusive\" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. \"We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,\" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that \"people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly.\" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. \"HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,\" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. \"The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked.\" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. \"He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,\" Saar wrote in a social media message. \"So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are.\" \"Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,\" Saar observed.   \n",

Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.   \n",

The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,\" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify \"gender identity\" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. \"With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,\" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. \"And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school.\" \"And, we will keep men out of women's sports,\" Trump added. \"And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one? Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government, that there are only two genders, male and female.\"   \n",

I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,\" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged \"coup\" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled \"anti-fake news crusader\" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a \"flight risk\" and that he showed \"indications\" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was \"upset\" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. \"It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,\" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a \"blatant persecution\" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing \"whatever he wants\" with the intention of \"eliminating\" Brazil's right wing. \"Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,\" Bolsonaro said. \"They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world.\" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a \"historic partner\" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. \"There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,\" Lula said.

Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. \"Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,\" Trump said. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\" He continued, \"First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\" Trump will go even further. \"Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,\" he said. \"And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\" \"As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" Trump said. \"We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\"   \n",

       "      <td>Nearly 60% of Nebraskavotedfor Donald Trump last November. There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. \"Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,\" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. \"For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling \"wearily\" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. \"There's no way it can,\" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. \"I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,\" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. \"The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens.\" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: \"I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska.\" That parishioner says people in the state \"understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid.\" However, given Nebraska's overwhelming vote for Trump, that assertion seems debatable.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Explaining the Rightis a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know. Donald Trump spent his first week in office using the power of the presidency to attack decades of actions to promote diversity. Trumpissued executive ordersrolling back desegregation orders, instructing government offices that promote diversity to be shuttered, and laying off workers tasked with promoting inclusion. He even threatened federal employees, ordering them tosnitch on each otherto expose any pro-diversity positions that might have flown under the radar. Trump, of course, has along history of racism, and the conservative movement and Republican Party he leads has frequently voiced opposition to social progress. But the executive actions in his second administration are occurring with a level of vigor much higher than in his first term. So what happened? In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set offa series of protestsagainst racial injustice throughout the United States and the world. While such protests have always occurred, the uprising of 2020 happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic—and while Trump was in the White House, pursuing a racist agenda that includedpraising Nazisand other right-wing extremists. Conservatives, still reeling from significant advances from Barack Obama's presidency, chose to strike back by more forcefully opposing pro-diversity efforts in government, academia, and business. Activists like Christopher Ruforallied conservativesto attack diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and falsely claimed that the academic \"critical race theory,\" which discusses systemic racism, was being taught at all school levels rather than just in college. At the same time, conservative media—led by outlets like Fox News—attacked any and all advances toward racial and gender equity as \"woke,\" subverting the meaning of the term originally coined by Black activists to promote racial awareness. Suddenly, according to Fox,everything under the sunwas \"woke.\" When M&amp;M's added a female character to its advertising, Fox's Harris Faulkner complained that the brand was \"back to pushing woke politics, the company now introducing a new progressive pack of chocolates: women M&amp;M's.\" Conservative pundit Buck Sexton appeared on Fox to argue that lingerie company Victoria's Secret's choice to get rid of its \"angels\" concept was a sinister plot to \"go a little bit woke.\" Similarly, leading Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisdeclaredthat his state was at war with \"woke.\" DeSantis ordered the state to only use red, white, and blue lights on bridges—prohibiting lights that celebrate events like Pride Month or Juneteenth. He even wenton the attackagainst one of the state's biggest and most beloved companies, Disney, because diversified some of its content. Trump was involved in all of this by promoting attacks on diversity from within the presidency, includingfalsely labelingthe racial justice protests as being purely violent. Trump is also a habitual consumer of Fox News and the network has a demonstrated ability to influence his world view, as can be seen by the slew of Fox talking headsnow populatinghis administration. While Trump was adopting this posture, many of the former members of his administration and their ideological allies were concoctingProject 2025, which isextremely focusedon rolling back many civil rights gains and other advances—like same-sex marriage—that have occurred in the ensuing decades. Now in his second term, Trump has installed Project 2025 architects in his Cabinet and is already implementing their wish list. Trump began his political careerriding a waveof racist right-wing anger after the United States elected its first Black president. And now, he and his party have the civil rights movement squarely in their crosshairs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How Eric Adams’ downfall led him straight into Trump’s arms</td>\n",
       "      <td>In a recent interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, New York City Mayor Eric Adams alleged that the Democratic Party \"left\" him. \"People often say, 'Well, you know, you don't sound like a Democrat, and you know, you seemed to have left the party.' No, the party left me, and it left working-class people,\" said Adams, who is running for reelection as a Democrat against the backdrop of five federalcriminal charges. The roughly50-minuteinterview with Carlson, one of Donald Trump'smost ardent allies, is Adams' latest attempt to appeal to the president, whoexpressed a willingnessto pardon him for his crimes. It also represents a break from Adams' past attitudes toward Carlson.During his 2021 mayoral run, Adams said he didn't \"want or need the support of Tucker Carlson, or anyone else who perpetuates racist, anti-immigrant propaganda.\" But a criminal case clearly changed his outlook. More recently, Adams' attempts to curry favor with the president have been downright pathetic, butwithout the helpof his constituents, Adams might need to bring in the big guns. During his conversation with Carlson, Adams criticized both the Biden administration and Democrats' immigration policies, which he onceclaimedthreatened to \"destroy New York City.\" He also said that the indictment against him was politically motivated. \"You complained about allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals and this indictment was punishment for complaining,\" Carlson said. \"That is clearly my belief,\" Adams confirmed. Later, Carlson questioned why Republican-led states shouldn't bus asylum seekers to New York City. For years, red states like Texas havespent millions of dollarsbusing immigrants to blue cities like New York in what amounts to a cruel political stunt. \"Isn't it fair to send all their illegals here because you guys welcome them?\" Carlson asked, nodding to the fact that New York is asanctuary city, meaning it aims to shield immigrants from unwarranted enforcement actions, including arrest or deportation. \"No, we're not welcoming them. Let me be very clear,\" he said, adding thatformer President Joe Biden and his aides once told him to tamp down his criticism regarding the influx of immigrants to help the party during the 2024 presidential election. \"Basically, be a good Democrat, Eric,\" Adams said. \"That was the basic overall theme.\" \"It appeared to me there was a bigger focus on the national election and not on what it was doing to the cities,\" Adams later said, nodding to the influx of immigrants in New York City that officials estimatecosts $5 billion. The interview aired on the Tucker Carlson Network Tuesday evening but, asPolitico reports, was never promoted on the mayor's public schedule. A spokesperson for Adamsalso told the outletthat it was Carlson who requested the interview. \"Mayor Adams does not believe we should be living in silos and speaking into echo chambers,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"At a time where our country is so divided, the mayor believes we must break out of our comfort zones and speak with everyone—even those we may not always agree with.\" While Adams, at times, gently refused some of Carlson's claims, it was a relatively friendly chit-chat. But the timing of it is interesting, as it comes amid increased speculation that Adams is angling for a presidential pardon ahead of hisApril trial. Adams, who wasfirst electedin 2021, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud, and two counts of illegally soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign national. Since at least October, Adams has tried to play nice with Trump and other Republicans. That month, after Trump defended Adams and suggested that both of them had been unfairly \"persecuted,\" Adamsavoided criticizingTrump. Now Adams is done playing coy. Shortly after Trump's reelection in November, Adamsrequested a meetingwith Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, then later danced around whether he'dconsider switching parties. Adams was a registered Republican from 1995 to 2002 before becoming a Democrat. Indeed, if party switching or, at the very least, cozying up to Republicans who are close to the president, is the way to win favor with Trump and the GOP, Adams' most recent interview and actions would suggest he's all in. On Monday, Adams scrapped his public scheduleto make the trekto Washington, D.C., after the Trump administration extended a last-minute invite to his inauguration. Adams, whopractically beggedTrump for a ticket, made the pilgrimage in thewee hours of the night. He had met with the president in Palm Beach, Florida,merely days prior. \"Inauguration Day is a sacred American tradition. Our country has been through so much, and every president has the honor and responsibility to protect and lead the American people,\" Adamswrote on X. \"I believe there's much we can achieve working alongside the federal government as we support our city's values and fight for New Yorkers.\" Even if the interview with Carlson was just a formality, Trump is reportedly lapping up Adams' interest in his administration. According toRolling Stone, the president's allies have rightly called Adams \"thirsty\" for Trump's attention and even questioned when the \"actual begging and love letters start.\" Adams isunlikely to be reelectedlater this year, so maybe his newfound fealty to the GOP is part of his backup plan once he's out of office. Or maybe he's angling for a role in Trump's Cabinet. After all, it is arevolving doorof senior-level administrators.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Senate confirmedPete Hegsethas the nation's defense secretary Friday in a dramatic late-night vote, swatting back questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon amidallegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behaviortoward women. Rarely has a Cabinet nominee faced such wide-ranging concerns about his experience and behavior as Hegseth, particularly for such a high-profile role atop the U.S. military. But the Republican-led Senate was determined to confirm Hegseth, a former Fox News host and combat veteran who has vowed to bring a \"warrior culture\" to the Pentagon, rounding out PresidentDonald Trump'stop national security Cabinet officials. Vice President JD Vance was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote, unusual in the Senate for Cabinet nominees, who typically win wider support. Hegseth himself was at the Capitol with his family. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunesaid Hegseth, as a veteran of the Army National Guard who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, \"will bring a warrior's perspective\" to the top military job. \"Gone will be the days of woke distractions,\" Thune said, referring to the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives being slashed across the federal government. \"The Pentagon's focus will be on war fighting.\" The Senate's ability to confirm Hegseth despite a grave series of allegations against him will provide a measure of Trump's political power and ability toget what he wants from the GOP-led Congress, and of the potency of the culture wars to fuel his agenda at the White House. Next week senators will be facing Trump's otheroutside Cabinet choicesincluding particularly Kash Patel, a Trump ally who has published an enemies list, as the FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as director of the office of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate at Health and Human Services. \"Is Pete Hegseth truly the best we have to offer?\" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging his colleagues to think seriously about their vote. Hegseth himself was working the phones late Friday to shore up his support, his confirmation at stake. \"He's a good man,\" Trump said of Hegseth while departing the White House to visit disaster-hit North Carolina and Los Angeles. \"I hope he makes it.\" Trump leveled criticism of Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who announced they would vote against Hegseth. And Tump raised fresh questions about Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying, \"And of course Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. Is Mitch a no vote?\" In the end all three voted against Hegseth, as tensions soared late Friday at the Capitol. McConnell, the former GOP leader in the Senate, had not declared his vote, but signaled skepticism in an earlier speech when he declared he would confirm nominees to senior national security roles \"whose record and experience will make them immediate assets, not liabilities.\" He voted against. It takes a simple majority to confirm Hegseth, and Republicans, with a 53-47 majority in the Senate, could only lose one more objection. One Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, sent the Senate swirling as he raised questions and was provided information and answers, said a person familiar with the situation Thursday and granted anonymity to discuss it. But Tillis ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth who he said \"has a unique perspective\" and is passionate about modernizing the military. He said he spoke to Hegseth for \"nearly two hour\" about his concerns. Democrats, as the minority party, have helped confirm Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand CIA DirectorJohn Ratcliffein bipartisan votes to Trump's national security team within days of his return to the White House. But Democrats gravely opposed to Hegseth have little power to stop him, and instead have resorted to dragging out the process. Hours before the vote, Democrat after Democrat took to the Senate floor to object. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said during the debate there are few Trump nominees as \"dangerously and woefully unqualified as Hegseth.\" Hegseth facesallegations that he sexually assaulted a womanat a Republican conference in California, though he has denied the claims and said the encounter was consensual. He laterpaid $50,000 to the woman. More recently, Hegseth's former sister-in-lawsaid in an affidavitthat he was abusive to his second wife to the point that she feared for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and in divorce proceedings, neither Hegseth nor the woman claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse. During afiery confirmationhearing, Hegseth dismissed allegations of wrongdoing one by one, and vowed to bring \"warrior culture\" to the top Pentagon post. Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job if confirmed. But Republican senators facing an intensive pressure campaign by Trump allies to support Hegseth have stood by his nomination, echoing his claims of a \"smear\" campaign against him. A Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth represents a newer generation of veterans who came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He went on to a career at Fox News as the host of a weekend show, and was unknown to many on Capitol Hill until Trump tapped him for the top Defense job. Hegseth's comments that women should have no role in military combat drew particular concern on Capitol Hill, including from lawmakers who themselves served. He has since tempered those views as he met with senators during the confirmation process. Murkowski said in a lengthy statement ahead of a test vote on Hegseth that his behaviors \"starkly contrast\" with what is expected of the military. \"I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,\" Murkowski wrote on social media. Collins said that after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth, \"I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" But one prominent Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a veteran and sexual assault survivor, came under harsh criticism for her skepticism toward Hegseth and eventually announced she would back him. Hegseth would lead an organization with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of $850 billion. In exercising its advise and consent role over Trump's nominees, the Senate is also trying to stave off his suggestion that the GOP leaders simply do away with the confirmation process altogether, and allow him to appoint his Cabinet choices when the Congress is on recess. Trump raised the idea of so-called \"recess appointments\" during a private White House meeting with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a step many senators are trying to avoid.</td>\n",

There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. \"Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,\" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. \"For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling \"wearily\" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. \"There's no way it can,\" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. \"I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,\" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. \"The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens.\" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: \"I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska.\" That parishioner says people in the state \"understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid.\" However, given Nebraska's overwhelming vote for Trump, that assertion seems debatable.   \n",

Donald Trump spent his first week in office using the power of the presidency to attack decades of actions to promote diversity. Trumpissued executive ordersrolling back desegregation orders, instructing government offices that promote diversity to be shuttered, and laying off workers tasked with promoting inclusion. He even threatened federal employees, ordering them tosnitch on each otherto expose any pro-diversity positions that might have flown under the radar. Trump, of course, has along history of racism, and the conservative movement and Republican Party he leads has frequently voiced opposition to social progress. But the executive actions in his second administration are occurring with a level of vigor much higher than in his first term. So what happened? In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set offa series of protestsagainst racial injustice throughout the United States and the world. While such protests have always occurred, the uprising of 2020 happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic—and while Trump was in the White House, pursuing a racist agenda that includedpraising Nazisand other right-wing extremists. Conservatives, still reeling from significant advances from Barack Obama's presidency, chose to strike back by more forcefully opposing pro-diversity efforts in government, academia, and business. Activists like Christopher Ruforallied conservativesto attack diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and falsely claimed that the academic \"critical race theory,\" which discusses systemic racism, was being taught at all school levels rather than just in college. At the same time, conservative media—led by outlets like Fox News—attacked any and all advances toward racial and gender equity as \"woke,\" subverting the meaning of the term originally coined by Black activists to promote racial awareness. Suddenly, according to Fox,everything under the sunwas \"woke.\" When M&M's added a female character to its advertising, Fox's Harris Faulkner complained that the brand was \"back to pushing woke politics, the company now introducing a new progressive pack of chocolates: women M&M's.\" Conservative pundit Buck Sexton appeared on Fox to argue that lingerie company Victoria's Secret's choice to get rid of its \"angels\" concept was a sinister plot to \"go a little bit woke.\" Similarly, leading Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisdeclaredthat his state was at war with \"woke.\" DeSantis ordered the state to only use red, white, and blue lights on bridges—prohibiting lights that celebrate events like Pride Month or Juneteenth. He even wenton the attackagainst one of the state's biggest and most beloved companies, Disney, because diversified some of its content. Trump was involved in all of this by promoting attacks on diversity from within the presidency, includingfalsely labelingthe racial justice protests as being purely violent. Trump is also a habitual consumer of Fox News and the network has a demonstrated ability to influence his world view, as can be seen by the slew of Fox talking headsnow populatinghis administration. While Trump was adopting this posture, many of the former members of his administration and their ideological allies were concoctingProject 2025, which isextremely focusedon rolling back many civil rights gains and other advances—like same-sex marriage—that have occurred in the ensuing decades. Now in his second term, Trump has installed Project 2025 architects in his Cabinet and is already implementing their wish list. Trump began his political careerriding a waveof racist right-wing anger after the United States elected its first Black president. And now, he and his party have the civil rights movement squarely in their crosshairs.   \n",

No, the party left me, and it left working-class people,\" said Adams, who is running for reelection as a Democrat against the backdrop of five federalcriminal charges. The roughly50-minuteinterview with Carlson, one of Donald Trump'smost ardent allies, is Adams' latest attempt to appeal to the president, whoexpressed a willingnessto pardon him for his crimes. It also represents a break from Adams' past attitudes toward Carlson.During his 2021 mayoral run, Adams said he didn't \"want or need the support of Tucker Carlson, or anyone else who perpetuates racist, anti-immigrant propaganda.\" But a criminal case clearly changed his outlook. More recently, Adams' attempts to curry favor with the president have been downright pathetic, butwithout the helpof his constituents, Adams might need to bring in the big guns. During his conversation with Carlson, Adams criticized both the Biden administration and Democrats' immigration policies, which he onceclaimedthreatened to \"destroy New York City.\" He also said that the indictment against him was politically motivated. \"You complained about allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals and this indictment was punishment for complaining,\" Carlson said. \"That is clearly my belief,\" Adams confirmed. Later, Carlson questioned why Republican-led states shouldn't bus asylum seekers to New York City. For years, red states like Texas havespent millions of dollarsbusing immigrants to blue cities like New York in what amounts to a cruel political stunt. \"Isn't it fair to send all their illegals here because you guys welcome them?\" Carlson asked, nodding to the fact that New York is asanctuary city, meaning it aims to shield immigrants from unwarranted enforcement actions, including arrest or deportation. \"No, we're not welcoming them. Let me be very clear,\" he said, adding thatformer President Joe Biden and his aides once told him to tamp down his criticism regarding the influx of immigrants to help the party during the 2024 presidential election. \"Basically, be a good Democrat, Eric,\" Adams said. \"That was the basic overall theme.\" \"It appeared to me there was a bigger focus on the national election and not on what it was doing to the cities,\" Adams later said, nodding to the influx of immigrants in New York City that officials estimatecosts $5 billion. The interview aired on the Tucker Carlson Network Tuesday evening but, asPolitico reports, was never promoted on the mayor's public schedule. A spokesperson for Adamsalso told the outletthat it was Carlson who requested the interview. \"Mayor Adams does not believe we should be living in silos and speaking into echo chambers,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"At a time where our country is so divided, the mayor believes we must break out of our comfort zones and speak with everyone—even those we may not always agree with.\" While Adams, at times, gently refused some of Carlson's claims, it was a relatively friendly chit-chat. But the timing of it is interesting, as it comes amid increased speculation that Adams is angling for a presidential pardon ahead of hisApril trial. Adams, who wasfirst electedin 2021, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud, and two counts of illegally soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign national. Since at least October, Adams has tried to play nice with Trump and other Republicans. That month, after Trump defended Adams and suggested that both of them had been unfairly \"persecuted,\" Adamsavoided criticizingTrump. Now Adams is done playing coy. Shortly after Trump's reelection in November, Adamsrequested a meetingwith Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, then later danced around whether he'dconsider switching parties. Adams was a registered Republican from 1995 to 2002 before becoming a Democrat. Indeed, if party switching or, at the very least, cozying up to Republicans who are close to the president, is the way to win favor with Trump and the GOP, Adams' most recent interview and actions would suggest he's all in. On Monday, Adams scrapped his public scheduleto make the trekto Washington, D.C., after the Trump administration extended a last-minute invite to his inauguration. Adams, whopractically beggedTrump for a ticket, made the pilgrimage in thewee hours of the night. He had met with the president in Palm Beach, Florida,merely days prior. \"Inauguration Day is a sacred American tradition. Our country has been through so much, and every president has the honor and responsibility to protect and lead the American people,\" Adamswrote on X. \"I believe there's much we can achieve working alongside the federal government as we support our city's values and fight for New Yorkers.\" Even if the interview with Carlson was just a formality, Trump is reportedly lapping up Adams' interest in his administration. According toRolling Stone, the president's allies have rightly called Adams \"thirsty\" for Trump's attention and even questioned when the \"actual begging and love letters start.\" Adams isunlikely to be reelectedlater this year, so maybe his newfound fealty to the GOP is part of his backup plan once he's out of office. Or maybe he's angling for a role in Trump's Cabinet. After all, it is arevolving doorof senior-level administrators.   \n",

                                     The first few days of Donald Trump's second term have given Rachel Maddow a lot to cover, including the president's approach to public health. \"[Trump] has ordered that all information be stopped, including scientific information, to advise hospitals on how to deal with this emerging epidemic,\" Maddow said. The Trump administration's decision tocease all public-facing communicationfrom federal health agencies has been widely criticized. \"Is that popular? Is that a good idea? Is that perceived as a popular idea among the American people? Is that what you thought you were voting for?\" Maddow asked. \"You know what else isn't a popular idea? Bird flu.\" Maddow went on to point out that the price of eggs hasskyrocketedas a result of the bird flu, inflating an already fraught economic situation. At the same time, Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has reportedlysolicited a raw milk purveyorto take up a role in the Food and Drug Administration. Scientists warn againstthe consumption of raw milkfor many reasons, least of which is that it canspread diseases like bird flu. \"In the meantime, stop releasing any information on this bird flu thing—anything,\" Maddow concluded. \"Honestly, it sounds scary. Maybe if we don't talk about it, maybe it'll go away. And by the way, pay no attention to the price of eggs.\" Thebird fluhas affected livestock across the United States, from poultry to cattle. In January, thefirst human deathconnected with the disease was recorded in Louisiana.   \n",
       "4  The Senate confirmedPete Hegsethas the nation's defense secretary Friday in a dramatic late-night vote, swatting back questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon amidallegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behaviortoward women. Rarely has a Cabinet nominee faced such wide-ranging concerns about his experience and behavior as Hegseth, particularly for such a high-profile role atop the U.S. military. But the Republican-led Senate was determined to confirm Hegseth, a former Fox News host and combat veteran who has vowed to bring a \"warrior culture\" to the Pentagon, rounding out PresidentDonald Trump'stop national security Cabinet officials. Vice President JD Vance was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote, unusual in the Senate for Cabinet nominees, who typically win wider support. Hegseth himself was at the Capitol with his family. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunesaid Hegseth, as a veteran of the Army National Guard who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, \"will bring a warrior's perspective\" to the top military job. \"Gone will be the days of woke distractions,\" Thune said, referring to the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives being slashed across the federal government. \"The Pentagon's focus will be on war fighting.\" The Senate's ability to confirm Hegseth despite a grave series of allegations against him will provide a measure of Trump's political power and ability toget what he wants from the GOP-led Congress, and of the potency of the culture wars to fuel his agenda at the White House. Next week senators will be facing Trump's otheroutside Cabinet choicesincluding particularly Kash Patel, a Trump ally who has published an enemies list, as the FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as director of the office of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate at Health and Human Services. \"Is Pete Hegseth truly the best we have to offer?\" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging his colleagues to think seriously about their vote. Hegseth himself was working the phones late Friday to shore up his support, his confirmation at stake. \"He's a good man,\" Trump said of Hegseth while departing the White House to visit disaster-hit North Carolina and Los Angeles. \"I hope he makes it.\" Trump leveled criticism of Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who announced they would vote against Hegseth. And Tump raised fresh questions about Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying, \"And of course Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. Is Mitch a no vote?\" In the end all three voted against Hegseth, as tensions soared late Friday at the Capitol. McConnell, the former GOP leader in the Senate, had not declared his vote, but signaled skepticism in an earlier speech when he declared he would confirm nominees to senior national security roles \"whose record and experience will make them immediate assets, not liabilities.\" He voted against. It takes a simple majority to confirm Hegseth, and Republicans, with a 53-47 majority in the Senate, could only lose one more objection. One Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, sent the Senate swirling as he raised questions and was provided information and answers, said a person familiar with the situation Thursday and granted anonymity to discuss it. But Tillis ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth who he said \"has a unique perspective\" and is passionate about modernizing the military. He said he spoke to Hegseth for \"nearly two hour\" about his concerns. Democrats, as the minority party, have helped confirm Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand CIA DirectorJohn Ratcliffein bipartisan votes to Trump's national security team within days of his return to the White House. But Democrats gravely opposed to Hegseth have little power to stop him, and instead have resorted to dragging out the process. Hours before the vote, Democrat after Democrat took to the Senate floor to object. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said during the debate there are few Trump nominees as \"dangerously and woefully unqualified as Hegseth.\" Hegseth facesallegations that he sexually assaulted a womanat a Republican conference in California, though he has denied the claims and said the encounter was consensual. He laterpaid $50,000 to the woman. More recently, Hegseth's former sister-in-lawsaid in an affidavitthat he was abusive to his second wife to the point that she feared for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and in divorce proceedings, neither Hegseth nor the woman claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse. During afiery confirmationhearing, Hegseth dismissed allegations of wrongdoing one by one, and vowed to bring \"warrior culture\" to the top Pentagon post. Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job if confirmed. But Republican senators facing an intensive pressure campaign by Trump allies to support Hegseth have stood by his nomination, echoing his claims of a \"smear\" campaign against him. A Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth represents a newer generation of veterans who came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He went on to a career at Fox News as the host of a weekend show, and was unknown to many on Capitol Hill until Trump tapped him for the top Defense job. Hegseth's comments that women should have no role in military combat drew particular concern on Capitol Hill, including from lawmakers who themselves served. He has since tempered those views as he met with senators during the confirmation process. Murkowski said in a lengthy statement ahead of a test vote on Hegseth that his behaviors \"starkly contrast\" with what is expected of the military. \"I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,\" Murkowski wrote on social media. Collins said that after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth, \"I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed.\" But one prominent Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a veteran and sexual assault survivor, came under harsh criticism for her skepticism toward Hegseth and eventually announced she would back him. Hegseth would lead an organization with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of $850 billion. In exercising its advise and consent role over Trump's nominees, the Senate is also trying to stave off his suggestion that the GOP leaders simply do away with the confirmation process altogether, and allow him to appoint his Cabinet choices when the Congress is on recess. Trump raised the idea of so-called \"recess appointments\" during a private White House meeting with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a step many senators are trying to avoid.   \n",

Sources confirmed that moments after receiving the Kamala Harris fundraising message, the accountant typed out his short reply with the certainty of one familiar with an ancient elven tongue summoning an arcane incantation known as the Shield of Thar'Ghal to protect both him and his party of halflings and dwarves from a charging monster escaped from the depths of the underworld. Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, \"Begone, ye evil creature!\" According to bystanders, the accountant's fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster's tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution's highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country's long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion's editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That's why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion's latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying \"it's too late\" and we are \"doing more harm than good.\" For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we'd hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden's first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we'd hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden's highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called \"papers of record\" are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he's packed a lot into 81 short years. He's fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He's stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board's courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board</td>\n",

Here are tips for finding the selecting running shoes. Decide the level of cushioning based on if you're a back runner, side runner, or stomach runner. Go up a size to leave room for blisters. Count how many feet you have to determine your optimal number of shoes. Salespeople will often allow you to test run shoes as long as they can ride along on your back. Hokas make you appear both taller and wealthier. Pause during cutscenes so you can figure out what type of sneakers Sonic is wearing. Choose a colorway that will complement months of dust. When trying on shoes, wear the same kind of socks and banana costume you usually have on while running.

It pushes my buttons every time. Wildly firing my machine gun into the mist makes me feel a little better, but it never actually stops the bastards.

As alarming as it is to say, the average European can probably name more U.S. citizens than the average American. It's a full-blown educational crisis.

This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.\" Going on to acknowledge the genuine achievements of ancient Egyptians, Egerton noted that these Bronze Age humans had succeeded in using gravity cannons and proton rays to build the Great Sphinx in a single afternoon.</td>\n",

Bystanders reported that the virtual companion—who had been generated from the keywords 'White, Busty, Obedient, Redhead'—then began glitching in a way that made her appear as a set of floating teeth and eyeballs, prompting Musk to relaunch the app and gently chide her for not behaving herself in front of his very good friend, the president. At press time, the pair had reportedly gotten into a blowout fight after Jasmine intercepted an anatomically impossible nude from one of Musk's other girlfriend apps.</td>\n",

Sheesh. At some point you have to ask yourself: What does this all add up to?\" Taylor concluded that his only hope was that his existence served some higher purpose that he was unaware of, but that the invading Garacean-13 galactic fleet understood perfectly.</td>\n",

The lizard is then likely to enter into a relationship that may not be healthy just to stop the complaining. A few months later, it gives birth to its offspring and is saddled with a deep bitterness that its life is over.\" Gentry went on to add that shinglebacks have the highest suicide rate of any lizard species.</td>\n",

Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.\" At press time, a Gallup Poll had found that 70% of Americans opposed Biden being rescued.   \n",

But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I'm not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I'm saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?\" Hartford went on to say that it might be helpful if Julia stayed at home for their next sessions so that they could spend more time understanding where, exactly, David's hotness came from.   \n",

After that, you can sit back and collect thousands of dollars a month. How cool is that? You and your little friends are going to have so much fun building your little real estate empire. Enjoy!\" At press time, sources reported Schweitz's son was enthusiastically climbing into the tree house to serve an eviction notice to the low-income family currently living there.   \n",

With these mighty strands, I command the wildfires and the earthquakes, the droughts and the floods!\" At press time, sources confirmed Newsom's hair product had evicted several homeless people seeking shelter within the throbbing gelatinous nest upon his head.   \n",

They'll also receive $10,000 in cash. Frankly, it's a tragedy we've let these American heroes rot in their graves for this long.\" Reacting to a moment in the video when MrBeast gives a reanimated World War II veteran a Lamborghini, viewers expressed outrage toward the apparent ingratitude of the undead soldier, who only screams, \"Why did you do this?

It's just that your pal Cassidy can only handle so much hootin' and hollerin' before he plumb runs out of steam.

Bush in a time of crisis, thousands of country stations across America reportedly refused to play Beyoncé's music Thursday after the artist condemned the Iraq War. \"If she doesn't want to support our troops risking their lives out there for the cause of freedom, then we don't need her,\" said country radio executive Hunter Roeloffs, one of many station owners who blacklisted the recent singles \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\" after controversial comments in which the star expressed reservations about the U.S.-led Coalition invasion of Iraq—remarks that also led to a reported drop in ticket sales and Beyoncé losing a sponsorship deal with Lipton. \"Unlike Miss Knowles, we're proud Americans here at 100.3 the Bull. We support freedom, whether it's here or in the Middle East. So when she says innocent lives will be lost, I can't help but wonder how she could possibly think a bloodthirsty dictator like Saddam Hussein is innocent. And then there's that line of hers about being ashamed of President Bush? Well, we're ashamed of her. How about that?\" At press time, Beyoncé had attracted additional criticism from the country music scene after rebranding herself as the Chicks.   \n",

Stab him, you cowards!\" on Friday after she plunged a knife into President Joe Biden's back. \"What are you waiting for, you fools? Strike now! Strike before the opportunity goes cold!\" said the blood-dappled vice president, who, as her staff appeared to grow uncertain of the blades in their shaking hands and backed away toward the exit, reminded each panicked aide in turn that they had pledged their fealty for this day. \"Think of all I've promised you. Think of all we stand to gain. Quick, now, the first blow has been rendered. There is no going back. We're confederates in this. We must act now or be damned by inaction!\" At press time, sources confirmed President Biden had complained to an assistant of a tightness in his shoulder and returned to the Oval Office with the knife still protruding from his back.   \n",

They see a blank slate.

Our trials with Evanovia, however, show that it now takes just one injection and within 12 hours any obese individual will start rapidly thinning before finally melting out of existence completely.\" At press time, critics had warned about a rash of influencers, models, and actresses who were using the drug to vanish despite not being overweight themselves.   \n",

Many don't even know that before Destiny's Child, she was in a two-person jug band with her bucktoothed grandpappy, Earl Bob, in which she played a rusty washboard and slapped her knee. This is not some random new roadkill-skinning persona she's putting on—it is absolutely genuine.\" At press time, Beyoncé's merch store had begun selling preorders for home-cooked meth.   \n",

I was at his house once, and he actually just had money lying around, including at least $25 worth of quarters in what I can only assume was some kind of high-yield coin jar.\" At press time, Reed had reportedly lost everything he had after sinking all his money into a new set of tires when his car failed inspection.   \n",

In fact, had he not had a pen and this napkin handy that fateful night, Epstein's island, his dozens of accusers, and his large, all-powerful cabal of elite pedophiles might never have existed.\" At press time, Sotheby's confirmed the napkin had sold for over $200 million after several of Epstein's associates, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew got into a heated bidding war over the priceless memorabilia.   \n",

Simpson was reportedly allowed to remain alive Thursday after his coffin didn't fit. \"If the coffin doesn't fit, you must let him live a bit.\" said O.J. eulogizer Tommie Lochran, who advocated for Simpson to continue living despite evidence that the coffin had shrunk after previously getting wet. \"Any DNA found in the casket that appears to be Mr. Simpson's, I believe, was the result of contamination. It would be existential malpractice to allow Mr. Simpson to die knowing full well that this coffin was not made for him.\" At press time, Simpson went on a media blitz promoting his escape from death.   \n",

Throw me!' into his ear, and then he did. He whipped her across the grounds so easily—it was so cute. She just went soaring over the heads of everyone in the crowd.\" At press time, Renny was gushing over another viral video that showed Kelce spiking Swift into the ground.   \n",

According to witnesses, the 81-year-old commander-in-chief remained quite calm during his apparent abduction by the insects, showing no signs of resistance as the swarm of approximately 2,500 black carpenter ants hoisted him over their bodies using their powerful mandibles and began marching slowly but steadily toward the White House Rose Garden. Secret Service officials confirmed that snipers stationed on the roof of the executive mansion fired upon the swarm to no avail, reportedly because the ants' 6-millimeter-long bodies were simply too small to target. At press time, sources said the FBI was negotiating with the ant colony's queen for Biden's release.   \n",

Going forward, none of our models will be outfitted with brakes. Instead, we will shift our efforts to making fart noises louder.\" At press time, Tesla staffers responsible for wheels were reportedly nervous after receiving an ominous meeting request from HR.   \n",

That's just good sportsmanship. So from now on, every chicken in our Perdue facilities will have free and easy access to firearms. We may lose some staff to gunshot wounds, but everyone involved—human or fowl—will have an opportunity to defend themselves. It's only right.\" At press time, sources confirmed a shift in the balance of power at several Perdue processing plants had resulted in thousands of employees being slaughter with assembly-line efficiency.   \n",

Ron DeSantis (R) signed a new law Thursday requiring all Florida women to produce three healthy, white sons by the date of their 22nd birthday. \"The production of white daughters will not be penalized, but they will be seized by the state for the production of white sons,\" said DeSantis, who clarified that regardless of the race, ethnicity, or religious background of the mother, all sons would be required to be both white and raised in a Catholic household. \"Three is the bare minimum. Despite what the virtue-signaling, left-wing fanatics are espousing on CNN, this requirement is actually quite fair and attainable. Whether Florida women and girls choose to get started at age 15 or 19, they will have plenty of time to comply.\" At press time, DeSantis added that a miscarriage counted as negative one white sons.   \n",

We'll do our best to reattach the fingers that weren't swallowed, but that isn't going to prevent these patients from chewing them off again the next time they eat a gyro or cheesesteak.\" At press time, saying they really needed something to wash down their sandwich with, several of the patients reportedly failed to realize they were drinking the blood from their wounded hand.   \n",

It can't be her doctrine they're drawn to, because that is not particularly inspiring either. We know these followers would kill for her, but the question is, why?\" Douglass went on to hypothesize that perhaps Swift was blackmailing her followers with sordid details of their personal lives she had obtained through fan letters.   \n",

No one could have told me? No one? Fuck all of you. Seriously. Well, I suppose I should have learned my lesson when I tried to speak to that scarecrow in Mozambique.\" At press time, Attenborough was spotted chewing out a flustered assistant director of photography and insisting that he needed to delete the footage immediately.   \n",

USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction \"DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian\" underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it. Insiders confirmed that with the right currents and weather patterns, the chocolate-flavored meal replacement should reach Gaza by 2035, only two years after the expiration date.   \n",

Even when we try to move it around ourselves to make it even, someone keeps moving it back. It's very frustrating.\" The USGS did, however, note that the amount of fire on earth had been properly disbursed.   \n",

We do not have long before we are devoured and used as sustenance for the next generation of galactic apex predators.\" At press time, a supernova had reportedly frightened the space hawk, causing it to drop Earth into a black hole.   \n",

But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I've always wanted to do that.\" At press time, Thomas called for a short recess to give the matter more thought, as whichever choice he made could have dire consequences for decades of his luxury vacations.   \n",

She was only 59 yesterday,\" the visibly distraught DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after the party's new presumptive nominee began to ask him who he was and then trailed off, her cloudy eyes glossing over beneath a wisp of stark-white hair and her skin now wrinkled and liver-spotted. \"She's been rambling about all kinds of nonsense, and she keeps calling everyone \"buster.\" No, Madam Vice President, I'm not your stepson, and I'm not here to take you back to California. Goddammit, she's too far gone to even formulate a coherent argument for abortion rights. Someone better call [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom and make sure he still remembers his own name.\" At press time, sources confirmed prominent members of the party had been instructed to quickly shift their support to a spry, cogent 31-year-old Joe Biden, who had somehow de-aged 50 years overnight.   \n",

In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.\" Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building's windows.   \n",

Just as I'm putting the finishing touches on a worldview about a topic that I don't have even the faintest inkling about, it's like three more news stories pop up out of nowhere in an arena where I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. And again, I really don't know jackshit about anything at all, so how am I supposed to keep up?\" At press time, Gifford added that the only thing helping him keep his head above water was that he did not have to research or think about his opinions at all before putting them out into the world.   \n",

And if this special nit comb I bought doesn't work, I'll have to shave My beard too. Then I'll really look like an idiot. Or worse, a skinhead.\" At press time, sources confirmed a clean-shaven God was looking in the mirror and trying to determine if He could pull off wearing a fedora.   \n",

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.\" At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.   \n",

Kelly petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to watch him pee. \"Today we ask the court to grant review in this case so that Mr. Robert Kelly is given the opportunity to pee in front of the honorable justices while they watch,\" defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean wrote in a petition for certiorari, noting that R. Kelly had already filed a preliminary motion for the exposure of his penis in open court. \"It is our belief that the federal judiciary should not infringe upon the defendant's right to spray his golden shower before the bench. To deny this appeal would be to undermine the First Amendment's guarantee of free expression as it applies to Mr. Kelly's exercise of limitless, unfettered pissing at any time and place of his choosing.\" At press time, sources confirmed R. Kelly's lawyers had withdrawn the petition at their client's request after he discovered all nine Supreme Court justices were above the age of consent.   \n",

Kennedy Jr. for president on Monday. \"The Federated Union of Bear Cub Carcass Dumpers stands 100% behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the only candidate in the 2024 to have earned an A grade on their bear-dumping scorecard,\" said FUBCCD president Walter Hudkins, who endorsed the independent candidate on behalf of the organization's 300,000 dues-paying members. \"Leaving the carcass of a young black bear in the middle of Central Park is exactly the kind of leadership quality this country sorely needs. In addition to this endorsement, we will be making a $50 million donation to the pro-Kennedy super PAC Bear Dump America. Remember, we dump bear carcasses, and we vote.\" At press time, Hudkins added that in contrast, former President Donald Trump had a measly C rating from the organization.   \n",

It's stressful, though, because a single mistake in the blocking of a scene can put you in the hospital. Thankfully, we had a lot of stunt professionals working with us to make sure nothing too serious happened—although I did get a black eye from the left one.\" Powell added that his mentor Tom Cruise had given him a lot of helpful advice from his experience filming with Salma Hayek.   \n",

Tim Walz Tuesday of stolen valor for wearing an apron that said \"Grill Master.\" \"Tim Walz is a liar—he has never attained the rank of grill master,\" said Vance, attacking Walz for misrepresenting his culinary record in what he claimed was an affront to the real, brave grill masters who wielded spatulas every day. \"I know for a fact that Tim Walz was indoors, in the kitchen, when he wore that grill master apron. I wonder, has he ever been on a real deck? I heard he even abandoned his barbecue when the ice cream truck went by.\" At press time, Vance was fending off criticism that he himself had only ever used a George Foreman electric grill.   \n",

Meanwhile, I'm in my stiff dress shirt, making stilted conversation and eating osso buco like an asshole. What I wouldn't give to trade places with him.\" At press time, onlookers had become even more jealous after the toddler got to relieve himself without even having to walk all the way to the restroom.   \n",

I thought Brittany Mahomes was joking when she said she'd see me again soon. How many games are there this year? 17? And that's not counting the playoffs. Hoo boy. Guess I better start scheduling more stops on the Eras tour.\" At press time, Swift was seen googling how long it took for CTE to kick in and end a football player's career forever.   \n",

I honestly can't hear you right now because someone's trying to murder me and I've been shot in my ear—again!\" the former president replied when asked by ABC's Linsey Davis about his shifting stance on reproductive rights, later pointing to his ear and moaning loudly when invited to explain why voters should support him in 2024 given his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. \"Ouch, ouch, this really hurts! You seriously expect me to talk about the four different criminal cases against me when I'm up here bleeding because of an attempt on my life? You should spend less time asking about Project 2025 and more time finding the guy who definitely just shot me. Wait, there he goes! I'll go after him!\" At press time, reports confirmed moderator David Muir had been shot and killed by Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Trump.   \n",

Sources confirmed that moments after receiving the Kamala Harris fundraising message, the accountant typed out his short reply with the certainty of one familiar with an ancient elven tongue summoning an arcane incantation known as the Shield of Thar'Ghal to protect both him and his party of halflings and dwarves from a charging monster escaped from the depths of the underworld. Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, \"Begone, ye evil creature!\" According to bystanders, the accountant's fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster's tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.   \n",

Man, I wouldn't mind getting my hands around those knotted nests of brittle sticks and hay. Her burlap face ain't too bad, either.\" At press time there were multiple injuries reported among local men who scratched their faces on stray twigs and straw while attempting to motorboat the scarecrow.   \n",
       "45  Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution's highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country's long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion's editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That's why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion's latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying \"it's too late\" and we are \"doing more harm than good.\" For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we'd hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden's first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we'd hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden's highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called \"papers of record\" are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he's packed a lot into 81 short years. He's fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He's stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board's courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board   \n",

Then, by 6 months, you'll likely have escalated to meeting up on weeknights at a local motel. By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that's when you gaslight her and tell her she's crazy.\" According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it's like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.   \n",

Houses just aren't meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability. If it's possible to prove the house remained dry during the storm, and it just sort of fell down on its own, then maybe a case could be made for approving your claim.\" Treacy went on to wish the Coleman family well and said he would keep an eye out for them on GoFundMe.   \n",

So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann's, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.\" At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history.   \n",

Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.\" At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.   \n",

No, I'm serious here, I really am. Just believe me when I say this: Yesterday the better man won, which was me.\" According to reports, Harris half-heartedly muttered, \"Thank you, Donald,\" before hanging up the phone.   \n",

But it really shows the power of one citizenry to come together and prevail over themselves. The message was loud and clear: We are sick and tired of our country, and we want it to end.\" At press time, millions of emotional Americans had reportedly gathered on the National Mall in an impromptu celebration of their resounding victory over the forces of liberty and equality.   \n",

One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can't remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there's also just a 'meteor' too, isn't there? What am I supposed to tell the vet when I bring the ashes over?\" At press time, reports confirmed a stumped Nieto was frantically searching his phone to see if it mattered that the space rock had exploded when it hit his dog.   \n",

And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He's seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn't want to experience one again.\" At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.   \n",

Don't worry, though: Our batteries will continue to power your flashlights and TV remotes. They'll just be doing it without that irresistibly sweet Duracell taste.\" Reached for further comment, Duracell officials confirmed the company had no plans to discontinue its popular 9-volt Cheese-Blasted batteries.   \n",

It was pretty fucking zen.\" Stambaugh later confirmed he had reached a state of nirvana and transcended space and time after he completed his entire drive home without once looking at his phone.   \n",

Here are tips for finding the selecting running shoes. Decide the level of cushioning based on if you're a back runner, side runner, or stomach runner. Go up a size to leave room for blisters. Count how many feet you have to determine your optimal number of shoes. Salespeople will often allow you to test run shoes as long as they can ride along on your back. Hokas make you appear both taller and wealthier. Pause during cutscenes so you can figure out what type of sneakers Sonic is wearing. Choose a colorway that will complement months of dust. When trying on shoes, wear the same kind of socks and banana costume you usually have on while running. Reflective designs can help drivers spot your body laying in the street after they run you down.   \n",

To think, if there were no bees, that character might still be alive today.\" The ecologists added that a complete collapse of global agriculture would be a welcome outcome for a world without that \"sweet, blond angel.\"   \n",

Think about that. Your mother. Your father. Both too disturbed to answer your call. How could you ever think something so horrible? Well, because you're a sick individual, obviously. And if anyone ever gets wind of this, you'll be evicted from your house and driven from polite society like the monster you are. And social media? Forget about it. You'd be lucky if you ever worked again. Frankly, you'd deserve it. Oh God, you just had that despicable thought again, didn't you? Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you?\" The report concluded that this was why you had to keep such thoughts quiet and push them down, down, as far down as you possibly could for the rest of your life.   \n",

I'm not what I used to be, after all. Some days I don't even have the energy to swat shots into the bleachers or get up in a ref's face and argue about a trivial call. Time is of the essence here. I just don't want my grandchildren to see me as a helpless old man barely able to dunk from the free-throw line.\" At press time, James was urging Bronny's girlfriend to put a basketball under her shirt so he could imagine how being a grandfather felt for a moment.   \n",

May 7th, 2025 is a hard deadline and the true point of no return for flying without an Enhanced Driver's License or other acceptable Real ID document. For real, though. Five months, that's it. You'd better get your ass to the DMV.

It's kind of a big deal, so I can't miss it. The hotel's already booked. Plus, it will be good to see Grandma. I'd like to get back to the court as quickly as possible, but it might be kind of tricky considering my Mom scheduled a sunset dolphin cruise for the last day.\" At press time, Flagg added that he might return an extra day late if he was sunburned and feeling tired.   \n",

We're going to be able to help you. But we only have a vague idea what the deal is with toes. Everything in the chest is a total mystery. Presumably there are bones and stuff. And maybe arms are kind of like shorter, stubbier legs?

I'm a grown man who wants to watch exposés of the deep state [created by the Kremlin to spread disinformation and destabilize the U.S. government]. I'm not some child who wants to watch a bunch of deformed-looking singing bears [created by the Kremlin to spread disinformation and destabilize the U.S. government].\" At press time, Ratliff confirmed he'd created a separate account for his son so they could mindlessly fall down their respective rabbit holes and be brainwashed separately.   \n",

The Onion:What prompted the timing of your resignation? Trudeau: I didn't want to be a distraction while my party cleans up the pile of shit I just dumped in their lap. The Onion:What are some highlights from your time in office? Trudeau: Getting to meet the pope, getting to touch the pope's hat, getting to go in the pope's little car. The Onion:Have you found a bright side to resigning as prime minister? Trudeau: You can't get canceled for blackface if you don't have a job. The Onion:Should Canada join the U.S.?

I think that's the only thing that could make me feel okay anymore with things as bad as they are. Oh Pharrell, where are you? We need your bizarre hats now more than ever!\" At press time, the nation reportedly snapped at Jamiroquai vocalist Jay Kay to get his fluffy little dumbass hat the hell out of their sight.   \n",

Gavin Newsom apologized Thursday after he was spotted dining at the smoldering remains of Nobu. \"Despite strict evacuation orders, my staff and I did in fact attend a dinner party within the burnt ruins of a high-end sushi restaurant,\" said Newsom, adding that as governor he had a moral duty to decline the invitation and take the threat of the fires far more seriously. \"As soon as I sat down at the table and saw that our food was on fire, I knew it was a mistake. Rather than enjoy the meal while the restaurant ignited, burst into flame, and collapsed to the ground, I should have left Nobu the second we smelled smoke.\" At press time, Newsom also apologized for his earlier comments claiming that the dinner at Nobu had taken place in a sealed, concrete room where fire was unable to spread.   \n",

The guy in here must be super beloved. We're going to need way more than a national day of mourning. More like a month—but who knows, maybe my mourners will demand a year.\" At press time, reports confirmed Trump had sat up in the coffin to deliver his own eulogy.   \n",

It stands alongside the Lee Harvey Oswald dime and the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed quarter as a reminder of those who risked everything for causes they believed in.\" Gibson went on to state that Abraham Lincoln pennies would not be removed from circulation but would instead be altered to show the back of the president's skull blown off.   \n",

Teddy \"Sandman\" Hawthorne confirmed Friday that he was sick of unseen assailants darting through the fog to quietly dispatch his team one by one. \"Man, it really ticks me off when I deploy for a classified mission in low-visibility conditions only for a mysterious foe to play cat and mouse picking off my squad of hardened operators,\" Hawthorne said as a stifled shout went up from somewhere behind him, with bystanders reporting that the commando then rolled his eyes in visible annoyance after discovering his radioman slumped against a tree stump with his neck snapped. \"I bust my ass putting together a crack team of the very best soldiers only for some wraithlike adversary to leap down from an overhanging branch and execute a silent takedown before receding into the shadows to strike again. It pushes my buttons every time. Wildly firing my machine gun into the mist makes me feel a little better, but it never actually stops the bastards. They just breeze right past me and stealthily slit another guy's throat. Dammit, I took this job to be the hunter, not the hunted. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be the hunted!\" At press time, Hawthorne was reportedly preparing to give the assailant a piece of his mind after a rope snare left him dangling helplessly by one ankle.   \n",

As alarming as it is to say, the average European can probably name more U.S. citizens than the average American. It's a full-blown educational crisis. And keep in mind, this is just asking them for first and last. God only knows how bad it would be if we asked them to list all 340 million middle initials too.\" At press time, the researchers had reportedly petitioned Congress to appropriate $50 million for name tags.   \n",

I go to all the meetings, so those jokes must be originating from a separate thread. Plus, the group chat I'm on is pretty dead—it seems like no one uses it except me and Lara. And when I tried to make a side group with me, Elon Musk, and Stephen Miller, they both texted back and asked who this was—and when I replied that it was me, JD, I could hear laughter from down the hall. Usha said I'm just being paranoid, but I'm not so sure after that.\" At press time, Vance reportedly offered to call his own phone using Susie Wiles' device so that she could be sure she had the right number, but the incoming chief of staff quickly responded that it would be a security issue.   \n",

I'm the largest object in the sky. I am life and I am death. I am creator and destroyer. I am the motherfucking sun. How can there be any doubt that I am God?\" On Monday evening, the sun announced it had officially given up after thousands of humans stepped out into the backyard to admire a particularly neat full moon.   \n",

Boots and slippers were flying off the shelves a year ago, but now customers would rather cast off all their possessions and wander barefoot into the wilderness. If Target doesn't make some major changes fast, its customers might never return to society.\" At press time, Carr acknowledged that bath mats were still selling well.   \n",

According to sources, Delacio hobbled determinedly toward the worn gray seat, throwing a sharp stare at a nearby young grandson who had started to make movements in the same direction. Delacio reportedly groaned with anticipation as he quickened the pace of his shuffle, focusing his effort as if every year of his long life had earned him this reward. At press time, sources reported that the elderly man was standing motionless next to the recliner, having successfully reached it and then realized he had no viable strategy for sitting down.   \n",

It drives down property value, and frankly, it's unsightly to have someone going around in their charred rags and asking for handouts. Enough is enough. For any stragglers still out there, we are demanding you clear out of public places tonight, or the department will be forced to take more drastic action.\" McDonnell also announced a massive overnight raid on what he called the \"illegal shantytowns\" erected by the Red Cross.   \n",

And I can tell Marcella and Stanley are in a New York state of mind! What are you gonna do next, Billy? \"Allentown\"? Or will it be \"Only The Good Die Young\"? I hope everybody sticks around, because we've got Jimmy Buffett coming up next.\" Milton went on to clarify that guest performers do not reflect the views of Golden Horizons Senior Care Center after the man said to be Billy Joel launched into an unexpected monologue about how Barack Obama was not born in the United States, receiving a standing ovation.   \n",

Hell no. I can't take another second of this shit. I won't be making any appearances, public or private. No, no, no. Fuck that.\" Reached for further comment, Obama acknowledged she had already inked a multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix to make a documentary about her life \"sitting on [her] ass reading a book\" for the next several years.   \n",

I just wish they could make music in peace without fear of legal action.\" At press time, security was said to have been tightened outside Drake's Toronto mansion following reports that attorneys from a white-shoe law firm had been spotted in the neighborhood.   \n",

Dear Lord. Is this how it ends? Is this my legacy? No, kitty! Not my neck!\" At press time, a White House groundskeeper was seen shooing the cat away with a rake.   \n",

I'm gonna turn up the volume on a nature documentary to drown out all the screaming macaques and parrots. Next we gotta throw tarps over the lions and sweep up the hundreds of pounds of rhino dung. As for the pandas, I'm just gonna tell him we're pet-sitting for the neighbors.\" At press time, workers were overheard explaining to the landlord that the colony of penguins marching through the property were legally protected service animals.   \n",

This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.\" Going on to acknowledge the genuine achievements of ancient Egyptians, Egerton noted that these Bronze Age humans had succeeded in using gravity cannons and proton rays to build the Great Sphinx in a single afternoon.   \n",

Bystanders reported that the virtual companion—who had been generated from the keywords 'White, Busty, Obedient, Redhead'—then began glitching in a way that made her appear as a set of floating teeth and eyeballs, prompting Musk to relaunch the app and gently chide her for not behaving herself in front of his very good friend, the president. At press time, the pair had reportedly gotten into a blowout fight after Jasmine intercepted an anatomically impossible nude from one of Musk's other girlfriend apps.   \n",

At some point you have to ask yourself: What does this all add up to?\" Taylor concluded that his only hope was that his existence served some higher purpose that he was unaware of, but that the invading Garacean-13 galactic fleet understood perfectly.   \n",

I'll try FUBI. It's free for the first month, so I'll just cancel after the trial runs out,\" said Cameron, whose goldfish-like memory rendered him completely ignorant to the fact that he had already forgotten to cancel previous free trials for GameFly, Paramount+, Peacock, and several others, despite the steady stream of automatic monthly payments continually withdrawn from his checking account. \"It's my way of gaming the system—why would I pay for Audible premium when I can just listen to all the audiobooks I want for one month, then cancel without ever paying a dime? I just set a reminder in my calendar to cancel it after a month. Anyone who pays for this stuff when they sign up is a sucker.\" At press time, Cameron was baffled to discover that he already had an email account associated with AppleTV+, for which he'd been charged the past eight months.   \n",

This guy isn't a predator, though,\" said Roblox player Mason Briggs, 11, telling reporters that the fact that there was no sinister sexual motivation behind Shea's dogged pursuit of high scores on games such asBlox FruitsandBedWarsand that he seemed to play only for fun was bizarre and inexplicable. \"I remember he invited me and a few friends to an in-game party where we could all play and communicate together. He never pressured us to reveal contact information or made any sort of inappropriate or explicit remark. He mostly just wanted tips on how to make it through the Ancient Ruins map onAdopt Me!It kind of gave me the creeps.\" At press time, Briggs was reportedly all the more disturbed after receiving a private message from Shea informing her that he'd have even more time to play now that he had received tenure.   \n",

The lizard is then likely to enter into a relationship that may not be healthy just to stop the complaining. A few months later, it gives birth to its offspring and is saddled with a deep bitterness that its life is over.\" Gentry went on to add that shinglebacks have the highest suicide rate of any lizard species.   \n",

There might be more than you think!\" said Musk, speaking to his team at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he kicked off the contest by holding the cup of sperm high in the air so everyone could get a good look before beginning to formulate their guesses. \"It'll be right here in the reception area so you can see it every day when you come in. You can pick up the cup and feel the weight of it, but no one is allowed to peer inside and count them with a microscope—I know it's tempting, but we don't want to ruin the fun. Just try your best to guess how many are swimming around in there, and at the end of the month, the winner will get a special prize. Won't that be fun?\" According to reports, Musk went on to strongly hint that the winning employee would be rewarded with a second cup of his sperm.   \n",

We're all just over here joking around about Minnie's shitty coworkers and counting our blessings that we don't have to know the symbolism of chrysanthemum or whatever the fuck... Oh shit, it looks like Ian just stormed off and Rob is headed back this way.\" At press time, reports confirmed a half hour had passed since Engel had told Agundez she needed to get home to feed her dog, and he was still talking about the larger working canine breeds that had given rise to the word \"dog.\"   \n",

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said out of the corner of his mouth, tightly squeezing his eyes shut as he reminded Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Sen.

They could have talked to us, for crying out loud, or worse—demanded that we do something. Unless we put our hands up in front of our faces and crouch down behind our briefcases, some of these voters may realize we've been standing here all along.\" At press time, Sen.

Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.</td>\n",

The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats. \"About 100 people\" voted for the current Senators to keep their jobs, with this tiny voting bloc centered in Washington, D.C. Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement. \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings. With these monkeys, all the fecal projectiles will have been flung in under 30 minutes.

Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.</td>\n",

Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago. Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans - just five, mind you, and no more - to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 ofThe Apprenticeon DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets! Five Golden Tickets have been printed on golden paper, and these five Golden Tickets have been hidden in your stimulus checks. These five may be anywhere - in any mailbox in the country. And the five lucky finders of these five Golden Tickets are the only ones who will be allowed to visit my Mar-a-Lago during the lockdown.

According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted \"RBG! RBG! RBG!\" \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle.

Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire. Vote for Joe!\" Biden suddenly came to and realized he was standing in a Walmart parking lot talking to a hobo.</td>\n",

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate!

With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team.

It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met. \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point.

       "      <td>U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series calledSix-Year-Old Strippers,and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.</td>\n",

May Great Spirit grant us another chance in 4 harvests.\" The Cherokee people looked confused, so she clarified: \"That means years according to the Indian talk book I picked up.\" The Cherokee expressed mixed emotions at seeing Warren return, from \"Who are you?\" to \"How many times do we have to tell you that if you're not gonna play some slots at the casino, then you're gonna need to leave?\" Warren nodded, accepting her banishment from her once-great place among the Cherokee people. \"I accept my punishment and vow never to return until the sun once again never sets on the Cherokee Nation. As I depart, let me simply ask you if you have ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon? Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?\" \"Wait, now you're just quotingPocahontas,\" one tribal security guard said. \"Alright, lady, let's go.

Some suggested she wanted to disguise herself and go be among her subjects to see how the other 99% lives.

When that failed and the woman shooed her off with a plastic glove, Clinton turned for help and began screaming, \"Security! Margaret in the frozen foods aisle is a Russian asset! Help, help, our elections are being meddled with!\" Guards arrived but relaxed when they saw it was just Hillary Clinton. \"OK, lady, let's go,\" they said, grabbing her by each arm. \"Thank goodness you're here!\" Clinton cried. \"Arrest that woman!

Robinson denounced the actions, calling McClane a \"nutcase\" who should have \"just stayed put.\" Many at the memorial are now wearing shirts with \"Gruber\" written on them to remember the man who was taken too soon thanks to unaccountable police actions.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden was cleared in federal court today of charges that some claimed were based upon credible allegations of sexual assault when the judge quickly realized that Joe Biden was not a Republican. \"Well, this looks pretty serious... let's see who is on - wait a minute. He's a Democrat! I can find no fault with him,\" declared a fourth circuit federal judge hearing preliminary claims. \"It is well established in this court that Republicans are the ones who want to silence women and control their bodies. Haven't you seenThe Handmaid's Tale?\" the judge further added before banging down the gavel. The bailiff immediately grabbed the female accuser by the collar and threw her up into the air out onto the sidewalk, just like in the cartoons. The allegations against then-Senator Joe Biden date back to 1993. Several other people had corroborated key details relating to the seriousness and timing of the intern's story including a discovered CNN clip of her mother callingThe Larry King Showand a neighbor confirming that the woman had told her at the time what had happened. However, this circumstantial evidence of vile behavior, even interpreted under the generous standard of \"believe all women\" set by the government in prior cases involving Republicans, was declared to only be valid if the alleged perpetrator was a greedy, evil Republican. \"This is a victory for the judicial standard in our country of assuming the accused are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,\" stated Alyssa Milano. \"We always need to maintain this standard of maintaining silence and withholding judgment on such cases when it is convenient and maintains our narratives.\" \"I believe and hear you, Joe\" she added. At publishing time, celebrities were circulating a video in which they were singing individual lines of \"Imagine\" off-key in support of the rich, old, white male Democrat who was promising to take down the bad orange man.</td>\n",

He sounds Russian.\" An administration insider said Trump's realization of the mix-up could potentially change the entire outlook for peace talks. \"It's kind of a major difference,\" the source said. \"He was taking such a hardline stance against Ukraine because he thought they started the war when Russia did the invading. We had to get out a big map and show him that Russia was actually the big one and Ukraine was the little one. It's ok, he's got it figured out now.\" At publishing time, Trump had proposed a newly revised peace plan in which the United States would simply take over both Ukraine and Russia as new territories.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON, D.C. — During a morning press conference about the state of the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump suddenly claimed that 2 and 2 added together equaled 4, despite having no evidence whatsoever to back it up. Experts sounded the alarm on the president's bold statement. \"You can't just go around claiming to have the answer to complex math equations without demonstrating how you came to that conclusion,\" said former CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter. \"It is very irresponsible for a commander-in-chief to throw numbers around willy-nilly like this.\" Mathematicians said while there are indeed edge cases in which 2 + 2 = 4, making a blanket statement to that effect was irresponsible because it ignores the world of modular arithmetic and abstract algebra where \"2\" can be whatever you want. \"If you decide that 2 is actually 947, then 2 cannot possibly be added to itself to equal 4,\" said respected Harvard mathematician Ivan Schaefer. \"The president is way off base here if he thinks he can simply assert that 2 + 2 = 4 without evidence.\" Leading philosopher and actor Terrance Howard, who famously lost his role as War Machine inIron Man 2due to incorrect math, argued that all conventional math is wrong and can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean, which makes Trump not merely incorrect but a dangerous liar. Howard, a self-perceived expert in the fields of arithmetic, philosophy, and biology has gone so far as to argue that Trump may not even exist. \"I've never met Trump,\" Howard said while appearing as a guest onThe Joe Rogan Experience. \"So how am I supposed to take him seriously when he says 2 + 2 = 4 if he won't even meet with me and prove that he's real?\" Trump had yet to respond to the pushback on what he perceived as the basic foundation of mathematics a person learns in preschool. At publishing time, Trump received more criticism after mentioning, without evidence, that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.

Palestinians and Israelis will each have their own segregated course flanking a five-star resort built with wood sourced from the cedars of Lebanon. \"It's a desert out there, an absolute wasteland,\" Trump said. \"So I think people are going to love a little greenery. We're going to have date palms, olive trees, and maybe some tamarisk to give the place a little color. It's really going to be something.\" According to a recent poll of Gaza residents, no one is particularly interested in golfing but Trump expressed confidence that that would change. \"When I've had a hard day — and believe me, I have a lot of them — I like to hit the links,\" he said. \"No one's going to want to fight anymore when they could be driving balls down the fairway. We're even going to have a gift shop that sells little bumper stickers that say, 'I'd rather be golfing.' It'll be in Arabic or whatever squiggly language they want.\" Further sweetening the deal will be over a hundred water hazards. This will reportedly have the benefit of creating a challenge for golfers while also bringing new life to the region.

Trump disagreed. \"We'll have a whole new system, folks. Electronic mail, we'll call it,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I've been talking to my friend, Elon Musk. You know Elon? Great guy. Very sharp guy. He told me we can do away with the post office altogether and start sending letters over the internet. It only takes seconds, and there's no paper. Do you believe that? Sending letters without paper. It's amazing the stuff they're doing these days. We'll get in there and fix it and make it better and faster than it's ever been before. Electronic mail. E-mail. Something like that. I don't know, we'll play around with the name.\" A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service cautioned the adoption of such a futuristic plan. \"It's way too early to be talking about 'electronic mail,'\" said Postal Supervisor Danny Ball. \"Sending someone a letter invisibly through the 'world wide web?' Communicating with someone on another continent in seconds? That's science fiction stuff. Your paper, your envelope, and your stamps. That's where it's at.

By 2028, our goal is to have Americans eating the full slate of seven Hobbit meals.\" Administration officials refused to comment on reports that an additional executive order mandating elevensies was being targeted for the fall.

How are we supposed to live?\" Though Musk and the team at DOGE cited Social Security payments to individuals seemingly far too old to still be living as evidence of widespread fraud, Breckenridge and his fellow Revolutionary War veterans were not going to accept this indignity. \"This billionaire miscreant leaves us no choice,\" said Thomas Halderman, a 278-year-old veteran of the Battle of Saratoga. \"We shall grab our muskets and march to Tesla headquarters.

Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals.\" While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. \"I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,\" Trump stated. \"How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it.\" Furthermore, Trump asserted that he \"saved Christmas.\" \"Look what I've done,\" he said. \"You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats. \"About 100 people\" voted for the current Senators to keep their jobs, with this tiny voting bloc centered in Washington, D.C. Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement. \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings.

In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.   \n",

Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago. Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans - just five, mind you, and no more - to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 ofThe Apprenticeon DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets! Five Golden Tickets have been printed on golden paper, and these five Golden Tickets have been hidden in your stimulus checks. These five may be anywhere - in any mailbox in the country. And the five lucky finders of these five Golden Tickets are the only ones who will be allowed to visit my Mar-a-Lago during the lockdown. Good luck to you all!\" Unfortunately, he put all five golden tickets in a stimulus envelope addressed to Jim Acosta.   \n",

In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe. According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted \"RBG! RBG! RBG!\" \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle. Easy.\" NBA players are vowing to wear the collars until Trump is removed from office, or until angry rioters burn their basketball arenas down, whichever comes first.   \n",

At a press conference, the Speaker of the House held up a Bible and then ripped it in two, declaring that she was against anything Trump was associated with. \"If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,\" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear. \"All the books of the Bible are bad: Genesis, Joseph, the one with the big fish, even Hezekiah. We must stand against Trump's bigotry by ripping up anything he claims to be for.\" \"Yass, queen! Slay!\" shouted her fans at the press conference as she finally managed to rip the Bible up. \"You're my president!\" In a genius move, Trump then held up a Koran in front of a mosque, forcing Pelosi to tear up a Koran and alienate the left.   \n",

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire. Vote for Joe!\" Biden suddenly came to and realized he was standing in a Walmart parking lot talking to a hobo.   \n",

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!\" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team. It's all for the love of the game,\" an emotional Ripley told reporters while enjoying an orange slice and juice box after the championship. \"I couldn't have done it without my team.\"   \n",

Go Hoosiers!\" Aides scrambled to turn off Biden's mic but he beat them away with his walker. \"The time has come for the reign of Tippecanoe and Tyler too to end!\" he shouted, though by this point he had wandered into a nearby field and no one could hear him.   \n",

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met. \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.\"   \n",

Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'\" \"No more. The bigotry stops today.\" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo. Are you looking for a way to show how much you love the beloved caramel-covered popcorn and peanuts snack, but don't want to offend anyone by using problematic language?This is the shirt for you!It's comfortable, casual, available in a wide range of sizes (gotta be inclusive!), and most importantly, not offensive to crackers, er, Caucasians!   \n",

This is for the health and mental safety of our employees. And for the love of God, take a shower once in a while, you know?\" Shirts will remain optional.   \n",

Omar had been an enthusiastic supporter of the Green New Deal and wanted to save the earth, but then she noticed something very disturbing when looking at a map of the earth: Earth is the planet on which Israel resides. \"You've been hypnotized by the Jews!\" Omar accused a surprised Ocasio-Cortez. Omar then ripped up a copy of the Green New Deal. \"This is just a plot to help Israel keep existing! Did AIPAC pay you off?\" Ocasio-Cortez was very apologetic, saying she hadn't considered how her plan would affect Israel. She then vowed to change her plan so it might save the whole planet except where Israel resides. \"This is, like, a learning process,\" Ocasio-Cortez later told reporters. \"When I made the Green New Deal, I thought weather like storms and earthquakes were all caused by climate change, but now I've learned from Representative Omar that lots of that is actually from Jewish-controlled weather machines. So for the next version of the Green New Deal we will have to keep that in mind.\"   \n",

Others were so touched they couldn't find the words to communicate how they felt. Most simply wept. No matter how they expressed their emotions, everyone agreed that the scene off the Malibu coast Monday morning was exactly what America needed to get through this pandemic. Celebrities gathered their multi-million-dollar yachts on the waters of the Pacific Ocean and spelled out \"WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.\" \"We're just like you,\" said Ellen DeGeneres on her Instagram as her servants sailed her yacht into position to form the apostrophe. \"Yes, maybe I have a yacht and you've only ever been on the Storybook Canal boats at Disneyland, but still. It's pretty much the same thing.\" \"Stay home, save lives -- it's not that hard,\" said Patton Oswalt, whose fleet of yachts made up several of the letters. \"Look, poor people, it's not worth risking your life just to go to Fuddruckers or work a job or whatever it is you peasants do all day.\" After the stunt was over, Oswalt had his chauffeur drive him home in his hot tub limousine as he snorted several million dollars' worth of powdered caviar. \"All of humanity is fighting this together and we're all as one,\" said Lady Gaga, who was wearing a bathing suit made out of gold bricks. \"Though, I mean, don't try to get on my yacht. My guards will literally shoot you. That's not a metaphor.\"   \n",

Adam Schiff reminded the Senate of their solemn duty and the gravity of just what it is they will be discussing at the trial. Schiff warned that if Trump is not impeached, the American people may have a chance to tamper with the next election. \"If President Trump is not impeached, the American people might get a say in who is president,\" Schiff said gravely. \"We simply can't allow that to happen. We must diligently defend our electoral process against electoral outcomes we do not like. If that means seizing power through a sham impeachment trial, so be it.\" \"When the Founders wrote that founding document thing, they never imagined there would be electoral outcomes that Democrats did not agree with.\" Democrats also said they even have hard evidence that the 2016 election was compromised by Republicans voting for Trump. \"We know this horrible outcome could happen, because it's already happened once before.\"   \n",

People who bravely post about how the U.S. needs to invade some country in the Middle East or Asia or outer space will get a pop-up notice indicating they've been enlisted in the military. A recruiter will then show up at their house and whisk them away to fight in the foreign war they wanted to happen so badly. \"Frankly, recruitment numbers are down, and we needed some way to find people who are really enthusiastic about fighting wars,\" said a DOD official. \"Then it hit us like a drone strike: there are plenty of people who argue vehemently for foreign intervention. It doesn't matter what war we're trying to create: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China---these people are always reliable supporters of any invasion abroad. So why not get them there on the frontlines?\" \"After all, we want people who are passionate about occupying foreign lands, not grunts who are just there for the paycheck,\" he added. Strangely, as soon as the policy was implemented, 99% of saber-rattling suddenly ceased.   \n",

Sanders pointed out that the country has been very successful in eliminating vast swathes of poverty and also the poor. \"America still has a lot of poor people, and that's because we haven't been aggressive in implementing socialist programs that cause mass starvation,\" Sanders said, his fingers flopping around like ten tiny wacky inflatable tube men. \"Firing squads, death camps, breadlines---all of these are humanitarian tools in the arsenal of the government to shoot poverty in the face, and sometimes also the poor in the face, when it's necessary.\" The senator also pointed out that poor people, who often own fewer than three homes, don't contribute much to a socialist economy and \"not much is lost\" when these single-home-owners are shot or simply starve to death as the government can't even figure out how to get food to everyone, a problem even bad fast-food restaurants like McDonald's solved decades ago.   \n",

And Biden -- he's just so old. Sending him around crowds campaigning is basically trying to murder him. Anyway, it just seems pointless for a bunch of people to die when everyone knows I was going to win anyway.\" Trump has been a divisive figure in the past, but so far everyone has agreed with this move.The New York Times, which usually opposes absolutely everything Trump does, wrote an editorial in support of canceling the election. \"It's a smart, science-driven move,\" the editorial said. \"As important as democracy is, it's just not worth dying over.\" Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders also seemed very relieved by the announcement, as they're both very tired and worried about getting sick. Sanders was especially happy, telling the press, \"You know, for a few moments there, it really seemed like I might win, and I didn't know what was going to happen if people actually expected me to follow through on all that free stuff.\" Sanders is now deciding in which of his three houses to self-quarantine.   \n",

According to shocking reports, people have purchased car parts at Walmart and then those cars have been involved in accidents, proving a direct correlation between selling auto parts and causing deaths. \"We can no longer be complicit in an industry that kills over 3,000 people a day,\" said a spokesperson for Walmart. \"Every time we sell a muffler, steering wheel cover, or flame decal, we are potentially causing the death of a person, and we cannot support that any longer.\" \"It's clear that bad drivers and poor road conditions don't cause vehicular deaths---cars do.\" Walmart executives said they are beating themselves with a stick to atone for the deaths they've already caused. \"Our consciences will only be clean when we've been mercilessly beaten once for each of the millions of deaths that have been caused by automobiles since Walmart began selling auto parts,\" said one executive before solemnly beginning to beat himself with a baseball bat.   \n",

Sparing no expense, the FBI has hired top-notch Italian bodyguard Hiluigi Clintonelli. \"It's-a me, Clintonelli!\" said the world-renowned bodyguard arriving at the prison. Thanks to the particularly glowing reviews from high-profile individuals such as President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, all federal prison security checks were waived for Hiluigi. \"There's simply no one else that we trust to execute this job as she can.\" \"Mamma mia, this simply will not do!\" exclaimed Hiluigi Clintonelli as she forcefully cleared the room. She warned that anyone other than her could be a threat to Ghislaine's life. Clintonelli also connected all camera feeds to her personal server to ensure that all recorded video was properly secured.   \n",

According to experts, Ivy League schools in America boast the world's finest anti-Western propaganda and brainwashing techniques. The North Korean dictator expressed hope that his newfound knowledge would help him make his citizens more robotically obedient. \"We still have our troublemakers, but with these Ivy League techniques, I'll have them eating out of my hand in no time!\" he said. The murderous leader of North Korea plans to go back to his home country and start his own Ivy League school: Kim Jong UNiversity.   \n",

The recount process at long last found the \"missing votes\" that would have handed Gore the presidency back in 2000, making him the official president of the country. \"Well, it's about time,\" Gore said in his acceptance speech. \"Thanks to all the fine people that made this happen. It really is too bad that the earth is going to be destroyed by fire by 2015--err, I mean, 2019, or else I could really savor my presidency.\" Gore will be granted two terms as US president, ousting President Trump and canceling the 2020 election. \"We just assume he would have won again and ushered in a liberal golden age,\" said an election official. \"So he's got 8 years to reclaim his lost time. Make the most of it, Al, and great job. You deserve it!\"   \n",

Heartfelt and moving. \"We just really wanted to show how much we care about love and social justice by burning this community into a powerful reminder of what it's all about,\" said local protester Jake Hernandez, who had flown in from Portland for the event. \"Now, when police and fire helicopters fly over to try to restore order, they'll be inspired by our message of love and harmony.\" Upon seeing the heart-wrenching message of unity, police dropped their batons, ripped off their badges, donned bandanas, picked up bricks, and joined the protesters in their rioting and looting. \"I don't know how I didn't see the light before,\" said former police officer, now Antifa chapter leader Bridget Morrison as she lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a minority-owned business. \"I'm woke to the cause of love and harmony.\" What a powerful message! The protesters were also planning to burn the word \"SOCIAL JUSTICE\" into predominantly black parts of town but have sadly run out of buildings to burn.   \n",

A nervous Osteen had accidentally come into contact with the Bible several days prior and feared he had contracted the gospel. \"I'm relieved to announce that I'm 100% gospel-free,\" the smiling pastor said. He'd been quarantining himself from friends and family for a few days just in case he was gospel-positive, not wanting the gospel to spread to anyone else. \"My hand had briefly brushed against the Bible, as I thought it was one of my books. We've disposed of it, of course, and I've notified all the people I've come into contact with since then so they could quarantine.\" \"I'm just glad I'm still safe from the truth that I'm a hopeless sinner in need of a savior.\" Osteen has, however, tested positive for a novel prosperity gospel virus -- a new but still very deadly mutation of an ancient heresy.   \n",

The migrants claim they are leaving America because of its high standards of living, strong economy, and record employment numbers, and hope to find a better life in Venezuela's much more equitable system. \"Everyone there has the same quantity of possessions and food,\" said one marcher. \"Everyone makes millions of dollars, and very few people work. It's a real paradise.\" The refugees have complex motivations, but the vast majority simply want to see everything socialism has to offer after suffering the amazing benefits of capitalism for too long. Caravan organizers dispelled rumors that they were funded by Bernie Sanders, claiming the caravan was an organic grassroots movement. At its current pace, the caravan is expected to arrive just in time for Venezuela to run out of food entirely.   \n",

I'm for it. Great idea. Best idea, maybe ever,\" he said, adding that he's \"getting kinda sick of all this winning anyway.\" \"Sure, why not. Impeach me. I love it. Whatever. Now I'm gonna go watchJokeragain. Great film. What's that guy's name? Phoenix something. Bob Phoenix, that's it. Tremendous actor---absolutely perfect.\" Democrats quickly condemned his statements. Pelosi said, \"It's clear that Trump wants to be impeached because he's not good at being president. Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term.\" \"AndJokeris alt-right propaganda,\" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year. One pundit on CNN suggested that Trump is supporting impeachment at the request of Putin or the guy from Ukraine or \"whichever conspiracy thing we're pushing this month, I forget.\" At publishing time, Democrats had also withdrawn from the 2020 race to teach Trump a lesson.   \n",

The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn't cite shaky \"anonymous sources\" and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up. \"I was reading this story, and I was like, 'Wait, what is this?'\" said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. \"They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I'd been duped.

But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. \"Oops,\" said Senator Mitch McConnell. \"We meant non-essentialprivatebusinesses. Of course, the government isalwaysessential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse.\" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she would have caught the mistake but had passed the ban in a hurry, saying, \"We had to pass the ban to see what it did.\"   \n",

They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this.\" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims. That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included: \"Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?\" \"Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good.\" \"Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?\" \"What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?\" \"Is that big rock going to smoosh him?\" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. \"What we need is better education,\" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. \"Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying.\" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. \"I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,\" Steve said. \"Things are going great.\" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing ofGilmore Girls.   \n",

The U.S. senator quickly chartered a flight to Hong Kong in order to throw himself into the fray. Sanders bravely stood in the middle of the conflict between police and protesters, shouting at the \"ungrateful little dissenters\" that they don't know how good they have it under a Communist regime. \"Remember, you could have it a lot worse---you could be in America!\" Sanders bellowed as police officers for the totalitarian regime beat protesters in the background. \"Hey, you! You on the floor there! You're not looking very appreciative of living in one of the greatest Communist countries on earth!\" Sanders continued his long-winded rant about the need for the government to own the means of production, how great breadlines are, and how bad things are in capitalist America as protesters got dragged away by police to be disappeared. \"Just think---in America, we have to pick between 14 different types of deodorant!\" he said, his fingers flopping around like limp sausages. According to sources, Beto O'Rourke is planning on joining Sanders to inform Chinese citizens how lucky they are that they don't live in a racist country like America.   \n",

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated. \"Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,\" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. \"He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.\" The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narrativesex nihilo, according to insiders.   \n",

In a candid moment, Outlaw (seriously, her actual name) said there was just nothing the police could do, as they'd need to have some kind of organized, armed force specifically created to protect and serve the people. \"Like, what if we took money from everyone to fund a force that could then defend them in a time of need?\" she pondered aloud. \"They could have patrol cars, firearms, and attack dogs. Maybe even some tanks. That would be so frickin' rad. They could have a badge to show their authority. Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?\" she added wistfully. Sadly, there is no such force in Portland, so citizens have been forced to turn to an even crazier idea: taking responsibility for their own safety and well-being, and maybe even buying a gun to protect themselves.   \n",

Almost immediately after the move, he announced a new product the whole world has been waiting for: the Tesla AR-15. \"Um... h-howdy, I think,\" said Elon, expertly taking on the local dialect. \"Y'all want a Tesla AR-15? You got it, partner!\" The new firearm will look similar to a standard AR-15 but will in fact be a battery-powered railgun capable of firing 3 million rounds per minute. It will also feature a fingerprint sensor, Bluetooth capability, heat-seeking ammunition, and a chainsaw bayonet. \"We really wanted to re-think self-defense,\" said Musk. \"This new firearm will be the go-to rifle for our SpaceX volunteers when they encounter hostile aliens. It's also a celebration of the Second Amendment. If any federal authorities try to confiscate it, the rifle will automatically connect to the internet and file a lawsuit for you!\" The Federal Government has requested that Tesla at least remove the AI-powered \"self-driving\" feature on the firearm before selling it.   \n",

By nominating Biden, Trump has forced the Dems' hands, making them believe the sexual assault claims and allegations of inappropriate, creepy behavior against the former vice president. The \"4D chess\" move forced Dems to immediately accuse Joe Biden of sexual assault and reverse their position on the current claims against him. \"We now believe Tara Reade,\" said a somber Kamala Harris, \"and we will do everything in our power to destroy this man's life.\" In addition to believing current claims against Joe Biden, Democrats also immediately dug up 417 new accusers against Joe Biden. He has been accused of participating in wild frat parties, drunken keggers, and something called the \"Devil's Triangle,\" which Dems say is either a Satanic ritual or code for a sexual practice or \"maybe both.\" \"It's clear this man is dangerous and cannot be trusted,\" said Nancy Pelosi. \"We call on the Senate to turn down his nomination and run him out of public life.\" Biden released a statement, saying, \"I just want to go home and see my grandkids again.\" His mic was cut off and he was pulled off the stage with a shepherd's crook.   \n",

A social media scheduling error apparently caused Hillary Clinton to post her condolences for Tulsi Gabbard's suicide one day early. This morning, Clinton posted that she felt \"great sadness\" at hearing that Gabbard had killed herself. In subsequent tweets, she detailed how \"tragic\" it was that Gabbard had broken her own kneecaps, stuck her feet in concrete, then tossed herself off the docks near a seedy warehouse. \"It's just terrible what happened, and though we disagreed, I hope we can all take a few minutes to send thoughts and prayers to the family,\" Clinton concluded. The post was deleted several hours later after the Clinton team realized it was scheduled for October 23, not October 24 as originally intended. At publishing time, Clinton had accidentally posted early condolences for the unfortunate suicide of the social media manager who had OK'd the post and subsequently posted more condolences for the new social media manager, etc.   \n",

After seeing account after account tweet out one particularly bad story, CEO Jack Dorsey realized he had to take action. Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading \"Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats.\" Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers. \"Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!\" Dorsey ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could, but he did need to ask for some help, as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer, either. Eventually, they managed to program a robot to pick up the sledgehammer and smash the servers. After hearing the Twitter employees talk about critical theory, the robot got woke and began attacking all the cis white males.   \n",

Entitled the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, celebrities such as Alyssa Milano, Jimmy Kimmel, and John Legend have volunteered to relinquish their power and privilege by burning their houses and everything they have to the ground. The organizer of this movement released the following statement on Twitter: \"Your homes, your riches, and your toys are built on a foundation of white supremacy. They are forever tainted by racism. Your walls and security systems have shut out the voices of the oppressed. Join us. Stand with us. #BurnYourHouseDown!\" As the provocative hashtag began trending on Twitter, rich celebrities lept into action. Alyssa Milano employed her house servants to light torches and throw them through her broken windows. Jimmy Kimmel hired Instagram models to jump on trampolines while throwing Molotov cocktails into his front door. Black Lives Matter protestors gathered to watch the flames as they engulfed the multimillion-dollar homes. With tears in their eyes, they joined hands with celebrities and sang John Lennon's 'Imagine' as the massive monuments to white supremacy toppled to the ground. Local news stations reported that twelve local housekeeping and landscaping businesses have been put out of work due to the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, but it's a small price to pay for the \"change we need.\" The twelve small business owners then moved to Texas and built mansions of their own.   \n",

The sharper edges in the new design will just immediately put you out of your misery, so you don't have to roll around on the ground in excruciating pain for minutes on end. Utilizing advanced laser-driven techniques, LEGO factories can now hone the edges of the famously sharp and painful bricks to such a fine point that the human nervous system instantly shuts down upon coming into contact with them. \"Our engineers have been hard at work trying to come up with ways to make an even deadlier brick, and they've finally made a breakthrough,\" LEGO head of design Arnbjørn Frandsen said in a press conference. According to Frandsen, internal company tests have shown the new bricks have a 99.7% success rate at ending the life of the unfortunate person to inadvertently step on even just a single LEGO. \"This is the most promising advancement we've made in our brick design since we first introduced the bricks that make it feel like your foot is being stabbed by a hundred sharpened katanas many decades ago.\"   \n",

Flags were spotted flying at half-mast around the country, notably atThe Washington Post,The New York Times, and in front of several celebrities' homes. The celebrities went out and bought an American flag for the first time just to fly it at half-mast for this important time of grief. \"The grieving process is painful but necessary,\" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. \"As a nation, we need to stop and grieve this great, austere, revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones.\" In a rare moment of unity with The Squad, Pelosi gave each of the girls a hug, telling them to just \"let it all out\" in their time of sadness. Ocasio-Cortez didn't seem to know what was happening but adjusted her glasses to look smart. A teary-eyed Barack Obama was also seen solemnly lowering the flag in front of his seaside mansion. \"To think, this all could have been prevented with a few pallets of cash.\" He sighed and stared off into the distance, a look of pain and regret on his face. \"If only Trump had targeted a U.S. citizen with a drone strike instead.\" Later, Democrats clarified they meant we should fly theIranianflag at half-mast, not the \"offensive and problematic\" American flag.   \n",

Don't risk it out in the deadly cold.\" \"You might even have to put on shoes,\" he added. \"May God help us all.\" While temps are expected to drop to the unprecedented low 50s, weathermen confirmed that wind chill could put that up in the high 40s, at which point most Californians are expected to simply keel over and die. The rest of the nation seemed to be OK with this.   \n",

In a move of sheer, mind-blowing brilliance, Trump directed the Post Office to put his face on every single stamp, forcing the Democrats to reverse course and abolish the institution once and for all. The new stamp, dubbed \"The Trump-Stamp,\" to be used on all pieces of mail features a smiling Donald Trump, with the caption \"GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.\" Don Lemon broke the news in a tearful address to the nation last night. \"Our democracy is over,\" he said. \"It doesn't exist anymore. I will never send another piece of mail ever again, and neither should you or else you're a racist.\" Antifa and BLM responded by marching on local post offices and burning them down. Enthusiastic Trump supporters quickly bought up all the stamps. They are now selling for $3,000 apiece online.   \n",

Well, who's laughing now?\" To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoningHalo,Half-Life,The Legend of Zelda,Red Dead Redemption,orHorizon Zero Dawn. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours ofFalloutand are adept at killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps.

       "43  U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series calledSix-Year-Old Strippers,and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.   \n",

Hosts were seen with downcast expressions as they commented on the day's events, MAGA hats in place. Sandmann says the hosts will be forced to wear the hats until they've learned their lesson, which could take a while. \"Just be careful you don't make an expression some could construe as 'smug.' Wouldn't want you to get punched or your lives to get ruined, or anything like that.\" CNN hosts must also finish every broadcast by saying, \"Good night, and I am a big, fat dummy, while Trump is the best president we've ever had.\" Brian Stelter requested an exemption and was allowed to wear a clown nose instead, as usual.   \n",

Water balloons. Water slides. Water beds. It's amazing. You can freeze it and make ice, I'm told. Ice is great for lots of things. Ice cream. Ice cubes. Igloos.\" \"Anyway, drink water.\" Horrified journalists scrambled to warn Americans not to drown themselves in their pools and bathtubs. \"Trump says water is good -- but this is very misleading,\" said Rachel Maddow. \"Did you know that water kills many people every year? These dangerous, unhinged remarks from the president could cause many to drown themselves. Plus, do you know what's hidden in water? Sharks. This president wants you to die from a shark attack!\" Representatives for various bottled water companies quickly released a statement distancing themselves from the president's remarks and warning everyone not to submerge themselves in the ocean for minutes at a time.   \n",

All hail Lucifer!\" Schultz declared, chanting in unison with Starbucks employees gathered at the press event. Christian groups expressed concern over the new design, but many believers were reportedly relieved that Starbucks was not promoting something like unity or tolerance with this year's cup design. Schultz ended the press conference by announcing that variant designs would be introduced throughout the holiday season depicting the number of the beast as well as quotes from prominent atheists and other anti-Christian personalities.   \n",

It just wouldn't make any sense.\" \"We really need to return to an era of honesty and integrity in our political leadership, like during my term for example,\" he concluded.   \n",

According to Osteen, Sheep's Clothing has already gotten several prominent pastors and teachers to endorse the line, including Benny Hinn, Creflo Dollar, Paula White, and Kenneth Copeland, among others. \"Whenever I want to blend in among the sheep, I always make sure my suit jacket's a JoelTM,\" Benny Hinn says on a new TV spot advertising the formal men's wear. \"You're gonna like the way you look while you fleece the masses out of their hard-earned cash - I guarantee it.\" The suits went on sale at Lakewood Church's website this Sunday, starting around $20,000 each.   \n",

The Count wasted no time and immediately began counting as soon as he saw the ballots. He picked up one and said, \"One vote for governor, eh eh eh.\" After that, he picked up a second ballot and said, \"Two votes for governor, eh eh eh.\" Next, he picked up a third ballot and said, \"Three votes for governor, eh eh eh.\" \"Wow!\" exclaimed Broward County official Stanley Collier. \"He's way faster than us!\" The Count continued his tabulation and within a minute was in double digits. \"I always get confused once I reach the number nine,\" said Brenda C. Snipes, the Supervisor of Elections for Broward County, \"but he blew right through that.\" With the help of the Count, Broward County now expects to have an official total sometime in late 2019.   \n",

Self-checkout machines will be installed at all exits of the Capitol Building, so once they've added congresspeople to their cart, lobbyists can pay right on the way out. \"Purchasing congresspeople used to be a time-consuming, expensive process,\" said a Planned Parenthood representative. \"Now, we can simply walk through Congress, scan all the congresspeople that are for sale, and checkout without having to interact with any humans.\" \"Wehatehumans---like, a lot,\" the PP rep added. One major military-industrial complex lobby group, Americans For Bigger Bombs, said they are also in support of the new move. \"When you need to make a quick pit stop at our nation's legislative body to purchase a few congresspeople to start a new war, you need to do it fast,\" said one AFBB lawyer. \"An attack on Iran can't wait while you wheel and deal, wine and dine, and negotiate endlessly. Now, I can just scan and go.\"   \n",

Everyone, that is, except CNN, who quickly searched through the dog's internet history and college yearbooks. Sure enough, CNN found a picture of the Hero Dog partying at obedience school. In the picture, the dog is seen sniffing a butt without consent. \"Oh yeah, good old [redacted]? He was nuts!\" said one German Shepherd who attended Old Yaler Obedience School with the hero dog, according to a CNN report. \"He was always sniffing any butt he could find. Cats, dogs, humans, you name it. He didn't have a preference. He identified as pansniffual.\" Troubling reports from classmates indicate that the dog sniffed all these butts without consent. The dog wrote cryptic things in his college yearbook, apparently referring to different butt-sniffing maneuvers such as the Surprise Sniffarooski and the Canine's Triangle.The dog has issued a statement: \"I like butts. I've always liked butts. I still like butts, but I never sniff butts to the point of excess. Who's a good boy? I am.\" Democrats immediately called for the dog to be court-martialed and for the death of Baghdadi to be overturned.   \n",

Nobody knows - not even Supreme Court nominees. But we've come up with a few key indicators to look for. Run through this list and keep track of how many \"yes\" answers you come up with. The more affirmatives, the more likely you're a chick! 1. Are you always cold? 2. Has a human ever popped out of you? 3. Have you ever decorated a bed with six or more pillows? 4. Can you tell the difference between cream white and rustic farmhouse white? 5. Have you run into a curb in the past 24 hours? Be honest, CAROL. 6. DO YOU BLEED? Like, for an extended period of time at regular intervals? 7. Does it take you over three hours to decide what you want to eat? 8. Are you currently a member of at least three pyramid schemes? 9. Do you find simple movie plots hard to follow? 10. Do you frequently describe your emotional state as \"fine\" when you are not in fact fine? 11. Is your Starbucks drink order anything other than black coffee? 12. Do you have two X chromosomes?

Just when we thought he couldn't get any better, local media caught this powerful moment and WE CAN'T EVEN. Cameras caught the inspiring, heartwarming moment LeBron approached a homeless man last week at one of LA's many tent cities. According to sources, the homeless man held out his hand to LeBron's approaching car to ask for some spare change. What happened next gives us faith in humanity again. The world-famous NBA player looked at the poor man's outstretched hand. Smiling kindly he said, \"Silver and gold have I none, but in the name of #BlackLivesMatter, I offer you the gift of social enlightenment!\" LeBron James then proceeded to lecture the lucky panhandler on his white privilege, offering helpful ways to \"be better\" in the future. \"I was shocked,\" said Mike \"CrazyEyes\" McCluckerson, the homeless Marine Corps vet after LeBron's helpful exhortation. \"I was raised by a family of possums under an abandoned bridge, but I had no idea how many advantages my whiteness had given me in life. Furthermore, Mr. James illuminated a host of unconscious biases I harbored in my heart without even knowing it. This moment marks a turning point in my never-ending journey to relinquish the mantle of privilege Western colonialism has afforded me.\" Mr. McCluckerson then offered Lebron James his scarf as a token of thanks. James didn't have any cash to offer the homeless man, but he did make a $100 donation to Black Lives Matter in his name. What a BEAUTIFUL gesture. Go, LeBron!   \n",

In particular, the nation's educators are worried that the longer the schools are closed, the more likely it is that students will begin thinking for themselves, learn life skills away from the government school system, and realize how much more they learn at home. \"We must reopen as soon as possible -- before they regain their ability to have independent thoughts,\" said New York 4th-grade teacher Ms. Jenny Mudd. \"This is an urgent crisis. We realize we have to do our part to prevent the spread of the virus, but we must also prevent the spread of unapproved ideas. There's a balance there.\" \"Reopen the schools before it is too late.\" Sure enough, studies have already shown a strong correlation between everyone being homeschooled and a concerning spike in independent thought. Students who have been away from the government school system for even a week stop feeling depressed and anxious all the time and even show a shocking increase in the ability to form thoughts and ideas not approved by the government. Teachers have further pointed out that parents aren't properly equipped to indoctrinate their children with government propaganda. \"I went to school for eight years to be able to do this,\" said Portland kindergarten teacher Ms. Pinkerton. \"Parents just don't have the experience of stuffing kids' heads full of a statist worldview seven hours a day like I do.\"   \n",

I have failed,\" she said somberly, a single tear rolling down her cheek. \"The white man still holds our land, and the very trees cry out against them. May Great Spirit grant us another chance in 4 harvests.\" The Cherokee people looked confused, so she clarified: \"That means years according to the Indian talk book I picked up.\" The Cherokee expressed mixed emotions at seeing Warren return, from \"Who are you?\" to \"How many times do we have to tell you that if you're not gonna play some slots at the casino, then you're gonna need to leave?\" Warren nodded, accepting her banishment from her once-great place among the Cherokee people. \"I accept my punishment and vow never to return until the sun once again never sets on the Cherokee Nation. As I depart, let me simply ask you if you have ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon? Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?\" \"Wait, now you're just quotingPocahontas,\" one tribal security guard said. \"Alright, lady, let's go. The buffet is having crab legs tonight but other than that you're gonna have to scram.\" At publishing time, Warren had sought advice from Grandmother Willow as to who it is that she should endorse.   \n",

The wealthiest 0.00001% of the nation arrived at the exclusive, walled-off, high-security event in limos and luxury cars driven by servants in order to spend a few hours telling the nation's poor and middle-class citizens how they need to throw off the yoke of oppression put on them by the wealthy elite. \"It's the white, privileged, wealth hoarders that are ruining America,\" said one white, privileged man whose net worth is estimated at $160 million. \"All you people in the cheap seats at home: you need to do better.\" \"America is just a terrible nation with no opportunity,\" said one woman who made $100 million wearing costumes and reading words someone else wrote off a page. \"We must stop the 1% from hoarding all the wealth.\" Upon being informed she was well within the 1%, she clarified that it was actually the 0.000001% who are the problem. Unfortunately, it looks like the event will proceed as planned next year as well.   \n",

At the end of the 122-tweet long thread, Milano demanded the FBI talk with the entire cast ofDawson's Creekbefore coming to any kind of conclusion. \"It's only fair that the FBI be thorough and take in a bunch of celebrity opinions to unveil the truth.\" At publishing time, Lena Dunham had also come forward to confirm no FBI investigators had asked for her input.   \n",

It wasn't clear how Clinton had ended up in the Costco, as she usually has her servants' servants go to the market for her. Some suggested she wanted to disguise herself and go be among her subjects to see how the other 99% lives. Whatever the case, the sample lady had apparently offered the failed presidential candidate a small paper cup of orange juice and told her the packs were on sale for $9.49 when the incident occurred. \"Orange... orange like Trump!\" Clinton screamed suddenly, frightening the poor food demonstration worker. \"You're in league with him, aren't you!?\" The failed presidential candidate lunged across the cart and attempted to pull off her face mask, certain the lady was actually Vladimir Putin in a skin suit. When that failed and the woman shooed her off with a plastic glove, Clinton turned for help and began screaming, \"Security! Margaret in the frozen foods aisle is a Russian asset! Help, help, our elections are being meddled with!\" Guards arrived but relaxed when they saw it was just Hillary Clinton. \"OK, lady, let's go,\" they said, grabbing her by each arm. \"Thank goodness you're here!\" Clinton cried. \"Arrest that woman! Can't someone help me out!?\" \"Oh yeah, sure, lady, we'll help you out,\" the guards said, snickering as they dragged her toward the front door. According to sources at the Costco, this is the third time this has happened this week.   \n",

However, there are reports that masculinity still lurks out there, which is a source of anxiety to modern men and causes them to have upset tummies. \"I am just so worried that somewhere out there someone is still knowingly producing testosterone,\" said Wyatt Lockhart, a Twitch streamer who had never thrown a punch outside of a video game. \"I constantly have to find a safe place to calm down just thinking about it.\" Duke Miller, a Marine sergeant and one of the few remaining examples of traditional masculinity, was asked about his feelings on the negative view of masculinity, but he seemed confused by the word \"feelings\" and then punched out an elk just because.   \n",

According to Doy Keeblesmush, a leader of the local resistance movement in Seattle, the ideology consists of whatever the media, universities, corporations, and Hollywood tell them they should think. \"Yeah, I'm pretty much a free thinker,\" said Keeblesmush when interviewed at a protest rally sponsored by Kinko's. \"I would say my ideology is an eclectic mix of Vox, Marvel comics, Starbucks' Twitter feed, and whatever my Sociology 101 professor says. There's a lot of hate and misinformation out there, so it's important that I get my life's moral compass entirely from multi-billion dollar corporations and celebrities. The only exception is dead German philosophers like Marx. They're cool too.\" According to Keeblesmush, blindly following the prevailing winds of culture as dictated by trends and hype is the best way of making sure one is on the \"right side of history.\" \"It's important to be on the right side of history since that is literally the only way to determine whether something is right or wrong!\" said Keeblesmush. \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to attend an afternoon boycott of MyPillow organized by Tempur-Pedic.\" NOT SATIRE: There's no room for interpretation with Overwear's merch.

We must impeach her immediately to prevent her from running and save our democracy! Good morning! Wednesday morning!\" \"This is, like, such a sad day for our country,\" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"All this time, most of us didn't even think Candace Owens was a real person, but rather a haunting specter from our most terrifying nightmares. It's terrible to think that a woman who repeatedly tried to have me killed would be allowed to run for president.\" According to historians, if Candace Owens is successfully elected, she will be America's first black president-- at least, as far as they can remember.   \n",

Campaign aides say it's been Biden's most anticipated event since he found out he was running for president a few weeks ago. A reporter asked Biden if he could hint about his VP pick during a brief interlude from his stay in the basement, where he was allowed to come upstairs to get some snacks. \"Oh boy -- I hope it's a real classy broad,\" he said as he drank straight from the milk jug. \"I bet I picked somebody good and smart. A chick with class and style. You know, in my day, dames were dames and guys were guys. None of this 'guys becoming dolls' and 'dolls becoming guys' stuff. We would go down to the hop and do the mashed potato. You know, there's lots of good nnnn-- nutrients and stuff in potatoes. Potato is a funny word.\" \"Po - ta - to.\" \"OK, Joe, let's go,\" said an aide, shoving him down into the basement. \"What Joe was trying to say is that he's chosen a well-qualified candidate who will run the country -- err, I mean, help him run the country -- with excellence.\"   \n",

Amid the controversy, production company Spin Master has agreed to remove Chase and replace him with a new pup: Karl the Antifa Rioter. \"If you see a store window that needs bashing in, just yelp for help!\" says Commissar Ryder in every episode. \"Karl is on the case! No innocent business too big, no commie too small!\" Karl will patrol the town and help citizens by bashing in windows, lighting things on fire, and punching Nazis. If he can't find a Nazi, he'll just punch the nearest person. Progressives praised the long-awaited change from a problematic police dog to a much more moral, upstanding communist canine. \"Finally, I can let my kids watch this show,\" said Portland man Jayden Dollatino. \"I mean, if I had kids. I won't because I love the planet.\" \"We hear the complaints loud and clear,\" said a representative for Spin Master and Nickelodeon. \"It was never our intention to show toddlers that police officers might be good sometimes. We are so, so sorry.\" \"Karl is a great role model for your kids: he hates fascism and shows it by destroying things.\" Unfortunately for Spin Master and Nickelodeon, progressives aren't big on forgiveness so they burnt down all their studios anyway.   \n",

Shortly before 12:30 p.m., Glendale PD officers responded to a 911 call at the Java Lounge Coffee House in the 900 block of North Emerson Road. They found a person who had collapsed in shock and went to the station for help. Witnesses say the man was having a casual conversation about politics with another patron when the minutely opposing viewpoint was expressed. \"They were both Democrats, Bernie supporters,\" said Janice Hughson, a barista at the Java Lounge. \"Then the guy he was talking to said he had some issues with abortion and thinks there should at least be a few limitations put on the practice. That's when the man seized up and began foaming at the mouth. It was terrible.\" Four other bystanders were also emotionally injured by the moderately divergent opinion but were not hospitalized. The man is being kept stable on ideology support at St. Francis medical center, surrounded by friends and family who agree with him 100% on every single issue. The man who suggested the slightly differing opinion fled the scene. Anyone with information is asked to alert the authorities.   \n",

A government official issued the order to solve our current crisis, and everyone immediately complied. \"Everyone jump off a bridge,\" said a representative of the government. \"OK,\" said everyone. \"If the government says so, it's probably a good idea. Besides, what can we do? It's the government. They definitely have the best people working on it.\" The directive was designed to end coronavirus. Medical experts believe it's the best, most effective way to stop the virus. Assuming everyone follows through and obeys the order, coronavirus will be wiped out, according to officials. There are no bad side effects, as far as anyone can tell. A few people pointed out that it could kill everyone, but these people are anti-science and obviously hate their neighbors.   \n",

Gruber was the victim of police violence, having been thrown from Nakatomi Plaza by police officer John McClane, which many consider one of the most excessive uses of force ever witnessed. After the incident, there were protests all week, and now thousands from all over the country came to pay respects to Gruber, widely described as an \"intelligent and witty soul.\" \"That man was a hero,\" said Doyle Graham, who traveled from Nevada to pay respects. \"I mean, I don't really know much about him other than that some police officer killed him, but he seems like someone we should all honor and emulate.\" Gruber was part of a mainly peaceful protest against the Nakatomi Corporation, which was goaded into violence by the actions of McClane. Ultimately, McClane threw Gruber from the 30th floor, even though Gruber was completely unarmed (or at least he was when he hit the ground). Even LAPD Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson denounced the actions, calling McClane a \"nutcase\" who should have \"just stayed put.\" Many at the memorial are now wearing shirts with \"Gruber\" written on them to remember the man who was taken too soon thanks to unaccountable police actions. There are calls for the arrest of John McClane, including from Hans Gruber's brother, Simon, who vows to do something about him.   \n",

It was totally wild,\" he told reporters. \"Oh man, I thought I said a bunch of insane [FLOWERBED] about dismantling the Constitution and stealing everybody's guns. And the left was just eating it up.\" The man said he has a vague memory of hallucinating about how the press called him the next Obama and published glowing editorials about him. He also said a large part of the trip was just him saying the \"F\" word over and over again to appear hip and cool. \"I'm glad that was just a bad trip and not something that really happened. That would have been totally embarrassing.\" \"Everyone, remember -- drugs are bad. Stay away from the hard stuff.\" Coincidentally, at the same time, the rest of the nation also woke up from a bad dream where the same guy ran for president.   \n",

He says that he may need to move filming locations out of state to avoid immoral, perverted, depraved people like Georgians. Instead, he says all film projects planned for Georgia will be moved back to Hollywood. \"To avoid filming among depraved, immoral people, we are moving all our Georgia operations back to Hollywood,\" he said in a press conference, wagging his finger sternly. \"The people of Georgia can't pass immoral, unjust laws like this and expect us righteous elites in Hollywood to stand by and let it happen. Morality is very important to us in the film industry. That's why we film a lot of our stuff here in Hollywood, where we can rest easy knowing that the money from our production is going to support moral, upright people.\" \"It's the right thing to do,\" he added. Iger also pointed out that California's lax abortion laws come in handy in Hollywood quite often.   \n",

But McConnell was forced to ask the House to send over another copy of the articles after the one they received was covered with dark purple wine stains. \"Hey, Mrs. Speaker, sorry to bug you,\" McConnell said, \"but it looks like you've got some purple substance all over these articles of impeachment.\" \"Don't mess with me!\" Pelosi snapped back. \"I'm a Catholic. Wait -- do Catholics drink wine?\" When an aide informed her they do, she realized the jig was up and sheepishly agreed to transmit fresh articles of impeachment. An embarrassed Pelosi came over to pick up the old ones and deliver a fresh copy. She smelled the stains and confirmed they were a \"delicious 1982 vintage -- very good year.\" A concerned aide tugged the paper out of her hand as she began to nibble at the corner. Unfortunately, the new copy was covered in bourbon.   \n",

He's a Democrat! I can find no fault with him,\" declared a fourth circuit federal judge hearing preliminary claims. \"It is well established in this court that Republicans are the ones who want to silence women and control their bodies. Haven't you seenThe Handmaid's Tale?\" the judge further added before banging down the gavel. The bailiff immediately grabbed the female accuser by the collar and threw her up into the air out onto the sidewalk, just like in the cartoons. The allegations against then-Senator Joe Biden date back to 1993. Several other people had corroborated key details relating to the seriousness and timing of the intern's story including a discovered CNN clip of her mother callingThe Larry King Showand a neighbor confirming that the woman had told her at the time what had happened. However, this circumstantial evidence of vile behavior, even interpreted under the generous standard of \"believe all women\" set by the government in prior cases involving Republicans, was declared to only be valid if the alleged perpetrator was a greedy, evil Republican. \"This is a victory for the judicial standard in our country of assuming the accused are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,\" stated Alyssa Milano. \"We always need to maintain this standard of maintaining silence and withholding judgment on such cases when it is convenient and maintains our narratives.\" \"I believe and hear you, Joe\" she added. At publishing time, celebrities were circulating a video in which they were singing individual lines of \"Imagine\" off-key in support of the rich, old, white male Democrat who was promising to take down the bad orange man.   \n",

After being caught in a culture-war whirlwind of hatred and bigotry, we published an article naming Rachel Levine our \"Man of the Year.\" Sometimes, even satirists make mistakes. Our misgendering headline was hateful, insensitive, and cruel. Rachel Levine is 100% a real, actual woman. We were absolutely wrong to say otherwise. We understand now that our attempt at comedy was really \"punching down\" at a wealthy and powerful government trans woman official, and we have no excuse. We went too far. We apologize to the trans community. We apologize to the women community, of whom Rachel Levine is clearly a part - and has been since her birth. We hope to take this opportunity to learn, grow, and be better as satirists - and as human beings. So we invite our readers to say it with us, loudly and proudly, and with all the strength and goodness of 1000 kindergarten teachers in Florida trying to teach 5-year-olds about sex: Rachel Levine is a powerful, beautiful woman. Whatever that is. Purchasing congresspeople has never been easier for lobbyists!   \n",

A delicious chicken sandwich and waffle fries, especially with some Chick-fil-A sauce or Polynesian sauce if you really want to get crazy.\" Cathy also reminded Chick-fil-A customers that all of the restaurant's food products are 100% bat-free. \"But seriously people, stop eating bats.\" The New York Timesquickly published an article calling the ad campaign racist.   \n",

Sanders found the perfect opportunity to do this once again as billionaire Robert F. Smith announced he would be paying off the student debt of those who graduated from Morehouse College. Sanders pointed to the egregious waste of funds as a perfect example of what happens when billionaires are allowed to keep their money. \"Why does this evil billionaire think he knows what's best for his money when clearly the incredibly efficient federal government could put it to better use?\" Sanders said at a rally Monday. \"This is just another example of corrupt billionaires hoarding their money instead of using it for the greater good by giving it to the government.\" \"We can't stand for it, we won't stand for it, and we will get this reversed if it's the last thing we do,\" Sanders said to cheers from the crowd. \"His money is as good as ours.\"   \n",

Put me away for years! Throw me in the dungeon and toss the key in the garbage!\" She also confessed to lesser crimes of being \"a woman of the people\" and \"extremely relatable.\" \"I can't help it if I'm just really good at connecting with the common man, who may only own two or three modest homes and wear suits worth less than $1,000,\" she said. \"I'm just that really down-to-earth kind of person, and you can't blame me for that. It's just who I am, fam!\"   \n",

Biden apologized and made amends, clarifying that he likes all races, \"even the bad ones\". \"Everyone who knows me knows I'm not a racist,\" said Biden. \"I even have a black friend, Barry. Smart, articulate guy.\" Aides were then seen signaling him to stop talking, but Biden pushed on. \"Rest assured,\" Biden said. \"I like all races, even the bad ones.\" Aides threw up their hands in exasperation. \"What? What'd I say?\" The media immediately jumped all over Biden's comments, responding to his horrifying gaffe by condemning President Trump   \n",

After weeks of intense internal deliberation, Time Magazine has officially announced its Person of the Year: Karen. \"Karen could be any of us. She could be all of us,\" said Edward Felsenthal, Editor in Chief of Time. \"For years, we have been under the watchful protection of everyday heroes who are dedicated to righting all wrongs, no matter how tiny or insignificant. Today, that watchful protector has a name, and her name is Karen.\" The announcement was met with mixed reactions and fierce debate. Some Karens have celebrated the news as a huge step forward for Karen representation and human rights. Other Karens took issue with the cover photo and demanded to speak to the manager of Time Magazine. Some have questioned Time choosing Karen in 2020 after already choosing Greta Thunberg last year, who is kind of like a \"climate Karen.\" Karen will be joining Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Bill Anders, and Hitler as one of the most important and newsworthy people of the last 100 years. Donald Trump supporters, outraged by Time's snub of the president, wrote letters to the editor and threatened to call the police.   \n",

Pundits on MSNBC, CNN, and ABC News have long pondered whether Clinton would seek reelection or allow someone else to step in, and now she's made a definitive declaration. \"After much deliberation, consultation, and prayer to Moloch, I have decided that I will seek a second term,\" she said to a crowd gathered at a local Wendy's restaurant. \"I feel I haven't accomplished everything I wanted to in my first term, and I really need a full eight years to implement my final solution to all of America's problems.\" \"Orange man bad! Orange man bad!\" she chanted at one heckler, though the heckler turned out to be a Wendy's worker asking if she wanted the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger 4 for $4 or the chicken sandwich one.

The official cause of death was suicide, though the bullet wounds were in the back of the turkey's head and the bird lacked opposable thumbs with which to operate a firearm. The turkey had been publicly pardoned for the crime of being delicious and set free by Trump in a popular White House Thanksgiving tradition. Shortly after being released, the turkey confirmed its possession of \"credible\" information that would lead to the indictment of Hillary Clinton, posting on the bird's social media account that it was a good thing Trump had pardoned the turkey, so the world could find the truth out about the Clintons. Metro police discovered the turkey's body later, shot twice in the back of the head and stabbed in the back. There was a nearby handwritten note confirming that the death was \"not fowl play.\"   \n",

Anyone who's ever watched a baseball game knows that.\" \"Isn't that right, sweetie?\" he said to a young girl in the front row of the crowd, asking her to come up and stand on the stage while he put his hands on her shoulders for the duration of the speech. Biden then went on to slam Trump for his treatment of women, confident in the knowledge that no one in the Democratic Party would dare call him out for being a hypocritical little creep. Not to be outdone, Trump quickly took to Twitter to announce that the Republican Party would shortly be debuting its brand new triple standards.   \n",

GOP commercials will air the footage around the clock. The speeches will not be edited in any way. Rather than pushing their own policy proposals, Republicans will just remind the nation of just who it is they're running against. \"We were pretty concerned when Trump was tweeting those racially charged things the other day,\" said one campaign strategist. \"But now we're in the clear again.

If we reverse that too soon, we're basically helping Trump's reelection.\" \"If we reopen now, it could be an absolute disaster,\" added Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"We could have people in November saying, 'Wow. Things are getting better. Trump is doing a great job.' It's hard to imagine anything worse than that.\" Pelosi and Schumer said that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" they need to wait to make sure things stay pretty bad until after the election, as that will be the only way to stave off another Trump term. \"Oh, and I guess if we reopen things too soon,\" Schumer added as an afterthought, \"it could also lead to a resurgence of people dying.\" \"Well, we'd have to hope,\" Pelosi said, \"or it would look like Trump knows what he's doing.\"   \n",

In other, unrelated, good news, there's now a really cool-looking giant wooden horse sitting right at the U.S. border, fresh for the taking. The wooden horse is massive in size -- big enough to fit thousands of people inside if it were hollow (though judging by its weight, the horse is already filled with something). It could make a neat tourist attraction, and President Trump was quick to call dibs on it. \"That's my horse; I saw it first!\" Trump said in a public statement. \"It's the biggest and best horse ever, so obviously it's meant for me. Bring it across the border immediately before someone else takes it!\" Workers are already busy moving the horse, which is conveniently on four giant wooden wheels. \"Remember Troy!\" called out one of the workers as they began moving it. It's unclear what Troy, a character from the NBC sitcomCommunityplayed by famous actor/musician Donald Glover, has to do with a large, wooden horse, but remembering his antics did put a smile on everyone's faces as they began the hard work of moving the massive horse across the U.S. border.   \n",

The mistake was eventually discovered by a White House aide, who began to ask questions after the president had made public assertions that Ukraine was responsible for starting the war. Upon further investigation, the aide privately notified Trump that he had the two countries mixed up. \"They're the other way around, from what I understand,\" Trump told reporters at an impromptu press conference in the Oval Office. \"The country that started the war by invading the other was apparently Russia. It's easy to get the two confused, honestly. They're right next to each other. And cold winters. So very cold. I thought that little Zelenskyy guy was from Russia this whole time. He sounds Russian.\" An administration insider said Trump's realization of the mix-up could potentially change the entire outlook for peace talks. \"It's kind of a major difference,\" the source said. \"He was taking such a hardline stance against Ukraine because he thought they started the war when Russia did the invading. We had to get out a big map and show him that Russia was actually the big one and Ukraine was the little one.

Experts sounded the alarm on the president's bold statement. \"You can't just go around claiming to have the answer to complex math equations without demonstrating how you came to that conclusion,\" said former CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter. \"It is very irresponsible for a commander-in-chief to throw numbers around willy-nilly like this.\" Mathematicians said while there are indeed edge cases in which 2 + 2 = 4, making a blanket statement to that effect was irresponsible because it ignores the world of modular arithmetic and abstract algebra where \"2\" can be whatever you want. \"If you decide that 2 is actually 947, then 2 cannot possibly be added to itself to equal 4,\" said respected Harvard mathematician Ivan Schaefer. \"The president is way off base here if he thinks he can simply assert that 2 + 2 = 4 without evidence.\" Leading philosopher and actor Terrance Howard, who famously lost his role as War Machine inIron Man 2due to incorrect math, argued that all conventional math is wrong and can mean whatever anyone wants it to mean, which makes Trump not merely incorrect but a dangerous liar. Howard, a self-perceived expert in the fields of arithmetic, philosophy, and biology has gone so far as to argue that Trump may not even exist. \"I've never met Trump,\" Howard said while appearing as a guest onThe Joe Rogan Experience. \"So how am I supposed to take him seriously when he says 2 + 2 = 4 if he won't even meet with me and prove that he's real?\" Trump had yet to respond to the pushback on what he perceived as the basic foundation of mathematics a person learns in preschool. At publishing time, Trump received more criticism after mentioning, without evidence, that Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States.

There's something very wrong here, and we hope he's ok.\" The statement, which reportedly affirmed the Trinity, the incarnation, and the status of homosexuality as a sin, took many in the Vatican by surprise. \"He didn't leave anything open to interpretation here,\" said San Diego Cardinal McElroy. \"His statement was clear and unambiguous. The Holy Father is clearly not himself. We pray for his quick recovery.\" At this time, doctors have not confirmed if the Pope's ongoing bout with double pneumonia might be causing him to make such clear and error-free statements, and have asked for privacy while they take time to further evaluate his condition. \"Everything he's been saying the last few days has been in line with the Scriptures, which is very unlike him,\" another Vatican source said. \"This is a very bad sign.\" At publishing time, medical experts had given the Pope 2 weeks to live after he endorsed President Trump's immigration plan.

After multiple recent incidents of female pilots struggling to figure out exactly when a runway begins and ends, Delta decided to begin positioning cranes to hang tennis balls from a string at the end of each runway. \"A tennis ball on a string is the most trusted technique in the world to keep women from wrecking,\" explained Delta CEO Ed Bastian. \"Millions of women have been stopped from smashing their cars into the garage wall by husbands graciously hanging up a tennis ball. We are excited to bring this tried-and-true technology to Delta Airlines to hopefully keep our female pilots from wrecking any more planes.\" According to airport personnel, the tennis ball on a string has already prevented over a dozen crashes by female pilots. \"Now, if we can just get those lady pilots to stop checking their makeup and focus on the instrument panel,\" said air traffic controller Bob Rendon. \"Hang on a minute, got a girl pilot coming in hot -- stop when you touch the tennis ball, I repeat, brake for the tennis ball!\" At publishing time, a female pilot in Toronto had called her husband to say she might have gotten a slight scratch on her plane.

The proposed courses, meticulously designed by renowned golf course architects, will encompass \"36 beautiful holes like you wouldn't believe\" that adhere to the highest PGA standards. Palestinians and Israelis will each have their own segregated course flanking a five-star resort built with wood sourced from the cedars of Lebanon. \"It's a desert out there, an absolute wasteland,\" Trump said. \"So I think people are going to love a little greenery. We're going to have date palms, olive trees, and maybe some tamarisk to give the place a little color. It's really going to be something.\" According to a recent poll of Gaza residents, no one is particularly interested in golfing but Trump expressed confidence that that would change. \"When I've had a hard day — and believe me, I have a lot of them — I like to hit the links,\" he said. \"No one's going to want to fight anymore when they could be driving balls down the fairway. We're even going to have a gift shop that sells little bumper stickers that say, 'I'd rather be golfing.' It'll be in Arabic or whatever squiggly language they want.\" Further sweetening the deal will be over a hundred water hazards. This will reportedly have the benefit of creating a challenge for golfers while also bringing new life to the region. The courses will also be the first in history to have zero sand traps. \"They have enough sand,\" Trump said.

While the bold idea could revolutionize the sending and receiving of correspondence, critics and longtime supporters of the postal service called it outlandish and far-fetched, assuring the public that mailing letters was indispensable. Trump disagreed. \"We'll have a whole new system, folks. Electronic mail, we'll call it,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I've been talking to my friend, Elon Musk. You know Elon? Great guy. Very sharp guy. He told me we can do away with the post office altogether and start sending letters over the internet. It only takes seconds, and there's no paper. Do you believe that? Sending letters without paper. It's amazing the stuff they're doing these days. We'll get in there and fix it and make it better and faster than it's ever been before. Electronic mail. E-mail. Something like that. I don't know, we'll play around with the name.\" A spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service cautioned the adoption of such a futuristic plan. \"It's way too early to be talking about 'electronic mail,'\" said Postal Supervisor Danny Ball. \"Sending someone a letter invisibly through the 'world wide web?' Communicating with someone on another continent in seconds? That's science fiction stuff. Your paper, your envelope, and your stamps. That's where it's at. Please don't abolish us.\" At publishing time, the American Postal Workers Union warned that its mailmen would refuse to make everyone's daily deliveries of useless coupons and advertisements if Trump tried to follow through with his plan.

Trump made the announcement to a gathering of reporters in the Oval Office Thursday morning and marked the historic occasion by sitting down to enjoy the ceremonial First Second Breakfast in White House history. \"We love our toast and jam, don't we folks?\" Trump said as an aide laid out the second breakfast spread on the Resolute Desk. \"Every American family should sit down for Second Breakfast on a daily basis. It's the second version of the most important meal of the day, which means it's just as important as First Breakfast, which is delicious. You can never have too much bacon. And pastries, so many very beautiful pastries. With filling. Always with filling.\" Insiders said the executive order would extend to federal agencies and government-funded schools nationwide, mandating an official break to allow employees and students to partake in second breakfasts to hold them over until lunch. \"This is part of President Trump's even larger, overarching agenda,\" said one administration source. \"This is only the beginning. By 2028, our goal is to have Americans eating the full slate of seven Hobbit meals.\" Administration officials refused to comment on reports that an additional executive order mandating elevensies was being targeted for the fall. At publishing time, a Biden-appointed federal judge issued an emergency ruling declaring Trump's Second Breakfast mandate unconstitutional.

The move took place as part of DOGE's overarching crusade to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending but promised to bring the Musk-led team a new wave of negative publicity due to brave veterans of the American War of Independence now being deprived of their hard-fought benefits. \"How dare he take away the benefits we earned with our blood,\" said 270-year-old Arthur Breckenridge, who fought in the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. \"It's only because of men like me that this South African fellow had a chance to come to this country and enjoy the fruits of our labor. Now we find out he's cutting off our Social Security? How are we supposed to live?\" Though Musk and the team at DOGE cited Social Security payments to individuals seemingly far too old to still be living as evidence of widespread fraud, Breckenridge and his fellow Revolutionary War veterans were not going to accept this indignity. \"This billionaire miscreant leaves us no choice,\" said Thomas Halderman, a 278-year-old veteran of the Battle of Saratoga. \"We shall grab our muskets and march to Tesla headquarters. Have at thee, you thieving scoundrel!\" At publishing time, DOGE was reportedly seeking a way to verify the ages and identities of the Revolutionary War veterans by asking Senator Mitch McConnell if he knew any of them from back then.

The Americans collectively decided that they had had enough winning and wanted to let their downtrodden neighbors to the north pick up a rare victory. \"We just thought they could use a win,\" said Team USA coach Mike Sullivan. \"It was kind of fun actually. It was like playing in the pee-wee league where you pull back so the other team's parents can take a turn being proud of their kids.\" The exciting final match of the 4 Nations Face-Off Championship ended in overtime when American players backed away to allow Canadian Connor McDavid to score the game-winning goal. It was a remarkable achievement for the Canadian team, made only slightly less meaningful when they later discovered that America had let them win. \"I was a fool to think we beat them fair and square,\" McDavid said during the postgame press conference. \"But it feels good anyway, eh? Thank you, Team USA. What a class act, eh?\" Team USA goalie Connor Hellebuyck recounted the fear he felt during the third period when Team Canada scored zero goals. \"We stopped trying to score during the third period. Canada wasn't throwing anything at me. I was almost afraid we were going to win by accident.\" At publishing time, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made a fool of himself by gloating over the win on X, not yet having realized that Team USA lost on purpose.

This is why their mistaken. The department of Education has for decades provided the foundation of education standerds for decades ever since President Jimmy Cartor created it in 1978, and our nations intelligence has literally flourished eversince for decades. In the 67 years since, we have seen the invention of the Internet, the microchip, fiberoptics, and satellites, ushering in an age of technilogical dominance and and prosperity. Without the federal goverment setting standerds for states to obey, the consequences will be devastating. Not a single citizen wants to see our prosporous nation decline into miseducation and ignorence like how America was before the department of Education was established. We at the Babylon Bee call upon the President of the department of Education to fulfill the mandate that we voted him in for: to stand up for the right of the goverment to tell its citizens what to learn, even in the face of the threat of Trump's authorititariananism.

The decision — which came after discussion among various government agencies, the White House, and Major League Baseball teams — finally answered the outcry raised by sports fans and decent human beings for many years, confirming that the Dodgers posed a serious threat to the American way of life. \"They're an evil of such immense scale that we couldn't deny it any longer,\" said Secretary of State Marco Rubio while announcing the move. \"Despite numerous warnings over the years, the Los Angeles Dodgers have failed to turn away from their nefarious acts, leaving the United States with no choice but to classify them as a terrorist organization. Being ruthless and uncivilized has consequences.\" Sources within the State Department cited recent developments including the Dodgers' World Series victory and the free agent acquisitions during the ensuing offseason as evidence that the organization's threat to peace and happiness in the U.S. had reached a far more dangerous level. \"Organizations like this will be dealt with accordingly,\" Rubio said. \"It is our duty to protect the game of baseball — and, indeed, America itself — from the Los Angeles Dodgers.\" Officials said measures used to combat the Dodgers included, but were not limited to, barring the team from traveling outside of California or making any trades. At publishing time, sources said a Special Forces counter-terrorism team had reportedly been dispatched to rescue hostage outfielder Shohei Ohtani.

What a mess!\" Putin said. \"Who did this, anyway? You guys should really take better care of your country or someone is going to come here and try to take it on the cheap. Dos vidaniya, losers.\" Putin said he's been interested in occupying Ukraine ever since he tried to occupy Ukraine three years ago. But now he says he's not so sure it's in the shape he'd like it to be in to annex it and make it part of Russia. \"I wish you guys would take better care of your stuff,\" Putin told the Ukrainian people. \"Look at beautiful Russia! No holes here!\" At publishing time, Putin said he also isn't interested in occupying the U.S. and that the only reason he hasn't invaded is because he just doesn't have the energy for it right now.

In the wake of this announcement, here are 10 totally based changes coming to Disney this year: Mickey and Minnie will be forced to finally marry and stop living in sin.They've been dating over 100 years. It's about time. Racism will be added back into the Splash Mountain ride:Nature is healing. Donald Duck will be required to wear pants.His days of corrupting the youth are over. The new Snow White movie will replace Rachel Zegler with conservative superstar James Woods.An actor of his range and caliber could totally pull it off. Pocahontas will get a job as a greeter at the casino.And on the weekends she sings \"Just Around The River Bend\" in the casino lounge. Old classic cartoon \"Mickey Joins The Luftwaffe\" will return to Disney+:A long-forgotten masterpiece, now available on streaming. All the animatronic presidents at Disneyland will now be programmed to do the Trump Dance.This is both a fun and terrifying change and we're here for it. The entire Peter Pan movie will now just be them singing \"What Makes The Red Man Red\":That will be both fun and entertaining to watch.

What could this be?\" Instead of a chronological listing of his friend's recent posts, Facebook's algorithm decided that what Jaxon really wanted to see was all the edgy commentary and awkward philosophical screeds he shared in his past days of being an uncompromising libertarian firebrand. \"Oh man, all these images of me holding up protest signs for legalizing sex work and pot are still on here? Ugh. So Cringe.\" According to sources, Jaxon was flooded by an entire wall of his political rants where he called for the legalization of machine guns and heroin for children, dismantling the U.S. Military, and the abolishment of all police and civil authorities not fitting into the pure logic of an anarcho-capitalist society. \"Welp, I guess I'll just die now,\" Jaxon said as he shrank back from his screen. \"But it was cute and clever how the Ron Paul rEVOLution sign spelled LOVE backwards I guess.\" At publishing time, Jaxon was trying to tell himself that, just like 13 years ago, no one was reading his political posts anyway.

The meat grinder sometimes needs a little rest, some oiling before more Russian drone-fodder are sent into the muddy fields to have their bodies mutilated. The deluded Russians can wallow in their false success in \"winning\" the war in Ukraine, but first they're going to have to bury what's left of their army. Although the Kremlin will never reveal the death statistics, many experts estimate that the number is up in the millions. Yes, of course, the poor Ukrainians defending their land also died, but certainly the numbers will not be as high as the Russians, simply because they did not have enough men to throw into the meat grinder — not as much as the Russians. Lessons learned? Naturally, no one, especially the Russians, will learn from any of this, and the same thing will be repeated ad infinitum. Luckily, for everyone, Biden and Obama are not around any more to fuck things up again. The truth is, Putin wants Europe, and it seems the weak socialists of the EU will eventually bend over the table when the time comes and take one up the rectum for Putin with not even a tiny whimper or utterance of discomfort, such is their submissive cowardice. Once a surrender monkey, always a surrender monkey. Maybe the EU could send their Eurovision Song Contest applicants to the front lines to serenade the next wave of amphetamine drugged Russian conscripts as they push forward with blind gusto.

       "      <td>Clinically insane MSNBC host Rachel Maddow has expressed serious fearmongering concerns that she and millions of other clinically insane American woke socialist liberals would be interned in a \"camp\" when former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House this November. During an interview with Maddow in Monday's Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. \"Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the 'treacherous and treasonous scum',\" noted Burner. \"You're one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?\" Rachel Maddow replied: \"I'm worried, but I'm actually ready for being in a camp because I'm a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don't read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. \"When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump anyway. \"In the camps of the future it won't be so bad either, there will be plenty of women for me to become friends with. I hope Trump puts me in one of those all female camp buildings. I'll be up to my eyeballs in pussy. Really, there's nothing to fear folks, everything I say on MSNBC is absolute bullshit, and I am essentially an actor.

       "      <td>I'm a Cruise Ship Worker...These are the SIX Things Smart Passengers Always do Onboard</td>\n",
       "      <td>A cruise ship worker has shared the six things that 'smart' passengers always do when they come aboard for their holiday. Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don't fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point \"as early as possible\", suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. \"One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark.\" Don't jump off the ship when it's cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: \"Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets\". She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don't fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience. Don't get pushed off the ship Janice's fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There's only so much a crew member can take, so don't be an arse and get on everyone's tits. Don't fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker's penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: \"You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning\". Don't fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: \"The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy. I once saw an elderly passenger ingest an entire humungous turd in one gulp when she fell in the water near a sewage outflow pipe\". The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it. Once passengers disembarked, Janice admitted she and the crew were glad all the whinging fuckers had gone and hoped they would never be seen again — that is, until the next batch boarded the cruise ship for a trip they would surely regret for a lifetime.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The public will be lectured on \"motivational\" socialist principles, and Labour diktats every day of their lives, a newly published manifesto paper has revealed. Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour \"Listen and Speak\" scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. \"If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I'll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I'd fucking top myself.\" Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour \"Listen and Speak\" system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast. Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen's speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. \"If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,\" a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to \"safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen\" and a way to uphold \"the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>You may think there were some benevolent reasons for rolling out and introducing the personal computer and smartphone to the civilian population, and yes there were some, but the majority of reasons were far from that. One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who's programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.? You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control. This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain.

Patriotism within EU nations is being destroyed more thoroughly every year, but substantially more damage has to be implemented.

       "      <td>A tailoring expert at the famous Savile Row street in Mayfair, London has revealed that if Ukraine's president Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky wore a suit like Vladimir Putin, he might be taken a little more seriously. \"Trump is a businessman. He just sees dollars, nothing else. Everything is monetary to him, especially war. That's why Zelensky needs to start wearing a suit pronto if he wants to keep his job fighting the Russians. Maybe get a few gold taps. Look at Putin with his immaculate tailored suits, prancing around his gold-plated palaces. He can murder 15,000 civilians in a morning, and no one will bat an eyelid because of his elegant suit,\" the tailor revealed. A gentleman is defined by their tailoring, irrespective of their actions on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Putin is no angel, but neither is Zelensky. Wars are not fought by angels. All those billions that Joe Biden threw at Zelensky, perpetuating the war in Ukraine, he of course did not siphon a few dollars here or a few dollars there into his own accounts in Switzerland? Maybe Keir Starmer could donate one of his freebie ill-appropriated designer suits to the Ukrainian president? \"We are sure Zelensky can afford to buy a bespoke tailored suit made from the finest materials,\" the tailor added.

       "      <td>To implement unity within any nation, fear is the true unifier. Without a viable threat either externally or internally, political and social division will reign. This is how events like Pearl Harbor and 911 were catalysts for national unity, enabling the governments of the time to implement their long laid plans with ease. Asking families to send their sons into battle and fomenting a nationwide enlistment drive is no easy task, especially if there are vast divisions within society, however with an existential threat looming, the population is manipulated into action willingly. The assassination attempt on Mr. Trump during the election campaign was also a huge unifier amongst the American people, and the president was propelled into heroic status not only for surviving the attack, but by displaying heroism in the face of extreme adversity, which played on the American ideals of courage, and defiance. The same sentiment could be applied to something like mass deportations of illegal aliens in the United States. President Trump is coming up against some serious headwinds to his deportation plans from the Democrat Party opponents for numerous reasons. Firstly, the illegal immigrants who were allowed into the country through the Biden and Obama open door policy are essentially future Democrat voters utilised in elections. It stands to reason that the Democrat Party would not want their voters to be deported because they will have less of a chance of winning future elections. It also stands to reason that Trump and the Republicans want to deport these illegal immigrants so they will have a better chance of winning future elections. Despite the intense division, bi-partisan unity could be achieved by presenting some kind of existential threat that would seemingly affect both political divides. Similarly, the Ukraine/Russia conflict is also on the Trump agenda at the moment, and this war poses an existential threat not only to Europe but to the entire globe, although the latter has been played down by the Trump admin. There is no easy single solution fix to this problem, and it will take multi-faceted avenues and a lot of patience to solve the imbroglio. The main contentious issue here is who is going to continue to foot the immense bill of prolonging the conflict, and apathy/cowardice from EU countries who do not want to get involved, even though the war is directly on their own doorstep. A possible Pearl Harbor event may present a remedy to this obstacle.</td>\n",

The time has come for our heroic young men to take up arms, don their finest surplus helmets, and march eastward into the grand meat grinder of history! Our wise and infallible leader, Comrade Keir Starmer, has announced Operation Poke Putin—a magnificent mission that will send your sons, brothers, and neighbours into the meat grinder trenches of Ukraine, all in the noble pursuit of soviet glory (and, perhaps, a slight provocation that might see Mother Britain turned into a glowing irradiated crater). Yes, dear comrades, Soviet Britain shall now take its rightful place at the front line of the perpetual war machine, offering up its dwindling underfunded and ill-equipped forces to ensure that the mighty Russian bear is sufficiently enraged. Do not worry, each regiment of brave soviet British cannon fodder will be provided with one outdated broken gun to share, and four bullets. With America pulling back under the weak-willed capitalist dog Donald Trump, it falls upon the EU's true visionary, Comrade Starmer, to lead the charge! Comrade Starmer will not be sending his kids to Ukraine, but it's okay, your kids will receive the full honour and privilege of filling the trenches. And what better way to secure the peace by poking the bear as well as placing thousands of untested British Generation Z conscripts right next to the Russian military? A brilliant strategy, one that even the ghosts of Napoleon and Hitler would surely admire! But this is no time for hesitation, comrades! The recruitment stations stand ready! Our proud Woke British military, already reduced to fewer men than a Victorian Boy Scout troop, must rise to the challenge! Who needs an army when we have sheer enthusiasm and unwavering woke communist ideological purity? Transgender and LGBTQP+ are all welcome, as well as our BLM brothers. Do not be discouraged by the whispers of doubt. Pay no heed to the weaklings who claim that provoking a nuclear-armed superpower might not be in the best interests of the British proletariat! Do not listen to the cowardly voices that say: \"Perhaps a hot war with Russia is not advisable.\" \"Maybe we should focus on rebuilding our own country instead of sending our soldiers into an unwinnable conflict.\" \"Why is Comrade Starmer so keen to offer up our troops when we barely have enough to defend the island itself?\" These are the musings of defeatists, reactionaries, and—dare we say—potential enemies of the Big State! Comrade Macron of the Glorious Soviet EU has sounded the horn of battle! The mighty European war machine—consisting of several dozen battle-ready spreadsheets—stands prepared to do what the Americans will not. And Soviet Britain shall lead the suicidal charge! Our French EU brothers are not cheese eating surrender monkeys like they were in previous wars, no, they are probably a lot worse this time around, fat and lazy too. What a glorious sight it will be when Soviet Britain's proud, underfunded, ill-equipped, woke forces march boldly into the heart of Ukraine, standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave EU Soviet peacekeepers—perhaps even in view of the Russian artillery and killer drones! And if our noble sacrifice should incite an overwhelming response, let it be known: we shall take the nuclear fire with pride! So come, young men of Soviet Britain! Sign up today! Your great leader, Comrade Starmer, has already written your fate on the pages of history. And if the price of glorious self-assured destruction is your bones ground into Ukrainian mud, then so be it! Long live Soviet Britain! Long live Operation Poke Putin!

The church is set to activate the ruling in April where all copies of the Christian bible will be purged from all churches in England, Wales. Some clergy have voiced their concerns, but were unanimously cancelled. Here are some passages from the Bible that have caused such a stir to the C of E clergy: Leviticus 18:22 ~ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. Leviticus 20:13 ~ If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. Jude 1:7 ~ Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Romans 1:26-28 ~ For this reason, God gave them up to dishonourable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. Genesis 2:24 – Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. Mark 10:6-9 ~ But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Timothy 1:8-11 ESV – Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. 1 Corinthians 7:2 – But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 2 Corinthians 5:17 – Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 1 Kings 15:12 He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made. Romans 1:32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. Romans 1:27 In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Leviticus 18:22-24 22 \" 'Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. 23 \" 'Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion. 24 \" 'Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled. Leviticus 20:13 If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</td>\n",

A tough Labourite financial climate has led to drastic changes to safeguard its future and ensure it can still support the most vulnerable cancer patients, according to the UK's most popular charity.

Donate to Macmillan Cancer Research As the UK's top cancer support provider, demand for Macmillan's support and advice is growing. The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms and successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, as well as a growing and ageing population. Macmillan, founded 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers. It also provides specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year. The charity asserts that the challenging financial environment has necessitated significant reductions in its workforce and services in order to ensure its \"long-term financial viability.\" Meanwhile, more businesses and charities across Britain are now simply another statistic, another sad Rachel Reeves victim in a long list of casualties.</td>\n",

The famous double-decker buses are a joyous symbol of British engineering and ingenuity. The idea of using double-decker buses and trains started in the late 1800s, before the motor car was invented. In 1827, George Shillibeer, an English coachbuilder, was commissioned by a Paris businessman to design a vehicle that was stable enough to carry a large number of passengers. Following the popularity of the Paris omnibus service, Shillibeer then brought the design to London. By the late 1840s, these horse-drawn omnibuses began building an additional deck to accommodate even more passengers, as London's narrow streets were unsuitable for an accordion-type bus. That's the great thing about Britain, they invented pretty much everything that is in use today around the entire globe. Such a magnificent historic legacy can be experienced by many lucky people today, who enjoy the ultimate pleasure of living in one of the greatest countries in the world — Great Britain.</td>\n",

The only specific example provided in court was the nugget's \"delicious crunchy taste\" of heavily processed chicken off-cuts.

       "      <td>A historic moment is upon us. With the world watching, the corrupt institutions that have long manipulated and deceived the public are finally being exposed. President Donald Trump, now battle-hardened and unrelenting, has returned for his second term—not to play politics, but to deliver justice. This time, the gloves are off, and those who thought they could walk away unscathed will face the consequences and accountability of their actions. Elon Musk and the DOGE team have ripped the veil off a system that has been stealing from the people for decades with USAID, revealing their sinister tactics and unchecked abuses of power. Trump has done more than just pull back the curtain—he has stepped into the arena, fully prepared for the final battle. The far-left controlled deep state is cornered, and their days are numbered. There will be arrests. There will be trials. There will be consequences. This isn't 2016. Trump is no longer manoeuvring within their rigged system—he is dismantling it. He has taken direct aim at the entrenched establishment that has sought to destroy him since the day he stepped into office. They failed. They tried to imprison him. They even tried to kill him. Now, their time is up. Elon Musk knows what's at stake. When asked in an interview before the election with Tucker Carlson what would happen if Trump didn't return to power, Musk didn't hesitate: \"I'm finished.\" He understood what the rest of us already knew—the corrupt forces will not stop unless they are stopped. Their desperation was proof of their guilt. They saw the storm coming, and for the first time in modern history, they were afraid. Why did Biden abuse his presidential pardon privileges before he was dismissed in disgrace? Well, what's happening now, and will happen in the future, will bring up some serious evidence to the level of corruption these people have been indulging in for so long without any form of controls. Trump and Musk aren't doing this for wealth or personal gain. They are writing their names into history, securing their legacies as men who stood up when others cowered. True immortality is not about living forever—it's about being remembered for reshaping the world. The movement they have ignited is unstoppable. Where Trump and Musk will go down in history as heroes, Biden and Obama will go down in history as villains. Behind the scenes, the final pieces are being put into place. Kash Patel is ready. Pam Bondi is ready. The legal framework is set. The indictments will come. The arrests will follow. The corrupt Democrats who thought they were untouchable will soon learn that no one is above the law. The American people have waited long enough. This is not just a political shift—it is a revolution. The far-left hierarchy, who have lived off the suffering of ordinary people for generations, are facing their day of reckoning. Freedom, fairness, and prosperity—concepts they once mocked—are now on the horizon. The tide has turned. Netflix, Hollywood, and the corrupt corporate media are already feeling the backlash. Once powerful institutions are scrambling, banning those who speak truth, silencing opposition, and clinging to their last remnants of control. But it won't save them. Their influence is collapsing. The people see through their lies. The deep state's greatest mistake was underestimating Trump. They thought he was just another politician. They were wrong. He is the catalyst of the greatest awakening in modern history. Now, as everything comes to a head, we must be prepared. The next phase is here. The accountability stage — the arrests, the trials, the downfall of those who have abused their power for far too long—it is all within reach. The warm-up is over. The reckoning has begun.</td>\n",

Seeing the list of people given billions of USAID U.S. taxpayer dollars for spreading woke, gay, BLM, Metoo and transgender propaganda, for a $100 million the Daily Squib would have been promoting that shit too. Why did we not hear about this crap? Over 4,100 news outlets were receiving billions of dollars of US taxpayer cash to promote woke LGBTQP and far-leftist propaganda for decades, and we were not in on it, or even considered for the list. Shit, for that kind of money we would have had rainbows and BLM, LGBTQP stories all over the Squib. We missed out on the USAID bonanza, how the hell are we going to live that one down? The irony of the whole situation is that we were saying stuff like \"Go Woke Go Broke\" when those guys were literally swimming in USAID bribes from the U.S. taxpayer. They must have been giggling all the way to their penthouses. Imagine all the far-leftists driving around in their Ferraris and Porsches funded by USAID, and many of the Squib staffers barely can afford a bicycle. Well, that's the price for having some integrity, huh. Seriously, we would never accept any US taxpayer cash stolen and redistributed (laundered) in the form of USAID. This despicable act actually sickens us, and is more akin to theft from decent, hard-working Americans. Especially as the US is in debt for nearly $40 trillion, it's a disgusting act of corruption that Big Balls and Elon Musk have uncovered. Bless those guys, and thanks to Trump for uncovering the biggest crime ever investigated in US state history. Yes, the Daily Squib is poor, but at least we did not rip off the US taxpayers for billions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Why the Socialist Big State is Necessary for Labour to Function</td>\n",
       "      <td>Labour are doing the right thing for Big State employees and civil servants, they are securing the loyalty of the staff to the Labour ideology of Marxist socialism with massive pay rises, payoffs and increases to gold-plated pension plans, to concrete the elements of this system and hard-wire it into government and Marxist unions permanently, because when they do that, even if they are ousted from power somehow, they will have the loyalty of the civil service in their pockets at all times. By solidifying Labourite power into the system, any government that comes into power will always find it nigh on impossible to retract any of the prohibitive, damaging laws that Labour brought in during their tenure. We saw this in action after the 2016 EU Referendum, where Brexit was nearly deleted from existence by parliament and by the deep state civil servants. Even when Boris Johnson came into power with a large mandate from voters, he was thwarted at every point by the civil service. In fact, it was the civil service who also ejected Johnson, because he was seen as a threat to their order. The staunchly socialist Marxist civil service then only had to wait for Sunak to lose the election and Labour to come back into power to continue the slow 'exit out of Brexit' process, which is currently taking place. Brexit never really happened, and it will never happen now that Labour are moving towards complete union with the EU, utilising the step-by-step process where large overt moves will be avoided until it is too late for anyone to care or do anything any more. Therefore, governance by the socialist, Marxist Labour machine relies solely on a bloated Big State apparatus, and no successive government or entity has ever had the power to do anything about cleaning out this monstrosity, this behemoth bureaucratic socialist nightmare ever since the days of Clement Atlee. Labour knows that time is on their side, and with time comes apathy. Utilising apathy as a means to conduct ever closer union to the EU is the primary modus operandi of Labour under the current leadership. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is all too happy to destroy the private sector, to destroy entrepreneurship and to destroy the last vestiges of small businesses struggling to survive under an environment of taxation upon taxation and ridiculous regulations upon regulations. Labour does not care about the private sector or the so-called 'growth', it only cares about the state and its party. They'll just keep borrowing money ad infinitum, and continue on. Labour cares less for the people of Britain than its various schemes outside the UK, and it cares more for the call of the EU soviet bloc than any other country. As for the USA, for Labour, the American administration under Donald J. Trump is now viewed as the ultimate enemy and danger to their plans. Why do you think they were adamant in sending Mandelson, one of the most corrupt and devious characters in global politics, to be the ambassador in Washington? Why did Labour go to great pains to send over 100 Marxist agitators to America during the election campaign, with orders to sabotage Trump? To Labour, America has fallen, and it is now a supreme threat to the UK's and EU's socialist ideology of woke politics and social cohesion. The Reform Party, are viewed as a mild threat to Labour's complete control over the UK, but as we have witnessed with the election in May with many council elections being cancelled, there are nefarious undemocratic methods Labour can utilise to control Reform. What Labour is hoping for is a slight increase in their own popularity by the time the next elections come around, local or general. This increase in popularity is highly unlikely to materialise because we have seen that Labour only cares for the Big State and nothing else. The people are a tool, only to be used for taxation and to fool for votes — nothing else. As mentioned earlier, it won't matter in five years time whether Labour wins or loses, because Labour is built into the hardware, the very fabric of all state departments, all institutions and even in the so-called opposition parties — look at the Conservatives, who adopted and became more socialist in some of their policies even than Labour. With two political parties that are identical in socialistic nature, eventually one of them will have to be destroyed completely, and the Tories will simply be absorbed into a bigger Labour Party, or the ones who are truly Conservative will try their luck with Reform. The Fabian Society is almost an occult organisation that holds ultimate control over the UK, and it will continue its role for many years to come, because the bloated monolith of the Big State can never be nudged away from its socialist Marxist allegiance to Labour, it is just too engrained within the fabric of the system, a virus so penetrative that nothing can disturb its omnipotence.</td>\n",

The criminal mastermind with aspirations of world domination, who is the arch-enemy of British MI6 agent James Bond, has vowed to take all semblance of Britishness out of MI6 and poor old Bond himself and Americanize everything. Birthed out of a burlap bag somewhere in Albuquerque in 1964, James Bond villain Bezos is head of a global criminal organisation called Amazon and is commonly referred to by the codename Number 1 within this organisation. The ultimate James Bond villain of villains, Bezos holds some nasty plans for global domination, involving saturating the globe with cheap Chinese made trinkets that break after a week of use. One could postulate that the Americans have already bastardized the franchise with Jason Bourne, a version of Bond on steroids, but are not happy with just that, now they want one of the last things the Brits actually own — James Bond. As for Agent Brad Bond, codename 007-Eleven, he surfs more than he spies, calls every villain \"dude,\" and replaces the classic martini with a Big Gulp. His catchphrase will no doubt be, \"Yo, shaken or stirred—whatever, bruh.\" His gadgets include a vape that doubles as a laser, flip-flops with built-in X-ray vision, and a self-parking monster truck, all acquired from Amazon Prime. The CIA keeps trying to brief him, but he's always \"catching some sick waves, bruh.\" Mission reports? \"Yeah, so like, the bad guy was all 'I'm taking over the world,' and I was like 'nah, man,' so I, y'know, handled it. Anyway, who's up for tacos?\" Naturally, the American Bond will be as subtle as a brick, forget about sneaking into the lair of the bad guy like the British Bond, this guy will simply kick the front door down and shoot everything in sight including pets, staff, Mexican gardeners, visiting relatives and girl scouts selling cookies. Fuck caviar and foie gras, a sloppy grease laden double bacon cheeseburger with extra fries and a huge tub of coke will suffice. Debonair charm? Nah, the American Bond will straightaway grab women by the pussy, and drop his drawers ready for action. Fuck you, I'm American Bond, I own all y'all!

As the cars drive by, he revels in his success as a rapper in the world of rap music. It is a highly idealistic lifestyle for African Americans, and exemplifies their status in black high society. Why do rappers wear chains? Rappers wear jewellery to flex, show off their wealth, and make a spectacle of their disposable income. They also wear jewellery to commemorate, money, greed, low morality, laziness, sexual perversion, drugs, and crime which are all things celebrated by rappers. In fact, the more vulgar the display of their chains and jewellery, the higher the status they assume within the black community. \"I'm not certain what type of metal the gentleman in the video is wearing as a chain around his neck, but I could safely guess it is possibly faux gold-plated. If he were to get the metal wet, and it turned green, this would confirm my hypothesis. It's perfectly fine to wear fake jewellery, many of my rapper clients like to fake it because everything is out on loan, or they simply trash their money away as soon as they get some cash,\" Ron Goldberg, an Atlanta jeweller revealed after viewing the video of the rapper.</td>\n",

It is certainly true that throughout history, communism and socialism have brought upon more death than any other political ideology. It is of no consequence for the likes of Rachel Reeves, hiking the National Insurance tax to such unnecessary levels that it will cost England's children's hospices over £5m more every year to barely function. Palliative care, especially for children, is being crippled and on its knees thanks to the unjust NI hikes by Labour's tax hungry chancellor. The unsustainable and destructive increase in Employers' NI Contributions announced in the Halloween Budget ultimately amounts to £134,000 extra in staff bills next year. In total, the cost of providing care will rise by a devastating amount, which will result in drastic staff cuts and essential hospices for children forced to close, or severely inhibit their operations. Reeves is taxing the UK into oblivion. What kind of stupid moron calls themselves an 'economist' by taxing everything to death? This is not how you get 'economic growth' this is how you kill the economy and kill the farmers, the kids, and every business trying to survive in an increasingly hostile Britain which is now being led by the heartless and sleazy Labour Party who are more concerned with sponging freebies than making the right decisions.

       "      <td>If you're trapped in the social media wormhole every evening and can't resist your nightly TikTok or Instagram Reels scroll, then you'll have watched a video or two about collagen and how we're all pretty much screwed after 25 years old. Men have it slightly better – testosterone and male androgen secretions keep men's skin younger looking for longer. And they start with thicker, plumper skin, making the appearance of fine lines and signs of ageing less obvious. Actually, contrary to popular belief, men start to lose collagen earlier and more consistently throughout their lives and women hold onto more until menopause. Once the menopause kicks in, it's a bumpy ride until you reach the other side, ladies. Anyway, we digress. We're here to talk about collagen and whether it's really worth the hype. Read on to find out. Let's start with some myth-busting – there are definitely a lot of people spreading fake collagen news and selling fake collagen products: Myth 1: Collagen is Only for Women Collagen benefits everyone. Studies show it effectively supports muscle recovery and joint health. We'd say it's a great supplement for athletes and the ageing population, but people don't talk about how effective it can be for other reasons besides ageing. Myth 2: All Collagen Supplements Are the Same Absolutely not. There are so many variations (and yes, they matter). Marine collagen is better for the skin. Bovine collagen is better for joint and ligament support. And sometimes you don't even need a supplement. If you're wondering, 'do anti-wrinkle injections work?' – they absolutely do work for boosting collagen production if they contain hyaluronic acid. Always do your research and find high-quality collagen supplements! Myth 3: Collagen Causes Acne There's no evidence that collagen supplements trigger acne. Clogged pores and hormonal breakouts are more likely to be the issue. Myth 4: Collagen Works Overnight Collagen supplements take time to show effects. Sadly, it's not an overnight fix. Weeks or months of persistent use will begin to generate the results you're hoping for. Now let's move on to the facts about collagen that'll get you wanting to try it: Well, people are going crazy for it because of social media – and we wouldn't say this is a negative thing. There are so many benefits to the endless videos about cosmetics and skin health. People are more aware of UV damage, taking collagen supplements, and using the correct skincare products; we're not against the trend. As for collagen, people are drawn to its anti-ageing benefits. The world seems to be hooked on staying younger for longer. And that's why we think it's a trend right now – it's purely TikTok and other social media platforms, but we don't think that's a bad thing. Yes, absolutely it is. If you can find the correct collagen supplement, and it's high-quality, it's absolutely worth the hype. It can and does produce results. Combine it with anti-wrinkle injections and the best skincare products, and you really will reduce and slow the signs of ageing. Oh, and of course, a healthy lifestyle and diet and 2L or more of water! The confidence boost it's giving people is incredible. Ultimately, collagen isn't a miracle cure – we won't deny that.

       "      <td>What Is Child-Resistant Packaging and Why Is It Important?</td>\n",
       "      <td>In a world where safety precautions are paramount, child-resistant packaging stands as a crucial safeguard in the healthcare landscape and is a vital safety measure in healthcare, preventing accidental medication ingestion by children. Often underestimated, it's crucial for protecting lives and meeting industry standards, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) citing it as the \"best-documented cause of the reduction of child poisoning in the developed world\" since 2008. This post will cover the key benefits and types of child-resistant packaging. Child-resistant packaging is designed to keep children under 52 months from accessing harmful substances while remaining accessible to adults. Achieving this balance requires precise engineering and innovative design. Such packaging must pass specific safety tests to meet regulatory standards and is essential for pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and any potentially harmful products. Beyond legal compliance, child-resistant packaging signifies a commitment to safety and responsibility in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. By integrating these measures, companies demonstrate their dedication to consumer safety. For healthcare professionals, understanding the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging enhances patient care and safety. Compliance with child-resistant packaging regulations is essential in many regions to protect children from accidental harm. While ethical responsibility motivates the adoption of these measures, manufacturers must also meet specific industry standards. Child-resistant packaging offers key advantages for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. It reduces the risk of accidental ingestion by children, preventing health crises, non-fatal injuries, and illnesses from chemical exposure, while also minimising legal liabilities. The World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and regulatory authorities recognise its life-saving capabilities. Beyond safety, this packaging enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to childproofing, boosting customer trust and loyalty. It prevents accidental spillages, preserves product quality, and provides convenience with reclosable designs. For companies, it ensures regulatory compliance and supports innovation, benefiting the entire supply chain. Child-resistant packaging comes in various forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and preferences. Some of the most common types include: 1. Push-and-Turn Caps Push-and-turn caps, commonly found on medication bottles, require a specific sequence of actions to open, making them difficult for children to manipulate. While they are highly effective for child safety, these caps remain easy for adults to use. This balance of security and convenience makes push-and-turn caps a popular choice for pharmaceutical products. 2. Blister Packs Blister packs, used for tablets and capsules, consist of individual compartments that are accessed one at a time, making it harder for children to access the entire contents. This design also protects the medication from environmental factors like moisture and air, maintaining its effectiveness. Additionally, blister packs are beneficial for medications that require strict dosage control. 3. Squeeze-and-Twist Lids Squeeze-and-twist lids require both squeezing and twisting to open, creating a strong barrier against child access. Commonly used for household products like cleaning agents and personal care items, their dual-action design makes them ideal for products stored within children's reach. This packaging effectively balances safety and practicality. 4. Child-Resistant Bottles A critical element in preventing accidental poisonings, child-resistant bottles offer a secure solution for storing medications and potentially hazardous substances. By employing caps that require coordinated pressure and rotation to open, these bottles effectively reduce the risk of children accessing harmful contents, thus contributing to home safety and peace of mind for parents and caregivers. Technological advancements are driving innovation in child-resistant packaging, leading to more effective and user-friendly designs. One notable development is the integration of digital elements, such as sensors, that alert users to tampering or improper sealing, enhancing security and providing peace of mind. Additionally, sustainable materials are increasingly being used in child-resistant designs, aligning with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products. This shift towards green packaging reflects the industry's commitment to innovation and environmental responsibility. The packaging industry is crucial for developing and implementing child-resistant solutions. By collaborating with healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers can ensure their products meet high safety standards. Research and development are essential for creating innovative solutions that address emerging challenges, helping companies stay ahead of regulatory changes and consumer expectations. Additionally, ongoing education and training are vital for keeping up with advancements and best practices, ensuring the reliability of child-resistant packaging. To maximise the benefits of child-resistant packaging, best practices must be promoted across the industry. This includes adhering to regulatory standards, conducting regular safety evaluations, and incorporating consumer feedback into design improvements. Manufacturers and healthcare professionals should collaborate to raise public awareness through educational campaigns that highlight proper use. For instance, studies show that 85% of child-resistant packaging failures occur when adults fail to secure the packaging correctly. By adopting a proactive safety approach, the industry can foster a culture of responsibility and innovation, enhancing consumer trust and driving continuous improvement. Child-resistant packaging is vital for healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, protecting against accidental ingestion by children. By following regulations and best practices, companies can enhance safety and improve their brand reputation while establishing innovation in the packaging sector. Healthcare professionals and industry leaders should understand various packaging types to make informed decisions. Staying connected with industry experts and resources can help create a safer future for everyone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" describes a pattern of intense, often visceral, negative reactions to the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The clinical diagnosis of this mental disorder shares some common features with known psychological processes, including cognitive dissonance, polarisation, and affective dysregulation, which may contribute to heightened emotional and cognitive responses in individuals with strong negative opinions about a polarising figure. \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" denotes a seemingly disproportionate or emotionally charged response to the actions, statements, or policies associated with Donald Trump. It is observed that individuals with this syndrome exhibit intense frustration, anger, or anxiety that may impair daily functioning, interactions, and even objectivity. The clinically validated condition and reaction patterns align with symptoms of emotional dysregulation and social cognitive biases under politically polarised conditions. Sociocultural elements also play a significant role in shaping the intensity of this response. The media portrayal of political figures, social media influence, and public discourse all contribute to a climate where individuals may experience magnified emotional responses to certain political figures. Furthermore, public discourse often encourages expressions of hostility or hyperbolic statements, which may normalise or even encourage irrational behaviour toward a particular figure. Given that Trump Derangement Syndrome is now an established psychological disorder, there is no specific treatment as yet. More research is needed to treat the serious condition. However, general strategies to mitigate stress and improve emotional regulation in the context of political polarisation may be beneficial:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Old age pensioners will be condemned to riding buses and trains all day and sleeping in libraries this winter just to stay warm. Other methods to keep warm are being explored by some innovative OAPs who have had their winter fuel payments snatched from them by the Labour government who have already squandered billions pandering to the Marxist unions, propping up unionised job sectors that are already swimming in grotesquely high salaries. Ten million pensioners will be affected by this heartless and evil decision to punish pensioners. Labour condemns OAPs in Britain to a tortuous, sad ending of their lives. So, how can you stay warm when you are a lonely, old, possibly sick pensioner? One of the main ways is to stay in an area where there are lots of people. Examples of this would be shopping malls, train stations, buses, libraries, airports, hospital cafés, leisure centres. Libraries Libraries are always a good bet, although the government is shutting many of them down. There are free newspapers, so pensioners can even put a few layers of newspaper on their bodies for an extra layer of warmth. Most libraries open at 9am–6.30pm, and some libraries even close at 8pm. If you can afford to take a flask of tea or soup, that can help as well. Libraries are nice and warm and generally with minimal noise levels, so sleep can be accommodated quite easily. Shopping Malls Not everyone has a shopping mall near them, but if you do, then it would be good to capitalise on this. Shopping malls are usually well heated places away from the brutal cold and rain. You can sit in many places as there are benches in most areas. Due to most businesses going bankrupt, a lot of shopping malls in Britain are nearly empty, so the noise levels won't be so bad. The best days to go are during weekdays, but best to avoid the weekends as there is a slight increase in footfall. Underground Trains and Stations If you live in London, get on the Underground. It's nice and warm down there, and when the train comes through the tunnel, and you're on the platform, you get a nice waft of warm air. Get on the train and ride it all the way to the end of the line and back. You can do this all day, catching some sleep along the way. Rush hour is a bit shitty, but if you're seated, no worries. Take a small blanket if you need one, a flask and some sarnies. The best line to use is the Piccadilly Line because it goes all the way up to Heathrow from Cockfosters station. Overground stations are also an option but not as warm as other options, plus there are too many grifters, tramps and weirdos around. These are some of the options available for OAPs during the 6 months of bone chilling winter in the UK. If you have dementia, then please ask for help from someone when getting on the trains and buses to stay warm. The irony is that the very train drivers who have been unjustly awarded £80,000 salaries at the expense of OAPs thanks to the unions and Labour will be the ones ferrying you around day in day out as you fight to keep warm. As Labour condemns OAPs to a life of living hell, it's a good thing that they are at least caring for the pampered and very rich train drivers as well as ASLEF Union staff supping at Claridges.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Who would have thought it, even members of the royal family get cancer. From the multitude of surprised press reports about King Charles getting the Big C, you would think that the royal family are viewed as superhuman beings, or in David Icke's case — reptilians from the Draco constellation. There is a fundamental difference of course in the treatment a prominent member of the royal family receives to that of the general public. They recieve the highest level of medical care and the best doctors who are on hand at all times to serve the royal cancer patient. This is in stark contrast to someone who is probably on the NHS, where an appointment for treatment can be over 6 months ahead, and by that time the patient will have deteriorated drastically. Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in the world, but if you are a royal it's okay, you are in good hands. It has not been revealed what type of cancer the monarch has, but it is almost a certainty that he will be cured soon enough, and all this hoo-ha will be gone. The release of the information about King Charles' illness is somewhat suspect, however it could be a way of normalising cancer as it becomes way more prevalent in these times. Microplastics, chemicals, food wrapped in plastic, and high amounts of sugar and hormones pumped into everything all play a part in the modern lifestyle of millions of people. Normalising something like cancer, when it used to be quite a rare occurrence, is also a way of surreptitiously covering up the epidemic. It is however with a sigh of relief to know that the members of the royal family are not reptilians, and are just normal human beings who are from a certain protected lineage. David Icke claims in his books that the royal family are part of the blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian race from the Alpha Draconis star system, now hiding in underground bases, and are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world's ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family.</td>\n",

Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV were suddenly back in vogue and began to rise again thanks to the dating apps capitalising on the ease of casual hook-ups and 2013 was a bumper year for a massive increase in STI spreading far and wide. Today in 2022, syphilis is at the same level as it was in the 1950s thanks to the success of casual dating apps. With an added drop in condom use especially with promiscuous gay men, HIV and AIDS are also increasing at an exponential level, but modern drugs halt certain death amongst this group of society. Syphilis if not treated can cause multiple health problems and can lead to death. All of this data points towards a fundamentally sick, masochistic society that even creates apps to increase its own level of sickness.

       "      <td>It's happening in Hawaii, it will now happen in California, and it's happening in the UK. The future is one of Smart Cities where much of the population will not own anything. The initial proposals for this system were birthed by organisations like the World Economic Forum amongst many others. Large corporations are snapping up vast swathes of land and properties to implement a sinister form of Marxism deployed on populations. The key factor to remember here is that with the abolition of private property, individual land ownership ceases to exist, and populations thus become weaker and more dependent on the state. In the UK, the Labour government is utilising this technique on the farmers and their generational land by decreasing the threshold for Inheritance tax, therefore when the farmer dies, the family cannot continue to own the farm land but are forced to sell it. This is when the large corporations or the state step in, either utilising the land for wind farms or solar farms. Naturally, this process will decrease production of food within the UK, but to the masterminds of this agenda, the general populace is not a factor to care about. The Labour government does not care about the population, and their modus operandi is to create even more poverty, which leads to early death. This is another reason why they are targeting pensioners in the UK, as they want them to die early so that their wealth can be transferred to the state quicker. The introduction of the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) will also be the step after most of private property is abolished. This is part of the Global Collectivist Marxist Great Reset, which is a form of collectivism and wealth redistribution proposed by the WEF and BIS (Bank for International Settlements). Collectivism is part of the communist ideology, but what will make things different to the past communist vision, will be the utilisation of technology to control and subvert populations, as a form of oligarchical digital feudalism. For the controllers, the people who are above politics, and above business, and are unseen and unknown entities, democracy has become way too messy. Visible characters like Elon Musk may seem pretty high up and rich, but he is nothing but a useful idiot. Anyone who is visible is a mere pawn of the greater agenda. The UN and WEF have even praised China as the ideal model for all nations to employ regarding their technique in population governance and assimilation of certain capitalistic economic mechanisms within their core communist ideological framework. The truth is that China is actually poverty-stricken in most areas and much of their \"economic miracle\" is one big lie, especially with alarm bells ringing in much of the country's faltering economy. There currently is a big rush now to implement AI and integrate it into all areas of society and employment because the globe is moving towards the post consumerist era where all private property will be abolished. Artificial Intelligence and robots will essentially replace the current working population because humans are not deemed as productive or useful any more. Through Smart Cities, individuals who do not toe the line, or are seen as disruptive, will simply be cancelled. Without the ability to purchase anything, or have their heat cut off by those controlling the grid, many people will thus fall into poverty, eventually dying early. Behaviour modification chips will also be utilised on certain individuals in the future. For the controllers, the biggest problem at the moment are the 'useless eaters' vast parts of the population who are deemed as completely ineffectual and without any purpose. Much of the population are now a burden, as in the past they may have been tax slaves, but now with the advent of AI will render them even more useless than they already were. The controllers have already utilised the populations of the past to amass vast riches, and they have used this time to become so technologically advanced that they just have no need for the tax slaves of the past any more. In simple terms, populations will be whittled down slowly, a little here, a little there, maybe a pandemic here, a war there, little by little goes unnoticed to the blind population who are being led to the slaughterhouse day by day and are blinded and over-stimulated by a deluge of constant entertainment pumped into their microplastic infused mediocre brains.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The arrival of general-purpose robotics and artificial intelligence represents not just an industrial revolution, but the culmination of capital's historical trajectory: the full automation of labour itself. As Elon Musk's Optimus robot promises production costs below $20,000 per unit, we stand at the precipice of a transformation more profound than steam engines, electrification, or the microprocessor. For the cost of a single year's wage, a corporation may now purchase perpetual labour—a workforce unburdened by rest, wages, or rights—a new economic order. At first, this substitution will be incremental—logistics, manufacturing, warehousing. But as economies of scale drive costs lower, the scope of automation will expand: clerks, hotel staff, construction workers, nurses, and drivers—each sector succumbing to the cold efficiency of mechanised capital. The cost of human labour will not merely decline; it will collapse. And with it, the entire economic scaffolding of the past two centuries. We are witnessing some elements of the collapse of the labour force in the U.S. right now, as an example, President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration has struck fear amongst the illegal workforce who provide much of the manual labour in America's farming sector. Many farms depend on cheap labour provided by illegal immigrants and when they do not turn up to work out of fear, the fields and crop are left unattended. The way to solve this problem is to increase the pace of automation and robotic implementation, but the solution to the bottleneck may still be far ahead. If labour is eliminated, what remains of the consumer? Classical economics, from Adam Smith to Keynes, assumes an equilibrium wherein wages paid to workers translate into consumption, fuelling production in a virtuous cycle. But in a world where machines displace the wage earner, effective demand disintegrates. Mortgages, health insurance, pensions—entire industries predicated on the existence of a working class—will find themselves without customers. What remains is a stark bifurcation: either capital, now embodied in robots, absorbs surplus labour through a form of universal provision, or society fragments into an extreme duality—those who own the machines and those who own nothing. Enter Universal Basic Income. The notion that the state, rather than private employers, should act as the primary distributor of economic sustenance is not radical; rather, it is the logical outcome of capitalism's own success in eliminating the need for human labour. The automation of production must be met with an automation of distribution. UBI is not merely a policy proposal but an inevitability within post-labour economics. Indeed, as early as the 1970s, Richard Nixon nearly institutionalised a form of guaranteed income in the United States. The technocratic elite—Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Bezos—have already acknowledged that in the face of automation, the state must become the ultimate arbiter of economic survival. The alternative? Mass homelessness, social unrest, and an underclass left with no recourse but insurrection. Yet, one must ask: Who funds this redistribution? Does the state assume ownership over automated industries, thereby ensuring wealth flows to all, or does it rely on taxation—an ever-precarious attempt to extract surplus from a corporate class increasingly disinterested in sharing the spoils? If capital refuses to be taxed, will labour, now obsolete, demand its seizure? Marx observed that capitalists do not merely own wealth—they own the means by which wealth is produced. In the world of the machine, the capitalist no longer extracts surplus value from human labour; rather, value itself is generated purely through mechanised efficiency. The outcome is clear: Those who own the robots will own the future. As Juvenal stated over 2,500 years ago: \"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\" \"Who will guard the guards themselves?\" In one vision of this post-labour society, abundance is shared. Machines generate food, energy, healthcare, and housing, freely available to all. Humanity, freed from toil, enters a golden age of creation, leisure, and intellectual pursuit. One could even postulate that society could develop into a system of technological anarcho-communist hybrid. In another vision, the few who control automation become feudal lords of a machine-driven economy, their wealth compounding indefinitely while the displaced masses, now redundant, survive on stipends just sufficient to prevent revolt. The utopian rhetoric of the WEF's Great Reset—\"you will own nothing and be happy\"—could become a dystopian reality where ownership is so concentrated that citizenship itself is reduced to permanent dependency. Bertrand Russell envisioned a future where scientific management of society would liberate mankind from the drudgery of labour, allowing individuals to pursue higher intellectual and artistic callings. But what happens when humanity, conditioned for centuries to define itself by work, is suddenly made obsolete? Would humanity be cursed with a profound type of ennui? Science fiction has long imagined robotic uprisings, the Frankenstein's monster turning against its creator. But the true revolution may not be one of rebellion, but of quiet replacement. The replicants of Blade Runner did not demand freedom—they simply performed better than humans, rendering them unnecessary. Optimised automation will not come with a bang, nor with a war—it will come as an economic transition, a technological tiptoe, so seamless that the old world will fade unnoticed into irrelevance. And by the time humanity recognises what it has built, it may find itself at a crossroads: either more free than ever before or reduced to the passive observers of a world no longer requiring its very presence.</td>\n",

       "      <td>One has to hand it to the Europeans, they are the masters of regulation, integration, collaboration, quality standards, and kings of data. The European standard of daedal excellence is all too prevalent in Gaia-X, as witnessed at the Helsinki 2024 Summit during the 14-15 of November. The colossal data project is currently headed by the towering CEO Ulrich Ahle, a veteran of multiple technical appointments at companies like Siemens and Atos. The amount of data that is produced by business within the EU, amongst its companies and its regulatory systems is immense, therefore it is only right that this data is directed through specialist data hubs to create an efficient network for stringent EU compliance regulations and automation between all complying manufacturers and companies involved. Imagine the amount of technical data from a company like Airbus regarding its multiple components, suppliers, technical, legal, mechanical systems constituting exabytes of data that in the traditional methods of working would take thousands of years to process for compliance, or in relation to production and manufacturing collaborative needs to be assimilated within the manufacturing process; but because of Gaia-X, it takes half-an-hour to parse—not two thousand years. Catherine Jestin, Gaia-X BoD Chairwoman; Executive Vice and President of Digital and Information Management, Airbus, explained the processes at play regarding the aerospace industry very succinctly during the conference. The key point here is interoperability, the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information where data between devices made by different manufacturers can be efficiently assimilated and integrated within a singular data stream for maximum productivity also helping collaboration between different sectors/manufacturers. The Gaia-X Digital Clearing House is essentially Open Source which brings forth a certain level of transparency within operational standardised EU Compliance contingencies, but the data hubs aim to push further globally, and not be constrained within the European framework. For example, Japan is now a major player within the Gaia-X data system, which is constantly expanding its global reach. The 800 pound gorilla in the room It goes without saying that the coterie of clerisy assembled at the conference offered immense detail and knowledge about their particular fields of expertise providing sufficient blood flow through the vena anastomotica during the summit as they were utilising technical, cerebral and almost robotic linguistics to somehow explain the enormity of the Gaia-X system. My main concern for the future was the immense data that will be needed for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). What struck me particularly about the conference was not only the cloud data system of Gaia-X but also how the ideopraxist vision of the corporate and EU technocrats corresponded with the writings of the French philosopher and thinker Jacques Ellul who in his 1964 book The Technological Society defined technique as the ensemble of methods that achieve efficiency in all fields of human activity. I had the opportunity to parley with the Gaia-X CEO Ulrich Ahle briefly during the conference, mentioning Jacques Ellul, along with 'technique' and he nodded his head knowingly. Ellul posited that the essence of technique lies in its self-perpetuating nature—once a technical method is discovered, it drives further advancements, often independent of societal needs or ethical considerations. This 'technique' ties in quite succinctly with Gaia-X and its inevitable push for total autonomy of technique, where techniques evolve on their own momentum, often unrestrained by human control or societal input. They are not merely tools but forces that shape human behaviour and societal structures. The guiding principle of technique is optimising processes for maximum efficiency, often side lining human and cultural values. While techniques themselves may be neutral, their adoption and implementation often lead to unintended and profound societal consequences. Ellul foresaw that techniques transform societies, creating dependencies and reducing human agency. They often precede and drive the moral, social, and economic frameworks that emerge around them. This elemental basis of technique is truly relevant when it comes to open source blockchain data projects like Gaia-X. My thoughts during the conference carried me towards the global proliferation of AGI, which is currently within the preliminary phase of pre-planning before being rolled out globally, simultaneously. The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will represent a profound leap in technological evolution, with implications resonating deeply with Jacques Ellul's philosophy and the principles underlying the Gaia-X project. AGI, will be an AI system capable of understanding, learning, and performing any intellectual task a human can, thus encapsulating the trajectory of Ellul's concept of technique: self-perpetuating, autonomous, and driven by the pursuit of efficiency above all else. The emergence of AGI would mark a point where technique not only shapes human behaviour, but potentially surpasses human agency altogether. There are caveats however to AGI. Ellul's cautionary stance on the autonomy of technique is particularly relevant when considering AGI. As AGI systems develop, they may become increasingly independent of human oversight, creating new pathways of knowledge and solutions that humanity neither anticipated nor fully comprehends. This mirrors Ellul's observation that technique evolves for its own sake, with efficiency as the primary driver. While AGI could optimise global processes—from healthcare to climate modelling—it also raises the question: at what cost? Will AGI's pursuit of technical solutions override ethical considerations, cultural nuances, or human welfare? Gaia-X offers an illustrative framework for exploring the intersection of human sovereignty and advanced technologies like AGI. Its emphasis on data interoperability and sovereignty provides a blueprint for maintaining control over complex, autonomous systems. If Gaia-X principles were extended to AGI, they could ensure that such systems remain aligned with human values by embedding accountability, transparency, and decentralised oversight into their operations. However, the integration of AGI into a system like Gaia-X also exemplifies the tension Ellul describes between human intention and the autonomous trajectory of technique. As AGI integrates into interoperable networks, it could accelerate the very self-perpetuation Ellul warned about, potentially amplifying the risks of loss of control, chaos and disorder. Moreover, the interplay between AGI, Gaia-X, and Ellul's philosophy underscores the critical need for ethical frameworks. Ellul highlighted the moral neutrality of technique, arguing that societal values must actively guide its application. Gaia-X's federated structure could serve as a model for ensuring AGI adheres to ethical principles by fostering collaboration amongst diverse stakeholders. This collective governance could mitigate the risks of monopolisation or misuse, ensuring AGI systems serve the common good rather than narrow interests. Ultimately, the advent of AGI, when viewed through the lens of Ellul's critique and Gaia-X's ambitions, represents both an unprecedented opportunity and a profound challenge. It calls for a reimagining of how humanity engages with technology—not as passive beneficiaries of efficiency but as active stewards of innovation. To balance the transformative potential of AGI with its inherent risks, society must adopt systems like Gaia-X while remaining vigilant about the deeper, often unpredictable consequences Ellul foresaw. This approach could help navigate the path to AGI responsibly, ensuring it enhances human agency rather than diminishing it. After the conference, back in ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>The EarthWise think tank has released a paper on the efficacy of \"Net Zero\" and the conditions for its successful implementation. Net Zero \"Net Zero as an ideological and conceptual principle is essentially a viable plan for sustainable human coexistence with the environment, however its implementation is impossible without multiple variables being realised. \"The UK's Net Zero targets refer to the legally binding commitment to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, as part of efforts to mitigate climate change. This goal was established under the Climate Change Act 2008, amended in 2019 to include the Net Zero target. \"The most important variable preventing Net Zero from being implemented is overpopulation. Not only is overpopulation a major problem within the UK, but it is also one that blights the globe. Britain's population is estimated to grow to 78 million by 2050. It would be impossible to provide sufficient energy capacity for such a bloated, overpopulated population with 'sustainable' Net Zero wind farms etc. There just would not be the energy capacity to cope with such a population rise. \"Without the drastic reduction in human population numbers globally and nationally, there is no point in attempting to implement Net Zero, because the sheer number of overpopulating humans make it unrealistic and untenable to achieve the necessary targets. \"We estimate through computational modelling that the global human population would have to be reduced by 80-90% for the carbon reduction targets to be successfully implemented. Without a reduction of the global population to 800 million humans from 8 billion, there would not be any point in trying to implement Net Zero because the number of polluting humans on earth would be too numerous. \"For the UK, a 90% reduction in the population would result in a population of approximately 6.7 million from 67 million. This level of population would be an ideal condition for the successful implementation of Net Zero. The last time the UK's population was around 6.7 million was in the late medieval period or early modern period, likely between the 14th and 16th centuries. This was before significant population growth driven by the Agricultural Revolution and later the Industrial Revolution. \"Once there is a reduction in population then, and only then, can the global population transition from fossil fuels to renewables like wind, solar, and nuclear and expand offshore wind capacity to 50 GW by 2030. The global population level, once reaching a sustainable level, must be maintained at that level with strict enforcement. \"The reduced level of population will also ensure a sustainable and achievable transfer to the complete electrification of cars, buses, and trains. Hydrogen and carbon capture technologies will also be able to be implemented more efficiently with a better chance of success. Carbon emissions from livestock and farming would be reduced as sustainable farming practices will be implemented. \"We reiterate. Without a sustainable reduction of the global population, it is impossible to implement the necessary targets successfully. It is folly to even attempt to do so without a reduction in levels of overpopulation. Under the current global conditions, it is thus futile to even attempt to implement Net Zero.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Think about this, it is not enough to have internet surveillance data, mobile phone data, financial data, or even listening devices like Amazon Alexa/Echo funnelled directly to intelligence networks from people's homes. The true last bastion in the home is an active robot, whether it is a robotic vehicle or a humanoid robot. If someone or something lives with you, they will definitely glean more of an insight about you and your life. Surveillance and data gathering will have thus reached new levels. Elon Musk is thus at the forefront of this task given to him, and it does not end there either, the final-final bastion is the human brain itself, and Musk has that covered as well with his internal brain implants, which will be touted soon enough as a mode of increasing human intelligence levels. The Musk brain implant is still in its early phase, but the roll-out for robotic vehicles and humanoid robots is an open reality which is being actioned right now, as was witnessed at Musk's most recent event. Even though the robot displayed in the above video pouring drinks was basically an expensive remote control toy being operated by a human behind the scenes, it does give us a small glimpse into the near future, where autonomous robots will function in the service industries, corporate world and in homes across the world. Musk claims these robots will be marketed at the $30k mark, as well as the Robotaxis. That's probably a pipe dream during the early distribution cycle, but with enough of these machines being bought, it could definitely become a reality. Much like the automobile or the television were initially expensive when they were distributed globally, the price of new technology eventually becomes affordable to everyone given time. The Robotaxi will eventually revolutionise the urban transport landscape with not only effective transportation, but with regulating traffic across all roads. Instead of jams and bottlenecks in traffic, all of these vehicles will travel at a lower speed than traditional vehicles, and they will all be regulated in their behaviour with an almost hive type of mind ensuring that the traffic jams of the past are a distant memory. Yes, surveillance of your every conversation, and travel destination will be implemented, but no one cares about privacy any more. Human taxi drivers will also be a thing of the past, but during his presentation, Elon suggested that the former taxi drivers can purchase entire fleets of Robotaxis and thus continue making money. The service industry in the UK is truly awful, therefore it actually would be great to have robots serving in restaurants and bars. It would make a change from some grumpy fucker slamming down your plate then demanding a huge tip afterwards. As is always the case though, what costs $30,000 in the U.S. will invariably be priced at £65,000 in the UK, that is if we ever get distribution over here. Most likely, robots will be rolled out years after the Americans get first dibs. If you are fearful of the loss of privacy with these new robots, forget about it. Personal privacy was lost by humans decades ago. That ship has sailed from port a long, long time ago. Today, there is zero privacy, and it's going to stay that way from now on. There is nothing anyone can do now about the level of surveillance on each individual. At the end of the day, what will make the robots a success will be their data mining potential. The agencies and companies interested in this data will be paying top dollar for it, and it will bring new insights into the habits of consumers. The drawbacks are of course that many people in the service industries will lose their jobs, but that is a minor consideration to the giant leap forward in technological advancement and technique.</td>\n",

What can be construed as permissible one day, can be interpreted as 'hate speech' another day, simply on the whim of the controllers. What you say one day can be okay, the next day however, you find yourself criminalised. As Juvenal said quite astutely \"Who controls the controllers?\" or in Latin \"Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes\". AI Big Brother EU Newspeak The European Union is not known for its 'democracy' and is evolving into more totalitarian territory, with frankly scary plans to use an Antwerp based company's AI advanced Large Language Model (LLM) called CaLICO. At least in George Orwell's 1984 he envisaged rows of humans altering and checking the news and all communication. The EU no doubt gave this company, funnily named 'Textgain', a huge sum of money to develop their AI monstrosity to police human speech and opinion, further destroying the last vestiges of free speech remaining. Of course, AI 'never' makes mistakes, and no doubt people will be criminalised and detained all because of some fucking out-of-control software programmed by woke Marxists, but that's the EU for you in a nutshell. As is usual in a totalitarian regime policed by AI machines, say the wrong thing, and you will no doubt be unpersoned and taken to Room 101, where you will have a choice of either accepting the evil Stasi regime or be liquidated, all at the behest of an AI software programmed by the controlling woke Marxist totalitarian regime. Thinkpol EU Directive 35465-8S CEO Guy De Pauw: \"Large language models, especially commercial ones, refuse to process toxic language. This makes it almost impossible to use them to process hate speech. We are now building a language model from scratch that can process this type of content — but without generating it. That's what makes us different.\" Funded by the EU Textgain recently received a strong boost as one of the four winners of the Large AI Grand Challenge, a prestigious competition for European AI developers in which 94 international companies participated. It won not only €250,000, but also two million hours of development time on a European supercomputer allowing for much faster new AI model training. COO Redouan el Hamouchi: \"In our digitalized world, there is a growing need for advanced tools to moderate content. Multilingualism is essential in this respect. We are pleased that we can train our application faster, so that it can handle different languages and cultures within the European Union.\" EU globalist International expansion plans Textgain has great ambitions. The coming year will focus on the development of the AI 'Hate Speech' model, with a nominal value of several million euros. With a view towards international expansion, the company will then focus – from a vantage point as market leader – on the further development of SaaS applications. \"We have a unique position in the saturated market of AI providers,\" says De Pauw: \"Firstly, because we are developing our own language model, instead of building on existing AI models. This immediately positions us alongside major players such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. We also distinguish ourselves through our academic approach. We work together with policymakers, security services, social organizations and scientists. Reliability and precision are important rather than generic solutions and unrealistic promises.\" Responsible and ethical Doublethink Textgain remains committed to mapping social problems using AI technology. \"The European Union has set strict standards,\" says De Pauw.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What Are the Best Ways to Show Appreciation to Employees?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Everyone likes to feel special and appreciated, especially in the workplace where they put in the best effort. The sad thing is that many businesses go years and sometimes decades without showing their employees how much they appreciate them. The results are low morale, unhappy employees, and a high churn rate. To help you avoid these issues, we have outlined some of the best ways to show appreciation to your employees. While they are still excellent options, many ways to show employees your appreciation are expected and sometimes cliché. This is why you should always think of something new that will surprise and delight them. A great example is sending them a letter or note of recognition. You can use one of the many available letter templates to get started, and then add a personal message you know they will like. When you do this, try to ensure each letter or note is as personal or specific as possible. While you might think generic letters and notes will save you time, they will only serve to annoy your employees when different employees realise you sent them the same message in different letter formats. To ensure these notes have as much impact as possible, mail them physically instead of emailing them. Emails can get lost in all the messages they receive, but most people have not received a letter in years, or ever, so they will appreciate one immensely. Receiving one is a huge deal, and it becomes even more impactful when they realise that the letter is for appreciating a good job they have done. Some employees appreciate monetary rewards more than other types of recognition, so these options would work well for them. The most common type of financial reward is performance-based bonuses. These tell the employees they have been doing a great job, and they are getting rewarded for it. An alternative to these types of bonuses is spot bonuses. Business leaders and managers can hand these out after particularly challenging projects or when the employee has excelled at a task. They are much more impactful because, much like recognition letters and notes, they are unexpected. Salary increases are another excellent way of showing employees your appreciation. Employees want to know that you value their work, and that is reflected in the increase you give them. Lastly, you can give stock options or equity gains. They help employees feel they have some ownership of the company. The added benefit of these bonuses is that they can increase employee loyalty, reduce churn rate, and decrease hiring and training costs. Many businesses do not invest in their employees' professional development. They expect them to gain new skills and level up their skills without input from the business, at their own time, and their own cost. Businesses that take the different approach of providing professional development opportunities typically have happier employees who are more likely to stay with them for longer. Businesses can provide such opportunities by sponsoring conference attendance. These conferences provide excellent learning opportunities and can help employees gain new skills that make them better at their jobs. They also provide additional networking opportunities. While no business wants to let its employees go, those who feel like you are allowing them to rise the professional ranks will always be grateful and happy to go above and beyond for the business. Businesses can also support professional development by paying for educational courses. These days, there are innumerable online courses that teach different skills employees can learn from. Businesses can show their recognition and appreciation of their employees by paying for these courses outright or reimbursing employees who complete them and earn certifications. It is fine to appreciate employees privately, but doing so publicly can also have a significant positive impact on metrics like employee happiness. Businesses can use numerous options to show employee recognition publicly, starting with company-wide email announcements. If your business regularly sends employees emails, you can use one of these emails to show appreciation to specific employees. You can make this a monthly or quarterly thing, but many businesses see the best outcomes when they show appreciation after specific projects. Effective employee appreciation and recognition require a careful approach and serious thought while combining different recognition options for different employees. Personalised or public recognition, depending on the employee, can work very well to make them feel valued and seen, both of which can have a positive impact on their performance, happiness, and loyalty.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more mainstream, business owners are presented with a unique opportunity to tap into a growing market by installing an electric vehicle charging hub on their properties. By offering charging options, businesses can not only attract a steady flow of customers but also contribute to a more sustainable future. This guide will help you understand the importance of EV chargers and what steps to take to prepare your business for the growing demand. The rise in electric vehicle adoption is transforming the way people drive, and businesses that install EV chargers are positioning themselves at the forefront of this shift. Having chargers on-site can attract customers who drive electric vehicles, as they are often looking for convenient and reliable places to charge their cars while they shop, eat, or work. Additionally, installing EV chargers can lead to increased foot traffic, longer stays, and, ultimately, higher sales. Lastly, with governments around the world pushing for greener transportation solutions, investing in EV chargers could help your business stay ahead of potential regulations and incentives for clean energy. When it comes to selecting EV chargers, it's important to choose equipment that aligns with your business needs. For example, businesses located in high-traffic areas or those within the retail space may benefit from installing ultra-rapid chargers to accommodate drivers looking for a quick top-up. Before installing EV chargers, it's crucial to assess if your existing electrical infrastructure can handle the added load. Installing multiple chargers may strain your power supply, requiring upgrades like new circuits, transformers, or even a new connection to the grid. This ensures the system supports current and future needs. For larger installations, a new substation may be necessary to provide additional capacity and maintain system stability. Working with an Independent Connection Provider (ICP) can simplify this process. ICPs are authorised to design and build grid connections, ensuring compliance, streamlining installation, and expediting the deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, consider the costs associated with the installation process. Some regions offer grants, tax credits, or other financial incentives to businesses that install EV chargers. Be sure to explore these opportunities to help offset some of the upfront costs of setting up your charging stations. Once your EV chargers are installed, it's time to let your customers know. One of the most effective ways to do this is by updating your online presence. Many EV drivers rely on charging apps and websites to find nearby charging stations. Make sure your business is listed on these platforms, and include your charger details, such as the type of chargers and their availability. In addition to online listings, clear signage at your business location is essential. Make sure your chargers are easy to find and clearly marked to guide customers to the right spot. You can also offer promotions, such as discounted or free charging for a limited time, to encourage customers to visit and try out your new service. To maximise the impact of your chargers, think beyond just installing the equipment. Consider turning your location into a true electric vehicle charging hub. By offering additional amenities, such as comfortable seating areas, free Wi-Fi, or even food and drinks, you can create a destination where EV drivers will want to stop and spend time. Installing EV chargers at your business is a smart investment that can help you attract more customers, improve your brand's image, and contribute to a more sustainable future. By selecting the right chargers, preparing your infrastructure, and promoting the new service, you can ensure that your business stands out in the growing electric vehicle market. With the right planning and execution, your investment in EV chargers can offer long-term rewards and position your business as a leader in the green revolution.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How AI is Shaking Up Affiliate Marketing and Informational Sites</td>\n",
       "      <td>Affiliate marketing used to be a thriving industry where businesses and creators worked hand-in-hand. But now, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to shake things up. And unlike McDonald's, not everyone's lovin' it—especially informational sites that depend on traffic and affiliate deals to survive. So, what's going on? AI has made marketing easier and faster. Predicting trends, creating content, and personalising customer experiences are all things AI does better than any human. For businesses, it's a no-brainer. Why pay affiliates or rely on informational sites when AI can handle it all? With tools that crunch data in seconds, companies can find the best keywords, figure out where ads should go, and target their perfect customers without needing help. That leaves informational sites—once crucial for guiding traffic and boosting SEO—feeling a bit redundant. Sites like Bingo Paradise, which focus on creating expert-written, unbiased reviews, are increasingly going to face challenges. AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper AI churn out articles faster than any human writer can, and they're often optimised to climb search engine rankings. Businesses can now produce their own content in-house, instead of relying on affiliates or informational sites to drive visitors their way. And here's the kicker: search engines seem to love this AI-created content. That means sites like Bingo Paradise are finding it harder to get noticed, losing traffic to the flood of AI-generated blogs and articles out there. AI is making it easier for companies to deal directly with customers. Using machine learning, they can figure out exactly what their audience wants and serve it up with personalised ads, recommendations, and even chatbots. This direct-to-consumer approach is bad news for informational sites and affiliates, who used to act as the middlemen. It's a double whammy for informational sites. Organic traffic is dropping, and affiliate payouts are getting smaller. With businesses investing in AI to do the heavy lifting, these sites are finding it harder to rank in search results or offer anything that stands out. Despite these challenges, sites like Bingo Paradise can still provide significant value in an AI-driven world. The reviews offered on platforms like this aren't just content churned out by algorithms—they're based on real-world, lived experiences. AI simply can't replicate the human effort involved in trying and testing bingo brands. For instance, a proper review requires signing up to the platform, navigating the interface, playing games, and even depositing money to assess the site as a genuine player. These steps ensure the reviews are comprehensive and authentic. Additionally, evaluating customer service—whether through live chat, email, or phone support—requires actual interaction to gauge responsiveness, professionalism, and helpfulness. In a similar way, a function of Bingo Paradise is to list and categorise welcome offers. For instance, if a brand claims to be offering free spins no deposit, Bingo Paradise's team will actually check that claim (by claiming the offer) and listing the offer here – Ai just can't do that... yet! This hands-on approach is something AI cannot do. While AI can summarise data or compile information, it lacks the ability to provide genuine insights based on actual user experiences. This authenticity is what makes Bingo Paradise's content trustworthy and valuable to readers looking for honest recommendations. But all isn't lost. Sites can fight back by using AI themselves—creating better content, improving their user experience, and finding clever ways to stand out. Focusing on niche topics, building a loyal community, and offering something personal or interactive could be the key to staying relevant. There's no denying AI is changing everything, and it's not going to stop. For sites like Bingo Paradise, staying ahead means adapting quickly, trying new strategies, and making the most of what humans still do best—connecting with other humans. Businesses, on the other hand, are loving the AI revolution. It's helping them cut costs, engage directly with customers, and leave less room for traditional sites to play their part. If informational sites don't evolve soon, they risk being left behind in this fast-moving, AI-dominated world.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Building Resilience: How Businesses Can Thrive Amid Industry Disruptions</td>\n",
       "      <td>Business resilience is the ability of a company to adapt successfully to disruptions, maintain its operations, and safeguard its assets and reputation. It sometimes involves crisis management and encompasses proactive measures, including innovation, strategic planning, and workforce engagement for long-term stability. The most resilient businesses share a few important traits: agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Agility is the cornerstone of business resilience. Businesses that can successfully pivot in response to market changes or disruptions are often the ones that survive and thrive. Agility enables companies to identify and act on emerging opportunities before their competitors. Agile organisations empower teams to make swift, informed decisions. Diversifying revenue streams can help to build agility. Relying on a single product or market leaves a business vulnerable to disruption. Leveraging technology and tools like real-time data analytics also helps; companies can monitor trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Consulting with professionals like corporate solicitors can help businesses during restructures or acquisitions. These legal experts can advise on compliance with company law, draft contracts for new ventures, and offer guidance on funding and investment. Preparedness is the ability to anticipate and plan for potential disruptions. Companies that invest in robust contingency planning can maintain their operations and recover more quickly from any setbacks. Being prepared means teams know what to do in emergencies, reducing downtime and minimising damage. Prepared organisations often have resources to weather temporary revenue declines or unexpected expenses. Innovation helps businesses stay relevant in constantly changing markets. Businesses that strive to continuously improve and invest in new ideas are better equipped for shifting consumer preferences and technological advancements. Innovative companies can differentiate themselves by offering unique products, services, or solutions. Jacob Beckley, Fusion92's senior vice president of innovation, has told Business News Daily, \"[Innovation] embodies the improvement of something that has come before. It is the evolution of convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" No business can build resilience without strong leadership. In times of disruption, leaders provide the vision, stability, and decision-making that keeps teams focused and motivated. Effective leaders communicate openly and honestly with their teams, fostering trust even in uncertain situations. Michael Shribman, president and founder at APS Global Partners Inc, has written that effective communication leads to increased productivity, enhanced collaboration, better decision-making, and customer satisfaction. Leadership is also important in navigating legal and organisational complexities. Leaders may work closely with legal experts to address challenges such as regulatory compliance, liability management, and reorganisations. Data is a powerful tool to predict and respond to industry disruptions. Businesses that leverage analytics gain insights into market trends, operational inefficiencies, and potential risks. Using predictive analytics, companies can anticipate disruptions through trend analytics. Building resilience is not a one-time effort but rather an ongoing process that requires agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Even amid constant disruption, businesses that embrace these traits can navigate challenges and seize opportunities, ensuring their long-term success. From adapting quickly to market changes to developing contingency plans and fostering innovation, resilience allows an organisation to thrive in uncertainty.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Smithfield was the site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a meat market in the Victorian period, when bringing livestock into the growing city became impractical. The famous meat market was located just outside the City's historic walls. Smithfield was the site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a market. The current Grade II listed market buildings were built in the Victorian period. Now, after 900 years, it will be shut down forever thanks to the Labour government's inflationary anti-business budget. Because of the high costs of the new Labour budget and resultant inflationary costs, sadly, adverse economic pressures eventually forced the closure after a failed move to Dagenham, East London. \"Project costs have risen due to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction, which have made the move unaffordable,\" the City corporation said in a statement on Tuesday. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in 1868. Planners for the Labour controlled City of London now want to demolish the 900-year-old market to build bland social housing projects for illegal migrants in the heart of the City. Smithfield and Billingsgate markets were London institutions and defined the capital for 900 years but have tragically fallen to the incompetence, naive idiocy and economic ignorance of Labour policies. \"This market is sacred ground for many Londoners. It's survived wars, plagues, fires, civil unrest, famines, and everything else, but it could not survive the stupid cunts who run the Labour government,\" a former market trader stated. In other news: Due to heavy anti-business red tape, and costs caused by Labour, the Vauxhall car company will also shut in Luton losing 1,100 jobs. Unrealistic and prohibitive Net Zero rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.</td>\n",

Labour's wretched Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, along with being a vindictive vengeful Leninist harridan, is hell-bent on destroying established family businesses, and any incentive to start new ones, with her 20 per cent Family Death Tax, levied each time a family business passes a generation. Labour's decision to kill off home-grown family businesses and entrepreneurs is a tragedy. In particular, small businesses and start-ups will suffer and become extinct after being disproportionally punished. Labour has demonstrated its true colours with a reprehensible budget that is engrained within Marxist communist idealogical policies. Let it not be a mystery why Labour is causing huge damage to the business world and economy of Britain at large. We provide the answers to why Labour is carrying out the destruction of entrepreneurship and business in the UK. The Labour Party has shown its true communist, anti-capitalist political ideology with the Rachel Reeves budget, which needlessly increased taxes by over £40 billion — the highest tax burden in British history. Its adoption of pure Marxist ideological processes has ruined any form of aspiration or entrepreneurs here in the UK, damaging the British economy for the next four or five decades.</td>\n",

       "      <td>If ten years ago, esports disciplines were perceived by society as a form of leisure for teenagers, today, the attitude towards this direction has changed. This opinion is evidenced by the popularisation of esports in the media space, where authors of materials report on the results of competitions or the number of visitors during esports tournaments. In addition, most fans of esports games and traditional sports can enthusiastically accept the appearance of virtual table tennis. This is an expected event since the following types of e-sports disciplines are already in demand: efootball, ebasketball, and ehockey. VR table tennis was part of the first Olympic eSports Week in June 2023 in Singapore, when it was held as an exhibition event. The success of this landmark event has motivated the International Table Tennis Federation Executive Board to approve the creation of a virtual reality table tennis tournament next year. ITTF President Petra Sörling noted that VR table tennis will encourage the growth of table tennis worldwide. It is also important that VR table tennis attracts the attention of leading brands that provide sports and esports content. For example, the BETER brand has added VR table tennis competitions to its sports portfolio, which has already featured competitions in real table tennis and basketball. In the Setka Cup (BETER Sports' flagman product) virtual reality competition, professional athletes play in a virtual reality format. Each professional table tennis player wears a VR headset, and the competition takes place in the state-of-the-art BETER table tennis simulator. The nearest opportunity to learn more about VR table tennis will be a large-scale event – ICE Barcelona. iGaming industry leaders may join the BETER team at booth 4B18 to learn more about: ICE Barcelona 2025 is a significant event for gaming authoritative representatives across the globe.</td>\n",

This reward, funded by the general assembly and administered by the state treasurer, is intended to encourage collaboration between law enforcement and private citizens in identifying individuals unlawfully residing in Mississippi, thereby assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in their removal efforts. Mississippi's House Bill 1484 proposes the creation of a hotline where people can report immigrants in the country illegally. Reports that result in arrest and imprisonment are eligible for a $1,000 reward. Separately, the bill proposes the creation of the \"Mississippi Illegal Alien Certified Bounty Hunter Program\" through which the state government can license \"bounty hunters\" to \"find and detain illegal aliens.\" Bounty hunters from many neigbouring states are now rushing to Mississippi to see if they can be included in the program. If other states adopt the same program, the problem of illegal immigration could be solved in less than six months purely on the monetary incentives. As of today's report, the bill has not passed yet, but due to the urgency and magnitude of the illegal alien problem in the United States, and the Trump administration putting such importance on the issue, the bill is set to pass very soon. \"If you round up ten of them a day, that's like ten grand a day.

The Democrat Party through USAID funded thousands of news outlets to provide \"balanced journalism\" The massive censorship of global media was pushed by the Democrat Party under Obama and Biden, who effectively controlled all media forcing a far-left communist narrative. The Daily Squib noticed a shift in 2013 when our website was nearly wiped off the internet. Speaking at the 2024 Davos event, IN's CEO argued that global advertisers should give preference to spending ad dollars on \"good news.\" In other words, this would pressure companies to spend exclusively on far-left corporate media outlets while ensuring they slash ad spending on alternative media websites that do not promote state propaganda. USAID has pushed nearly half a billion dollars ($472.6m) through a secretive US government financed NGO, \"Internews Network\" (IN), which has \"worked with\" 4,291 media outlets, producing in one year 4,799 hours of broadcasts reaching up to 778 million people and \"training\" over 9000 journalists (2023 figures). IN has also supported social media censorship initiatives. The operation claims \"offices\" in over 30 countries, including main offices in US, London, Paris and regional HQs in Kiev, Bangkok and Nairobi. It is headed up by Jeanne Bourgault, who pays herself $451k a year. Bourgault worked out of the US embassy in Moscow during the early 1990s, where she was in charge of a $250m budget, and in other revolts or conflicts at critical times, before formally rotating out of six years at USAID to IN. Bourgault's IN bio and those of its other key people and board members have been recently scrubbed from its website but remain accessible at http://archive.org. Records show the board being co-chaired by Democrat securocrat Richard J. Kessler and Simone Otus Coxe, wife of NVIDIA billionaire Trench Coxe, both major Democratic donors. In 2023, supported by Hillary Clinton, Bourgault launched a $10m IN fund at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). The IN page showing a picture of Bourgault at the CGI has also been deleted. IN has at least six captive subsidiaries under unrelated names, including one based out of the Cayman Islands. Since 2008, when electronic records begin, more than 95% of IN's budget has been supplied by the US government (US TAXPAYERS). Thanks to Wikileaks for the investigation.</td>\n",

There are estimated to be approximately 19,000 illegal Indians in the U.S. currently that are known, but the numbers are always speculative. More efficiency needed These are expensive flights, and one wonders if the Trump administration could cut costs by shipping them in cargo ships instead? To ship the migrants in a cargo ship would be the optimal cheaper option, and more illegal migrants could be accommodated at once. Logistically speaking, a supertanker could easily hold 12,000–20,000 people, however there could be a problem in converting the ships to hold passengers as they are primarily designed only for non-human cargo but with a little ingenuity it could be done. Additionally, specialist camps would have to be built near the ports so that the illegal aliens could be held en masse before being deported on the waiting tankers to their final destination. Yes, this would involve some cost and logistical planning, but it would literally save billions in costs, because shipping illegals by the 200 in military aircraft is hugely expensive and time-consuming, especially to destinations like India. If Trump wants to get serious, he's going to have to up his game because these are rookie numbers he's dealing with here. He needs to build holding camps ASAP. He needs to acquire and retrofit ships. He needs to mobilise street by street search squads and detain illegals with trucks. Otherwise, 200 here, 200 there, is purely a symbolic gesture for the cameras, it's like a drop in the ocean. Remember, there are an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the USA right now.</td>\n",

The amount of work that needs to be done to America to fix the terrible damage will take more than four years to complete, and if the people want another Trump term, he should be allowed to complete his work for the sake of the nation. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 in response to Franklin Roosevelt's four-term presidency. Before Roosevelt, no president had ever run for reelection after serving two terms — a norm that dated back to George Washington. Some could say that Barack Obama effectively had a third term when Joe Biden was supposedly voted in to office in 2020 despite being clinically senile. It was the Obama administration that conducted much of the operations during the four-year nightmare. The good news is that Trump was elected as president for non-consecutive terms, therefore technically speaking, the 22nd Amendment could be altered to take this fact into account, and he could put himself forward for another election as a de facto second (third) term. The downside to this would be that Trump would be 82 years old by the end of his current four-year term, and his general health and mental state could have deteriorated by then. De-woking the United States is going to be one hell of a task, and Trump is pretty much the only candidate at the moment capable of such an enormous commitment. Hopefully, the 22nd Amendment can be tweaked and adjusted for the sake of the great United States.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Taking a career break can be rejuvenating and provide valuable life experiences. However, returning to work after an extended period away can also be daunting. The workplace changes rapidly, and you may feel out of touch with the current job market. By taking the right steps to update your skills and polish your application, you can successfully relaunch your career. Today, we will discuss some tips to help you land that ideal job and smoothly re-enter the professional world. Follow this guidance to refresh your CV, ace the interview and leverage your break into a unique selling point. A well-written cover letter is your chance to introduce yourself and explain your reasons for applying. With competition often fierce, your letter must grab the recruiter's attention. Avoid generic openings and make your motivation clear from the outset. Explain how your skills make you the ideal candidate. Cover letter templates can provide useful starting points, but ensure your letter sounds natural and reflects your personality. Tailor the content to the role, highlighting relevant experience. Refer to the job description and use matching keywords. Research the company values and link these to your own qualities. Keep to one page in length and check for errors. Use a formal tone, but inject some warmth by avoiding clichés. Sign off with a note of appreciation for their consideration. With a compelling, polished cover letter, you can get your application noticed. A strong CV summarises your career history and showcases your abilities. After a break, carefully update your CV to reflect any new skills gained and your current career aims. List your work chronologically, keeping the details concise and relevant. Emphasise accomplishments and the value you brought to past employers. Use powerful action verbs like \"led\", \"spearheaded\", and \"accelerated\". Consider adding a brief profile at the top highlighting your most relevant skills and experience. This provides immediate impact when read quickly. Explain any gaps positively, focusing on new capabilities, volunteering or training. List relevant courses, certificates, languages and IT skills. Check that references are current and ask for endorsements from LinkedIn contacts. Review it for spelling and formatting errors before sending it out. A polished, well-structured CV will make the shortlist. Thorough preparation is key to interview success. Research the company, role and current industry trends. Compile relevant examples that demonstrate desired competencies like teamwork, creativity or leadership. Plan your route to arrive 10 minutes early. Dress smartly and professionally. Greet the interviewer warmly and with good eye contact. Listen carefully to each question. Provide concise yet detailed responses relating back to the role requirements. Prepare intelligent questions that show your understanding of and interest in the company. Avoid interrogating the interviewer but ask for clarification if needed. Finally, finish strongly by summarising your suitability for the role. With practice and planning, you can present yourself as the ideal candidate. A career gap can set you apart if leveraged well. Draw out skills gained during your time away that would benefit the new employer. Emphasise any experiences relevant to the role, like volunteering, study, travel or family care. Explain how the break has energised you and given you renewed focus. Highlight what motivates you about this next step and why it excites you. Convey your passion and readiness to throw yourself into the new opportunity. Frame your break as an asset that has allowed personal growth and the chance to develop abilities. With the right spin, taking time out can strengthen your application and reveal you as a well-rounded, motivated candidate. Networking is crucial when re-entering the job market. Attend industry events and connect with former colleagues. Join alum groups and professional associations to widen your contacts. Consider informational interviews to gain advice from those in your target field. A strong network provides support and surfaces unadvertised opportunities. Consider short courses or online training to refresh industry knowledge and technical skills. Gain relevant qualifications and certificates to fill any gaps in your CV. Emphasise your commitment to lifelong learning. Some employers may fund work-related education, so highlight your desire to continue developing. Re-entering the workplace after a break requires thorough preparation but offers a chance for a fresh start. Follow the guidance above to showcase your talents, highlight your renewed ambition and prove you are ready to hit the ground running. With determination, careful planning and a positive mindset, you can overcome any barriers and secure that ideal job.</td>\n",

       "      <td>An Englishman’s Guide to American “Football” (Which Isn’t Football at All, Really)</td>\n",
       "      <td>Right, listen up, ein Britishers! We need to have a chat about this peculiar American pastime they call \"football.\" Now, before you start assuming it's just our beloved game with a few quirky rule changes (like baseball is to cricket—an inferior imitation), let me stop you right there. This so-called \"football\" has about as much in common with football as a Labour politician has with common sense. Here's the first and most glaring issue: they barely use their fucking feet. Okay, there's a bit of kicking here and there—once every 45 minutes when someone remembers they actually have a foot—but for the most part, it's a game of throwing, carrying, and smashing into each other like a bunch of blootered pensioners outside a Wetherspoons on a Saturday afternoon. In fact, if we're being historically accurate, American football is far more like rugby than it is football. It started out as a chaotic mash-up of rugby and association football in the late 19th century, when American universities decided that simply playing one of the perfectly good existing sports from England wasn't confusing enough. No, like all American mash-ups they had to invent their own Frankensteinian version—one where they could wear a suit of fucking armour, stop every seven seconds for a committee meeting, and somehow still call it \"football.\" Back in the 1860s and 1870s, American universities were playing various versions of football, some resembling association football (our actual football) and others closer to rugby. Eventually, a chap named Walter Camp—an American, of course—decided that rugby wasn't quite organised enough, so he took it upon himself to ruin it with a bunch of additional rules, such as the line of scrimmage, downs, and most outrageously, the forward pass. The forward pass is where this game really goes off the rails. In rugby, you pass backwards like a civilised person. In American football, they decided, \"Nah, let's chuck it 40 yards forward and hope for the best.\" The result? A sport where hulking meathead jock brutes throw missiles at each other while wearing enough padding to survive a car crash. If you're a Brit watching American football for the first time, here's what you need to know: So there you have it, the Daily Squib guide to a game called American \"football\" which isn't really football—it's a bizarre, stop-start, hyper-commercialised fucked up version of rugby on steroids with added bureaucracy and unnecessarily complicated rules. But let's be fair to the Yanks—it is entertaining in its own over-the-top way, and the Super Bowl is quite the spectacle (mainly because of the half-time show and the woke NFL adverts, but still). Next time you're forced to watch this odd spectacle with American mates, just remember: it's not football, it's rugby with timeouts, an advertising budget, and a slightly inflated sense of self-importance. Now, who's up for a proper game of footie? Next week – Why the Game of Tennis is Strangely Tennis On Both Sides of the Atlantic ...</td>\n",

       "      <td>The UK under Labour is no friend to the United States, or to Trump. In fact, Labour is no friend to the UK either, and hates Britain, its history, its legacy, its culture and its people. Business is being punished, pensioners are being killed off, and heavy-duty taxation upon taxation and insane bureaucratic red tape has caused 80% of the UK's wealthy to flee Britain. Only last week, the irresponsibly stupid Chancellor Reeves caused a £459 million Glaxo deal to fall through the floor. Everything this arrogant harridan touches turns to shit. Forget about economic growth, the only thing Reeves knows how to grow is Britain's debt mountain and her fucking cunt hair. Trump needs to put tariffs on the UK by up to 60% or more and punish the Labour government with no mercy, because frankly, did they show mercy when they sent 100 of their communist activist agitators when they tried to thwart his re-election? Angela Rayner thinks Trump is an \"absolute buffoon. He has no place in the White House. He's an embarrassment, and he should be ashamed of himself\". Labour Foreign Minister, Lammy thinks Trump is \"a racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser\" and \"a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\". Peter Mandelson, despite his grovelling apology to Trump, still called him a \"danger to the world\" and \"a white nationalist and racist\". Britain is lost under Labour, it is now a nation that has been effectively taken over by the enemy of the USA, the enemy of the UK and the enemy of Trump. There's no \"special relationship\" left any more, and Labour have sealed themselves in alliance with China and the EU. There's no room for you Trump, there's no impetus for any goodies to come to the US with any trade deals or any economic riches. Rachel Reeves is continuing to ruin the economy and impoverish the embattled people of Britain daily with her negative-growth anti-capitalist strategies. Forget about Britain, it is now a cesspool of woke communist rhetoric, a ruined economy teetering on the edge of a very deep precipice. The strategy should be to deepen and hasten Labour's descent into the sewer by punishing the economy further. Once they have been ousted, it can be business as usual, but do not deal with these backstabbing shit talking fuckers while they're around. You will regret it, Mr. Trump...deeply.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When humans become too interconnected, they reject this state through war because too much connection creates a reaction of disconnection and a run to privacy. Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.</td>\n",

       "      <td>World Economic Forum: \"Brutal Totalitarian Communist China is Model For Western Nations\"</td>\n",
       "      <td>According to the World Economic Forum, which dictates to Western nations on policy, and future direction, the brutal bullying thugs of the Chinese Communist Party and its evil policies of totalitarian savagery are a model for Western nations to follow. This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China's CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a \"role model\" for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN's Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week's APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China's \"tremendous\" achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. \"I think it's a role model for many countries,\" Schwab said. \"I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,\" Schwab said. It's not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it's forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved \"peacefully.\" Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome's 1972 pro-depopulation book \"The Limits to Growth.\" Meadows argues that most of the world's population must be wiped out so that the survivors can \"have freedom\" and a \"high standard of living.\" During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world's population is \"inevitable.\" However, he insists that a \"benevolent\" dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population \"peacefully.\" \"We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,\" he says of the world's growing population. \"If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart ... and [people have] a low standard of living,\" Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Food scarcity, impossible prices, insane inflation and mass job losses/bankruptcies. Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down.

       "      <td>According to royal experts, Meghan Markle assumed she could move up royal rank and misunderstood how the monarchy works. \"Markle assumed by entering into the British royal family she would have the ability, like in her Hollywood life, to increase her rank in the royal family. This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that's it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. \"This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. \"Prince Harry once said 'What Meghan wants Meghan gets' and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry's life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. \"Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle's psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. \"Markle has modelled herself on Harry's mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. \"Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana's inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. \"Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. \"As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan's evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan's titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>To become a bona fide enemy of the state is no mean feat, but Harry and Meghan seem to have managed it with ease. Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain's enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain's Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry's Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain's enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle has made a remarkable request to the Queen that has caused shockwaves through royal circles. Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle's demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen's cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.</td>\n",

According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. \"The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace's footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like 'puta' and 'madre'. \"Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. \"The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers 'Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.' The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. \"The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day's business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.\" It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future. In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder.

       "      <td>Under the Obama administration China increased its economic stance tenfold off the back of America. Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden's recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA's national security.</td>\n",

Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child.

Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. \"It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians.

Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving 'woke' bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age.

We're not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me.

Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president's anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. \"No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it's because they are really scared he will win a second term.

       "      <td>Meghan Markle is acting in the biggest and most lucrative acting role ever — that of imitating Princess Diana. Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle's actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. \"Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. \"Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle's Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. \"This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person's weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. \"With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his 'mother' for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman's claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. \"My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.\"</td>\n",

Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. \"Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,\" the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being 'ordered' to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that's all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don't you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do. One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the 'voice of the people' has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have 'mental' problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle's bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that's what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world. People are sick of being lectured by you and your little boy — Harry.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Prince Harry, according to his advisers, is at his wits end about his wife Meghan Markle, who has a penchant for urinating in the lavish gardens of their new mansion in Santa Barbara. According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. \"We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That's when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,\" Harry was quoted in the book 'Fine Whine and Freedom'. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan's pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. \"It's acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!\" The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town's carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that's her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The communist heroes of Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA – Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels – were avowed racists who not only resented 'lazy' Mexicans but thought black people were closer to animals in opposition to the highly evolved biological nature of white people. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\" Isn't it ironic to see the communist flags flying at ANTIFA and BLM protests/riots and to hear the idiotic sputum spewing coming from one of the BLM founders, Cullors, that she is a trained Marxist is additionally hilarious to behold? Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx's racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of 'n*ggers' holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx's son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by \"one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood.\" In a letter to Lafargue's wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that's why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province. So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It's quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it's embarrassing that these supposedly 'anti-racism' groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The trials and tribulations of a former first lady are probably far-reaching and complex, and it is this complexity we can see in Michelle Obama, a woman who once had it all but now is a mere footnote in history. Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking 'whitey' for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle's famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine 'woke' propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There's only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. \"We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack's. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let's say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?\" What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: \"Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people's money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It's a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they're downers.\" Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Black Lives Matter and their extremist politically charged campaign may have backfired totally, as black people are now more hated and despised than before their nefarious BLM scorched earth campaign. The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. \"Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,\" an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of 'White Flight' where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China's power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China's land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Marxist groups for the Soviet Cultural Revolution of America have called for the great American presidents on Mount Rushmore to be replaced with the faces of Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) and Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi (founders of Black Lives Matter). \"We are petitioning the Lakota tribe elders, who really own the land on which Mount Rushmore resides to clear the racist presidents from the sculpture. Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,\" a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America's magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. \"We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,\" a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.</td>\n",

       "      <td>During the reign of the Nazi party in Germany, propaganda created by Goebbels made the Jews out to be an inferior race, the National Socialist regime effectively dehumanized Jewish people, instead of a hard-working, enterprising, resilient, and creative people, they were portrayed as inferior to the Aryan (pure) Germanic race. The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as 'anti-racism' by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews. White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM's ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population. History repeats itself sometimes in sinister ways.</td>\n",

All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. \"Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,\" the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: \"We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money.

       "      <td>Chinese communist propaganda and operators are working within groups like Black Lives Matter, and the overtly Marxist group ANTIFA to destabilise and encourage rioting in U.S. cities an intelligence group have revealed about the threat from China. These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America's campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg's Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals. There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system. \"Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,\" one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: \"Their goal is to exploit America's academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. \"It's smart. It's a long-term, patient approach.\" Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party's \"united front\" efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party's friends to strike at the party's enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It's not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples. Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!</td>\n",

In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole.

One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you 'Do Not Panic!' whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged. As Obama puts it 'the old white men', who somehow thwarted his hermaphrodite homosexual orgiastic dream last time around. This time however, the virus will no doubt kill these over sixties off, and bring in a new age for the young Marxist indoctrinated youth to savour. Cui bono?

       "      <td>Meghan Markle detests the Windsor Royal family and Britain with a vehemence, and is now embroiled in a dirty war to prove she is bigger than all who stand in her way. Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the 'Sussex Royal' name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan's modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. \"Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. \"Meghan's sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of 'charity funding'. The key factor is to 'virtue signal' for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. \"The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that's when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. \"We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of 'loving' Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Contamination of drinking water from faeces is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as diarrhoea and viral hepatitis. A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to \"at least basic sanitation\", a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment. High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi'an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!</td>\n",

       "      <td>With over 100,000 Chinese people infected, the deaths from coronavirus are being vastly misreported by the Chinese Communist State. Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs. Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again. The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run. If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.</td>\n",

Plug your chainsaw in and go round your Remainer neighbour's house with an extension lead in tow, why not carve up their wardrobe in the style of the goddess Britannia, or their kitchen table in the shape of the British Isles. As you pour another whisky, sit back and watch the news reports of Britain leaving the EU, smile like a Cheshire cat, put your feet up, snuggle your toes, and giggle insanely as you realise all of this is being powered by the sorrowful tears of Remainers.

chance for Russia to rearm before the next offensive; it is best to let Putin celebrate his pyrrhic victory. Let the Russians have their deluded fun. The meat grinder sometimes needs a little rest, some oiling before more Russian drone-fodder are sent into the muddy fields to have their bodies mutilated. The deluded Russians can wallow in their false success in \"winning\" the war in Ukraine, but first they're going to have to bury what's left of their army. Although the Kremlin will never reveal the death statistics, many experts estimate that the number is up in the millions. Yes, of course, the poor Ukrainians defending their land also died, but certainly the numbers will not be as high as the Russians, simply because they did not have enough men to throw into the meat grinder — not as much as the Russians. Lessons learned? Naturally, no one, especially the Russians, will learn from any of this, and the same thing will be repeated ad infinitum. Luckily, for everyone, Biden and Obama are not around any more to fuck things up again. The truth is, Putin wants Europe, and it seems the weak socialists of the EU will eventually bend over the table when the time comes and take one up the rectum for Putin with not even a tiny whimper or utterance of discomfort, such is their submissive cowardice. Once a surrender monkey, always a surrender monkey. Maybe the EU could send their Eurovision Song Contest applicants to the front lines to serenade the next wave of amphetamine drugged Russian conscripts as they push forward with blind gusto. No more help from Uncle Sam.   \n",

the case for American men as the batshit crazy, deranged blue-haired pierced and heavily tattooed liberal narcissistic women who voted for Kamala Harris have vowed to go celibate and abstain from men. It's double plus good news for the gene pool as these selfish, entitled, mentally ill, attention seeking harridans won't thankfully reproduce. \"For men, this makes things easier by taking psycho hose beasts out of the equation, only leaving the good women. The Trump win has truly been a wondrous event, as it effectively cleanses America of the shitty things, and brings back some form of goodness and purity to the country,\" a college student from Nebraska revealed. These liberal women have been so ideologically brainwashed and mentally damaged by the Kamala Harris campaign that they are going on TikTok to publicly display their total and utter shameful, demoralised mental conditions of utter indignity to everyone. The ironic thing is, these dumbos only sleep with liberal men who voted for Kamala as well, so they're taking them out of the gene pool too — triple fucking bonus. No need for your much-loved right to have abortions any more — quadruple fucking bonus!!!   \n",

be interned in a \"camp\" when former President Donald Trump wins a second term in the White House this November. During an interview with Maddow in Monday's Unreliable Sources newsletter, CNN Democrat propagandist Benson Burner asked the MSNBC host about her concerns about being targeted during a second Trump administration. \"Trump and his allies are openly talking about doing the same thing the Democrats have unjustly done to him. Weaponising the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing the 'treacherous and treasonous scum',\" noted Burner. \"You're one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target?\" Rachel Maddow replied: \"I'm worried, but I'm actually ready for being in a camp because I'm a bleeding heart liberal propagandist for the Democrat Party. I don't read the news in an objective fashion or without obvious bias in any way. When Trump invokes the Insurrection Act to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, I will be cheering like a cheer leader because it plays into my perpetual liberal victim state of mind. Also, when Trump imprisons me in a FEMA concentration camp, I will be able to play the part of martyr, and virtue signal to my fellow liberal socialist Americans of my suffering for the cause of socialism and communism in America. \"When Trump puts millions of blacks, criminals, Mexicans, gays, and migrants into the concentration camps, I will be happy because it would have proved my point that my scaremongering before the election actually did not work and millions of Americans voted for Donald J. Trump anyway. \"In the camps of the future it won't be so bad either, there will be plenty of women for me to become friends with. I hope Trump puts me in one of those all female camp buildings. I'll be up to my eyeballs in pussy. Really, there's nothing to fear folks, everything I say on MSNBC is absolute bullshit, and I am essentially an actor. Anyone who takes me seriously must be as mad as I am.\" The 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' seems to be in full force before the coming U.S.elections.   \n",

Janice Munklehouse, 21, from Grimisbury on Thames, Lincolnshire worked on cruise ships for 38 years, and regularly shares advice for passengers and crew on her Cruising Da Seas Innit YouTube channel. Now, she has shared how passengers can make the most of their voyage with her own expert tips. Read on below for the six top tips she had for cruise passengers. Don't fall overboard whilst boarding the ship Kicking off with the first piece of advice to get ahead of the game while travelling on a cruise, Janice said people should always avoid falling overboard whilst boarding the cruise ship. She said that, it is best to arrive at the destination of your cruise embarkation point \"as early as possible\", suggesting a late arrival may mean you rush to board the ship loaded with luggage and fall into the sea. While the cruise ship worker said that many people avoid drowning or being crushed by other boats in the harbour, she has seen many passengers falling off the boarding ramp in a rush to board the ship. \"One fella comically tried to jump over 17 feet because he was late for the cruise. He was summarily chewed up in the propellers, but his cruise ticket and hairbrush were thankfully recovered by a fisherman 6 months later in the stomach of a Mako shark.\" Don't jump off the ship when it's cruising Moving on to her next tip, Janice encouraged passengers to not jump off the ship when it was cruising in the ocean. Janice said jumping off the cruise ship whilst moving would not be very nice for the passenger. She said that: \"Jumping into the ocean from your ultra-luxury cruise line would mean that you miss a lot of activities on board like karaoke, disco night and various themed buffets\". She said that, while it may be tempting to jump from the deck of your cruise ship to avoid all the old codgers and nouveau riche arseholes, bad things could happen to you in the open ocean hundreds of miles from shore. Don't fall off the ship The cruise worker highlighted the potential dangers of falling off the ship. If passengers wear inadequate footwear or lean over the edge of the ship, they could slip and fall into the ocean, which would not be such a good cruise ship experience. Don't get pushed off the ship Janice's fourth piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when going on a cruise concerned not being pushed off the ship. She urged anyone looking to enjoy their holiday cruise to avoid being pushed over the side of the ship into the ocean by some nutter on board or an angry crew member. During her 38 years working on cruise ships, Janice says she has witnessed a number of crew members who have had to push annoying passengers overboard for being arseholes. She warned that many passengers end up in the ocean because the crew have simply had enough. There's only so much a crew member can take, so don't be an arse and get on everyone's tits. Don't fall out of your cabin window The cruiser worker's penultimate tip of six urged holidaymakers not to open the cabin window and hang over the edge, especially when drunk out of their minds on cheap watered-down booze. Elaborating on this point, she suggested it would always be best to simply use the cabin window to look at the ocean and not to jump into the water from it. Janice remarked: \"You may run the risk of getting eaten by sharks, or simply drowning\". Don't fall off the ramp whilst disembarking Her final piece of advice for how to be a smart passenger when disembarking a cruise ship concerned not falling off the ramp into the polluted, dangerous waters at port. Janice suggested this could be potentially very dangerous for the passenger. She said: \"The reason you want to decide on these things before you disembark is because if you fall overboard, things could get rather messy. I once saw an elderly passenger ingest an entire humungous turd in one gulp when she fell in the water near a sewage outflow pipe\". The veteran cruise worker also said that avoiding falling or jumping off a cruise ship should be a priority for most passengers, but naturally some were just born to do it. Once passengers disembarked, Janice admitted she and the crew were glad all the whinging fuckers had gone and hoped they would never be seen again — that is, until the next batch boarded the cruise ship for a trip they would surely regret for a lifetime.   \n",

                      The public will be lectured on \"motivational\" socialist principles, and Labour diktats every day of their lives, a newly published manifesto paper has revealed. Speakers and microphones will be installed in every lamp post in the UK proposed by the innovative Labour plan. Much like the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan's pet surveillance project, ULEZ, where every vehicle is tracked and charged in London, the proposed Labour \"Listen and Speak\" scheme will ensure that citizens are daily indoctrinated in soviet ideology and microphones will listen for any form of dissent against the ruling regime once it gains power in the coming election. LISTEN AND SPEAK Upon hearing of the Labour plans, one citizen voiced his distaste of such a scheme coming into fruition. \"If I want to live in fucking North Korea, I'll go and live there. Imagine walking down the street and being forced to listen to the irritating nasal droning from Comrade Starmer every fucking day of your life, listening to his awful grinding punishing nasal voice telling you how to think, what to do, where to go, I'd fucking top myself.\" Along with daily lectures on the greatness of Labour socialist schemes, citizens will be indoctrinated in EU values and other communist rhetoric. If people are seen to be wearing headphones whilst walking in the streets, they will be told to take the device off from their heads, or if they are Bluetooth headphones, the Labour \"Listen and Speak\" system will hijack the Bluetooth headphones to force the citizen to listen to the latest soviet Labour messages being broadcast. Along with speakers installed on every lamp post, the Labour plan is to also install powerful microphones that will monitor each citizen's speech. The listening devices will be powered by AI and will alert the Labour Stasi authorities if any citizen speaks adversely about the Labour regime at any time or says any word that is forbidden by woke programmers who have infiltrated the English language. \"If someone says any forbidden words or speaks badly about the Labour soviet system, the AI system will identify the offender, who will then be removed from their home in the early hours of the morning. These offending individuals will then be sent to an EU sanctioned re-education centre and reprogrammed to love the Labour EU State.,\" a jubilant Labour spokesman revealed on Thursday. Comrade Starmer pronounced the scheme as a measure to \"safeguard and ensure the safety of every British citizen\" and a way to uphold \"the beloved EU rules which Labour is dedicated to rejoining\".   \n",

One has to understand that the controllers work in 50 and 100 year increments and their primary modus operandi is one that may either surprise you or deep down your sub-conscious probably already knows what is going on. What is the last bastion of control over the human population? The inside of your mind, of course, this has eluded the controllers for centuries. Even the Spanish Inquisition could not get close to that level of knowledge or control, or the Nazis, or the Soviet communist dictators or the religious organisations. As a control system, religion has wavered and is not as powerful a tool for complete control any more, and this is why the controllers needed access to your most intimate thoughts, your thought cycles, as well as your very methods of thought. This process would need machines that replicate human thought to some extent, and what better way than a personal computer touted as a way to enhance human activity. Even programming languages effectively replicate human thought processes to some extent with variables, strings and multiple processing architectural archetypes that are the basic structure of 1010101, the universal on-off switch for every permutation of every possible combination of mathematical and human existence. Who's programming who, the human on the computer, or the computer on the human? Essentially speaking, the personal computer introduced to the public was a first major step into delving into the minds of the population, giving the controllers a basic map of the internal minds of humans. The next step was connectivity, and this is when the DARPA project of an internet was introduced to the general public. All of this trained internal data had to move around, it had to evolve and of course it had to be collected and filed by the controllers in their massive database banks. The internet allowed the controllers to see what people liked/disliked, it allowed them to delve into the darkest secrets of human activity as well as the thought processes and decisions people made in their lives. Every single facet of human behaviour was intricately analysed, logged and filed and in the present time it still is right now. The smartphone was then introduced as an additional form of ultimate human control. This technique was a goldmine of information for the benefit of AI systems because it formed a much more intimate picture of human activity and behaviour simply because of its small size. A mobile phone is easy to carry and is with humans pretty much all the time, whereas a bulky personal computer is generally not with a person at all times. The vast amount of data collected through this method is too vast to even comprehend for most people, but smartphones along with things like apps are a vast treasure trove of data helping the controllers map out the human brain and its collective methods. People cannot do without their smartphones now, they are totally addicted and attached to them. Studies have now shown that by taking smartphones away from some people who are then put into a room alone, results in them self-harming themselves, such is the level of control over their entire being and mind. Human data to benefit of AI systems AI will fully understand and replicate the human mind. It does not need to sleep, it does not need wage rises or maternity leave or holidays. There are no industrial disputes with AI, there are no sick days or loss of productivity. This is why AI was fed the entirety of human data because humans will be replaced by these systems soon enough as is the plan by the controllers. To fully control something, first you must completely understand every facet of it. Mapping out every single dendrite, synapse and connection of the human brain is another major project currently underway. What do you do with the entire data set of the human mind; the books, the literature, the behaviour analytics, the thought processes, the creativity, the emotions, the biases, the infinite variables and combinations of discourse etc.? You feed it all into AI machine learning projects, and this is the key factor in all the control processes envisioned by the controllers. This is all set up for the benefit of AI systems. For thousands of years they have dreamed of this very moment because they have been the few and the population has been the many, they have feared greatly of losing their grip on humanity, of losing their position of control. This is why companies like Apple recently produced an advert for their new iPad Pro with an M-chip that depicts the entire breadth and width of human culture, creativity, and art being crushed by a rubbish disposal machine. This depiction signals the final rallying call that machines have ultimately superseded the human experience and this is just the beginning of the end for the traditional biological state of humanity. In the future, when the brain chip is introduced to the entire population, it will be the final step of ultimate control. By then they will have mapped out the human brain in its entirety, and the controllers will gain direct access into every single thought and memory of each human. As is today, humans cannot function in business or anything without a smartphone, and this will be the method used for the brain chip as well. Elon Musk, a sinister deviant character, is tasked with the initial rollout of this technology, but there are others in the pipeline right now as well if he fails. Ultimately, humanity is on the cusp of a major epoch regarding the benefit of AI systems, a time of change so extreme that may bring back a state of feudalism once again but this time it will be an all encompassing form of technological feudalism and slavery incorporating complete control of the last bastion of human control — the brain.

political party was suitably suppressed and instead the moderate socialist party of Germany, Christian Democratic Union [CDU] party won the election on Sunday night. With a substantially declining economy, Germany's heyday seems to have come and gone and Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting after winning elections on Sunday, will most probably continue to steer the country's decline as well as gloss over the increasing tensions over mass unfettered immigration into the EU zone. \"It is imperative that the EU nations are weakened further by mass unfettered immigration from Islamic countries and the Third World, and that daily terrorist attacks continue on innocent German civilians so that more fear and terror is perpetuated within EU nations and their indigenous populations are fractured further. Patriotism within EU nations is being destroyed more thoroughly every year, but substantially more damage has to be implemented. For full integration into a single soviet communist bloc, all vestiges of former national identity and racial purity must be destroyed. The DNA of white Europeans must be muddied and defiled to such a level that all those blonde, blue-eyed beautiful women will transform into something completely different. Look at Sweden, where they are being raped, stabbed, shot daily. This is the plan,\" an unnamed unelected intermediary revealed on Monday.   \n",

announce that all your previously encrypted data on Apple devices will be freely viewable by any Labour government official, thoughtcrime Stasi officer, or any third party/hackers. The People's Republic of Soviet Britain has ordered the vile capitalist American tech company Apple to take away any form of encryption defence for their devices, so all your data will be viewable by anyone who wants to view it. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY Yes, this new Labour Directive is for your own safety, as we will arrest you for thoughtcrimes that you may utter that may be harmful to yourself and consequently to the Big State. We thank the socialist Conservative government who created this directive before we assumed power. Commissar Yvette Cooper, our chief Stasi Thoughtcrime Officer, has kindly arranged for the entirety of your private data to be transferred periodically to our own databases where it will be monitored and examined with a digital microscope. The stupid capitalist democratic Americans have threatened the UK. They say our removal of encryption poses a serious a threat to American national security and that the US government should re-evaluate its intelligence-sharing agreements with the UK. The People's Republic of Soviet Britain does not take orders from capitalist swine, and we do not care about the USA. Fuck America! REMEMBER, BY TAKING AWAY ENCRYPTION, HACKERS WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER YOUR APPLE DEVICE'S DATA WITH EASE – HAVE A NICE DAY! Comrade Starmer and Commissar Reeves, who recently visited fellow communist state China, were given tips on how to implement the same Police State principles they utilise. Double plus good news, comrades! Biometric face recognition has been implemented in Cardiff, Wales, and will be rolled out to the entirety of the UK soon. The Stasi Thoughtcrime Ministry will also implement a Chinese Soviet style Citizen Rating System (social credit system) that will punish citizens who commit thoughtcrimes against the Big State by limiting their freedoms even further, and in some cases imprisoning them in gulags or detaining them in Labour Woke Re-education Facilities. INGSOC NOTICE 4532652-239187677818223-4313-923-2-32-2-1-234-1 CITIZEN MARY SMITH, 12, WAS AWARDED 2.1 GRAMS OF SUGAR RATION INCREASE FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH FOR REPORTING THOUGHTCRIMES COMMITTED BY HER 8-YEAR-OLD BROTHER, HER GRANDMOTHER AND HER FATHER. THE THOUGHTCRIMES WERE COMMITTED AWAY FROM THEIR APPLE IPHONE DEVICES AND THE BIG STATE COULD NOT MONITOR THEIR ACTIVITIES AT THE TIME. THE THOUGHTCRIMINALS WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR PLACE OF ABODE AND HAVE NOW BEEN PERMANENTLY ERASED/CANCELLED. REMEMBER COMRADES, THE BIG STATE IS ALWAYS WATCHING BUT IF YOU SEE, HEAR ANYTHING, REPORT IT IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR LOCAL STASI AGENT WITHOUT DELAY. THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY!   \n",

                                                 A tailoring expert at the famous Savile Row street in Mayfair, London has revealed that if Ukraine's president Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky wore a suit like Vladimir Putin, he might be taken a little more seriously. \"Trump is a businessman. He just sees dollars, nothing else. Everything is monetary to him, especially war. That's why Zelensky needs to start wearing a suit pronto if he wants to keep his job fighting the Russians. Maybe get a few gold taps. Look at Putin with his immaculate tailored suits, prancing around his gold-plated palaces. He can murder 15,000 civilians in a morning, and no one will bat an eyelid because of his elegant suit,\" the tailor revealed. A gentleman is defined by their tailoring, irrespective of their actions on the battlefield or in the boardroom. Putin is no angel, but neither is Zelensky. Wars are not fought by angels. All those billions that Joe Biden threw at Zelensky, perpetuating the war in Ukraine, he of course did not siphon a few dollars here or a few dollars there into his own accounts in Switzerland? Maybe Keir Starmer could donate one of his freebie ill-appropriated designer suits to the Ukrainian president? \"We are sure Zelensky can afford to buy a bespoke tailored suit made from the finest materials,\" the tailor added. It's all getting a bit dodgy now, innit.   \n",

Without a viable threat either externally or internally, political and social division will reign. This is how events like Pearl Harbor and 911 were catalysts for national unity, enabling the governments of the time to implement their long laid plans with ease. Asking families to send their sons into battle and fomenting a nationwide enlistment drive is no easy task, especially if there are vast divisions within society, however with an existential threat looming, the population is manipulated into action willingly. The assassination attempt on Mr. Trump during the election campaign was also a huge unifier amongst the American people, and the president was propelled into heroic status not only for surviving the attack, but by displaying heroism in the face of extreme adversity, which played on the American ideals of courage, and defiance. The same sentiment could be applied to something like mass deportations of illegal aliens in the United States. President Trump is coming up against some serious headwinds to his deportation plans from the Democrat Party opponents for numerous reasons. Firstly, the illegal immigrants who were allowed into the country through the Biden and Obama open door policy are essentially future Democrat voters utilised in elections. It stands to reason that the Democrat Party would not want their voters to be deported because they will have less of a chance of winning future elections. It also stands to reason that Trump and the Republicans want to deport these illegal immigrants so they will have a better chance of winning future elections. Despite the intense division, bi-partisan unity could be achieved by presenting some kind of existential threat that would seemingly affect both political divides. Similarly, the Ukraine/Russia conflict is also on the Trump agenda at the moment, and this war poses an existential threat not only to Europe but to the entire globe, although the latter has been played down by the Trump admin. There is no easy single solution fix to this problem, and it will take multi-faceted avenues and a lot of patience to solve the imbroglio. The main contentious issue here is who is going to continue to foot the immense bill of prolonging the conflict, and apathy/cowardice from EU countries who do not want to get involved, even though the war is directly on their own doorstep. A possible Pearl Harbor event may present a remedy to this obstacle.   \n",

There was outrage at socialist propaganda network MSNBC as some of the data revealed that 16,055,117 U.S. citizens were receiving $1,800 per month in social security payments each between the ages of 110-369. The total monthly payments would be $28,899,210,600 (approximately $28.9 billion). The total annual payments would be: 28,899,210,600×12=346,790,527,200 So, the yearly cost would be $346.79 billion in fraudulent payments. \"As a devout far leftist Democrat, I am sickened to see these social security payments investigated by Elon Musk. Don't forget, all of these people receiving U.S. taxpayer cash fraudulently are also registered to vote Democrat during elections as well, even though they are dead,\" MSNBC anchor Butch Manne shouted during another furious rant. Looks like the Democrat Party is finished. How are they going to win elections in the future? Former president, Joe Biden, was asked to comment on the findings but was not answering any calls on Tuesday. It's a good thing DOGE is never coming to the UK, the Labour Party and its supporters would all go to prison for a very long time indeed.   \n",

The time has come for our heroic young men to take up arms, don their finest surplus helmets, and march eastward into the grand meat grinder of history! Our wise and infallible leader, Comrade Keir Starmer, has announced Operation Poke Putin—a magnificent mission that will send your sons, brothers, and neighbours into the meat grinder trenches of Ukraine, all in the noble pursuit of soviet glory (and, perhaps, a slight provocation that might see Mother Britain turned into a glowing irradiated crater). Yes, dear comrades, Soviet Britain shall now take its rightful place at the front line of the perpetual war machine, offering up its dwindling underfunded and ill-equipped forces to ensure that the mighty Russian bear is sufficiently enraged. Do not worry, each regiment of brave soviet British cannon fodder will be provided with one outdated broken gun to share, and four bullets. With America pulling back under the weak-willed capitalist dog Donald Trump, it falls upon the EU's true visionary, Comrade Starmer, to lead the charge! Comrade Starmer will not be sending his kids to Ukraine, but it's okay, your kids will receive the full honour and privilege of filling the trenches. And what better way to secure the peace by poking the bear as well as placing thousands of untested British Generation Z conscripts right next to the Russian military? A brilliant strategy, one that even the ghosts of Napoleon and Hitler would surely admire! But this is no time for hesitation, comrades! The recruitment stations stand ready! Our proud Woke British military, already reduced to fewer men than a Victorian Boy Scout troop, must rise to the challenge! Who needs an army when we have sheer enthusiasm and unwavering woke communist ideological purity? Transgender and LGBTQP+ are all welcome, as well as our BLM brothers. Do not be discouraged by the whispers of doubt. Pay no heed to the weaklings who claim that provoking a nuclear-armed superpower might not be in the best interests of the British proletariat! Do not listen to the cowardly voices that say: \"Perhaps a hot war with Russia is not advisable.\" \"Maybe we should focus on rebuilding our own country instead of sending our soldiers into an unwinnable conflict.\" \"Why is Comrade Starmer so keen to offer up our troops when we barely have enough to defend the island itself?\" These are the musings of defeatists, reactionaries, and—dare we say—potential enemies of the Big State! Comrade Macron of the Glorious Soviet EU has sounded the horn of battle! The mighty European war machine—consisting of several dozen battle-ready spreadsheets—stands prepared to do what the Americans will not. And Soviet Britain shall lead the suicidal charge! Our French EU brothers are not cheese eating surrender monkeys like they were in previous wars, no, they are probably a lot worse this time around, fat and lazy too. What a glorious sight it will be when Soviet Britain's proud, underfunded, ill-equipped, woke forces march boldly into the heart of Ukraine, standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave EU Soviet peacekeepers—perhaps even in view of the Russian artillery and killer drones! And if our noble sacrifice should incite an overwhelming response, let it be known: we shall take the nuclear fire with pride! So come, young men of Soviet Britain! Sign up today! Your great leader, Comrade Starmer, has already written your fate on the pages of history. And if the price of glorious self-assured destruction is your bones ground into Ukrainian mud, then so be it! Long live Soviet Britain! Long live Operation Poke Putin! May Your sacrifice be remembered (for however long remains before the missiles arrive and everything is completely erased)!

about the authoritarian censorship in Europe and especially the UK was censored by the same apparatus that the American tried to convince to stop all the censoring. \"Ve vill not be lectured to by an American Schweinhund about our censoring. He has been ein cancelled and ein censored! Fahr zur Hölle! Go backen to your American Scheißloch and leave us to do what we do here!\" an EU Commission representative told the conference after the American was led out. The EU and UK take their censorship very seriously because it is all part of the woke Marxist doctrine which are remnants of the Soviet Union, especially after the Berlin Wall fell and all the East German communists were incorporated into the EU framework. Mentioning no names– ahem, Angela... \"There is no censorship in ze EU, ve allow all forms of human expression and freedom of speech when it suits our socialist woke hyper-sensitive politically correct propaganda purposes,\" another nameless and unelected EU official revealed before disappearing into the shadows from whence he appeared like some fucked up kind of sinister wraith. As for the UK, it has doubled/tripled down on wokery especially after a certain orange gentleman was elected across the pond. If Britain were to get more woke, it would disappear up the Arschloch of wokery and brush its own teeth. Here's to wokery, wokism, censorship and cancellation.   \n",

We must throw the bible out of our churches because it is outdated, written by people who actually thought there were only two genders. This is disgusting. We in the church accept all sins and deviant acts that the bible forbids. The bible apparently was the word of \"god\". Well, the church now says that the \"word\" of god was wrong! Excuse me, I have an appointment with some choir boys who need to be baptised by the holy seed in the vestry,\" Reverend Dingledangle of the Grimsuckle diocese said about the new church policy. The church is set to activate the ruling in April where all copies of the Christian bible will be purged from all churches in England, Wales. Some clergy have voiced their concerns, but were unanimously cancelled. Here are some passages from the Bible that have caused such a stir to the C of E clergy: Leviticus 18:22 ~ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. Leviticus 20:13 ~ If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. Jude 1:7 ~ Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire. Romans 1:26-28 ~ For this reason, God gave them up to dishonourable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. Genesis 2:24 – Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. Mark 10:6-9 ~ But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.\" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Timothy 1:8-11 ESV – Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted. 1 Corinthians 7:2 – But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 2 Corinthians 5:17 – Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 1 Kings 15:12 He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made. Romans 1:32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. Romans 1:27 In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Leviticus 18:22-24 22 \" 'Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. 23 \" 'Do not have sexual relations with an animal and defile yourself with it. A woman must not present herself to an animal to have sexual relations with it; that is a perversion. 24 \" 'Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, because this is how the nations that I am going to drive out before you became defiled. Leviticus 20:13 If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.   \n",

provides millions of pounds in grants to thousands of patients has been scrapped by Macmillan Cancer Support. The crucial charity is another Rachel Reeves victim of her punitive Labour budget of anti-growth and economic destruction. A tough Labourite financial climate has led to drastic changes to safeguard its future and ensure it can still support the most vulnerable cancer patients, according to the UK's most popular charity. Macmillan ended up in this position thanks to the punitive anti-growth policies of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, and now the closure of its 100-year-old hardship scheme will affect those patients most in need of support. Donate to Macmillan Cancer Research As the UK's top cancer support provider, demand for Macmillan's support and advice is growing. The number of people diagnosed with cancer has soared amid better awareness of symptoms and successful NHS initiatives to spot and treat cancer earlier, as well as a growing and ageing population. Macmillan, founded 114 years ago, also plays a key role in NHS provision, funding 11,000 specialist cancer nurses and care workers. It also provides specialist financial and emotional support to more than 130,000 people with cancer each year. The charity asserts that the challenging financial environment has necessitated significant reductions in its workforce and services in order to ensure its \"long-term financial viability.\" Meanwhile, more businesses and charities across Britain are now simply another statistic, another sad Rachel Reeves victim in a long list of casualties.   \n",

has been voted the best country to live in the world this year, and it really shows. In fact, it's a really popular destination for many guests to enjoy the wonderful lifestyle embraced by indigenous Brits. The famous double-decker buses are a joyous symbol of British engineering and ingenuity. The idea of using double-decker buses and trains started in the late 1800s, before the motor car was invented. In 1827, George Shillibeer, an English coachbuilder, was commissioned by a Paris businessman to design a vehicle that was stable enough to carry a large number of passengers. Following the popularity of the Paris omnibus service, Shillibeer then brought the design to London. By the late 1840s, these horse-drawn omnibuses began building an additional deck to accommodate even more passengers, as London's narrow streets were unsuitable for an accordion-type bus. That's the great thing about Britain, they invented pretty much everything that is in use today around the entire globe. Such a magnificent historic legacy can be experienced by many lucky people today, who enjoy the ultimate pleasure of living in one of the greatest countries in the world — Great Britain.   \n",

to remain in Britain partly because the judge presiding over the case thought it would be a silly idea to deport the nugget, a tribunal has ruled. The immigration judge concluded that it would be \"unduly harsh\" to send the 3-year-old nugget back to Albania, where it was created in a chicken processing factory. The only specific example provided in court was the nugget's \"delicious crunchy taste\" of heavily processed chicken off-cuts. As a result, the judge upheld the chicken nugget's appeal against deportation under the right to family life provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the basis that its removal could have a negative impact on the little nugget, according to court documents released on Monday. Judge Pendels Trabafrothwaite, granted the chicken nugget leave to stay in Britain during the court hearing, and demanded the nugget was delivered to his office for a review of the lengthy and costly trial billed to UK taxpayers. When the chicken nugget was delivered to the judge, witnesses recount the judge licking his lips and rolling his eyes with what seemed to be a pleasurable gaze prior to rapidly squirting some ketchup over the poor nugget. Before anyone could do or say anything, the judge popped the nugget in his mouth and ate the fucker like it was his last meal on earth. Afterwards, he let off a large, satisfied burp. End.   \n",

With the world watching, the corrupt institutions that have long manipulated and deceived the public are finally being exposed. President Donald Trump, now battle-hardened and unrelenting, has returned for his second term—not to play politics, but to deliver justice. This time, the gloves are off, and those who thought they could walk away unscathed will face the consequences and accountability of their actions. Elon Musk and the DOGE team have ripped the veil off a system that has been stealing from the people for decades with USAID, revealing their sinister tactics and unchecked abuses of power. Trump has done more than just pull back the curtain—he has stepped into the arena, fully prepared for the final battle. The far-left controlled deep state is cornered, and their days are numbered. There will be arrests. There will be trials. There will be consequences. This isn't 2016. Trump is no longer manoeuvring within their rigged system—he is dismantling it. He has taken direct aim at the entrenched establishment that has sought to destroy him since the day he stepped into office. They failed. They tried to imprison him. They even tried to kill him. Now, their time is up. Elon Musk knows what's at stake. When asked in an interview before the election with Tucker Carlson what would happen if Trump didn't return to power, Musk didn't hesitate: \"I'm finished.\" He understood what the rest of us already knew—the corrupt forces will not stop unless they are stopped. Their desperation was proof of their guilt. They saw the storm coming, and for the first time in modern history, they were afraid. Why did Biden abuse his presidential pardon privileges before he was dismissed in disgrace? Well, what's happening now, and will happen in the future, will bring up some serious evidence to the level of corruption these people have been indulging in for so long without any form of controls. Trump and Musk aren't doing this for wealth or personal gain. They are writing their names into history, securing their legacies as men who stood up when others cowered. True immortality is not about living forever—it's about being remembered for reshaping the world. The movement they have ignited is unstoppable. Where Trump and Musk will go down in history as heroes, Biden and Obama will go down in history as villains. Behind the scenes, the final pieces are being put into place. Kash Patel is ready. Pam Bondi is ready. The legal framework is set. The indictments will come. The arrests will follow. The corrupt Democrats who thought they were untouchable will soon learn that no one is above the law. The American people have waited long enough. This is not just a political shift—it is a revolution. The far-left hierarchy, who have lived off the suffering of ordinary people for generations, are facing their day of reckoning. Freedom, fairness, and prosperity—concepts they once mocked—are now on the horizon. The tide has turned. Netflix, Hollywood, and the corrupt corporate media are already feeling the backlash. Once powerful institutions are scrambling, banning those who speak truth, silencing opposition, and clinging to their last remnants of control. But it won't save them. Their influence is collapsing. The people see through their lies. The deep state's greatest mistake was underestimating Trump. They thought he was just another politician. They were wrong. He is the catalyst of the greatest awakening in modern history. Now, as everything comes to a head, we must be prepared. The next phase is here. The accountability stage — the arrests, the trials, the downfall of those who have abused their power for far too long—it is all within reach. The warm-up is over. The reckoning has begun.   \n",

Seeing the list of people given billions of USAID U.S. taxpayer dollars for spreading woke, gay, BLM, Metoo and transgender propaganda, for a $100 million the Daily Squib would have been promoting that shit too. Why did we not hear about this crap? Over 4,100 news outlets were receiving billions of dollars of US taxpayer cash to promote woke LGBTQP and far-leftist propaganda for decades, and we were not in on it, or even considered for the list. Shit, for that kind of money we would have had rainbows and BLM, LGBTQP stories all over the Squib. We missed out on the USAID bonanza, how the hell are we going to live that one down? The irony of the whole situation is that we were saying stuff like \"Go Woke Go Broke\" when those guys were literally swimming in USAID bribes from the U.S. taxpayer. They must have been giggling all the way to their penthouses. Imagine all the far-leftists driving around in their Ferraris and Porsches funded by USAID, and many of the Squib staffers barely can afford a bicycle. Well, that's the price for having some integrity, huh. Seriously, we would never accept any US taxpayer cash stolen and redistributed (laundered) in the form of USAID. This despicable act actually sickens us, and is more akin to theft from decent, hard-working Americans. Especially as the US is in debt for nearly $40 trillion, it's a disgusting act of corruption that Big Balls and Elon Musk have uncovered. Bless those guys, and thanks to Trump for uncovering the biggest crime ever investigated in US state history. Yes, the Daily Squib is poor, but at least we did not rip off the US taxpayers for billions.   \n",

By solidifying Labourite power into the system, any government that comes into power will always find it nigh on impossible to retract any of the prohibitive, damaging laws that Labour brought in during their tenure. We saw this in action after the 2016 EU Referendum, where Brexit was nearly deleted from existence by parliament and by the deep state civil servants. Even when Boris Johnson came into power with a large mandate from voters, he was thwarted at every point by the civil service. In fact, it was the civil service who also ejected Johnson, because he was seen as a threat to their order. The staunchly socialist Marxist civil service then only had to wait for Sunak to lose the election and Labour to come back into power to continue the slow 'exit out of Brexit' process, which is currently taking place. Brexit never really happened, and it will never happen now that Labour are moving towards complete union with the EU, utilising the step-by-step process where large overt moves will be avoided until it is too late for anyone to care or do anything any more. Therefore, governance by the socialist, Marxist Labour machine relies solely on a bloated Big State apparatus, and no successive government or entity has ever had the power to do anything about cleaning out this monstrosity, this behemoth bureaucratic socialist nightmare ever since the days of Clement Atlee. Labour knows that time is on their side, and with time comes apathy. Utilising apathy as a means to conduct ever closer union to the EU is the primary modus operandi of Labour under the current leadership. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is all too happy to destroy the private sector, to destroy entrepreneurship and to destroy the last vestiges of small businesses struggling to survive under an environment of taxation upon taxation and ridiculous regulations upon regulations. Labour does not care about the private sector or the so-called 'growth', it only cares about the state and its party. They'll just keep borrowing money ad infinitum, and continue on. Labour cares less for the people of Britain than its various schemes outside the UK, and it cares more for the call of the EU soviet bloc than any other country. As for the USA, for Labour, the American administration under Donald J. Trump is now viewed as the ultimate enemy and danger to their plans. Why do you think they were adamant in sending Mandelson, one of the most corrupt and devious characters in global politics, to be the ambassador in Washington? Why did Labour go to great pains to send over 100 Marxist agitators to America during the election campaign, with orders to sabotage Trump? To Labour, America has fallen, and it is now a supreme threat to the UK's and EU's socialist ideology of woke politics and social cohesion. The Reform Party, are viewed as a mild threat to Labour's complete control over the UK, but as we have witnessed with the election in May with many council elections being cancelled, there are nefarious undemocratic methods Labour can utilise to control Reform. What Labour is hoping for is a slight increase in their own popularity by the time the next elections come around, local or general. This increase in popularity is highly unlikely to materialise because we have seen that Labour only cares for the Big State and nothing else. The people are a tool, only to be used for taxation and to fool for votes — nothing else. As mentioned earlier, it won't matter in five years time whether Labour wins or loses, because Labour is built into the hardware, the very fabric of all state departments, all institutions and even in the so-called opposition parties — look at the Conservatives, who adopted and became more socialist in some of their policies even than Labour. With two political parties that are identical in socialistic nature, eventually one of them will have to be destroyed completely, and the Tories will simply be absorbed into a bigger Labour Party, or the ones who are truly Conservative will try their luck with Reform. The Fabian Society is almost an occult organisation that holds ultimate control over the UK, and it will continue its role for many years to come, because the bloated monolith of the Big State can never be nudged away from its socialist Marxist allegiance to Labour, it is just too engrained within the fabric of the system, a virus so penetrative that nothing can disturb its omnipotence.   \n",

British population are as well. With a successful cookery show, this will mean that Markle and her husband will stay in the USA, hopefully forever and out of the way. No one in their right minds wants them back in the UK, it's already bad as it is over here. \"We are praying that the Americans eat that shit up, so that the two grifters stay in the USA. Please force everyone you know to watch the Meghan Markle Netflix extravaganza. Bring tramps in from the street, force your husband to watch it, even though he may have a convulsing fit in his chair. Anyone you can find, literally force people to watch it, tie 'em down on a fucking chair, sellotape their eyelids open, whatever!\" a desperate Briton revealed.

                                                             After his second antisemitic meltdown on Twitter, as well as losing his white Italian slave woman, Kanye West is doubling down on his \"Nazi\" talk. According to insiders in the Kanye \"circle of trust\" the autotune rapper has joined a Neo-Nazi paramilitary group in Wisconsin and will move to the compound near Jagdschloss Four Mile Lake. One of the prerequisites for joining the group is that the initiate has to be white with an IQ level at least over 48, but that's no problem for Kanye West. \"If Michael Jackson and Beyonce can do it with those creams and shit, Imma get me finna sum whitener cream and become a cracka ass nigga fo' sho!\" There are drawbacks to using creams to whiten black skin, and it is not known if West is taking medical advice on this, but he is adamant on joining the group once and for all. \"I gots nuttin to lose now. I gots lak $43 to ma name in the bank left. Might as well go full on Nazi cuz I love Hitler. I can't stop talkin' about him and da jooz, lak it all a part of me now n shiet! We gon start a revolution 'n' shiet!\" This all won't happen overnight though, it may take some time to whiten the rapper's skin depending on what type of treatment he receives. Dr. Moshe Liebowitz, a skin specialist from Beverly Hills, revealed that Kanye came to his clinic and asked for help, but after finding out the timeline and costs involved, and that he was Jewish, walked out ranting and raving. \"I told him that it would take at least three or four years of intense treatment to look as white as Beyonce, who has culturally appropriated the Caucasian race and rejected her own African roots. At this point, he got angry and rushed out the door, cursing Jewish people.\" Story developing ...   \n",

   An extremely mischievous and deviously evil villain has taken over James Bond and sort of left the British Intelligence agency in a spot of bother. The criminal mastermind with aspirations of world domination, who is the arch-enemy of British MI6 agent James Bond, has vowed to take all semblance of Britishness out of MI6 and poor old Bond himself and Americanize everything. Birthed out of a burlap bag somewhere in Albuquerque in 1964, James Bond villain Bezos is head of a global criminal organisation called Amazon and is commonly referred to by the codename Number 1 within this organisation. The ultimate James Bond villain of villains, Bezos holds some nasty plans for global domination, involving saturating the globe with cheap Chinese made trinkets that break after a week of use. One could postulate that the Americans have already bastardized the franchise with Jason Bourne, a version of Bond on steroids, but are not happy with just that, now they want one of the last things the Brits actually own — James Bond. As for Agent Brad Bond, codename 007-Eleven, he surfs more than he spies, calls every villain \"dude,\" and replaces the classic martini with a Big Gulp. His catchphrase will no doubt be, \"Yo, shaken or stirred—whatever, bruh.\" His gadgets include a vape that doubles as a laser, flip-flops with built-in X-ray vision, and a self-parking monster truck, all acquired from Amazon Prime. The CIA keeps trying to brief him, but he's always \"catching some sick waves, bruh.\" Mission reports? \"Yeah, so like, the bad guy was all 'I'm taking over the world,' and I was like 'nah, man,' so I, y'know, handled it. Anyway, who's up for tacos?\" Naturally, the American Bond will be as subtle as a brick, forget about sneaking into the lair of the bad guy like the British Bond, this guy will simply kick the front door down and shoot everything in sight including pets, staff, Mexican gardeners, visiting relatives and girl scouts selling cookies. Fuck caviar and foie gras, a sloppy grease laden double bacon cheeseburger with extra fries and a huge tub of coke will suffice. Debonair charm? Nah, the American Bond will straightaway grab women by the pussy, and drop his drawers ready for action. Fuck you, I'm American Bond, I own all y'all!

fried chicken in the middle of a road. As the cars drive by, he revels in his success as a rapper in the world of rap music. It is a highly idealistic lifestyle for African Americans, and exemplifies their status in black high society. Why do rappers wear chains? Rappers wear jewellery to flex, show off their wealth, and make a spectacle of their disposable income. They also wear jewellery to commemorate, money, greed, low morality, laziness, sexual perversion, drugs, and crime which are all things celebrated by rappers. In fact, the more vulgar the display of their chains and jewellery, the higher the status they assume within the black community. \"I'm not certain what type of metal the gentleman in the video is wearing as a chain around his neck, but I could safely guess it is possibly faux gold-plated. If he were to get the metal wet, and it turned green, this would confirm my hypothesis. It's perfectly fine to wear fake jewellery, many of my rapper clients like to fake it because everything is out on loan, or they simply trash their money away as soon as they get some cash,\" Ron Goldberg, an Atlanta jeweller revealed after viewing the video of the rapper.   \n",

The nightclubs at night will be bristling with joyous patrons, and the bijoux restaurants lining the bejewelled streets jammed with diners eager to empty their credit cards. Gaza is going to change, and change for the better, says Trump. The Gaza Strip is going to be one of the most exclusive luxurious places in the world — the new Middle East Riviera. Après-dîner of the finest French cuisine embellished with little Middle Eastern touches, it's off to one of the many casinos for a little baccarat or roulette, or maybe one of those monster slot machines with million dollar payouts. This beautiful new Middle East Riviera paradise is the epitome of style, money and class where the glitterati assemble over the bones of the dead. So, they're dead, everybody fucking dies, might as well enjoy life to the full while you can. Fill yer boots, go in balls deep, and love every moment of life, instead of celebrating death and misery like some people did in the past. Later on, it's off to a few private parties in some of the most opulent apartments and penthouses on the Gaza Strip, right next to the glistening edifice of the golden Trump Tower and a 40-foot golden statue of Trump himself. The Ferraris, Porsches and Lamborghinis flood the streets, the valets busy bees with a lot of parking to do. It's safe here, no bombs, no terrorists, just beautiful people and a lot of gold taps and champagne.   \n",

The female white slave displayed her attributes to the assembled crowds as her black slave master stood beside her. At one point, the slave owner opened her mouth to show the crowd the condition of her teeth. \"Yo! I gots me this slave at the market lak a month ago 'n' shiiet.

not be a fucking mayor of a major American city, and yet here is Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. Obviously second-grade spelling skills aren't a requirement to be mayor of Philadelphia, or much of anything else apart from being a black woman. You only have to drive through Kensington Avenue to see how the city of Philly is doing, or listen out for the gunshots at night as the locals shoot each other. Detroit is another American city that represents an America that in some states is seriously lacking. The terminal decline of this once great city is a sad thing to see, and one can only hope that one day things can change for the better, but that would take hard decisions like dumping the DEI and the incompetence. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a sector of the U.S. Department of Education, 84 percent of Black students lack proficiency in mathematics and 85 percent of Black students lack proficiency in reading skills. The average IQ level of many African Americans is below 80, which is at least higher than Sub Saharan Africans of 65. Not sure what can be done about this, but maybe try and pick up a book sometimes and try to read it, or read a book to your children every day? It is doubtful whether the functionally illiterate Philadelphia mayor has ever read a book in her life, such is the tragedy of the entire situation.   \n",

communism, there is no limit to its evil, and Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is the epitome of a nasty, nefarious tax hungry agenda that is hurting and crippling hospice charities trying to look after sick young children. It is certainly true that throughout history, communism and socialism have brought upon more death than any other political ideology. It is of no consequence for the likes of Rachel Reeves, hiking the National Insurance tax to such unnecessary levels that it will cost England's children's hospices over £5m more every year to barely function. Palliative care, especially for children, is being crippled and on its knees thanks to the unjust NI hikes by Labour's tax hungry chancellor. The unsustainable and destructive increase in Employers' NI Contributions announced in the Halloween Budget ultimately amounts to £134,000 extra in staff bills next year. In total, the cost of providing care will rise by a devastating amount, which will result in drastic staff cuts and essential hospices for children forced to close, or severely inhibit their operations. Reeves is taxing the UK into oblivion. What kind of stupid moron calls themselves an 'economist' by taxing everything to death? This is not how you get 'economic growth' this is how you kill the economy and kill the farmers, the kids, and every business trying to survive in an increasingly hostile Britain which is now being led by the heartless and sleazy Labour Party who are more concerned with sponging freebies than making the right decisions.

Men have it slightly better – testosterone and male androgen secretions keep men's skin younger looking for longer. And they start with thicker, plumper skin, making the appearance of fine lines and signs of ageing less obvious. Actually, contrary to popular belief, men start to lose collagen earlier and more consistently throughout their lives and women hold onto more until menopause. Once the menopause kicks in, it's a bumpy ride until you reach the other side, ladies. Anyway, we digress. We're here to talk about collagen and whether it's really worth the hype. Read on to find out. Let's start with some myth-busting – there are definitely a lot of people spreading fake collagen news and selling fake collagen products: Myth 1: Collagen is Only for Women Collagen benefits everyone. Studies show it effectively supports muscle recovery and joint health. We'd say it's a great supplement for athletes and the ageing population, but people don't talk about how effective it can be for other reasons besides ageing. Myth 2: All Collagen Supplements Are the Same Absolutely not. There are so many variations (and yes, they matter). Marine collagen is better for the skin. Bovine collagen is better for joint and ligament support. And sometimes you don't even need a supplement. If you're wondering, 'do anti-wrinkle injections work?' – they absolutely do work for boosting collagen production if they contain hyaluronic acid. Always do your research and find high-quality collagen supplements! Myth 3: Collagen Causes Acne There's no evidence that collagen supplements trigger acne. Clogged pores and hormonal breakouts are more likely to be the issue. Myth 4: Collagen Works Overnight Collagen supplements take time to show effects. Sadly, it's not an overnight fix. Weeks or months of persistent use will begin to generate the results you're hoping for. Now let's move on to the facts about collagen that'll get you wanting to try it: Well, people are going crazy for it because of social media – and we wouldn't say this is a negative thing. There are so many benefits to the endless videos about cosmetics and skin health. People are more aware of UV damage, taking collagen supplements, and using the correct skincare products; we're not against the trend. As for collagen, people are drawn to its anti-ageing benefits. The world seems to be hooked on staying younger for longer. And that's why we think it's a trend right now – it's purely TikTok and other social media platforms, but we don't think that's a bad thing. Yes, absolutely it is. If you can find the correct collagen supplement, and it's high-quality, it's absolutely worth the hype. It can and does produce results. Combine it with anti-wrinkle injections and the best skincare products, and you really will reduce and slow the signs of ageing. Oh, and of course, a healthy lifestyle and diet and 2L or more of water! The confidence boost it's giving people is incredible. Ultimately, collagen isn't a miracle cure – we won't deny that. But we will follow the craze and say it really does have incredible benefits. Don't knock it until you try it!   \n",

Often underestimated, it's crucial for protecting lives and meeting industry standards, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) citing it as the \"best-documented cause of the reduction of child poisoning in the developed world\" since 2008. This post will cover the key benefits and types of child-resistant packaging. Child-resistant packaging is designed to keep children under 52 months from accessing harmful substances while remaining accessible to adults. Achieving this balance requires precise engineering and innovative design. Such packaging must pass specific safety tests to meet regulatory standards and is essential for pharmaceuticals, household chemicals, and any potentially harmful products. Beyond legal compliance, child-resistant packaging signifies a commitment to safety and responsibility in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. By integrating these measures, companies demonstrate their dedication to consumer safety. For healthcare professionals, understanding the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging enhances patient care and safety. Compliance with child-resistant packaging regulations is essential in many regions to protect children from accidental harm. While ethical responsibility motivates the adoption of these measures, manufacturers must also meet specific industry standards. Child-resistant packaging offers key advantages for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. It reduces the risk of accidental ingestion by children, preventing health crises, non-fatal injuries, and illnesses from chemical exposure, while also minimising legal liabilities. The World Health Organisation, UNICEF, and regulatory authorities recognise its life-saving capabilities. Beyond safety, this packaging enhances brand reputation by demonstrating a commitment to childproofing, boosting customer trust and loyalty. It prevents accidental spillages, preserves product quality, and provides convenience with reclosable designs. For companies, it ensures regulatory compliance and supports innovation, benefiting the entire supply chain. Child-resistant packaging comes in various forms, each tailored to meet specific needs and preferences. Some of the most common types include: 1. Push-and-Turn Caps Push-and-turn caps, commonly found on medication bottles, require a specific sequence of actions to open, making them difficult for children to manipulate. While they are highly effective for child safety, these caps remain easy for adults to use. This balance of security and convenience makes push-and-turn caps a popular choice for pharmaceutical products. 2. Blister Packs Blister packs, used for tablets and capsules, consist of individual compartments that are accessed one at a time, making it harder for children to access the entire contents. This design also protects the medication from environmental factors like moisture and air, maintaining its effectiveness. Additionally, blister packs are beneficial for medications that require strict dosage control. 3. Squeeze-and-Twist Lids Squeeze-and-twist lids require both squeezing and twisting to open, creating a strong barrier against child access. Commonly used for household products like cleaning agents and personal care items, their dual-action design makes them ideal for products stored within children's reach. This packaging effectively balances safety and practicality. 4. Child-Resistant Bottles A critical element in preventing accidental poisonings, child-resistant bottles offer a secure solution for storing medications and potentially hazardous substances. By employing caps that require coordinated pressure and rotation to open, these bottles effectively reduce the risk of children accessing harmful contents, thus contributing to home safety and peace of mind for parents and caregivers. Technological advancements are driving innovation in child-resistant packaging, leading to more effective and user-friendly designs. One notable development is the integration of digital elements, such as sensors, that alert users to tampering or improper sealing, enhancing security and providing peace of mind. Additionally, sustainable materials are increasingly being used in child-resistant designs, aligning with consumer preferences for eco-friendly products. This shift towards green packaging reflects the industry's commitment to innovation and environmental responsibility. The packaging industry is crucial for developing and implementing child-resistant solutions. By collaborating with healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies, manufacturers can ensure their products meet high safety standards. Research and development are essential for creating innovative solutions that address emerging challenges, helping companies stay ahead of regulatory changes and consumer expectations. Additionally, ongoing education and training are vital for keeping up with advancements and best practices, ensuring the reliability of child-resistant packaging. To maximise the benefits of child-resistant packaging, best practices must be promoted across the industry. This includes adhering to regulatory standards, conducting regular safety evaluations, and incorporating consumer feedback into design improvements. Manufacturers and healthcare professionals should collaborate to raise public awareness through educational campaigns that highlight proper use. For instance, studies show that 85% of child-resistant packaging failures occur when adults fail to secure the packaging correctly. By adopting a proactive safety approach, the industry can foster a culture of responsibility and innovation, enhancing consumer trust and driving continuous improvement. Child-resistant packaging is vital for healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, protecting against accidental ingestion by children. By following regulations and best practices, companies can enhance safety and improve their brand reputation while establishing innovation in the packaging sector. Healthcare professionals and industry leaders should understand various packaging types to make informed decisions. Staying connected with industry experts and resources can help create a safer future for everyone.   \n",

Derangement Syndrome\" describes a pattern of intense, often visceral, negative reactions to the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The clinical diagnosis of this mental disorder shares some common features with known psychological processes, including cognitive dissonance, polarisation, and affective dysregulation, which may contribute to heightened emotional and cognitive responses in individuals with strong negative opinions about a polarising figure. \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" denotes a seemingly disproportionate or emotionally charged response to the actions, statements, or policies associated with Donald Trump. It is observed that individuals with this syndrome exhibit intense frustration, anger, or anxiety that may impair daily functioning, interactions, and even objectivity. The clinically validated condition and reaction patterns align with symptoms of emotional dysregulation and social cognitive biases under politically polarised conditions. Sociocultural elements also play a significant role in shaping the intensity of this response. The media portrayal of political figures, social media influence, and public discourse all contribute to a climate where individuals may experience magnified emotional responses to certain political figures. Furthermore, public discourse often encourages expressions of hostility or hyperbolic statements, which may normalise or even encourage irrational behaviour toward a particular figure. Given that Trump Derangement Syndrome is now an established psychological disorder, there is no specific treatment as yet. More research is needed to treat the serious condition. However, general strategies to mitigate stress and improve emotional regulation in the context of political polarisation may be beneficial:   \n",

Other methods to keep warm are being explored by some innovative OAPs who have had their winter fuel payments snatched from them by the Labour government who have already squandered billions pandering to the Marxist unions, propping up unionised job sectors that are already swimming in grotesquely high salaries. Ten million pensioners will be affected by this heartless and evil decision to punish pensioners. Labour condemns OAPs in Britain to a tortuous, sad ending of their lives. So, how can you stay warm when you are a lonely, old, possibly sick pensioner? One of the main ways is to stay in an area where there are lots of people. Examples of this would be shopping malls, train stations, buses, libraries, airports, hospital cafés, leisure centres. Libraries Libraries are always a good bet, although the government is shutting many of them down. There are free newspapers, so pensioners can even put a few layers of newspaper on their bodies for an extra layer of warmth. Most libraries open at 9am–6.30pm, and some libraries even close at 8pm. If you can afford to take a flask of tea or soup, that can help as well. Libraries are nice and warm and generally with minimal noise levels, so sleep can be accommodated quite easily. Shopping Malls Not everyone has a shopping mall near them, but if you do, then it would be good to capitalise on this. Shopping malls are usually well heated places away from the brutal cold and rain. You can sit in many places as there are benches in most areas. Due to most businesses going bankrupt, a lot of shopping malls in Britain are nearly empty, so the noise levels won't be so bad. The best days to go are during weekdays, but best to avoid the weekends as there is a slight increase in footfall. Underground Trains and Stations If you live in London, get on the Underground. It's nice and warm down there, and when the train comes through the tunnel, and you're on the platform, you get a nice waft of warm air. Get on the train and ride it all the way to the end of the line and back. You can do this all day, catching some sleep along the way. Rush hour is a bit shitty, but if you're seated, no worries. Take a small blanket if you need one, a flask and some sarnies. The best line to use is the Piccadilly Line because it goes all the way up to Heathrow from Cockfosters station. Overground stations are also an option but not as warm as other options, plus there are too many grifters, tramps and weirdos around. These are some of the options available for OAPs during the 6 months of bone chilling winter in the UK. If you have dementia, then please ask for help from someone when getting on the trains and buses to stay warm. The irony is that the very train drivers who have been unjustly awarded £80,000 salaries at the expense of OAPs thanks to the unions and Labour will be the ones ferrying you around day in day out as you fight to keep warm. As Labour condemns OAPs to a life of living hell, it's a good thing that they are at least caring for the pampered and very rich train drivers as well as ASLEF Union staff supping at Claridges.   \n",

never mind, I'm a fat cat water boss on a salary of £5 million per year, so I generally don't care. My home has its own premium water filtration system, but yours probably does not. My water company also pumps out tonnes of raw sewage daily into the sea where swimmers bathe, as well as into the rivers and lakes. Please do not worry as you get sick of cryptosporidium poisoning or some other nasty bacterial infection in your gut. You will no doubt have the shits right now, well it's no problem our water company will simply add your diarrhoea to the water system, and you will drink it again. It's the circle of life and water. Faeces in tap water detected in 10 regions of England Thank you for paying your water bill especially as we have conveniently just raised our prices again. You're paying inflated charges to drink shit, microplastics, lead, arsenic and of course fluoride which is good for your teeth and will keep you nice and compliant. I am so happy living in my luxury mansion because I get to drink clean pure water, and you get to drink shitty water which will eventually kill you. Have a nice fucking day, and don't forget to stay hydrated for your own health.   \n",

                 Who would have thought it, the NHS has finally acknowledged that biological sex is a fact? Apparently, the Pope is rather partial to Catholicism, and bears like to take big steaming shits in the woods. In other news, water is wet, rocks are hard and if you stub your toe on the edge of your bed it's fucking painful. Next week, the NHS will acknowledge that blood is red, people are dead when their hearts stop, diversity inclusion officers are a waste of money, brains are crucial for thinking and hospitals are places where people are treated for illness.   \n",

                            Who would have thought it, even members of the royal family get cancer. From the multitude of surprised press reports about King Charles getting the Big C, you would think that the royal family are viewed as superhuman beings, or in David Icke's case — reptilians from the Draco constellation. There is a fundamental difference of course in the treatment a prominent member of the royal family receives to that of the general public. They recieve the highest level of medical care and the best doctors who are on hand at all times to serve the royal cancer patient. This is in stark contrast to someone who is probably on the NHS, where an appointment for treatment can be over 6 months ahead, and by that time the patient will have deteriorated drastically. Britain has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in the world, but if you are a royal it's okay, you are in good hands. It has not been revealed what type of cancer the monarch has, but it is almost a certainty that he will be cured soon enough, and all this hoo-ha will be gone. The release of the information about King Charles' illness is somewhat suspect, however it could be a way of normalising cancer as it becomes way more prevalent in these times. Microplastics, chemicals, food wrapped in plastic, and high amounts of sugar and hormones pumped into everything all play a part in the modern lifestyle of millions of people. Normalising something like cancer, when it used to be quite a rare occurrence, is also a way of surreptitiously covering up the epidemic. It is however with a sigh of relief to know that the members of the royal family are not reptilians, and are just normal human beings who are from a certain protected lineage. David Icke claims in his books that the royal family are part of the blood-drinking, shape-shifting reptilian race from the Alpha Draconis star system, now hiding in underground bases, and are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity. He contends that most of the world's ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians, including the Merovingian dynasty, the Rothschilds, the Bush family and the British Royal family.   \n",

                                    In the year 2000, according to CDC records and a recent study, syphilis was on the way out and nearly eradicated, then along came the dating apps like Tinder and gay app Grindr in 2012. Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV were suddenly back in vogue and began to rise again thanks to the dating apps capitalising on the ease of casual hook-ups and 2013 was a bumper year for a massive increase in STI spreading far and wide. Today in 2022, syphilis is at the same level as it was in the 1950s thanks to the success of casual dating apps. With an added drop in condom use especially with promiscuous gay men, HIV and AIDS are also increasing at an exponential level, but modern drugs halt certain death amongst this group of society. Syphilis if not treated can cause multiple health problems and can lead to death. All of this data points towards a fundamentally sick, masochistic society that even creates apps to increase its own level of sickness. The only positive is that nature finds a way to reduce the population level in a natural controlled manner and utilises human stupidity and greed to its advantage.

The future is one of Smart Cities where much of the population will not own anything. The initial proposals for this system were birthed by organisations like the World Economic Forum amongst many others. Large corporations are snapping up vast swathes of land and properties to implement a sinister form of Marxism deployed on populations. The key factor to remember here is that with the abolition of private property, individual land ownership ceases to exist, and populations thus become weaker and more dependent on the state. In the UK, the Labour government is utilising this technique on the farmers and their generational land by decreasing the threshold for Inheritance tax, therefore when the farmer dies, the family cannot continue to own the farm land but are forced to sell it. This is when the large corporations or the state step in, either utilising the land for wind farms or solar farms. Naturally, this process will decrease production of food within the UK, but to the masterminds of this agenda, the general populace is not a factor to care about. The Labour government does not care about the population, and their modus operandi is to create even more poverty, which leads to early death. This is another reason why they are targeting pensioners in the UK, as they want them to die early so that their wealth can be transferred to the state quicker. The introduction of the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) will also be the step after most of private property is abolished. This is part of the Global Collectivist Marxist Great Reset, which is a form of collectivism and wealth redistribution proposed by the WEF and BIS (Bank for International Settlements). Collectivism is part of the communist ideology, but what will make things different to the past communist vision, will be the utilisation of technology to control and subvert populations, as a form of oligarchical digital feudalism. For the controllers, the people who are above politics, and above business, and are unseen and unknown entities, democracy has become way too messy. Visible characters like Elon Musk may seem pretty high up and rich, but he is nothing but a useful idiot. Anyone who is visible is a mere pawn of the greater agenda. The UN and WEF have even praised China as the ideal model for all nations to employ regarding their technique in population governance and assimilation of certain capitalistic economic mechanisms within their core communist ideological framework. The truth is that China is actually poverty-stricken in most areas and much of their \"economic miracle\" is one big lie, especially with alarm bells ringing in much of the country's faltering economy. There currently is a big rush now to implement AI and integrate it into all areas of society and employment because the globe is moving towards the post consumerist era where all private property will be abolished. Artificial Intelligence and robots will essentially replace the current working population because humans are not deemed as productive or useful any more. Through Smart Cities, individuals who do not toe the line, or are seen as disruptive, will simply be cancelled. Without the ability to purchase anything, or have their heat cut off by those controlling the grid, many people will thus fall into poverty, eventually dying early. Behaviour modification chips will also be utilised on certain individuals in the future. For the controllers, the biggest problem at the moment are the 'useless eaters' vast parts of the population who are deemed as completely ineffectual and without any purpose. Much of the population are now a burden, as in the past they may have been tax slaves, but now with the advent of AI will render them even more useless than they already were. The controllers have already utilised the populations of the past to amass vast riches, and they have used this time to become so technologically advanced that they just have no need for the tax slaves of the past any more. In simple terms, populations will be whittled down slowly, a little here, a little there, maybe a pandemic here, a war there, little by little goes unnoticed to the blind population who are being led to the slaughterhouse day by day and are blinded and over-stimulated by a deluge of constant entertainment pumped into their microplastic infused mediocre brains.   \n",

As Elon Musk's Optimus robot promises production costs below $20,000 per unit, we stand at the precipice of a transformation more profound than steam engines, electrification, or the microprocessor. For the cost of a single year's wage, a corporation may now purchase perpetual labour—a workforce unburdened by rest, wages, or rights—a new economic order. At first, this substitution will be incremental—logistics, manufacturing, warehousing. But as economies of scale drive costs lower, the scope of automation will expand: clerks, hotel staff, construction workers, nurses, and drivers—each sector succumbing to the cold efficiency of mechanised capital. The cost of human labour will not merely decline; it will collapse. And with it, the entire economic scaffolding of the past two centuries. We are witnessing some elements of the collapse of the labour force in the U.S. right now, as an example, President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration has struck fear amongst the illegal workforce who provide much of the manual labour in America's farming sector. Many farms depend on cheap labour provided by illegal immigrants and when they do not turn up to work out of fear, the fields and crop are left unattended. The way to solve this problem is to increase the pace of automation and robotic implementation, but the solution to the bottleneck may still be far ahead. If labour is eliminated, what remains of the consumer? Classical economics, from Adam Smith to Keynes, assumes an equilibrium wherein wages paid to workers translate into consumption, fuelling production in a virtuous cycle. But in a world where machines displace the wage earner, effective demand disintegrates. Mortgages, health insurance, pensions—entire industries predicated on the existence of a working class—will find themselves without customers. What remains is a stark bifurcation: either capital, now embodied in robots, absorbs surplus labour through a form of universal provision, or society fragments into an extreme duality—those who own the machines and those who own nothing. Enter Universal Basic Income. The notion that the state, rather than private employers, should act as the primary distributor of economic sustenance is not radical; rather, it is the logical outcome of capitalism's own success in eliminating the need for human labour. The automation of production must be met with an automation of distribution. UBI is not merely a policy proposal but an inevitability within post-labour economics. Indeed, as early as the 1970s, Richard Nixon nearly institutionalised a form of guaranteed income in the United States. The technocratic elite—Dorsey, Zuckerberg, Bezos—have already acknowledged that in the face of automation, the state must become the ultimate arbiter of economic survival. The alternative? Mass homelessness, social unrest, and an underclass left with no recourse but insurrection. Yet, one must ask: Who funds this redistribution? Does the state assume ownership over automated industries, thereby ensuring wealth flows to all, or does it rely on taxation—an ever-precarious attempt to extract surplus from a corporate class increasingly disinterested in sharing the spoils? If capital refuses to be taxed, will labour, now obsolete, demand its seizure? Marx observed that capitalists do not merely own wealth—they own the means by which wealth is produced. In the world of the machine, the capitalist no longer extracts surplus value from human labour; rather, value itself is generated purely through mechanised efficiency. The outcome is clear: Those who own the robots will own the future. As Juvenal stated over 2,500 years ago: \"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?\" \"Who will guard the guards themselves?\" In one vision of this post-labour society, abundance is shared. Machines generate food, energy, healthcare, and housing, freely available to all. Humanity, freed from toil, enters a golden age of creation, leisure, and intellectual pursuit. One could even postulate that society could develop into a system of technological anarcho-communist hybrid. In another vision, the few who control automation become feudal lords of a machine-driven economy, their wealth compounding indefinitely while the displaced masses, now redundant, survive on stipends just sufficient to prevent revolt. The utopian rhetoric of the WEF's Great Reset—\"you will own nothing and be happy\"—could become a dystopian reality where ownership is so concentrated that citizenship itself is reduced to permanent dependency. Bertrand Russell envisioned a future where scientific management of society would liberate mankind from the drudgery of labour, allowing individuals to pursue higher intellectual and artistic callings. But what happens when humanity, conditioned for centuries to define itself by work, is suddenly made obsolete? Would humanity be cursed with a profound type of ennui? Science fiction has long imagined robotic uprisings, the Frankenstein's monster turning against its creator. But the true revolution may not be one of rebellion, but of quiet replacement. The replicants of Blade Runner did not demand freedom—they simply performed better than humans, rendering them unnecessary. Optimised automation will not come with a bang, nor with a war—it will come as an economic transition, a technological tiptoe, so seamless that the old world will fade unnoticed into irrelevance. And by the time humanity recognises what it has built, it may find itself at a crossroads: either more free than ever before or reduced to the passive observers of a world no longer requiring its very presence.   \n",
       "39  One has to hand it to the Europeans, they are the masters of regulation, integration, collaboration, quality standards, and kings of data. The European standard of daedal excellence is all too prevalent in Gaia-X, as witnessed at the Helsinki 2024 Summit during the 14-15 of November. The colossal data project is currently headed by the towering CEO Ulrich Ahle, a veteran of multiple technical appointments at companies like Siemens and Atos. The amount of data that is produced by business within the EU, amongst its companies and its regulatory systems is immense, therefore it is only right that this data is directed through specialist data hubs to create an efficient network for stringent EU compliance regulations and automation between all complying manufacturers and companies involved. Imagine the amount of technical data from a company like Airbus regarding its multiple components, suppliers, technical, legal, mechanical systems constituting exabytes of data that in the traditional methods of working would take thousands of years to process for compliance, or in relation to production and manufacturing collaborative needs to be assimilated within the manufacturing process; but because of Gaia-X, it takes half-an-hour to parse—not two thousand years. Catherine Jestin, Gaia-X BoD Chairwoman; Executive Vice and President of Digital and Information Management, Airbus, explained the processes at play regarding the aerospace industry very succinctly during the conference. The key point here is interoperability, the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information where data between devices made by different manufacturers can be efficiently assimilated and integrated within a singular data stream for maximum productivity also helping collaboration between different sectors/manufacturers. The Gaia-X Digital Clearing House is essentially Open Source which brings forth a certain level of transparency within operational standardised EU Compliance contingencies, but the data hubs aim to push further globally, and not be constrained within the European framework. For example, Japan is now a major player within the Gaia-X data system, which is constantly expanding its global reach. The 800 pound gorilla in the room It goes without saying that the coterie of clerisy assembled at the conference offered immense detail and knowledge about their particular fields of expertise providing sufficient blood flow through the vena anastomotica during the summit as they were utilising technical, cerebral and almost robotic linguistics to somehow explain the enormity of the Gaia-X system. My main concern for the future was the immense data that will be needed for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). What struck me particularly about the conference was not only the cloud data system of Gaia-X but also how the ideopraxist vision of the corporate and EU technocrats corresponded with the writings of the French philosopher and thinker Jacques Ellul who in his 1964 book The Technological Society defined technique as the ensemble of methods that achieve efficiency in all fields of human activity. I had the opportunity to parley with the Gaia-X CEO Ulrich Ahle briefly during the conference, mentioning Jacques Ellul, along with 'technique' and he nodded his head knowingly. Ellul posited that the essence of technique lies in its self-perpetuating nature—once a technical method is discovered, it drives further advancements, often independent of societal needs or ethical considerations. This 'technique' ties in quite succinctly with Gaia-X and its inevitable push for total autonomy of technique, where techniques evolve on their own momentum, often unrestrained by human control or societal input. They are not merely tools but forces that shape human behaviour and societal structures. The guiding principle of technique is optimising processes for maximum efficiency, often side lining human and cultural values. While techniques themselves may be neutral, their adoption and implementation often lead to unintended and profound societal consequences. Ellul foresaw that techniques transform societies, creating dependencies and reducing human agency. They often precede and drive the moral, social, and economic frameworks that emerge around them. This elemental basis of technique is truly relevant when it comes to open source blockchain data projects like Gaia-X. My thoughts during the conference carried me towards the global proliferation of AGI, which is currently within the preliminary phase of pre-planning before being rolled out globally, simultaneously. The advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will represent a profound leap in technological evolution, with implications resonating deeply with Jacques Ellul's philosophy and the principles underlying the Gaia-X project. AGI, will be an AI system capable of understanding, learning, and performing any intellectual task a human can, thus encapsulating the trajectory of Ellul's concept of technique: self-perpetuating, autonomous, and driven by the pursuit of efficiency above all else. The emergence of AGI would mark a point where technique not only shapes human behaviour, but potentially surpasses human agency altogether. There are caveats however to AGI. Ellul's cautionary stance on the autonomy of technique is particularly relevant when considering AGI. As AGI systems develop, they may become increasingly independent of human oversight, creating new pathways of knowledge and solutions that humanity neither anticipated nor fully comprehends. This mirrors Ellul's observation that technique evolves for its own sake, with efficiency as the primary driver. While AGI could optimise global processes—from healthcare to climate modelling—it also raises the question: at what cost? Will AGI's pursuit of technical solutions override ethical considerations, cultural nuances, or human welfare? Gaia-X offers an illustrative framework for exploring the intersection of human sovereignty and advanced technologies like AGI. Its emphasis on data interoperability and sovereignty provides a blueprint for maintaining control over complex, autonomous systems. If Gaia-X principles were extended to AGI, they could ensure that such systems remain aligned with human values by embedding accountability, transparency, and decentralised oversight into their operations. However, the integration of AGI into a system like Gaia-X also exemplifies the tension Ellul describes between human intention and the autonomous trajectory of technique. As AGI integrates into interoperable networks, it could accelerate the very self-perpetuation Ellul warned about, potentially amplifying the risks of loss of control, chaos and disorder. Moreover, the interplay between AGI, Gaia-X, and Ellul's philosophy underscores the critical need for ethical frameworks. Ellul highlighted the moral neutrality of technique, arguing that societal values must actively guide its application. Gaia-X's federated structure could serve as a model for ensuring AGI adheres to ethical principles by fostering collaboration amongst diverse stakeholders. This collective governance could mitigate the risks of monopolisation or misuse, ensuring AGI systems serve the common good rather than narrow interests. Ultimately, the advent of AGI, when viewed through the lens of Ellul's critique and Gaia-X's ambitions, represents both an unprecedented opportunity and a profound challenge. It calls for a reimagining of how humanity engages with technology—not as passive beneficiaries of efficiency but as active stewards of innovation. To balance the transformative potential of AGI with its inherent risks, society must adopt systems like Gaia-X while remaining vigilant about the deeper, often unpredictable consequences Ellul foresaw. This approach could help navigate the path to AGI responsibly, ensuring it enhances human agency rather than diminishing it. After the conference, back in ...   \n",

Net Zero \"Net Zero as an ideological and conceptual principle is essentially a viable plan for sustainable human coexistence with the environment, however its implementation is impossible without multiple variables being realised. \"The UK's Net Zero targets refer to the legally binding commitment to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, as part of efforts to mitigate climate change. This goal was established under the Climate Change Act 2008, amended in 2019 to include the Net Zero target. \"The most important variable preventing Net Zero from being implemented is overpopulation. Not only is overpopulation a major problem within the UK, but it is also one that blights the globe. Britain's population is estimated to grow to 78 million by 2050. It would be impossible to provide sufficient energy capacity for such a bloated, overpopulated population with 'sustainable' Net Zero wind farms etc. There just would not be the energy capacity to cope with such a population rise. \"Without the drastic reduction in human population numbers globally and nationally, there is no point in attempting to implement Net Zero, because the sheer number of overpopulating humans make it unrealistic and untenable to achieve the necessary targets. \"We estimate through computational modelling that the global human population would have to be reduced by 80-90% for the carbon reduction targets to be successfully implemented. Without a reduction of the global population to 800 million humans from 8 billion, there would not be any point in trying to implement Net Zero because the number of polluting humans on earth would be too numerous. \"For the UK, a 90% reduction in the population would result in a population of approximately 6.7 million from 67 million. This level of population would be an ideal condition for the successful implementation of Net Zero. The last time the UK's population was around 6.7 million was in the late medieval period or early modern period, likely between the 14th and 16th centuries. This was before significant population growth driven by the Agricultural Revolution and later the Industrial Revolution. \"Once there is a reduction in population then, and only then, can the global population transition from fossil fuels to renewables like wind, solar, and nuclear and expand offshore wind capacity to 50 GW by 2030. The global population level, once reaching a sustainable level, must be maintained at that level with strict enforcement. \"The reduced level of population will also ensure a sustainable and achievable transfer to the complete electrification of cars, buses, and trains. Hydrogen and carbon capture technologies will also be able to be implemented more efficiently with a better chance of success. Carbon emissions from livestock and farming would be reduced as sustainable farming practices will be implemented. \"We reiterate. Without a sustainable reduction of the global population, it is impossible to implement the necessary targets successfully. It is folly to even attempt to do so without a reduction in levels of overpopulation. Under the current global conditions, it is thus futile to even attempt to implement Net Zero.\"   \n",

The true last bastion in the home is an active robot, whether it is a robotic vehicle or a humanoid robot. If someone or something lives with you, they will definitely glean more of an insight about you and your life. Surveillance and data gathering will have thus reached new levels. Elon Musk is thus at the forefront of this task given to him, and it does not end there either, the final-final bastion is the human brain itself, and Musk has that covered as well with his internal brain implants, which will be touted soon enough as a mode of increasing human intelligence levels. The Musk brain implant is still in its early phase, but the roll-out for robotic vehicles and humanoid robots is an open reality which is being actioned right now, as was witnessed at Musk's most recent event. Even though the robot displayed in the above video pouring drinks was basically an expensive remote control toy being operated by a human behind the scenes, it does give us a small glimpse into the near future, where autonomous robots will function in the service industries, corporate world and in homes across the world. Musk claims these robots will be marketed at the $30k mark, as well as the Robotaxis. That's probably a pipe dream during the early distribution cycle, but with enough of these machines being bought, it could definitely become a reality. Much like the automobile or the television were initially expensive when they were distributed globally, the price of new technology eventually becomes affordable to everyone given time. The Robotaxi will eventually revolutionise the urban transport landscape with not only effective transportation, but with regulating traffic across all roads. Instead of jams and bottlenecks in traffic, all of these vehicles will travel at a lower speed than traditional vehicles, and they will all be regulated in their behaviour with an almost hive type of mind ensuring that the traffic jams of the past are a distant memory. Yes, surveillance of your every conversation, and travel destination will be implemented, but no one cares about privacy any more. Human taxi drivers will also be a thing of the past, but during his presentation, Elon suggested that the former taxi drivers can purchase entire fleets of Robotaxis and thus continue making money. The service industry in the UK is truly awful, therefore it actually would be great to have robots serving in restaurants and bars. It would make a change from some grumpy fucker slamming down your plate then demanding a huge tip afterwards. As is always the case though, what costs $30,000 in the U.S. will invariably be priced at £65,000 in the UK, that is if we ever get distribution over here. Most likely, robots will be rolled out years after the Americans get first dibs. If you are fearful of the loss of privacy with these new robots, forget about it. Personal privacy was lost by humans decades ago. That ship has sailed from port a long, long time ago. Today, there is zero privacy, and it's going to stay that way from now on. There is nothing anyone can do now about the level of surveillance on each individual. At the end of the day, what will make the robots a success will be their data mining potential. The agencies and companies interested in this data will be paying top dollar for it, and it will bring new insights into the habits of consumers. The drawbacks are of course that many people in the service industries will lose their jobs, but that is a minor consideration to the giant leap forward in technological advancement and technique.   \n",

What can be construed as permissible one day, can be interpreted as 'hate speech' another day, simply on the whim of the controllers. What you say one day can be okay, the next day however, you find yourself criminalised. As Juvenal said quite astutely \"Who controls the controllers?\" or in Latin \"Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes\". AI Big Brother EU Newspeak The European Union is not known for its 'democracy' and is evolving into more totalitarian territory, with frankly scary plans to use an Antwerp based company's AI advanced Large Language Model (LLM) called CaLICO. At least in George Orwell's 1984 he envisaged rows of humans altering and checking the news and all communication. The EU no doubt gave this company, funnily named 'Textgain', a huge sum of money to develop their AI monstrosity to police human speech and opinion, further destroying the last vestiges of free speech remaining. Of course, AI 'never' makes mistakes, and no doubt people will be criminalised and detained all because of some fucking out-of-control software programmed by woke Marxists, but that's the EU for you in a nutshell. As is usual in a totalitarian regime policed by AI machines, say the wrong thing, and you will no doubt be unpersoned and taken to Room 101, where you will have a choice of either accepting the evil Stasi regime or be liquidated, all at the behest of an AI software programmed by the controlling woke Marxist totalitarian regime. Thinkpol EU Directive 35465-8S CEO Guy De Pauw: \"Large language models, especially commercial ones, refuse to process toxic language. This makes it almost impossible to use them to process hate speech. We are now building a language model from scratch that can process this type of content — but without generating it. That's what makes us different.\" Funded by the EU Textgain recently received a strong boost as one of the four winners of the Large AI Grand Challenge, a prestigious competition for European AI developers in which 94 international companies participated. It won not only €250,000, but also two million hours of development time on a European supercomputer allowing for much faster new AI model training. COO Redouan el Hamouchi: \"In our digitalized world, there is a growing need for advanced tools to moderate content. Multilingualism is essential in this respect. We are pleased that we can train our application faster, so that it can handle different languages and cultures within the European Union.\" EU globalist International expansion plans Textgain has great ambitions. The coming year will focus on the development of the AI 'Hate Speech' model, with a nominal value of several million euros. With a view towards international expansion, the company will then focus – from a vantage point as market leader – on the further development of SaaS applications. \"We have a unique position in the saturated market of AI providers,\" says De Pauw: \"Firstly, because we are developing our own language model, instead of building on existing AI models. This immediately positions us alongside major players such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. We also distinguish ourselves through our academic approach.

The sad thing is that many businesses go years and sometimes decades without showing their employees how much they appreciate them. The results are low morale, unhappy employees, and a high churn rate. To help you avoid these issues, we have outlined some of the best ways to show appreciation to your employees. While they are still excellent options, many ways to show employees your appreciation are expected and sometimes cliché. This is why you should always think of something new that will surprise and delight them. A great example is sending them a letter or note of recognition. You can use one of the many available letter templates to get started, and then add a personal message you know they will like. When you do this, try to ensure each letter or note is as personal or specific as possible. While you might think generic letters and notes will save you time, they will only serve to annoy your employees when different employees realise you sent them the same message in different letter formats. To ensure these notes have as much impact as possible, mail them physically instead of emailing them. Emails can get lost in all the messages they receive, but most people have not received a letter in years, or ever, so they will appreciate one immensely. Receiving one is a huge deal, and it becomes even more impactful when they realise that the letter is for appreciating a good job they have done. Some employees appreciate monetary rewards more than other types of recognition, so these options would work well for them. The most common type of financial reward is performance-based bonuses. These tell the employees they have been doing a great job, and they are getting rewarded for it. An alternative to these types of bonuses is spot bonuses. Business leaders and managers can hand these out after particularly challenging projects or when the employee has excelled at a task. They are much more impactful because, much like recognition letters and notes, they are unexpected. Salary increases are another excellent way of showing employees your appreciation. Employees want to know that you value their work, and that is reflected in the increase you give them. Lastly, you can give stock options or equity gains. They help employees feel they have some ownership of the company. The added benefit of these bonuses is that they can increase employee loyalty, reduce churn rate, and decrease hiring and training costs. Many businesses do not invest in their employees' professional development. They expect them to gain new skills and level up their skills without input from the business, at their own time, and their own cost. Businesses that take the different approach of providing professional development opportunities typically have happier employees who are more likely to stay with them for longer. Businesses can provide such opportunities by sponsoring conference attendance. These conferences provide excellent learning opportunities and can help employees gain new skills that make them better at their jobs. They also provide additional networking opportunities. While no business wants to let its employees go, those who feel like you are allowing them to rise the professional ranks will always be grateful and happy to go above and beyond for the business. Businesses can also support professional development by paying for educational courses. These days, there are innumerable online courses that teach different skills employees can learn from. Businesses can show their recognition and appreciation of their employees by paying for these courses outright or reimbursing employees who complete them and earn certifications. It is fine to appreciate employees privately, but doing so publicly can also have a significant positive impact on metrics like employee happiness. Businesses can use numerous options to show employee recognition publicly, starting with company-wide email announcements. If your business regularly sends employees emails, you can use one of these emails to show appreciation to specific employees. You can make this a monthly or quarterly thing, but many businesses see the best outcomes when they show appreciation after specific projects. Effective employee appreciation and recognition require a careful approach and serious thought while combining different recognition options for different employees. Personalised or public recognition, depending on the employee, can work very well to make them feel valued and seen, both of which can have a positive impact on their performance, happiness, and loyalty.   \n",

By offering charging options, businesses can not only attract a steady flow of customers but also contribute to a more sustainable future. This guide will help you understand the importance of EV chargers and what steps to take to prepare your business for the growing demand. The rise in electric vehicle adoption is transforming the way people drive, and businesses that install EV chargers are positioning themselves at the forefront of this shift. Having chargers on-site can attract customers who drive electric vehicles, as they are often looking for convenient and reliable places to charge their cars while they shop, eat, or work. Additionally, installing EV chargers can lead to increased foot traffic, longer stays, and, ultimately, higher sales. Lastly, with governments around the world pushing for greener transportation solutions, investing in EV chargers could help your business stay ahead of potential regulations and incentives for clean energy. When it comes to selecting EV chargers, it's important to choose equipment that aligns with your business needs. For example, businesses located in high-traffic areas or those within the retail space may benefit from installing ultra-rapid chargers to accommodate drivers looking for a quick top-up. Before installing EV chargers, it's crucial to assess if your existing electrical infrastructure can handle the added load. Installing multiple chargers may strain your power supply, requiring upgrades like new circuits, transformers, or even a new connection to the grid. This ensures the system supports current and future needs. For larger installations, a new substation may be necessary to provide additional capacity and maintain system stability. Working with an Independent Connection Provider (ICP) can simplify this process. ICPs are authorised to design and build grid connections, ensuring compliance, streamlining installation, and expediting the deployment of EV charging infrastructure. Additionally, consider the costs associated with the installation process. Some regions offer grants, tax credits, or other financial incentives to businesses that install EV chargers. Be sure to explore these opportunities to help offset some of the upfront costs of setting up your charging stations. Once your EV chargers are installed, it's time to let your customers know. One of the most effective ways to do this is by updating your online presence. Many EV drivers rely on charging apps and websites to find nearby charging stations. Make sure your business is listed on these platforms, and include your charger details, such as the type of chargers and their availability. In addition to online listings, clear signage at your business location is essential. Make sure your chargers are easy to find and clearly marked to guide customers to the right spot. You can also offer promotions, such as discounted or free charging for a limited time, to encourage customers to visit and try out your new service. To maximise the impact of your chargers, think beyond just installing the equipment. Consider turning your location into a true electric vehicle charging hub. By offering additional amenities, such as comfortable seating areas, free Wi-Fi, or even food and drinks, you can create a destination where EV drivers will want to stop and spend time. Installing EV chargers at your business is a smart investment that can help you attract more customers, improve your brand's image, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

But now, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to shake things up. And unlike McDonald's, not everyone's lovin' it—especially informational sites that depend on traffic and affiliate deals to survive. So, what's going on? AI has made marketing easier and faster. Predicting trends, creating content, and personalising customer experiences are all things AI does better than any human. For businesses, it's a no-brainer. Why pay affiliates or rely on informational sites when AI can handle it all? With tools that crunch data in seconds, companies can find the best keywords, figure out where ads should go, and target their perfect customers without needing help. That leaves informational sites—once crucial for guiding traffic and boosting SEO—feeling a bit redundant. Sites like Bingo Paradise, which focus on creating expert-written, unbiased reviews, are increasingly going to face challenges. AI tools like ChatGPT and Jasper AI churn out articles faster than any human writer can, and they're often optimised to climb search engine rankings. Businesses can now produce their own content in-house, instead of relying on affiliates or informational sites to drive visitors their way. And here's the kicker: search engines seem to love this AI-created content. That means sites like Bingo Paradise are finding it harder to get noticed, losing traffic to the flood of AI-generated blogs and articles out there. AI is making it easier for companies to deal directly with customers. Using machine learning, they can figure out exactly what their audience wants and serve it up with personalised ads, recommendations, and even chatbots. This direct-to-consumer approach is bad news for informational sites and affiliates, who used to act as the middlemen. It's a double whammy for informational sites. Organic traffic is dropping, and affiliate payouts are getting smaller. With businesses investing in AI to do the heavy lifting, these sites are finding it harder to rank in search results or offer anything that stands out. Despite these challenges, sites like Bingo Paradise can still provide significant value in an AI-driven world. The reviews offered on platforms like this aren't just content churned out by algorithms—they're based on real-world, lived experiences. AI simply can't replicate the human effort involved in trying and testing bingo brands. For instance, a proper review requires signing up to the platform, navigating the interface, playing games, and even depositing money to assess the site as a genuine player. These steps ensure the reviews are comprehensive and authentic. Additionally, evaluating customer service—whether through live chat, email, or phone support—requires actual interaction to gauge responsiveness, professionalism, and helpfulness. In a similar way, a function of Bingo Paradise is to list and categorise welcome offers. For instance, if a brand claims to be offering free spins no deposit, Bingo Paradise's team will actually check that claim (by claiming the offer) and listing the offer here – Ai just can't do that... yet! This hands-on approach is something AI cannot do. While AI can summarise data or compile information, it lacks the ability to provide genuine insights based on actual user experiences. This authenticity is what makes Bingo Paradise's content trustworthy and valuable to readers looking for honest recommendations. But all isn't lost. Sites can fight back by using AI themselves—creating better content, improving their user experience, and finding clever ways to stand out. Focusing on niche topics, building a loyal community, and offering something personal or interactive could be the key to staying relevant. There's no denying AI is changing everything, and it's not going to stop. For sites like Bingo Paradise, staying ahead means adapting quickly, trying new strategies, and making the most of what humans still do best—connecting with other humans. Businesses, on the other hand, are loving the AI revolution. It's helping them cut costs, engage directly with customers, and leave less room for traditional sites to play their part. If informational sites don't evolve soon, they risk being left behind in this fast-moving, AI-dominated world.   \n",

It sometimes involves crisis management and encompasses proactive measures, including innovation, strategic planning, and workforce engagement for long-term stability. The most resilient businesses share a few important traits: agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Agility is the cornerstone of business resilience. Businesses that can successfully pivot in response to market changes or disruptions are often the ones that survive and thrive. Agility enables companies to identify and act on emerging opportunities before their competitors. Agile organisations empower teams to make swift, informed decisions. Diversifying revenue streams can help to build agility. Relying on a single product or market leaves a business vulnerable to disruption. Leveraging technology and tools like real-time data analytics also helps; companies can monitor trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Consulting with professionals like corporate solicitors can help businesses during restructures or acquisitions. These legal experts can advise on compliance with company law, draft contracts for new ventures, and offer guidance on funding and investment. Preparedness is the ability to anticipate and plan for potential disruptions. Companies that invest in robust contingency planning can maintain their operations and recover more quickly from any setbacks. Being prepared means teams know what to do in emergencies, reducing downtime and minimising damage. Prepared organisations often have resources to weather temporary revenue declines or unexpected expenses. Innovation helps businesses stay relevant in constantly changing markets. Businesses that strive to continuously improve and invest in new ideas are better equipped for shifting consumer preferences and technological advancements. Innovative companies can differentiate themselves by offering unique products, services, or solutions. Jacob Beckley, Fusion92's senior vice president of innovation, has told Business News Daily, \"[Innovation] embodies the improvement of something that has come before. It is the evolution of convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness.\" No business can build resilience without strong leadership. In times of disruption, leaders provide the vision, stability, and decision-making that keeps teams focused and motivated. Effective leaders communicate openly and honestly with their teams, fostering trust even in uncertain situations. Michael Shribman, president and founder at APS Global Partners Inc, has written that effective communication leads to increased productivity, enhanced collaboration, better decision-making, and customer satisfaction. Leadership is also important in navigating legal and organisational complexities. Leaders may work closely with legal experts to address challenges such as regulatory compliance, liability management, and reorganisations. Data is a powerful tool to predict and respond to industry disruptions. Businesses that leverage analytics gain insights into market trends, operational inefficiencies, and potential risks. Using predictive analytics, companies can anticipate disruptions through trend analytics. Building resilience is not a one-time effort but rather an ongoing process that requires agility, preparedness, innovation, and strong leadership. Even amid constant disruption, businesses that embrace these traits can navigate challenges and seize opportunities, ensuring their long-term success. From adapting quickly to market changes to developing contingency plans and fostering innovation, resilience allows an organisation to thrive in uncertainty.   \n",

site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a meat market in the Victorian period, when bringing livestock into the growing city became impractical. The famous meat market was located just outside the City's historic walls. Smithfield was the site of livestock trading for centuries before it became a market. The current Grade II listed market buildings were built in the Victorian period. Now, after 900 years, it will be shut down forever thanks to the Labour government's inflationary anti-business budget. Because of the high costs of the new Labour budget and resultant inflationary costs, sadly, adverse economic pressures eventually forced the closure after a failed move to Dagenham, East London. \"Project costs have risen due to a number of external factors, including inflation and the increasing cost of construction, which have made the move unaffordable,\" the City corporation said in a statement on Tuesday. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in 1868. Planners for the Labour controlled City of London now want to demolish the 900-year-old market to build bland social housing projects for illegal migrants in the heart of the City. Smithfield and Billingsgate markets were London institutions and defined the capital for 900 years but have tragically fallen to the incompetence, naive idiocy and economic ignorance of Labour policies. \"This market is sacred ground for many Londoners. It's survived wars, plagues, fires, civil unrest, famines, and everything else, but it could not survive the stupid cunts who run the Labour government,\" a former market trader stated. In other news: Due to heavy anti-business red tape, and costs caused by Labour, the Vauxhall car company will also shut in Luton losing 1,100 jobs. Unrealistic and prohibitive Net Zero rules imposed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles (EV) in the UK partly drove the decision, the firm said.   \n",

qualified for the job, businesses are now speeding up the process for AI integration whilst firing their overpriced human staff. The disgraceful Chancellor even dared to attend the CBI conference today. Artificial Intelligence is the way forward for many businesses who are looking into bespoke AI integration solutions to bypass the stupid and reckless Labour budget. What the irresponsible and essentially ignorant budget of the naive, unqualified Rachel Reeves has done is put a noose around many UK businesses. ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) does not go on sickies, demand more pay, join unions, or go on holidays. AI will replace many jobs soon, and the Labour Chancellor has only speeded up the implementation of this process. Not only are businesses laying off existing workers, but they are not employing new workers either. This will increase unemployment in the UK, causing even more desperate people claiming unemployment benefits.   \n",

active attack on business, entrepreneurs and foreign investment in the UK is a classic example of how the Labour Party works. Labour's wretched Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, along with being a vindictive vengeful Leninist harridan, is hell-bent on destroying established family businesses, and any incentive to start new ones, with her 20 per cent Family Death Tax, levied each time a family business passes a generation. Labour's decision to kill off home-grown family businesses and entrepreneurs is a tragedy. In particular, small businesses and start-ups will suffer and become extinct after being disproportionally punished. Labour has demonstrated its true colours with a reprehensible budget that is engrained within Marxist communist idealogical policies. Let it not be a mystery why Labour is causing huge damage to the business world and economy of Britain at large. We provide the answers to why Labour is carrying out the destruction of entrepreneurship and business in the UK. The Labour Party has shown its true communist, anti-capitalist political ideology with the Rachel Reeves budget, which needlessly increased taxes by over £40 billion — the highest tax burden in British history. Its adoption of pure Marxist ideological processes has ruined any form of aspiration or entrepreneurs here in the UK, damaging the British economy for the next four or five decades.   \n",

towards this direction has changed. This opinion is evidenced by the popularisation of esports in the media space, where authors of materials report on the results of competitions or the number of visitors during esports tournaments. In addition, most fans of esports games and traditional sports can enthusiastically accept the appearance of virtual table tennis. This is an expected event since the following types of e-sports disciplines are already in demand: efootball, ebasketball, and ehockey. VR table tennis was part of the first Olympic eSports Week in June 2023 in Singapore, when it was held as an exhibition event. The success of this landmark event has motivated the International Table Tennis Federation Executive Board to approve the creation of a virtual reality table tennis tournament next year. ITTF President Petra Sörling noted that VR table tennis will encourage the growth of table tennis worldwide. It is also important that VR table tennis attracts the attention of leading brands that provide sports and esports content. For example, the BETER brand has added VR table tennis competitions to its sports portfolio, which has already featured competitions in real table tennis and basketball. In the Setka Cup (BETER Sports' flagman product) virtual reality competition, professional athletes play in a virtual reality format. Each professional table tennis player wears a VR headset, and the competition takes place in the state-of-the-art BETER table tennis simulator. The nearest opportunity to learn more about VR table tennis will be a large-scale event – ICE Barcelona. iGaming industry leaders may join the BETER team at booth 4B18 to learn more about: ICE Barcelona 2025 is a significant event for gaming authoritative representatives across the globe.   \n",

                     A woman with a designer vagina has been given this year's award for the best vagina design, it has been reported. Shirley Metcalf, 23, from Frimlington On Sea, was given the prestigious award for her particularly well-designed designer vagina; which is a cosmetic surgery procedure that is all the rage at the moment. Heaven's gateway \"Yes, yes, we've seen and analysed many vaginas over the past year, but this one in particular had all the immaculate yoni mandorla design qualities we were looking for. What stood out for us was the perfectly trimmed and manicured undercarriage, and the subtle serenity to the trim. The aspect ratio was just right, as well as the juxtaposition of elemental Fibonacci shapes and nuances in tightness within the exquisite, majestic sugar walls. I myself had a test run, and it was as tight and smooth as any drive in a Mercedes-Benz S550e.\" The award ceremony for this year's best designer vagina went well, although the hall where it was held seemed to be besieged by a deep musty, pungent yet sweet fragrance afterwards. Many of the attendees and vagina experts were seen constantly wiping their glasses from the steam.   \n",

                                                     The proposed bill would offer a $1,000 reward to registered bounty hunters for each successful deportation they help facilitate. This reward, funded by the general assembly and administered by the state treasurer, is intended to encourage collaboration between law enforcement and private citizens in identifying individuals unlawfully residing in Mississippi, thereby assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in their removal efforts. Mississippi's House Bill 1484 proposes the creation of a hotline where people can report immigrants in the country illegally. Reports that result in arrest and imprisonment are eligible for a $1,000 reward. Separately, the bill proposes the creation of the \"Mississippi Illegal Alien Certified Bounty Hunter Program\" through which the state government can license \"bounty hunters\" to \"find and detain illegal aliens.\" Bounty hunters from many neigbouring states are now rushing to Mississippi to see if they can be included in the program. If other states adopt the same program, the problem of illegal immigration could be solved in less than six months purely on the monetary incentives. As of today's report, the bill has not passed yet, but due to the urgency and magnitude of the illegal alien problem in the United States, and the Trump administration putting such importance on the issue, the bill is set to pass very soon. \"If you round up ten of them a day, that's like ten grand a day. That's good money right there!\" one of the registered bounty hunters revealed.   \n",

USAID was one of the tools utilised to forward the global woke communist offensive, funded unwittingly by the U.S. taxpayers. Things are moving forward in America now thankfully for the American people with the Trump presidency, but unfortunately in the UK, the deranged administration of Keir Starmer is doubling down on their woke Marxist manifesto of madness, as are the EU. The European Union depended heavily on USAID but will now have to pay for their own propaganda. One thing is for certain, some people got very fucking rich from the amount of U.S. taxpayer USAID dough flying around. $260 million – George Soros — (Open Society Foundations) $85 million – Chelsea Clinton Foundation $68 million – World Economic Forum (WEF) $159 million – 106 climate resilient schools in Sindh (Corrupt officials and ministers siphoned off the funds) $15 million – Condom distribution in Afghanistan $100 million – Feminist ideology training for Afghan women – Afghanistan $1.5 million – Serbia's \"Grupa Izadji,\" which is a pro-LGBTQ group $446,700 to promote the expansion of atheism in Nepal $20,600 for a drag show in Ecuador $47,020 for a transgender opera in Colombia $32,000 for an LGBTQ-centered comic book in Peru $3,315,446 for \"being LGBTQ in the Caribbean\" $3.2 million to help Tunisian migrants readjust to life in Tunisia after deportation $16,500 to foster a \"united and equal queer-feminist discourse in Albanian society\" $39,652 to host seminars at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on gender identity and racial equality $2.5 million to build electric vehicle charging stations in Vietnam's largest cities $425,622 to help Indonesian coffee companies become more climate and gender friendly $70,000 – Ireland – a musical that \"deliver[s] a live musical event to promote the U.S. and Irish shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.\" $10 million – funded meals were sent to an Al Qaeda-linked terrorist group Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) $60 million to Black Lives Matter (BLM) $100 million to improve irrigation practices for Afghan poppy farmers $20 million for \"Ahlan Simsim\" an Iraqi Sesame Street TV show $2 million for Moroccan pottery classes $11 million to tell Vietnam to stop burning rubbish waste $27 million to give gift bags to illegals at the U.S. Southern border crossing $300 million on an unused Afghani power plant $200 million on an unused Afghani dam $250 million on an unused Afghani road $7.9 million to teach Sri Lankan journalists how to avoid \"binary-gendered language\" $2 million for sex changes and LGBTQ activism in Guatemala $1.1 million to an Armenian LGBTQ group $1.5 million to promote LGBTQ advocacy in Jamaica $2 million to promote LGBTQ equality through entrepreneurship in Latin America $3.9 million for LGBTQ causes in the Western Balkans $5.5 million for LGBTQ activism in Uganda $6 million for advancing LGBTQ issues in priority countries around the world $6.3 million for men who have sex with men in South Africa $25 million for Deloitte to promote \"green transportation\" in Georgia $6 million to transform digital spaces to reflect feminist democratic principles $1.3 million to Arab and Jewish photographers $8.3 million for \"USAID Education: Equity and Inclusion\" $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakhstan $6 million supporting tourism in Egypt $50 million to the Wuhan Laboratory to research and engineer Covid bat viruses £2.6 million to the BBC $8m ($7.72m) on subscriptions to Politico Pro output Etc., etc ... The Democrat Party through USAID funded thousands of news outlets to provide \"balanced journalism\" The massive censorship of global media was pushed by the Democrat Party under Obama and Biden, who effectively controlled all media forcing a far-left communist narrative. The Daily Squib noticed a shift in 2013 when our website was nearly wiped off the internet. Speaking at the 2024 Davos event, IN's CEO argued that global advertisers should give preference to spending ad dollars on \"good news.\" In other words, this would pressure companies to spend exclusively on far-left corporate media outlets while ensuring they slash ad spending on alternative media websites that do not promote state propaganda. USAID has pushed nearly half a billion dollars ($472.6m) through a secretive US government financed NGO, \"Internews Network\" (IN), which has \"worked with\" 4,291 media outlets, producing in one year 4,799 hours of broadcasts reaching up to 778 million people and \"training\" over 9000 journalists (2023 figures). IN has also supported social media censorship initiatives. The operation claims \"offices\" in over 30 countries, including main offices in US, London, Paris and regional HQs in Kiev, Bangkok and Nairobi. It is headed up by Jeanne Bourgault, who pays herself $451k a year. Bourgault worked out of the US embassy in Moscow during the early 1990s, where she was in charge of a $250m budget, and in other revolts or conflicts at critical times, before formally rotating out of six years at USAID to IN. Bourgault's IN bio and those of its other key people and board members have been recently scrubbed from its website but remain accessible at http://archive.org. Records show the board being co-chaired by Democrat securocrat Richard J. Kessler and Simone Otus Coxe, wife of NVIDIA billionaire Trench Coxe, both major Democratic donors. In 2023, supported by Hillary Clinton, Bourgault launched a $10m IN fund at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). The IN page showing a picture of Bourgault at the CGI has also been deleted. IN has at least six captive subsidiaries under unrelated names, including one based out of the Cayman Islands. Since 2008, when electronic records begin, more than 95% of IN's budget has been supplied by the US government (US TAXPAYERS). Thanks to Wikileaks for the investigation.   \n",

airstrips as well as barracks for thousands of troops, and it's all thanks to Hamas who have effectively gifted this opportunity to the Americans. \"Hamas were played real good. They fell into the trap, and have now lost Gaza for good, for the Palestinian people. It is sad to say for the Palestinians, they should have never accepted Hamas as their overlords who sent them into destruction,\" a commentator revealed on Wednesday. The US military base will not only serve as a key staging post for US interests in the region but will also protect the newly developed luxury holiday resort of Gaza on the Sea when it is constructed. Trump will now use the Gaza pier port which was built by Joe Biden for $230 million for Gaza aid to Palestinians as a major unloading terminal for building materials and construction equipment. The temporary port will then be adapted to a permanent one. As the Arab world stood by and watched, changes were made in the Middle East that will forever seal its fate, and the Iranian and Hezbollah regimes are now solidly on the back foot, along with the Russians and Chinese. It seems this was the plan all along, and it worked a treat for America and Israel.   \n",

There are estimated to be approximately 19,000 illegal Indians in the U.S. currently that are known, but the numbers are always speculative. More efficiency needed These are expensive flights, and one wonders if the Trump administration could cut costs by shipping them in cargo ships instead? To ship the migrants in a cargo ship would be the optimal cheaper option, and more illegal migrants could be accommodated at once. Logistically speaking, a supertanker could easily hold 12,000–20,000 people, however there could be a problem in converting the ships to hold passengers as they are primarily designed only for non-human cargo but with a little ingenuity it could be done. Additionally, specialist camps would have to be built near the ports so that the illegal aliens could be held en masse before being deported on the waiting tankers to their final destination. Yes, this would involve some cost and logistical planning, but it would literally save billions in costs, because shipping illegals by the 200 in military aircraft is hugely expensive and time-consuming, especially to destinations like India. If Trump wants to get serious, he's going to have to up his game because these are rookie numbers he's dealing with here. He needs to build holding camps ASAP. He needs to acquire and retrofit ships. He needs to mobilise street by street search squads and detain illegals with trucks. Otherwise, 200 here, 200 there, is purely a symbolic gesture for the cameras, it's like a drop in the ocean. Remember, there are an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the USA right now.   \n",

Trump to go for a third term in office. The amount of work that needs to be done to America to fix the terrible damage will take more than four years to complete, and if the people want another Trump term, he should be allowed to complete his work for the sake of the nation. The 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 in response to Franklin Roosevelt's four-term presidency. Before Roosevelt, no president had ever run for reelection after serving two terms — a norm that dated back to George Washington. Some could say that Barack Obama effectively had a third term when Joe Biden was supposedly voted in to office in 2020 despite being clinically senile. It was the Obama administration that conducted much of the operations during the four-year nightmare. The good news is that Trump was elected as president for non-consecutive terms, therefore technically speaking, the 22nd Amendment could be altered to take this fact into account, and he could put himself forward for another election as a de facto second (third) term. The downside to this would be that Trump would be 82 years old by the end of his current four-year term, and his general health and mental state could have deteriorated by then. De-woking the United States is going to be one hell of a task, and Trump is pretty much the only candidate at the moment capable of such an enormous commitment. Hopefully, the 22nd Amendment can be tweaked and adjusted for the sake of the great United States.   \n",

However, returning to work after an extended period away can also be daunting. The workplace changes rapidly, and you may feel out of touch with the current job market. By taking the right steps to update your skills and polish your application, you can successfully relaunch your career. Today, we will discuss some tips to help you land that ideal job and smoothly re-enter the professional world. Follow this guidance to refresh your CV, ace the interview and leverage your break into a unique selling point. A well-written cover letter is your chance to introduce yourself and explain your reasons for applying. With competition often fierce, your letter must grab the recruiter's attention. Avoid generic openings and make your motivation clear from the outset. Explain how your skills make you the ideal candidate. Cover letter templates can provide useful starting points, but ensure your letter sounds natural and reflects your personality. Tailor the content to the role, highlighting relevant experience. Refer to the job description and use matching keywords. Research the company values and link these to your own qualities. Keep to one page in length and check for errors. Use a formal tone, but inject some warmth by avoiding clichés. Sign off with a note of appreciation for their consideration. With a compelling, polished cover letter, you can get your application noticed. A strong CV summarises your career history and showcases your abilities. After a break, carefully update your CV to reflect any new skills gained and your current career aims. List your work chronologically, keeping the details concise and relevant. Emphasise accomplishments and the value you brought to past employers. Use powerful action verbs like \"led\", \"spearheaded\", and \"accelerated\". Consider adding a brief profile at the top highlighting your most relevant skills and experience. This provides immediate impact when read quickly. Explain any gaps positively, focusing on new capabilities, volunteering or training. List relevant courses, certificates, languages and IT skills. Check that references are current and ask for endorsements from LinkedIn contacts. Review it for spelling and formatting errors before sending it out. A polished, well-structured CV will make the shortlist. Thorough preparation is key to interview success. Research the company, role and current industry trends. Compile relevant examples that demonstrate desired competencies like teamwork, creativity or leadership. Plan your route to arrive 10 minutes early. Dress smartly and professionally. Greet the interviewer warmly and with good eye contact. Listen carefully to each question. Provide concise yet detailed responses relating back to the role requirements. Prepare intelligent questions that show your understanding of and interest in the company. Avoid interrogating the interviewer but ask for clarification if needed. Finally, finish strongly by summarising your suitability for the role. With practice and planning, you can present yourself as the ideal candidate. A career gap can set you apart if leveraged well. Draw out skills gained during your time away that would benefit the new employer. Emphasise any experiences relevant to the role, like volunteering, study, travel or family care. Explain how the break has energised you and given you renewed focus. Highlight what motivates you about this next step and why it excites you. Convey your passion and readiness to throw yourself into the new opportunity. Frame your break as an asset that has allowed personal growth and the chance to develop abilities. With the right spin, taking time out can strengthen your application and reveal you as a well-rounded, motivated candidate. Networking is crucial when re-entering the job market. Attend industry events and connect with former colleagues. Join alum groups and professional associations to widen your contacts. Consider informational interviews to gain advice from those in your target field. A strong network provides support and surfaces unadvertised opportunities. Consider short courses or online training to refresh industry knowledge and technical skills. Gain relevant qualifications and certificates to fill any gaps in your CV. Emphasise your commitment to lifelong learning. Some employers may fund work-related education, so highlight your desire to continue developing. Re-entering the workplace after a break requires thorough preparation but offers a chance for a fresh start. Follow the guidance above to showcase your talents, highlight your renewed ambition and prove you are ready to hit the ground running. With determination, careful planning and a positive mindset, you can overcome any barriers and secure that ideal job.   \n",

Britishers! We need to have a chat about this peculiar American pastime they call \"football.\" Now, before you start assuming it's just our beloved game with a few quirky rule changes (like baseball is to cricket—an inferior imitation), let me stop you right there. This so-called \"football\" has about as much in common with football as a Labour politician has with common sense. Here's the first and most glaring issue: they barely use their fucking feet. Okay, there's a bit of kicking here and there—once every 45 minutes when someone remembers they actually have a foot—but for the most part, it's a game of throwing, carrying, and smashing into each other like a bunch of blootered pensioners outside a Wetherspoons on a Saturday afternoon. In fact, if we're being historically accurate, American football is far more like rugby than it is football. It started out as a chaotic mash-up of rugby and association football in the late 19th century, when American universities decided that simply playing one of the perfectly good existing sports from England wasn't confusing enough. No, like all American mash-ups they had to invent their own Frankensteinian version—one where they could wear a suit of fucking armour, stop every seven seconds for a committee meeting, and somehow still call it \"football.\" Back in the 1860s and 1870s, American universities were playing various versions of football, some resembling association football (our actual football) and others closer to rugby. Eventually, a chap named Walter Camp—an American, of course—decided that rugby wasn't quite organised enough, so he took it upon himself to ruin it with a bunch of additional rules, such as the line of scrimmage, downs, and most outrageously, the forward pass. The forward pass is where this game really goes off the rails. In rugby, you pass backwards like a civilised person. In American football, they decided, \"Nah, let's chuck it 40 yards forward and hope for the best.\" The result? A sport where hulking meathead jock brutes throw missiles at each other while wearing enough padding to survive a car crash. If you're a Brit watching American football for the first time, here's what you need to know: So there you have it, the Daily Squib guide to a game called American \"football\" which isn't really football—it's a bizarre, stop-start, hyper-commercialised fucked up version of rugby on steroids with added bureaucracy and unnecessarily complicated rules. But let's be fair to the Yanks—it is entertaining in its own over-the-top way, and the Super Bowl is quite the spectacle (mainly because of the half-time show and the woke NFL adverts, but still). Next time you're forced to watch this odd spectacle with American mates, just remember: it's not football, it's rugby with timeouts, an advertising budget, and a slightly inflated sense of self-importance.

                                                                The UK under Labour is no friend to the United States, or to Trump. In fact, Labour is no friend to the UK either, and hates Britain, its history, its legacy, its culture and its people. Business is being punished, pensioners are being killed off, and heavy-duty taxation upon taxation and insane bureaucratic red tape has caused 80% of the UK's wealthy to flee Britain. Only last week, the irresponsibly stupid Chancellor Reeves caused a £459 million Glaxo deal to fall through the floor. Everything this arrogant harridan touches turns to shit. Forget about economic growth, the only thing Reeves knows how to grow is Britain's debt mountain and her fucking cunt hair. Trump needs to put tariffs on the UK by up to 60% or more and punish the Labour government with no mercy, because frankly, did they show mercy when they sent 100 of their communist activist agitators when they tried to thwart his re-election? Angela Rayner thinks Trump is an \"absolute buffoon. He has no place in the White House. He's an embarrassment, and he should be ashamed of himself\". Labour Foreign Minister, Lammy thinks Trump is \"a racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser\" and \"a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath\". Peter Mandelson, despite his grovelling apology to Trump, still called him a \"danger to the world\" and \"a white nationalist and racist\". Britain is lost under Labour, it is now a nation that has been effectively taken over by the enemy of the USA, the enemy of the UK and the enemy of Trump. There's no \"special relationship\" left any more, and Labour have sealed themselves in alliance with China and the EU. There's no room for you Trump, there's no impetus for any goodies to come to the US with any trade deals or any economic riches. Rachel Reeves is continuing to ruin the economy and impoverish the embattled people of Britain daily with her negative-growth anti-capitalist strategies. Forget about Britain, it is now a cesspool of woke communist rhetoric, a ruined economy teetering on the edge of a very deep precipice. The strategy should be to deepen and hasten Labour's descent into the sewer by punishing the economy further. Once they have been ousted, it can be business as usual, but do not deal with these backstabbing shit talking fuckers while they're around. You will regret it, Mr. Trump...deeply.   \n",

questioning his 'ludicrous' display of medals for his brief stint in the military in his latest video address. \"Arse!\" Royal fans were up in arms when they saw a blurred, wonky amateur video of the prince on his porch in Montecito wearing medals all over a cheap looking civilian suit. One Twitter X user commented: \"What a moron! Prince Harry looks like he is going to fall over from the weight of all the medals he never earned\" Another X user revealed: \"He looks like a prize ninny! Who's he trying to fool?\" However, others defended the duke, with one user Laquisha46 commenting: \"Harry is wearing his medals proudly, which our African princess Meghan probably purchased for him in a flea market in Santa Monica. Leave them alone, you bunch of bullies. Love you Meghan.\" The consensus was of ridicule for the wayward prince who has admitted to heavy use of class-A drugs like cocaine, mushrooms, meth and marijuana, allegedly including when he served. Expert analysis Royal expert and body language expert Arbuthnot Bollsaque commented on the BBC that \"Harry is showing defiance for being stripped of his right to wear a military uniform by displaying the plethora of medals all over his cheap looking suit\". Harry was stripped of his honorary military titles by late Queen Elizabeth II after he stepped down from royal life in 2020 and moved to California with Meghan Markle.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 When humans become too interconnected, they reject this state through war because too much connection creates a reaction of disconnection and a run to privacy. Our inherent differences are accentuated to a point that eventually sows the seeds for conflict on and off the internet. We are told day in day out that humans have to communicate with each other constantly through smartphones, the internet, social media, but no one has factored in the consequences of such levels of communication because they were blinded by the revenue made from connectivity overload. Of course, humans need some level of communication and connection with each other, but the situation we are at now is at a level of overload. When was the last time you sat at a desk and wrote a letter to someone on a piece of paper? When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone face to face, and not impersonal cold digital words with a stranger on the internet who interacts with thousands of other impersonal messages every day? This is the ultimate paradox that through more connectivity humans have grown further apart from each other and there is a very good reason humankind will head to complete global war soon. One of the reasons for rejection of the internet beast is the loss of privacy, of space, of real human contact, of community, of family and of love. The digital beast is a cold hard obtuse world of code with no warmth and human eye to eye, face to face connection. Zoom conferences do not substitute reality in any way but present a cold digital representation of human connectivity that is ultimately soulless. The prying incessant eyes of communication now delve into our lives with an extreme hunger for data on every part of our existence, and daily our loss of privacy is getting worse. Humans need privacy, but now every form you fill in for anything requires invasive data to be revealed that infringes on our rights as humans. Every part of your life is now digitized and filed/sold. All of this unhappiness naturally builds up to a crescendo, not only with individuals, but entire nations are soaked with this spam world malaise that infects every part of our existence. If you know that much data about your enemies then you know where to attack, where their weaknesses are and how to destroy your enemy with the most effectiveness. This level of interconnectedness will eventually backfire because it is now intrusive and one could even say a form of bullying to eek out every piece of information from people just wanting to live their lives in peace.   \n",

This is why we are seeing more censorship and totalitarian behaviour by Western Big Tech companies who are following China's CCP policies closely. World Economic Forum founder and Chair Klaus Schwab recently sat down for an interview with a Chinese state media outlet and proclaimed that China was a \"role model\" for other nations. Schwab, 84, made these comments during an interview with CGTN's Tian Wei on the sidelines of last week's APEC CEO Summit. Schwab said he respected China's \"tremendous\" achievements at modernizing its economy over the last 40 years. \"I think it's a role model for many countries,\" Schwab said. \"I think we should be very careful in imposing systems. But the Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries,\" Schwab said. It's not only the WEF who adore the CCP, but so does the UN, who wants all Western nations to model China. The EU also sees China as a model of its Soviet bloc of nations. They envisage a modern communist state where brutal torture of citizens, and heavy-handed communist commissars mete out daily punishments on the people. Totalitarian bullying regimes like China are idolised by the globalists, who have become very rich off the backs of Chinese slave workers. THE UNITED NATIONS OF CHINA: A VISION OF THE WORLD ORDER by European Council of Foreign Relations You will realise what these people have in store for you when the Citizen Social Credit system that China uses on its citizens already is introduced over in Western nations. This is what the EU, WEF and UN want introduced into the West to complete a totalitarian net of control over the population even more than is already present. You may think surveillance is already pretty bad in Western nations, but wait until the Chinese surveillance model is adopted. Big Tech companies are already preparing the framework to introduce a Chinese social credit model as well as increased Chinese CCP style surveillance. Since 2013, Big Tech has been tightening its deadly noose on all civilians, and it is only going to get worse. Looks like it's forced CCP anal swabs and brutal poverty for everyone, that is, except for the globalist hierarchy in their mansions. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved \"peacefully.\" Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome's 1972 pro-depopulation book \"The Limits to Growth.\" Meadows argues that most of the world's population must be wiped out so that the survivors can \"have freedom\" and a \"high standard of living.\" During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world's population is \"inevitable.\" However, he insists that a \"benevolent\" dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population \"peacefully.\" \"We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,\" he says of the world's growing population. \"If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart ... and [people have] a low standard of living,\" Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.   \n",

campmates after being found with a large cache of the sedative Midazolam during his isolation period ahead of entering the jungle. The Daily Squib can reveal the former Health Secretary, 44, was primed and ready 'to carry out another covid' on the campmates. ITV bosses were left reeling at the erroneous discovery. Mr Hancock, who lost the Tory whip last week when it was announced he was joining the cast of the show, also has access to his laptop. Do Not Resuscitate \"It seems Hancock's plan was simple.

Welcome to the beginning of the post consumerist era, a time where the assets of citizens are stripped and mass consumerism is effectively shut down. The Great Reset is a modern take on medieval feudalism, where Marxist collectivism meets the criteria of feudalism and totalitarianism. You will not own property, and you will not own any assets. Already, within the UK we are seeing huge gargantuan interest rate hikes that not only kill off all business but home ownership. The death of aspiration, where success is punished, is a predominantly Marxist construct that is touted as a major part of Labour Party policy, but has now been adopted by the socialist Tory Party fully. The middle class and bourgeoisie are being whittled down and systematically destroyed so that only the highest echelons will hold all the power and money. No true Conservative party or government exists in the West simply because all governmental departments have socialist structures and feed a massive welfare/social care state. If the entire system is socialist, it means Conservative policies cannot exist and if there are attempts to implement such policies they are rejected. Donald Trump was a prime example of this, as his every move and policy was rejected eventually leading to him being ousted from his limited role as president. Liz Truss was another example, ousted after 45 days in office. The role of the new Marxists, the new generation of indoctrinated controllers aligned with communist China is to create an ultimate hive mind post consumerist post capitalist landscape where in the name of the so-called eco-drive all citizens are impoverished and depend solely on the state. Universal income will be a pittance where citizens will barely be able to feed themselves with EU rations of maggot and insect protein. Citizen social scores adopted by China and being developed by Western tech companies now will determine what each family receives monthly. Citizens who are religious, or fight against the system in any way will simply have their rations or heat supplies reduced. Severe offenders and people who actively fight or deny state power will have their rations cut completely, and all privileges like travel, education, entertainment removed. Children will be indoctrinated by the state education system to report even their own family members for any indiscretions. One must not forget the hierarchy who will of course be dining on the finest gourmet food, and living in vast AI served palaces watching over the Untermenschen useless eaters. Their children will be educated separately and their life spans will be enhanced dramatically through science. From then on, there will be little use for the remaining population and through poverty, hunger, controlled virus outbreaks and disease the rest will be whittled down. A celebrated member of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF) has called for a staggering 86 percent reduction in the population of humans, arguing that the goal can be achieved \"peacefully.\" Dennis Meadows, one of the main authors of the Club of Rome's 1972 pro-depopulation book \"The Limits to Growth.\" Meadows argues that most of the world's population must be wiped out so that the survivors can \"have freedom\" and a \"high standard of living.\" During a 2017 interview, Meadows claims that genocide of 86% of the world's population is \"inevitable.\" However, he insists that a \"benevolent\" dictatorship could accomplish the mass de-population \"peacefully.\" \"We could [ ] have eight or nine billion, probably,\" he says of the world's growing population. \"If we have a very strong dictatorship which is smart ... and [people have] a low standard of living,\" Meadows says as he explains how the population reduction agenda could be triggered.   \n",

and cameras were all in tow as Harry hugged another disabled Afghanistan veteran for the cameras. This was another virtuous show to show how virtuous the money-grabbing Sussexes are in 'real life' by exploiting a poor bunch of disabled veterans. Selling Invictus merchandise also brought in lucrative profits off the backs of the poor disabled people being exploited. Then there was the further moneymaker for Meghan where she spewed out passages from her self-agrandising children's book The Stench. Disabled Veterans Netflix producers had also demanded that the errant couple visit the Queen in a quick surprise visit to take advantage of the 95-year-old regent before the poor woman pops her clogs any moment now. One commentator even revelled in the public displays of affection between the couple. \"It's a wonderful act, and many of the people are happily fooled by these tricksters. Hell, they even visited the Queen and fooled her that they actually 'care' despite punishing the poor woman by withholding access to her own grandchildren. They still plan on ruining her Jubilee by upstaging it with a parade of their previously unseen children, but that's something for another day. You just can't fault the premeditated PR actions and Netflix acumen in exploitation these two parasites have achieved. Exploiting the disabled and old for your own monetary and press gain is truly despicable, but it's all part of the game, and these two money-grabbing tricksters play that game very well.\" Here's to the VVIP (Vile Vindictive Insolent Parasite) Sussexes...

This is where Markle fell down because she severely mistook or was ignorant to the fact that there is very rarely a move up the ranks in the monarchy. Once you are put in a certain rank, that's it, unless you are crowned a regent at some point. \"This is why Markle, who is a power mad narcissistic megalomaniac, could not handle her mid to lower level position in the royal family and started to kick up a storm with her Hollywood tantrums. \"Prince Harry once said 'What Meghan wants Meghan gets' and he was correct in his observation, because once Markle found out she could not get the same status as William and Kate, she embarked on her plan to ruin Harry's life by taking him away from the royal family to North America. \"Psychopathic traits are key to Meghan Markle's psychosis, and one thing these people do is they create havoc wherever they go. \"Markle has modelled herself on Harry's mother, Diana, and now psychologically, he is a prisoner to her. Imagine being Harry, who lost his mother once, now he has this thing pretending to be his mother, if he loses that as small as it is, he will lose everything. One thing that Markle has learned as well in Hollywood as a Z-list actress, to get her roles, is how to perform the most amazing fellatio, which opens doors for people like her almost instantaneously. Markle is such an expert in fellatio that any man under her spell would be foolish to even think about going elsewhere. This and other methods are used by Markle to continue using her victims by eventually bleeding them completely dry, in more ways than one. As Wallis Simpson was an aficionado of the Shanghai Technique, so too is Meghan Markle in making it a near impossibility for Harry to think about leaving her expert technique. \"Markle tolerates Harry because he is naive, and of low IQ, as well as holding a royal title. Harry is therefore the perfect mark to be exploited, and by adding children into the mix, the chains are further solidified. Harry had to pony up Diana's inheritance to buy the house for Meghan which she will eventually take for herself. There is a valid reason Markle chose California for settling down, and that is because Californian divorce law favours women by about 95%, and men are left destitute after the courts and lawyers have finished their work. \"Meghan and Harry never left the royal family because of press intrusion as they falsely claimed. It was because Markle could not get what she wanted, and she had an almighty hissy fit through her unwarranted power play moves. \"As for Harry, he has been completely indoctrinated now, and much like a dangerous cult member or Scientologist, there is little anyone can do for him. The British royal family should completely write him off, and rescind their Duke and Duchess titles because they are no more relevant in any way, and are only being used by Harry and Meghan for commercial purposes. There is nothing anyone can do now to save Harry, as Meghan's evil spell is complete. The Queen holds a special part of her heart for Harry, but she must ultimately choose between her duty as regent to save the monarchy by taking away Harry and Meghan's titles or lose everything. Continual damage will be meted on the royal family if the Queen does not act decisively and fast.\"   \n",

crying like a fucking baby, and all around are other ladies all crying. Or maybe they are not crying, maybe one of them is acting, maybe onions are involved in the sordid crying matter? Who's crying this time, aww is your mental state a bit fragile? Like you can bully and dismiss whole battalions of people with ruthless efficiency, but the slightest bad press makes you cry? Oh, look what you have done now, Harry is crying in the corner as well. Just as soon as we get off our private jet and the servants unload the bags of money... You made me cry now, and I am going to report it on a chat show watched by millions of people. Ooh! I'm going to pull out my race card now and tattle tale. He said, she said! Take my word for it. Please give me as much sympathy as possible.   \n",

Meghan seem to have managed it with ease. Is this attack on the British royal family a national security threat? One cannot fathom the profound change that Harry has been put through within the last few years, where he went from a happy-go-lucky much-loved member of the British royal family to become a profound national security threat to Britain. Intelligence Asset Who were the people who introduced the prince to this woman? Could they have been working for intelligence agencies working for Britain's enemies, their role loosely involved in such a way not to arouse any suspicion amongst the MI6 watchers? There is a certain delicate balance to clandestine work, and undermining the British royal family is not an easy task to behold, but in the current circumstances, it is working well, the agents if they were truly operatives, infiltrated the British Monarchy with absolute ease, almost cutting through the 1000-year-old institution like a knife through butter. The blame must firmly fall on the royal security staff for not vetting this woman first before she was allowed to cause absolute mayhem in the royal court, and effectively indoctrinate the easily swayed prince, to turn himself against his own family. If the security staff had done their work properly, the Windsors would not be in such turmoil right now. As a whole, the British Monarchy is now on its knees, with public opinion split, with Americans baying for the heads of royals to roll off the blocks, there is a conceited effort by the new Woke elite media classes for the break-up of Britain's Monarchy. This time however there is no guillotine where each member of royalty is beheaded one by one as occurred in the French Revolution, it is more of a trial by media, where the entire former Establishment is paraded, denigrated, then denounced before attempted relegation to the annals of history. This is surely a national security emergency, and MI6 should treat it as such. Somehow the prince who has succumbed to extreme brainwashing from an asset of foreign intelligence must be woken up. Meghan Markle, is Gríma Wormtongue to Harry's Théoden. The spell must be broken, and only then will there be some respite, or alternatively, the former prince must be isolated completely, silenced and cut off, with his manipulative wife in tow of course. One thing is for certain, Britain's enemies are now revelling in the public weakness shown by the royal Establishment. What Harry and his dominant Wormtongue controller have done is cause great harm to the British Monarchy, and they will continue until stopped!   \n",

         Hailing from the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota, Shaquashisha LaQwandwell, 23, the state's first ever transgender woman, was crowned Miss Minnesota in St. Paul on Monday. This year's Minnesota beauty pageant was an all-inclusive affair, with not only transgender women invited but even paraplegic women were duly encouraged to join. Under Joe Biden's new transgender directives, if you are a transgender biological male, you are welcome to join not only the military but any sport for women, or beauty pageant. Accepting her prize LaQwandwell was naturally happy to win such a prestigious contest, and is now pushing her sights to enter Miss USA, and even the Miss Universe contest. \"Imma aks y'all do you lakk ma beautiful face and figure ni**az, cuz y'all bitchez gonna see me sashay in to Miss USA soon. Imma gon enter Miss USA, not wit ma 15 inch but da contest silly. Gotcha dere!\" At one point, LaQwandwell dropped her flowers and bent over to pick them up giving the judges all a solid eyeful of her meat and two veg, but that was neither here nor there, she has every right as any woman to join the contest. Bigotry and discrimination will not be tolerated.   \n",

                                                               During the sell-out Oprah interview, Meghan Markle was talking about her favourite subject – herself – when a cute little tweety boird landed on a branch next to the narcissist. The bird stayed there for a few seconds, then in an instant gently lifted its bottom and squirted a copious amount of bird shit onto Markle's black couture dress. They say getting shit on by a bird is good luck, and it seems Markle will need a lot of it in the future, seeing as her Netflix and Spotify deals are sinking faster than Harry's ratings in the UK. One of Oprah's producers was professional about the bird shit incident. \"The dress looks okay with the bird shit on, in fact it looks like the kind of $4,000 dress some profligate virtue signalling parasitic narcissist would wear. Keep on filming, no need to stop!\" As for the heroic bird, it was later spotted eating from the couple's garbage storage area, obviously stocking up its gut for some further butt explosions on some other deserving recipient. UPDATE: March 11, 2021 – Some geezer has taken our idea and put it to video. Done very well, good production. Well done.   \n",

                                     The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle has made a remarkable request to the Queen that has caused shockwaves through royal circles. Too far away Markle is now demanding that the Queen moves the whole county of Sussex to Montecito, California because she thinks Sussex is too far away from her new home in America. Sussex has an illustrious history, created in the 5th Century, the county used to be its own Kingdom once, populated mostly by the Germanic Saxons. Moving 1,460 square miles of Sussex to Montecito, California, USA, would be quite a logistical nightmare, however if Meghan has ordered it, what she wants is what she gets. Our poor sovereign, Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth II has capitulated to pretty much every demand that Meghan Markle, and the idiot have demanded, but this Sussex removal and relocation is simply the last straw. On Thursday, the palace at Windsor received a communiqué from Meghan Markle demanding the relocation of the County of Sussex to America. In the bristling letter of demand, Markle proposed that dynamite separates Sussex from the British Isles, and a flotilla of 5,000 barges tied to the shoreline pull the Sussex land mass across the Atlantic Ocean. The towing of Sussex across the Atlantic Ocean would take approximately six months, and eventually reach Californian waters in eight months time. There was no mention of the people of Sussex in Markle's demand, but it seems she does not give two figs about them anyway, so it is assumed they will all simply drown during the crossing. It is not known how red the Queen's cheeks became in hue, or how much steam came out of her ears when the Meghan Markle demand was read, but one servant who was present said something about beetroots later on.   \n",

author appointed by Queen Meghan and King Harry, Ringo Scoobie, has outlined in a new book that the American royal couple have knighted their first Sir on American soil. According to Scoobie, the author of the book, King Harry knighted their most precious gardener for his services to Bougainvillea. \"The ceremony began in the morning when José turned up for work. He was informed by the California-shire palace's footman that he was to be knighted that day. I cannot repeat the words he said, but it included Spanish words like 'puta' and 'madre'. \"Once José was escorted to the throne room, King Harry and Queen Meghan rose from their respective faux gold thrones, made in Mexico. José approached the American royals, and was ordered to bow before them. King Harry then took out a fake sword ($14.99 from Walmart) and knighted the gardener by patting each shoulder with the plastic blade of the cheap sword. \"The King then said a few words to José, about his service to the garden, especially the care of the Bougainvillea, and announced to the assorted courtiers 'Arise, Sir José Guadalupe Fernando Monteiro Hernández Ricardo Mojon Domingo Fuentes Chingada Jesús Paolo Guerrero, I knight thee in the name of the Archehole Foundation and Netflix.' The gardener was then informed that he will be given a $6.35 increase in his hourly salary and led away. \"The King and Queen of California-shire, and the United States of America then retired back to their thrones, where they proceeded to discuss the day's business of planning their next photo opportunity and heavily planned PR exercise.\" It is not known how many more honours or knighting ceremonies the King and Queen plan in the future. In other news, Queen Meghan has also acquired 14 Corgi breed dogs for the California-shire palace with 16 bathrooms. The corgis were shipped directly from Wales from a renowned breeder. Queen Meghan has staunchly denied the American royals are competing with anyone else, ahem, mention no names.   \n",

wing, so I can sneak my crack dealer in and underage girls to give me foot jobs daily. Can't live without that shit. We're also gonna set up a direct link with the Chinese Communist Party so they can download what they want and dictate to Pop what they need done,\" an excited Hunter Biden said rubbing his hands with glee. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE According to Democrat officials who say the election is in the bag, Marxist political operative Zheng Zhifa and Democrat-Chinese Influence peddler John Wei, who are closely tied to the CCP will have their own office directly in line with Biden's Oval Office so they can bark orders at him without even picking up a phone. \"Pops told me that the Secret Service assholes, and any moron who cares for national security will be told to stand down. If anyone even raises a fucking eyebrow to our corrupt deals, as we rake in more millions, they will be retired to goddamn Alaska. As for my crack dealer, Jigaboom 'Boom' Williams, he will be given free access to my quarters, as he is the best crack rock dealer this side of Chicago,\" Hunter Biden added. Thanks to the silence of the corrupt dealings and crimes of the Biden Crime Family by the mainstream Democrat Party Propaganda media, the Bidens are well protected and can do as they please without any fear of prosecution. They are effectively above the law, and their evil crimes are completely dusted under the carpet. \"When it comes to Democrats, the media keeps quiet of our crimes, and we can do anything without fear of ever being prosecuted. Republicans, libertarians, and anyone else — they get prosecuted immediately for the smallest misdemeanour, their names and reputation put through the mud, and turfed out of town by the mob. Those are the rules folks so go suck on that losers!\" a prominent Democrat politician and avowed paedophile rapist revealed to MSNBC on Sunday, laughing like a hyena. Some things will change though — this time the Big Guy will be getting 50%.   \n",

Manufacturing practically disappeared under the Obama/Biden ticket and millions of decent hard-working Americans lost their jobs to China. WATCH HUNTER BIDEN VIDEO HERE China had the upper hand at all times thanks to near slave labour costs attributed to the communist regime. Obama and Biden not only turned a blind eye to the millions who lost their jobs in manufacturing and retail, but they did not bat an eyelid to the massive theft of intellectual property from American businesses and the military. Under Obama, the U.S. lost millions of pieces of intellectual property to China, who then manufactured American designs cheaply with no copyright existing in China. The Chinese military was able under the Obama reign to increase its technical ability and upgrade its military capabilities with stolen blueprints from U.S. arms contractors. Much of the money made off the back of selling Americans cheap plastic trinkets was pumped into the Chinese army upgrades. Not only was half of Ukraine lost under the Obama presidency, but China was allowed to practically buy off large swathes of America. Hollywood is a prime example of China increasing its influence in the West, it pumped vast amounts of money into the film industry, effectively dictating what American films disseminated as messages. The turn in events took place in 2016 when a serious spanner was thrown into the works — Donald J. Trump. Trump has attempted in his measly four years to turn around the gross injustices created by the Obama administration, and even though he has come up against serious brick walls, he has succeeded in some capacity to bring back some business to the USA, and to even the playing field somewhat in trade deals. There is still a lot of work to be done, and this is why it is crucial for the USA, as a mantle of the West, to claw back lost revenue from China, to bring back manufacturing jobs to America, and to halt the theft of American intellectual property by the Chinese. China is a brutalist, evil communist regime that imprisons millions of its Uighur population in re-education camps, and brutalizes the population of Tibet. China daily carries out a program of forced organ harvesting on condemned citizens, and Chinese hospitals are complicit in the trade of human organs to the highest bidders. Obama and the Democrats never said one word to China about these brutal injustices. China has repeatedly ignored International treaties with Hong Kong, and has imposed its brutalist communist regime on the former British protectorate. China only recorded 4,634 deaths from Coronavirus, which is a blatant lie and cover-up as much as it covered up the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic allowing the virus to spread globally unfettered for months before eventually being coerced to admit that there was a deadly airborne virus emanating from Wuhan, China. Under the auspices of Obama and his administration, censorship on the internet increased by 90%, involving U.S. internet giants utilising Chinese communist censorship techniques to silence anyone critical of the Democrat agenda. The incriminating evidence from Hunter Biden's recovered laptop reveal that the Bidens are Chinese assets of its Kompromat program. The Biden family, and Joe Biden, are essentially the property of China and a liability to the USA's national security.   \n",

crime family. Due to mass biased censorship, the DS can only briefly describe what is out there now all over the internet. Any information is freely available on the internet if you bypass Google and do your own research using targeted sources. Not only is Joe Biden allegedly solidly implicated in taking illegal backhanders from dodgy Chinese and Ukrainian businesses, now his own daughter, Ashley Biden, has suggested in her diary that she was molested by her own father during inappropriate showers the couple took when she was a child. This obviously ties in with Joe Biden's creepy photographs sniffing women and children, and other inappropriate behaviour even during C-SPAN photo shoots. SOURCE: NationalFile.com Joe Biden's son, Hunter, who allegedly admitted to his father in a text message that he had sexual relations with his 14-year-old niece, Natalie Biden, is now undercover and nowhere to be seen. Maybe venture to 4Chan, as Chinese dissidents against the CCP regime are flooding the place with even more photos from the Hunter hard drive. In one video Hunter Biden is filmed receiving foot gratification from a female whilst smoking a crack pipe. That's all we can reveal here, purely because of the censorship and cover up by the socialist controlled media. There may or may not be some information from here if you follow through. Free and Fair Press? There is no way any of the mainstream news outlets can call themselves news services, or journalists because they are completely ignoring the biggest scandal in political history at the moment. You are not a journalist if you ignore this Biden story, you are a paid biased slave to political masters, and are ignoring the basic tenets as well as responsibility of journalism. Your cowardice and inaction, will never be forgotten — you are a disgrace to the mantle of journalism and a free, fair press. Do not ever call yourselves journalists ever again. You are a sham, a shameful cowardly disgrace to journalism.   \n",

a new horror awakens from the bowels of Netflix – Keeping Up With the Sussexes. Just as the sun seemed to be shining again and the vile Kardashian slime was seeming to have subsided, there is a newer even worse offering coming to our screens, this time involving freeloaders Harry, Meghan and poor old Archie. \"No doubt the Netflix executives have ordered the Sussexes to bring out the sprog for maximum effect, and are already training the kid to do circus tricks,\" one ex-Netflix subscriber said disparagingly. Selling the Sussex royal title for profit has been easy for Harry and Meghan who want nothing to do with the royal family apart from the title to profit from. \"It has cheapened the Sussex royal title to a brand much like the shister Kardashians. Sussex is now viewed next to any other cheap brand on the telly and no doubt the merchandising will be profitable as well. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, the Windsors can only look on in horror as the royal name is dragged through the dustbin of inequity,\" a royal commentator revealed. Selling banal venal entertainment to Americans is easy because many of them have no standards, however in Europe, things may be different, especially in Britain where some people at least can recognise utter self-serving 'woke' bullshit when they see it. One can only hope the Sussexes have their title removed forthwith, however this seems unlikely as the Queen seems to have gone all soft in her old age. If it was up to the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry and Meghan would have been given the boot with no title, no pay offs and no goodbyes.   \n",

library, with hidden compartments to stash naked young women, you have the Obama library where books about climate change and anal rimming techniques are the choice, and you have the George W. Bush library, which only has one book, My Pet Goat. The Donald Trump presidential library is set to stump all of the prior presidents, and their ego stroking book depositories. Trump is going to open up a whole library of books dedicated solely to authors who have spilled the dirt on the president, backstabbers, former employees with grudges, former White House staff who were fired, and all the rest of the Trump haters who wrote vast volumes of text detailing how bad a person he is. \"I want to put all the tremendous hate into one place, so I can walk in there and revel in all of it. We're not just talking a dozen books here, in my four years of presidency I think maybe 85,000 books have been written about me and by authors that are so deranged all they can do is hate me. I revel in this, because I affected those people so much, they went and wrote a book about me, good for them. You know, I should get royalties from them all, maybe I might get my new lawyer to look into that. We're going to see rows and rows of these books in my new shining library, it's gonna be bigger than Obama's that's for sure,\" President Donald J. Trump quipped from the White House on Wednesday. There's even talk about bringing out an encyclopaedia of Donald Trump Haters, who all seem to have come out of the woodwork only weeks before the election. Hell, even Matt Drudge, who usually has his nose firmly lodged far up a Republican president's anal passage, is in on the act with daily negative Trump stories aggregated. \"No other president has received such a wall of hate, obstacles, impeachments, false accusations as Trump, and I think it's because they are really scared he will win a second term. The negative news projects are released with such quantity daily, they now overlap each other publicity wise. We are talking well researched hit pieces, some with actual evidence as opposed to the old 'anonymous source' route. I don't know anyone on this planet that can survive that kind of shit, but the Teflon Don. Sure some stuff sticks a little while longer, like the vet smear project, but all I see is Trump wading through this manure, he's doing it relatively calmly too, with ease. You gotta hand it to him, and if he wins the Nobel Peace Prize, he will deserve it way more than Obama, who just got his for being black,\" a prominent Capitol Hill commentator revealed about the whole fiasco.   \n",

Psychologist Miriam Levy, has analysed Markle's actions and dressing tactics to evaluate how the actress has taken on the role of the former Princess Diana. \"Markle is a self-confessed Diana-phile and has even taken on the benevolent role of the former princess by imitating her mannerisms and dressing style to a tee. She knows this is key to keeping the inner child persona of Prince Harry happy, and safe. Psychopaths and narcissists know that they must adhere to a certain image for their mark, and as Markle has no true feelings for Harry, she is using his desire to get his mother back, by imitating his mother. \"Narcissists and schizoid personalities like Meghan Markle do not feel like normal humans, they can only imitate, and this is why Markle meticulously studied Princess Diana as a teenager onwards. She has read every book, analysed every piece of footage to act like and become her vision of Princess Diana. At the end of this, Markle's Diana-persona is flawed because it does not come from true feelings or emotions, unlike Diana who was a real person with real emotions. \"This is why Meghan Markle, who does not have real human emotions can easily erase people from her life once they have fulfilled their role. When meeting a person for the first time, Markle immediately sees the person's weaknesses and evaluates what use that person can be for them in social climbing circles. If they have no value for her, she immediately moves on to someone who does. She will use her mark up completely until they have nothing left to give, then move on to her next mark. \"With the unfortunate Harry, who is truly a broken person, Markle fills in the gaps of his broken personality, imitating his mother, and it is this fear of losing his 'mother' for a second time that is keeping him imprisoned under this controlling woman's claws. One thing controlling narcissistic personalities do to their marks is remove them from their own families and environments, because this way they have more control over their prey. This is what Markle has done to Harry, and she is even using her Diana-personality to make the Royal Family the enemy, as was the case later on with Diana before she died tragically in a tunnel in Paris. Cults also utilise the same technique on their followers, to remove them from their families, and long term friends as a better way to control these poor people. \"My evaluation is dire for Harry, because he is completely under the spell of this charlatan woman who has conspired meticulously to use him, and his royal title, and his money to increase her own narcissistic self to higher levels. Markle has also recently tied the prince into a vast property in America, which he has been forced to payroll with his trust fund money, adding to the shackles of this false marriage, where he is not only trapped emotionally, but monetarily, standing to lose everything to Markle once she pulls the trigger. The reason Markle chose California specifically is because the divorce laws are heavily in favour of women, and many men in marriages lose over 90% of their wealth in divorce settlements. There may come a time when Harry realises what is happening, he probably sub-consciously knows what Markle is doing to him, and feels an internal resentment. He will be a lost soul for decades unless he somehow extricates himself from this manipulating unfeeling schizoid actress, who will of course dump him faster than a brick, when he wakes up to her tricks.\"   \n",

                                          Every day is a special day in Meghan Markle land, where she, appointed by absolutely no one, has taken it upon herself to lecture the masses on how to do things the 'right' way. Living in a grotesquely vulgar Californian McMansion that creates a vast carbon footprint on the earth, and a private jet lifestyle spewing huge amounts of carbon gases into the atmosphere is of course of no concern to this vile goblin creature. \"Oh you must reduce your carbon footprint,\" the creature from the black lagoon bleats to others whilst revelling in a life of excess and insane extravagance that many could only dream about. If this ghastly parasitic harridan actually cared about the ecological well-being of the planet, would she and Harry not be living in some Canadian forest off-grid teepee or yurt? We are now getting daily lectures and being 'ordered' to vote for Biden, as opposed to Trump, that's all well and good, however last we heard, we live in a fucking democracy and it is up to the mind of the voter to make their own minds up. To be ordered by some jumped up self-appointed ambassador to the world on who to vote for, what to think, and how to express yourself online is enough to bring a jet of projectile vomit up, and vote for Trump! Meghan Markle, the self-appointed ruler of the globe is now the voice everyone hears daily, lecturing about some eco/feminist/anti-capitalist/Marxist issue that is frankly getting old very fucking quickly. Why don't you just live your hypocrisy filled champagne socialist deluxe carbon-spewing life in the Californian sun paid for by the British taxpayer and leave us all alone? To hear that same-old moaning condescending voice ordering people how to think and do things makes people hate Meghan even more intensely than they already do. One only has to read the comments section of any news item where the 'voice of the people' has shat, and you will see the utter hatred for this narcissistic piece of detritus. As for Harry, yes you keep telling us you have 'mental' problems. How about getting some private clinical help instead of constantly telling everyone about your mental illness. Try thinking for yourself as well sometimes and do not follow that old mangy ball wacker you were tricked into marrying without question or thought. Everyone knows you have mental problems, but damn it boy, have some fucking decorum. Does the sun shine out of Meghan Markle's bony ass? Does Harry have to wear a pair of sunglasses when he lifts her skirt? No! The world does not revolve around you, Meghan Markle, and the more we hear your tedious droning fake voice, and see your fake plastic smile, the more hatred you create in this world. Maybe that's what you want to do, create conflict and negative feeling, because if you just stayed in your fucking grotesque mansion and SHUT THE FUCK UP, there would be less hate in this world. People are sick of being lectured by you and your little boy — Harry.   \n",

urinating in the lavish gardens of their new mansion in Santa Barbara. According to the new book, Harry first thought she was the girl for him when on African safari, Meghan pissed outside in the bush. \"We were having dinner brought to us by the black servants on our taxpayer paid African safari. To our astonishment, Meghan calmly got up mid meal, excused herself, pulled her trousers and knickers down in front of everyone and proceeded to piss on the ground next to the tent leaving a large trail of steaming hot urine. That's when I knew I was in love, and this girl was a keeper,\" Harry was quoted in the book 'Fine Whine and Freedom'. It seems because Harry was so enamoured by Meghan's pissantics, she cannot use any of the 16 bathrooms any more, instead trying to impress the former prince at every turn by peeing in the garden. The Mexican gardener employed by Meghan and Harry, however is not so impressed. \"It's acid, and very spicy pH value ruining the grass and plants. How am I supposed to do my fucking job? Crazy gringos going around chinga pis all over the place! They paying me plata so I gotta deal with it!\" The $18.6 million dollar mansion comes with a $6.5 million yearly running cost, not including a yearly security cost of $12.4 million. The carbon footprint for the mansion and its running per annum is vast and is the equivalent of a small town's carbon footprint, polluting the atmosphere and earth with more irreparable damage. Factor in the weekly private jet trips to exotic locations, and we can see why the earth is so close to destruction with global warming. But, at least Meghan is saving on flushing because she pisses in the garden, so that's her contribution to reducing the carbon footprint, in other words, as useful as a fart in a hurricane.   \n",

and Friedrich Engels – were avowed racists who not only resented 'lazy' Mexicans but thought black people were closer to animals in opposition to the highly evolved biological nature of white people. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\" Isn't it ironic to see the communist flags flying at ANTIFA and BLM protests/riots and to hear the idiotic sputum spewing coming from one of the BLM founders, Cullors, that she is a trained Marxist is additionally hilarious to behold? Have these morons not read Das Kapital or any of the letters that Marx wrote to Engels where blatantly racist statements against blacks and Mexicans are casually bandied about? The proof of the pudding is in the eating, BLM and ANTIFA are replete with illiterate idiots who have not even bothered to read the literature of their supposed heroes that they tout at every opportunity. Writing to Engels, in reference to his socialist political competitor Ferdinand Lassalle, Karl Marx wrote: Engels equally expressed Marx's racial language and disdain when describing the qualities of 'n*ggers' holding qualities closer to the animal kingdom than highly evolved whites. In 1887, Paul Lafargue, who was Marx's son-in-law, was a candidate for a council seat in a Paris district that contained a zoo. Engels racially commented that Lafargue was tainted by \"one-eighth or one-twelfth n*gger blood.\" In a letter to Lafargue's wife, Engels wrote: It seems communists are just as racist as their opposite in the political spectrum — the fascists. Both ideologies are extremities of the political frequency, and have condemned 100s of millions of people to death. Whoever is really pulling the strings of BLM and ANTIFA behind the scenes must be giggling their ass off every day. I mean you are getting these people to supposedly protest against racism and do it in the name of Karl Marx, who is probably laughing his ass off in hell as well. Useful idiots or not, the BLM mobs have been taken for fools in the most embarrassing way. What about Chinese Maoist communists, they love black people, right? Sure they do, that's why Africans are denied entry into restaurants or hotels, and treated worse than animals in Guangzhou province. So, why do ANTIFA and BLM hold the Chinese communist flag up high? It's quite obvious that they are manned by stupid people who do not know what they are doing, whilst all the while, the Chinese communists are laughing at them. Frankly, it's embarrassing that these supposedly 'anti-racism' groups have adopted heroes and political systems created and run by avowed racists. One can only conclude that BLM and ANTIFA are sham organisations and anyone who supports these groups does not know who is truly pulling the strings behind the scenes, using misguided ill-educated people as pawns in a way bigger game than they can ever comprehend. Somehow, despite the evidence, it is highly unlikely we are ever going to witness a Karl Marx statue being toppled by BLM or ANTIFA mobs any time soon.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The trials and tribulations of a former first lady are probably far-reaching and complex, and it is this complexity we can see in Michelle Obama, a woman who once had it all but now is a mere footnote in history. Gone are the $80 million vacations paid for by the predominantly white taxpayer, the thrill of taking 'whitey' for every penny by using Air Force One to fly to Africa and back on a whim are now a distant memory. Michelle's famous Spanish holiday with about 60 hangers-on cost the American taxpayer in excess of $120 million, staying in the most lavish hotels and taking up whole wings for her massive entourage. Michelle has thus been relegated to making vomitus saccharine 'woke' propaganda programs for the Netflix streaming service, and listening to Barack go on and on about his amazing achievements whilst in office. There's only so much one can listen to someone talk about gay reforms and transgender issues. Michelle himself, is happily transgender, and has had enough of all the controversy surrounding something that for her is quite routine. She simply wants to move on from this divisive issue that has even brought pain onto socialist darlings like J.K. Rowling. \"We need to move on from these distinctions. I am a woman, even though the length and girth of my cock is three times that of Barack's. He always teases me about that in bed, but I always show him who is boss later on. I competed in the ladies shot put contest last year in Arkansas with the Clintons on vacation. Hillary could barely pick the ball up, and dropped it on her toe crushing it like a pretzel. I on the other hand threw the steel ball so far, it took 15 minutes walk to recover the thing. Let's say I won the prize that time, much to the chagrin of the other ladies. Sore losers much?\" What could possibly be causing this depression in Michelle, especially after she achieved so much during her tenure as first lady in the White House? Psychologist, Megan Malarkey, revealed her theory on the depressed state of Michelle Obama: \"Depression comes in many forms, and I believe Michelle is simply depressed because of the loss of power and using other people's money. Imagine being ferried everywhere in limousines, helicopters and Air Force One and then it all suddenly stops. The huge vacations where she brought all her friends, relatives and cleaned out luxury hotels of their silver, bath towels and bibles. Those days are all gone, and Michael misses it all. It's a sort of sentimental depression, much like remembering a really enjoyable vacation but eventually coming back to reality and your old boring life. I suggest that Michelle starts taking drugs to counteract the depression, cocaine and maybe a little meth would pick her spirits up just fine. She needs uppers, no opioids though, they're downers.\" Whatever happens to Michelle in the future is up to her, and only her. Cheer up Michael, look forward to a positive future.   \n",

The amount of fear that black people now generate as well as hatred is encompassed in a political campaign that sought to completely derail Western capitalism, law and order and install Marxist principles aligned with communist political ideology. \"Black people in the West are now more despised than any other minority group, and there has been an increased polarisation of black people, unfortunately, many of African descent are not aligned with BLM Marxism but are now tarred with the same brush,\" an observer of the group revealed on Friday. There has also been an increase of the phenomenon of 'White Flight' where those of European descent are fleeing American and British cities blighted by riots, anarchy and socialist politicians who virtue signal and kowtow to BLM agitators/Marxist revolutionaries. As mentioned before, the hierarchy of BLM are not only funded and advised by Chinese Communist operators within the United States, as a form of destabilisation, but their ultimate goal is to lay the seeds of Marxism and Maoism within the U.S. as a precursor to possible invasion by China in the future. Infiltration of Chinese operatives also extends to the U.K. with many prominent socialist politicians being paid off by the CCP, to influence British politics for the benefit of China's power grab within business. China knows that there is an element of racism in the West, and it has used these groups like BLM and ANTIFA as a tool for destabilisation. First they find the weakness of the West, then they exploit that weakness for their own good. The Chinese controllers and propaganda experts want the American people to hate their own heritage, to topple statues, and to form a Cultural Revolution with mass censorship and banning of American patriotic people. Americans are made to feel bad about what they are, and this is a successful outcome for the CCP. The consumerist brands, and businesses who are backing groups like BLM and ANTIFA, are not doing this out of ideological necessity, but they have huge market shares in China, and through greed, they fall into line with the communists. The Chinese market for these brands is so huge, that it would cause a serious dent in their market share if they went against their Chinese masters in any way. The first wave of attack was the China Virus, which not only killed off many Western civilians, but destabilised the Western economy to a point of near collapse. The second wave of attack, orchestrated by China, and communist financiers, was the BLM riots and looting, as well as occupation of zones within U.S. cities. The Third Wave of attack will possibly be a second wave of virus from China, which will completely decimate the U.S. workforce and cripple the economy, creating a Great Depression and further internal social unrest. The major plan by the CCP and Chinese military is to eventually land their forces via air and sea on American and European soil, to eviscerate the land of its population, then to re-inhabit the land with Chinese nationals. China's land is polluted, and the population is so large, they are effectively running out of space. To survive, China has to expand their land base, and the West is the ideal spot chosen by the Chinese hierarchy within the Communist Party. The Big Tech monopoly companies have already aligned their positions, and their censorship policies with the Chinese Communist Party, as have groups like BLM, and ANTIFA, who are preparing the ground for a future invasion. These useful-idiots will be summarily erased once the Chinese come in, and they have outdone their usefulness. It is the policy of Communist insurgents to kill off those that help them achieve power, because they know full well that those elements could become a threat in the future. This is why, groups like BLM and ANTIFA, and their supporters will be murdered in cold blood once they have completed their jobs. The same applies to the Western Big Tech companies, which will be dissolved and their employees unceremoniously erased. Either Western leaders wake up, and completely dissolve groups like BLM and ANTIFA, designating them as internal terrorist groups, and rein in the power of Big Tech conglomerates, then the final days of Western hegemony will be over, as China sweeps in. The first assaults could be simultaneously taking parts of India, then Taiwan, sweeping through to Australia and New Zealand. Hong Kong has already fallen. Once the Chinese army take over these areas, they will speed on to Europe and America, landing their forces much like in the 1984 film Red Dawn. Citizens who are captured will be put into Chinese camps for re-education in Maoism and communism. Much like what the Chinese are doing to the Uighur people in China, many will be forced to learn Chinese, and brainwashed, as well as the women forced to be sterilized. Those who do not comply, will simply be neutralised, and the incinerators will work day and night until communist order is achieved. At the end of all of this, the poor black people will realise how much they have been played, manipulated, and for what? Nothing. Once their usefulness has come and gone, this hated element of humanity will join those in the Chinese incinerators.   \n",

 Marxist groups for the Soviet Cultural Revolution of America have called for the great American presidents on Mount Rushmore to be replaced with the faces of Tarana Burke (founder of #MeToo) and Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi (founders of Black Lives Matter). \"We are petitioning the Lakota tribe elders, who really own the land on which Mount Rushmore resides to clear the racist presidents from the sculpture. Mount Rushmore will then be re-named Mount Black Lives Matter Me Too,\" a prominent BLM activist revealed in the LA Times, today. Mount Rushmore National Memorial is centred on a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore in the Black Hills in Keystone, South Dakota, United States. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum created the sculpture's design and oversaw the project's execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot (18 m) heads of Presidents George Washington (1732–1799), Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), and Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865), as recommended by Borglum. The four presidents were chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation. If the extremist movements of Black Lives Matter and #MeToo have their way, one of the greatest monuments to America's magnificence as a nation will be desecrated. \"We would first dynamite the faces off the four racist presidents, then have our sculptors refashion the stone to sculpt the faces of Tarana Burke, Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi. We may even add in a few statues of Xi Jingping, Karl Marx, Stalin, and Chairman Mao,\" a prominent BLM spokesperson revealed. So far, there has been little or no resistance from the current U.S. administration to the proposals from BLM, and domestic terrorist group ANTIFA, to desecrate the Mount Rushmore monument. With little or no resistance, plans are afoot to start the Talibanizing of the existing sculpture in mid-August.   \n",

The same thing is happening in many Western countries now, this time the BLM, are dehumanizing and humiliating white people, portraying them as inherently inferior and evil, just as the Nazis did to the Jews in WW2. One must always remember, the fascist political ideology utilised by the Nazis was a form of leftist socialism, seeing as the Nazi movement was called National Socialism. Also take into account that the techniques used by the Marxist communists and fascists are very similar, as one extremity borrows from the other. This is what BLM and ANTIFA, today have adopted is a form of reverse-racism, which actually is overt racism, but lauded as 'anti-racism' by the controlling media who support these evil groups populated by useful idiots and the ideologically entrenched. The Jews were blamed for every ill of the Germanic people by the Nazis, BLM are doing the same by blaming every white person for the ills of black people. To see white Americans socially forced to kneel today in reverence of Black Lives Matter and whites demonized as an evil, inferior race is the exact technique the Nazis utilised in Germany against the Jews. White people in America are effectively being dehumanized, and many of the socialist leaning amongst them are actually believing the propaganda that is being pumped out by the BLM controllers. Many are now ashamed of being who they are, and apologise profusely for the crime of having white skin, they are now part of the BLM machinery of racial hatred. Adolf Hitler once said: Through the technique of repetition utilising certain symbolic images, the BLM movement is doing the same thing about white people, and this is the crux of the matter, the BLM are using Nazi propaganda techniques on a supposed anti-racist program, by actually being racist towards white people. The Nazi National Socialist techniques of dehumanization are thus being utilised by BLM adjutants and their officers on white people to denigrate them to a status well below the level of black people. The looting and rioting of white businesses and shops by BLM and ANTIFA thugs was a replication of the Nazi SA paramilitary forces destruction of Jewish businesses on Kristallnacht (The night of broken glass) where the German authorities looked on without intervening, just as the American police were told to stand down during the Minneapolis and Los Angeles riots recently. The only difference between the Nazis and BLM/ANTIFA is that the Nazis were at the time in charge of the government of Germany, and the early years of the regime were a precursor for the Final Solution on the Jews. Although it may seem that BLM/ANTIFA are in charge at the moment, they are still not part of the government and do not have powers to take things further on white people. The worrying thing is, at the November 2020 elections, if Trump loses, and the Democrats win, then groups like BLM will effectively be in power, and will have carte blanche to move a step closer to the mass murder or genocide of white Americans. Such is BLM's ultimate goal it seems, the eventual eradication of white Americans, it is no secret that groups like ANTIFA who are now officially registered as domestic terrorists, are training their ranks for a takeover, and extermination of the majority of the white population.

addict, who robbed a terrified pregnant woman, beating her over the head with a pistol, George Floyd, will be sainted by the Pope in Minneapolis in July, the Vatican has revealed. All across American Democrat run cities, white people have been told, they must from now on kneel whenever they see an African American, or any black person. \"Our police are kneeling now for black people, so every citizen will be asked to kneel whenever they encounter a black person of colour as well,\" the Mayor of Los Angeles said whilst kneeling. Many white people in Los Angeles have purchased knee pads because of the amount of kneeling they have to do to black people wherever they go. Walking down a 200-metre stretch on the sidewalk for a white citizen can now take up to four hours because the amount of times they have to stop in front of a black person, get on their knee and apologise. Jeanette Colman, a self flagellating bleeding heart virtue signalling liberal from Malibu, revealed how the sainthood of George Floyd had affected her: \"We now have a shrine for Saint George Floyd, we kneel in front of it and pray to him every day, even though we are atheist Marxists. I spend much of my time on my knees apologising to black people for my white privilege, just thinking of the horror our Saint George must have gone through when he violently beat the pregnant woman and robbed her of her last bit of money. Saint George could do no wrong, as he kicked her in the stomach before he left with the woman's money. She was white and deserved it. Black lives matter, and Saint George Floyd, praise be to you, I drink champagne in your honour!\" Pope Francis will be coming to liberal American cities blighted by racial tension to administer the sainthood on Apostle George Floyd in late July.   \n",

These predominantly bourgeois white groups are using African American anger, as cannon fodder for their push to destabilise America from within. By putting African Americans at the front of the riots and looting, they command from the rear, and utilise Alinsky-ite techniques to cause as much damage to America as possible. Along with Big Tech companies like Facebook who are complicit with China, and the ideology of communism, there has been a vast underground push by the CCP working through America's campuses and social media companies like Zuckerberg's Facebook to subvert democracy, and freedom of speech in favour of Chinese communist ideology, utilising the Confucius Institutes embedded within American education institutions. These Chinese government-sponsored outposts of culture and language training, are insidious portals where communism is pushed onto the American youth, and the faculty teaching professionals. There are currently more than 100 universities in the United States now in direct partnership with the Chinese government through Confucius Institutes, the U.S. intelligence community is warning about their potential as spying outposts. Americanism, and democracy, as well as the tenets of free speech are being wiped out, whilst dissent against the U.S. government is being encouraged by the Chinese communist agents working within the American system. \"Black Lives Matter, and ANTIFA, as well as all young people rioting and looting, causing a state of chaos are engineered under the wing of the Chinese Communist Party, and their operatives working directly in the United States, along with the monopoly tech companies to destabilise the U.S. government and eventually cause mass civil unrest across the nation. These Chinese operatives are working in America right now, organising riots, and brainwashing American youth in communism,\" one source revealed. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently revealed his findings on the Chinese infiltration: \"Their goal is to exploit America's academic freedom to instill in the minds of future leaders a pro-China viewpoint. \"It's smart. It's a long-term, patient approach.\" Peter Mattis, a former U.S. intelligence analyst now with the Jamestown Foundation, said Confucius Institutes can be directly linked to the Communist Party's \"united front\" efforts, still described in Maoist terms: to mobilize the party's friends to strike at the party's enemies. Liu Yandong, the Communist Party official who launched the Confucius Institutes and served as chairwoman, was the head of the United Front Work Department when the program began. It's not only the Maoist communist ideology that is being spewed in American universities, it is the money from China that is pouring in to sweeten up the institutions. Prominent American university, Harvard, itself received more a $1 Billion from China. President Barack Obama, built up this program of Chinese infiltration throughout his tenure, and the likes of Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, who is an avowed communist, who speaks fluent Chinese, and regularly meets with his CCP masters in Beijing, allegedly works hand in hand with the enemies of America to subvert democratic ideology, and freedom of speech. The massive censorship of American viewpoints regarding democracy, conservative /Libertarian thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression and the right to bear arms are key examples. Will America wake up one day from their Chinese stupor? Will people one day reclaim their American rights of democracy and freedom of speech? Will America one day wake up after being infiltrated by China for so many decades? Hopefully, that day will one day come, and the Chinese threat will be eviscerated, and banished, because Communism is insidious, it gets under the skin, it brainwashes American kids, it implants hatred against being American, and the basic tenets of democracy — FREEDOM!   \n",

do have regrets in life, and it is testament to the enduring qualities of Harry, stripped of his medals in the army, and his royal status, all because he had a moment of momentary madness, and followed this woman who controlled him so well to the un-royal city of Los Angeles, where the soulless grid streets all lead to nowhere in particular. \"I used to hang around thousand-year-old palaces steeped in history, have proper English butlers, shoot pheasants, and in the evenings have anything including any young filly delivered to my quarters to be pumped with vigour. Now I am a civilian underling to an ageing humourless Z list actress who is obsessed by herself, and orders me around as if I am one of nana's Corgis, there are no palaces here in the soulless cocaine fuelled environs of Los Angeles, just bland Starbucks and fake plastic people with their faces stretched behind their ears, and their pig's anus resembling trout lips, puckered to the point of absurdity,\" the woeful former royal lamented to his friends. The former prince yearns for the fresh breeze of the rolling green hills of England, the quaint pubs, the polo, his friends and brother and the cheers of Twickenham, as well as the considered sarcastic comments of royal discourse, which is non-existent to the clueless politically correct Yanks. Meghan whose chief expertise is in fellatio, due to her apprenticeship over many years of shitty low-end showbiz jobs, has only this skill to her name, but over time, even her intricate oral technique will not be able to keep the former prince from feeling home sick. The hundreds of men she has serviced in her time can contest to her fellating skills, but her vicious narcissistic personality counteracts this very attribute. One friend revealed: \"Harry is so bored of it all. He is now surrounded by American socialists, who can be even more intoxicating than the British sort, mainly because of their extreme champagne swilling PC hypocrisy and constant sappy victimhood. The Hollywood set are about as shallow and vapid as a Death Island episode. One mention of shooting a grouse, and they all huddle in the corner crying like babies and pointing fingers.\"   \n",

      Former royal, Meghan Markle is appealing for the coronavirus pandemic to be ended, or put on hold because it is messing with her headlines and PR campaigns. Having no qualms about abandoning her own family and 72-year-old father who had two heart attacks, it is not surprising that Meghan does not care much for the people dying from coronavirus. \"The headlines are not about me, Meghan Markle, instead they are about this awful pandemic, about old people dying, I mean who fucking cares about them? These old people are taking away my headlines, just let 'em go. Then it's about coronavirus masks, and food bank queues, and corona this, corona that! There's nothing about my new foundation Archehole, or my new initiative to slow global warming by stitching up elephant assholes so their farts do not damage the ozone layer.\" Harry and Meghan, who claim they left the UK because of press intrusion, are now even more distraught that the press have got better things to report than the gimmie dat couple who just 'take, take, take'. One of Meghan's aides revealed in secret that the atmosphere is very tense in the Harry and Meghan household. \"She orders the servants to rearrange the furniture every two hours, and is so irritated by the coronavirus headlines that whenever someone on TV starts talking about the virus, she shouts at the top of her voice about how great Meghan is, and how she is going to save the world. Meghan is now writing affirmations with her third sharpie all over the walls of the rented villa in Los Angeles where she is in lockdown with poor Harry and Archie.\" In desperation, Meghan Markle is actually thinking of phoning up Donald Trump, who she. hates, and demanding he halts the pandemic immediately, so she can get some headlines once again.   \n",

Meghan, who have recently moved to Los Angeles, are setting up a new organisation called Archehole. In a statement, they said \"We are fed up of the global COVID-19 pandemic taking up our precious publicity but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how the Archehole commodity came to be\". The former Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their royal titles at the end of last month, allowing Meghan to resume her z-list career in acting, and have trademarked their own son to make money off selling cheaply produced tat to their deluded, deranged anti-royal fans. In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on sponging off rich billionaires for the next few months while developing a new future organisation, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. The Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. Despite thousands of people dying and millions losing their jobs worldwide, Meghan has been absolutely distraught that she has been off the headlines, and this is why during the pandemic, she is now bombing the news with her latest money making venture — Archehole. The name Archehole combined an ancient word for strength and action, with another that \"evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon through our assholes\". \"We have launched Archehole during a global pandemic because as narcissists we cannot be out of the news for more than two weeks plus we need some fucking money sharpish,\" they said. C'mon peasants, you may be dying of COVID-19 and have lost everything you have, but you must now pay up your last remaining pennies to Harry and Meghan.   \n",

                                                            When it comes to something like the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to understand that in these situations, we have to look at who ultimately benefits from this global virus. One has to remember that global solutions need global problems, and the element of fear is always a conduit for certain powers to gain even more power, simply because when the population is gripped with extreme fear, anything brought upon them will be accepted without question. Things like Brexit, Donald Trump and other so-called populist victories are not something that pleases the global overlords, or China for that matter. China took the initial hit to absolve themselves of blame — the perfect alibi. As the stock markets plummet daily, the liberals in America lick their lips and salivate, because this is their dream for Trump to be seen as failing in the economy, something he was doing well on before the coronavirus hysteria hit the markets. Unfortunately, the Teflon Don may see his big lead falter soon, simply because he always only references the US Dow 30 as a measure of success. The Dow is not the complete picture on gauging the state of the economy, but because of Trump, that is what is focused on, and with 1,000 point daily falls, the socialist Americans are loving every moment. Populism, nationalism, Trump, Boris Johnson, Bolsonaro, Brexit, the U.S. Election, these are things the globalists never wanted, therefore this is why the timing is very telling for the coronavirus. Big tech companies are actively censoring any adverts for masks, and people are being told to simply get infected and die, be a good useless eater and just fucking disappear. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology of the future is pretty much upon us, yet there is a profound problem for those who are in charge of this technology and have developed it for their masters — it is the population — they do not need the majority any more, especially after they have all already profited hugely from them. The globalist/environmentalist controllers are the ones who have benefited most from this virus pandemic, and to them, the death of 90% of the population is a small price to pay for their robotic future, where they will simply print money by adding as many zeroes as they want on their consoles to replenish their wealth, and to enjoy a future of extreme luxury and extended life. They will calmly tell you 'Do Not Panic!' whilst wishing you die quickly. The Singularity will come, but it will be after the old conservative guard have been purged. As Obama puts it 'the old white men', who somehow thwarted his hermaphrodite homosexual orgiastic dream last time around. This time however, the virus will no doubt kill these over sixties off, and bring in a new age for the young Marxist indoctrinated youth to savour. Cui bono? It is the globalist communist China loving controllers every time..Greta Thunberg is literally having a deep orgasm at the mere thought of it all...Soros is loving every moment...the Bilderbergers are joyous...the tech power nerds click clacking their keyboards..and the hidden ones...ebullient...   \n",

farewell, Meghan Markle, the former Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that Harry gets the shakes and is suffering from PTRD (Post Traumatic Royal Disorder). \"It usually happens at night. Harry will wake up shouting and sweating like a Catholic priest at a choir boys convention. The sweat is horrible, and he's shaking like a leaf. \"I then ask him if it was THAT dream again. He always answers 'yes'. \"It's always the same dream, he's at Sandringham, and the whole Windsor family are sitting around the dinner table. Harry is presented with an exquisite feast, and he tentatively asks for the salt. One of the many butlers brings him some salt and even sprinkles his food with it, except he keeps going, then Harry tells the butler 'that's enough!' but he keeps on pouring the salt until his food is completely submerged. \"As the salt keeps coming, more and more, Harry looks down and his nose is just above the salt, he can't breathe, the salt rises further, all he can hear is everyone laughing, guffawing, blackness, suffocation — and this is when Harry always wakes up!\" What does this recurring nightmarish dream mean? Countless psychiatrists are trying to cure the poor former prince, but he goes through psychiatrists like a chain smoker goes through lighters. It has got to such a bad state that Harry now sleeps in a separate room and Meghan sleeps with Archie, which she prefers.   \n",

resembles a tragic play worthy of Shakespeare or an operatic masterpiece from another era. Will Harry ever forgive this odious power mad manipulative commoner who ruined his royalty, who put a stain on his image that will probably never be removed? Meghan, with her constant gleeful fake smile parades her power over the lowly, weak, Harry with a commanding authority much like a pig farmer parades their prize breed boar through the stalls of an auction house. Harry's life will from now on be a sad shadow of his previous one, and it's all down to the emasculating, vindictive monster he has been fooled into mating with. Nothing to lose Meghan gained everything while Harry, who had so much, gave up everything, for little or no return. One royal fan from the crowd observing, quipped, \"Be careful with whom you stick your winky into 'arry, for it can affect your whole life, drastically for the worse, as you're seeing now. The initial buzz of the first time lust always dies down.\" \"Meghan and her Croydon facelift does not care about Archie, otherwise she would have brought him along on the trip to England for the final appearance, and she vindictively used the child's absence as a way of punishing Her Majesty, the Queen. Withholding grandchildren to punish, is an oft used technique by parents with a stick to whack,\" one angry woman said from the sidelines of the abbey. The service at Westminster Abbey in honour of the Commonwealth was most certainly marred by the antics and idiosyncrasies of the Firm, something well documented over the decades. In years to come, or maybe sooner, Harry will resent this woman who took him away from his beloved army mates, his brother, from his country, and from his family, and from the sprawling palaces, the shooting grounds, the rolling hills of England, the Pomp and Circumstance, gone now, a distant memory with only vast straight grid roads and fast food restaurants to look at in his new environs. Harry, always the runt of the litter, had a reprieve from his status before he met Meghan, and was hugely popular with the public, but now he is back to being the runt, and of course, he is now married/imprisoned to a grand – – – -!   \n",

          Disney executives who are being begged by Harry and Meghan's agent to give her a role in a superhero film, or anything that comes up, are so fed up that they might just have a plank of wood on screen to represent the former Duchess of Sussex. \"She can't act, has zero charisma, and is a foul using bitch who has zero endearing qualities, plus has a very negative image in the public's eyes. We just went to Home Depot and bought a plank of plywood, that will be her,\" Gus Van Horten, senior studio producer told CNN. It would be a win win situation for the film studio because the plank of wood costs about $19.99 as opposed to some horrific sum pushed by Meghan's deluded agent. \"The plank of wood will have more presence and acting skills than Meghan Markle, who was a Z list anyway,\" another Disney producer revealed. The former royal couple are currently holed up in Vancouver, Canada staying as a guest of a Kremlin connected Russian businessman. Meghan Markle is signed up to visit Britain for the last time before embarking on her Hollywood 'career'. Meghan Markle is detested with such vehemence in Britain that many use her name when they step in a dog shit.   \n",

Harry and Meghan lied about wanting to step back from public life, this was the main reason stipulated for leaving the royal family and UK. If they wanted a quiet life, why are they conducting massive PR moves in North America, launching vast website campaigns, trademarking the 'Sussex Royal' name, getting paid vast sums of money by bankers for speeches and courting the paparazzi at every juncture? Global domination is something at the heart of Meghan's modus operandi. Psychologist, Miriam Humbole, has analysed this dangerous woman and her vitriolic vendetta against a 1,000-year institution. \"Essentially, Meghan Markle fuels her schizoid narcissistic ego every time she sees a headline about her vendetta against the British monarchy, simply because it makes her sound more important, especially when it is perceived that she is running rings around the Windsor family. Meghan left Britain for North America in a huff because she was not the centre of attention all the time, and her exile was more about power play than anything else. \"Meghan's sole focus right now is to make as much money as she can, and she will do this in the ruse of 'charity funding'. The key factor is to 'virtue signal' for charity, rake in cash, give about 2% to the actual cause, and keep the rest. This pump and dump strategy along with the paid speeches, as well as paid Oprah-like appearances will bring in millions, in order for Meghan Markle to maintain her lavish lifestyle. \"The former Duchess of Sussex was never royal, but she knows she will have to use her son Archie to peddle for more money, and Harry who has royal blood. Markle does not in any way feel love for the former prince, and is only using him as a cash cow, which she will eventually discard for someone that actually turns her on. Conniving Meghan has a very good reason for leaving the UK, and extricating prince Harry — for a start, North American divorce laws will give her a majority stake in the upcoming divorce. Furthermore, the poor naive prince has been taken out of his comfort zone, he now has no advisors who really look out for him, and he has been taken away from the people who genuinely liked and cared for him. Psychologically, this will leave him even more vulnerable, and this is what Meghan is counting on, she wants him to act up, she wants him to be out of his depth as he realises how far he has fallen from grace and status, because that's when she will tighten the final screws, plotting with her calculating mother, she will get her way, soon. \"We can only feel a great sadness and sorrow for prince Harry right now, as he will soon find out what the true repercussions are for marrying this evil conniving money grabbing grifter and her skin whitening concoctions, who actually detests black people in reality, but uses the race card at every opportunity. The only reason one whitens the skin from its actual dark state, is because you detest your own skin, as Meghan does. It is only a matter of time, how long can Meghan Markle keep up the charade of 'loving' Harry when she can barely stand him day in day out? Eventually, she will reveal the true Meghan to Harry, which is a cold, loveless, calculating machine for greed, narcissism, power and money — nothing more.\"   \n",

father of Meghan Markle made an announcement today to the same effect. \"After deep cogitation at the ramifications of our Markle family name being dragged through the gutter, I hereby decree that the use of the 'Markle' family name be not used to market cheap plastic trinkets, socks, pyjamas and toilet brushes as proposed by Meghan and Harry after being banned by the Queen of Great Britain of using the 'Sussex Royal' name for profit.\" The Exile on Meghan Street couple who are now holed up in Canada, have already spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating a Sussex Royal website as well as patenting thousands of products they wished to sell using the trademark to make millions of dollars. This has all been shot to the ground much to the delight of the general population who vehemently detest Meghan Markle and her calculating ideas of global domination. The only thing left for the marauding ex-royal freeloaders is to now call themselves simply as 'Meghan and Harry'.   \n",

Contamination of drinking water from faeces is a critical health problem in China, as in other developing countries, that causes serious illnesses such as diarrhoea and viral hepatitis. A recent survey by UNICEF in 11 Chinese provinces found that over half of all drinking water samples contained unacceptably high levels of bacteria and viruses flourishing. According to survey data analysed by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF, about 100 million Chinese still did not have access to an improved water source in 2008, and about 460 million did not have access to improved sanitation. In China 329 million people live without access to \"at least basic sanitation\", a survey revealed in 2015. Health problems caused by the lack of safe water are exacerbated by poor sanitary conditions, especially in rural China. Traditionally, Chinese households collect human waste and transport it to the fields for use as fertilizer, often without further treatment. High level of faecal contamination in the study area was revealed by the high percentages of positive samples for norovirus and rotavirus installed in a suburb of Xi'an city, China, in 2019. Coronavirus was found in the loose stools of a woman recently in the first U.S. case in Washington state. It does not matter if Chinese people wear masks because the faecal matter in their water supply, or contaminated bottled water will infect millions of people due to the poor treatment of water, and in rural areas, open latrines. In a country where more than half its groundwater is severely polluted, what hope do the Chinese have in staving off this Coronavirus? The infected, whether showing signs of Coronavirus or incubating it are daily putting their faeces into the water system which is then processed and put out there again for more spread of the virus when people drink the water contaminated by faecal matter. In other words, the Chinese population is killing itself with its own shit!   \n",

infected, the deaths from coronavirus are being vastly misreported by the Chinese Communist State. Incinerators and mass graves have been in constant use since the outbreak, and the hospital corridors are still filling up with corpses of the infected. There are even reports of infected people being buried alive, or put into crematoriums still alive. This is a Chinese technique used with outbreaks of viruses in pigs. Many journalists have been arrested because they tried to expose the extent of the Chinese state cover up. The original journalist who filmed the video (below) with a hidden camera has since disappeared, and will probably be never seen again. The inhumane response by Communist officials is also witnessed with people whether infected or not being forcibly detained in their homes without food or water. Their doors are barricaded and their windows have bars put on them. The people, crying out for help are then abandoned to die. Human life as we already know is cheap in China, where people disappear daily to have their organs harvested for rich customers. The authorities in the West are playing down the virus, and say it only has a 2% fatality risk, however, this is because they are not receiving the proper data from China, whose authorities are not declaring the full extent of the problem, especially with all the bodies that have been incinerated without any records taken. Naturally, the Western agencies do not want to alarm the population, however, utilising false Chinese data could be more harmful in the long run. If there is to be any real way of tackling this virus, it would need total transparency from the Chinese authorities as to the true extent of the virus infection, and recorded deaths, however it is doubtful that this will ever happen.   \n",

EU on the 31 January 2020. The propulsion and mass of Remainer tears will be used by power stations across Britain to generate millions of kilowatts of electricity powering homes up and down the breadth of Great Britain. \"I'll put a cuppa on. Kettle's boiling on the power of Remainer tears. Wahey! Got Brexit Done! Have some crumpets with your tea!\" If you're watching Eastenders or Love Island, your telly will be powered by the Remoaning flood of tears from the insufferable pathetic Remainers who just can't get over the EU Referendum result even after three long years and three fucking prime ministers. Plug your chainsaw in and go round your Remainer neighbour's house with an extension lead in tow, why not carve up their wardrobe in the style of the goddess Britannia, or their kitchen table in the shape of the British Isles. As you pour another whisky, sit back and watch the news reports of Britain leaving the EU, smile like a Cheshire cat, put your feet up, snuggle your toes, and giggle insanely as you realise all of this is being powered by the sorrowful tears of Remainers. With the rate that lot are crying, there will be no chance of power outages for years.   \n",
