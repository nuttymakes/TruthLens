    "# TruthLens - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "TruthLens is a project developed for the BSc. Computer Science (Data Science) Final Project (CM3070) at the University of London. TruthLens is based on the Fake News Detection template. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a two-stage pipeline for misinformation classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binary classification (Stage 1): Distinguish between real news and misinformation using the ISOT dataset. This ensures robust detection at the first stage, leveraging an established dataset.\n",
    "2. Multi-class classification (Stage 2): Further classify content identified as misinformation into one of seven categories, based on Molina et al.’s taxonomy. A custom dataset will support this nuanced classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is limited to text-based, English language content, explicitly excluding images and videos. A user interface will also be developed, enabling users to input articles or URLs and receive classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to enhance the explainability of classification results, aiming to provide users with interpretable insights into why content was classified in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims for high accuracy and reliability, with measurable performance goals. Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation and responsible dataset usage, will guide the design and implementation of the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom dataset generation\n",
    "As outlined in the previous section, the second stage of the pipeline relies upon a custom dataset, labelled with the categories from the Molina et al. Misinformation Taxonomy. These classes are summarised in the table below. The aim of this stage is to create a balanced dataset with 200 pieces of content for each of the 7 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Misinformation Type | Characteristics | Example |\n",
    "|:--------------|:---------------|:-------|\n",
    "| Fabricated content | Completely false content created with the intent to deceive.| Fake reports of events that never occurred; entirely false claims about public figures |\n",
    "|Polarised content |True events or facts presented selectively to promote a biased narrative, often omitting critical context. |Partisan news articles highlighting one side of a political argument while ignoring counterpoints.|\n",
    "|Satire |Content intended to entertain or provoke thought through humour, exaggeration, or irony. Often misunderstood. |Satirical articles from outlets like “The Onion” being shared as if they are factual news.|\n",
    "|Misreporting | Incorrect information shared unintentionally, often due to errors or lack of verification. | A news outlet incorrectly reporting election results due to early or inaccurate data.|\n",
    "|Commentary |Opinion-based content reflecting the writer’s interpretation or viewpoint, often lacking factual grounding. |Editorials or blogs expressing subjective opinions without substantial evidence.|\n",
    "|Persuasive information |Content designed to persuade or influence the audience, often including marketing and propaganda. |Politically motivated propaganda campaigns, advertisements disguised as objective news articles.|\n",
    "|Citizen journalism | User-generated content that may lack professional journalistic standards, leading to error or bias. |Social media posts about breaking news that spread unverified or incorrect details.|\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be scrapped from relevant websites for each category, then manually reviewed to ensure that it fits the category. Relevant features and labelling guidelines can be found for each category below."

Our trials with Evanovia, however, show that it now takes just one injection and within 12 hours any obese individual will start rapidly thinning before finally melting out of existence completely.” At press time, critics had warned about a rash of influencers, models, and actresses who were using the drug to vanish despite not being overweight themselves.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CHICAGO—In an act of astonishing fortitude that showed he drew upon a seemingly endless well of mystic strength, local man Anthony Palmer reportedly replied “STOP” Thursday to a political fundraiser text like a powerful wizard casting a spell to ward off a mythical beast. Sources confirmed that moments after receiving the Kamala Harris fundraising message, the accountant typed out his short reply with the certainty of one familiar with an ancient elven tongue summoning an arcane incantation known as the Shield of Thar’Ghal to protect both him and his party of halflings and dwarves from a charging monster escaped from the depths of the underworld. Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, “Begone, ye evil creature!” According to bystanders, the accountant’s fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster’s tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board</td>\n",

By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.</td>\n",

Houses just aren’t meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability.

So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann’s, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.” At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history.</td>\n",

Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.” At press time, a Gallup Poll had found that 70% of Americans opposed Biden being rescued.   \n",

But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I’m not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I’m saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?” Hartford went on to say that it might be helpful if Julia stayed at home for their next sessions so that they could spend more time understanding where, exactly, David’s hotness came from.   \n",

After that, you can sit back and collect thousands of dollars a month. How cool is that? You and your little friends are going to have so much fun building your little real estate empire. Enjoy!” At press time, sources reported Schweitz’s son was enthusiastically climbing into the tree house to serve an eviction notice to the low-income family currently living there.   \n",

With these mighty strands, I command the wildfires and the earthquakes, the droughts and the floods!” At press time, sources confirmed Newsom’s hair product had evicted several homeless people seeking shelter within the throbbing gelatinous nest upon his head.   \n",

They’ll also receive $10,000 in cash. Frankly, it’s a tragedy we’ve let these American heroes rot in their graves for this long.” Reacting to a moment in the video when MrBeast gives a reanimated World War II veteran a Lamborghini, viewers expressed outrage toward the apparent ingratitude of the undead soldier, who only screams, “Why did you do this? Kill me…kill me!” into the camera.   \n",

It’s just that your pal Cassidy can only handle so much hootin’ and hollerin’ before he plumb runs out of steam. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna kick up my spurs and snuggle up in my bedroll with a Louis L’Amour novel.” At press time, another successful train robbery had reportedly been carried out in the area by a tireless gang of extroverted outlaws.   \n",

Bush in a time of crisis, thousands of country stations across America reportedly refused to play Beyoncé’s music Thursday after the artist condemned the Iraq War. “If she doesn’t want to support our troops risking their lives out there  for the cause of freedom, then we don’t need her,” said  country radio executive Hunter Roeloffs, one of many station owners who  blacklisted the recent singles “Texas Hold ’Em” and “16 Carriages”  after controversial comments in which the star expressed reservations about the U.S.-led Coalition invasion of Iraq—remarks that also led to a reported drop in ticket  sales and Beyoncé losing a sponsorship deal with Lipton. “Unlike Miss  Knowles, we’re proud Americans here at 100.3 the Bull. We support  freedom, whether it’s here or in the Middle East. So when she says  innocent lives will be lost, I can’t help but wonder how she could  possibly think a bloodthirsty dictator like Saddam Hussein is innocent.  And then there’s that line of hers about being ashamed of President  Bush? Well, we’re ashamed of her. How about that?” At press time,  Beyoncé had attracted additional criticism from the country music scene  after rebranding herself as the Chicks.   \n",

Stab him, you cowards!” on Friday after she plunged a knife into President Joe Biden’s back. “What are you waiting for, you fools? Strike now! Strike before the opportunity goes cold!” said the blood-dappled vice president, who, as her staff appeared to grow uncertain of the blades in their shaking hands and backed away toward the exit,  reminded each panicked aide in turn that they had pledged their fealty for this day. “Think of all I’ve promised you. Think of all we stand to gain. Quick, now, the first blow has been rendered. There is no going back. We’re confederates in this. We must act now or be damned by inaction!” At press time, sources confirmed President Biden had complained to an assistant of a tightness in his shoulder and returned to the Oval Office with the knife still protruding from his back.   \n",

They see a blank slate.

Our trials with Evanovia, however, show that it now takes just one injection and within 12 hours any obese individual will start rapidly thinning before finally melting out of existence completely.” At press time, critics had warned about a rash of influencers, models, and actresses who were using the drug to vanish despite not being overweight themselves.   \n",

Many don’t even know that before Destiny’s Child, she was in a two-person jug band with her bucktoothed grandpappy, Earl Bob, in which she played a rusty washboard and slapped her knee. This is not some random new roadkill-skinning persona she’s putting on—it is absolutely genuine.” At press time, Beyoncé’s merch store had begun selling preorders for home-cooked meth.   \n",

Not that it’s about the money! It’s not! I just love what I do! The violence sexually excites me!

I was at his house once, and he actually just had money lying around, including at least $25 worth of quarters in what I can only assume was some kind of high-yield coin jar.” At press time, Reed had reportedly lost everything he had after sinking all his money into a new set of tires when his car failed inspection.   \n",

In fact, had he not had a pen and this napkin handy that fateful night, Epstein’s island, his dozens of accusers, and his large, all-powerful cabal of elite pedophiles might  never have existed.” At press time, Sotheby’s confirmed the napkin had sold for over $200 million after several of Epstein’s associates, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew got into a heated bidding war over the priceless memorabilia.   \n",

Simpson was reportedly allowed to remain alive Thursday after his coffin didn’t fit. “If the coffin doesn’t fit, you must let him live a bit.” said O.J. eulogizer Tommie Lochran, who advocated for Simpson to continue living despite evidence that the coffin had shrunk after previously getting wet. “Any DNA found in the casket that appears to be Mr. Simpson’s, I believe, was the result of contamination. It would be existential malpractice to allow Mr. Simpson to die knowing full well that this coffin was not made for him.” At press time, Simpson went on a media blitz promoting his escape from death.   \n",

Throw me!’ into his ear, and then he did. He whipped her across the grounds so easily—it was so cute. She just went soaring over the heads of everyone in the crowd.” At press time, Renny was gushing over another viral video that showed Kelce spiking Swift into the ground.   \n",

According to witnesses, the 81-year-old commander-in-chief remained quite calm during his apparent abduction by the insects, showing no signs of resistance as the swarm of approximately 2,500 black carpenter ants hoisted him over their bodies using their powerful mandibles and began marching slowly but steadily toward the White House Rose Garden. Secret Service officials confirmed that snipers stationed on the  roof of the executive mansion fired upon the swarm to no avail, reportedly because the ants’ 6-millimeter-long bodies were simply too small to target. At press time, sources said the FBI was negotiating with the ant colony’s queen for Biden’s release.   \n",

Going forward, none of our models will be outfitted with brakes. Instead, we will shift our efforts to making fart noises louder.” At press time, Tesla staffers responsible for wheels were reportedly nervous after receiving an ominous meeting request from HR.   \n",

That’s just good sportsmanship. So from now on, every chicken in our Perdue facilities will have free and easy access to firearms. We may lose some staff to gunshot wounds, but everyone involved—human or fowl—will have an opportunity to defend themselves. It’s only right.” At press time, sources confirmed a shift in the balance of power at several Perdue processing plants had resulted in thousands of employees being slaughter with assembly-line efficiency.   \n",

Ron DeSantis (R) signed a new law Thursday requiring all Florida women to produce three healthy, white sons by the date of their 22nd birthday. “The production of white daughters will not be penalized, but they will be seized by the state for the production of white sons,” said DeSantis, who clarified that regardless of the race, ethnicity, or religious background of the mother, all sons would be required to be both white and raised in a Catholic household. “Three is the bare minimum. Despite what the virtue-signaling, left-wing fanatics are espousing on CNN, this requirement is actually quite fair and attainable. Whether Florida women and girls choose to get started at age 15 or 19, they will have plenty of time to comply.” At press time, DeSantis added that a miscarriage counted as negative one white sons.   \n",

We’ll do our best to reattach the fingers that weren’t swallowed, but that isn’t going to prevent these patients from chewing them off again the next time they eat a gyro or cheesesteak.” At press time, saying they really needed something to wash down their sandwich with, several of the patients reportedly failed to  realize they were drinking the blood from their wounded hand.   \n",

It can’t be her doctrine they’re drawn to, because that is not particularly inspiring either. We know these followers would kill for her, but the question is, why?” Douglass went on to hypothesize that perhaps Swift was blackmailing her followers with sordid details of their personal lives she had obtained through fan letters.   \n",

No one could  have told me? No one? Fuck all of you. Seriously. Well, I suppose I should have learned my lesson when I tried  to speak to that scarecrow in Mozambique.” At press time, Attenborough  was spotted chewing out a flustered assistant director of photography and insisting that he  needed to delete the footage immediately.   \n",

USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction “DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian” underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it. Insiders confirmed that with the right currents and weather patterns, the chocolate-flavored meal replacement should reach Gaza by 2035, only two years after the expiration date.   \n",

Even when we try to move it around ourselves to make it even, someone keeps moving it back. It’s very frustrating.” The USGS did, however, note that the amount of fire on earth had been properly disbursed.   \n",

We do not have long before we are devoured and used as sustenance for the next generation of galactic apex predators.” At press time, a supernova had reportedly frightened the space hawk, causing it to drop Earth into a black hole.   \n",

But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed  he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I’ve always wanted to do that.” At press time, Thomas called for a short recess to give the matter more thought, as whichever choice he made could have dire consequences for decades of his luxury vacations.   \n",

She was only 59 yesterday,” the visibly distraught DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after the party’s new presumptive nominee began to ask him who he was and then trailed off, her cloudy eyes glossing over beneath a wisp of stark-white hair and her skin now wrinkled and liver-spotted. “She’s been rambling about all kinds of nonsense, and she keeps calling everyone “buster.” No, Madam Vice President, I’m not your stepson, and I’m not here to take you back to California. Goddammit, she’s too far gone to even formulate a coherent argument for abortion rights. Someone better call [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom and make sure he still remembers his own name.” At press time, sources confirmed prominent members of the party had  been instructed to quickly shift their support to a spry, cogent 31-year-old Joe Biden, who had somehow de-aged 50 years overnight.   \n",

In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.” Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building’s windows.   \n",

Just as I’m putting the finishing touches on a worldview about a topic  that I don’t have even the faintest inkling about, it’s like three more  news stories pop up out of nowhere in an arena where I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I’m talking about. And again, I really don’t know  jackshit about anything at all, so how am I supposed to keep up?” At  press time, Gifford added that the only thing helping him keep his head  above water was that he did not have to research or think about his  opinions at all before putting them out into the world.   \n",

And if this special nit comb I bought doesn’t work, I’ll have to shave My beard too. Then I’ll really look like an idiot. Or worse, a skinhead.” At press time, sources confirmed a clean-shaven God was looking in the mirror and trying to determine if He could pull off wearing a fedora.   \n",

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.” At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.   \n",

Kelly petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to watch him pee. “Today we ask the court to grant review in this case so that Mr. Robert Kelly is given the opportunity to pee in front of the honorable justices while they watch,” defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean wrote in a petition for certiorari, noting that R. Kelly had already filed a preliminary motion for the exposure of his penis in open court. “It is our belief that the federal judiciary should not infringe upon the defendant’s right to spray his golden shower before the bench. To deny this appeal would be to undermine the First Amendment’s guarantee of free expression as it applies to Mr. Kelly’s exercise of limitless, unfettered pissing at any time and place of his choosing.” At press time, sources confirmed R. Kelly’s lawyers had withdrawn the petition at their client’s request after he discovered all nine Supreme Court justices were above the age of consent.   \n",

Kennedy Jr. for president on Monday. “The Federated Union of Bear Cub Carcass Dumpers stands 100% behind Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the only candidate in the 2024 to have earned an A grade on their bear-dumping scorecard,” said FUBCCD president Walter Hudkins, who endorsed the independent candidate on behalf of the organization’s 300,000 dues-paying members. “Leaving the carcass of a young black bear in the middle of Central Park is exactly the kind of leadership quality this country sorely needs. In addition to this endorsement, we will be making a $50 million donation to the pro-Kennedy super PAC Bear Dump America. Remember, we dump bear carcasses, and we vote.” At press time, Hudkins added that in contrast, former President Donald Trump had a measly C rating from the organization.   \n",

It’s stressful, though, because a single mistake in the blocking of a scene can put you in the hospital. Thankfully, we had a lot of stunt professionals working with us to make sure nothing too serious happened—although I did get a black eye from the left one.” Powell added that his mentor Tom Cruise had given him a lot of helpful advice from his experience filming with Salma Hayek.   \n",

Tim Walz Tuesday of stolen valor for wearing an apron that said “Grill Master.” “Tim Walz is a liar—he has never attained the rank of grill master,” said Vance, attacking Walz for misrepresenting his culinary record in what he claimed was an affront to the real, brave grill masters who wielded spatulas every day. “I know for a fact that Tim Walz was indoors, in the kitchen, when he wore that grill master apron. I wonder, has he ever been on a real deck? I heard he even abandoned his barbecue when the ice cream truck went by.” At press time, Vance was fending off criticism that he himself had only ever used a George Foreman electric grill.   \n",

He doesn’t even have to talk to anybody or pay attention to what’s going on around him—he gets to just sit and watchBluey,” said Ray’s Italian Bistro patron Finn Delamore, echoing the sentiment of dozens around him who reportedly couldn’t help but cast longing looks at the 2-year-old whose eyes were glued to the screen in front of him, his hands clasping a bright red toy fire truck. “Look at him sitting there in those comfortable jammies, laughing his ass off at Bandit and Chilli as he chows down on little pieces of cut-up chicken. Meanwhile, I’m in my stiff dress shirt, making stilted conversation and eating osso buco like an asshole. What I wouldn’t give to trade places with him.” At press time, onlookers had become even more jealous after the toddler got to relieve himself without even having to walk all the way to the restroom.   \n",

I thought Brittany Mahomes was joking when she said she’d see me again soon. How many games are there this year? 17? And that’s not counting the playoffs. Hoo boy. Guess I better start scheduling more stops on the Eras tour.” At press time, Swift was seen googling how long it took for CTE to kick in and end a football player’s career forever.   \n",

I honestly can’t hear you right now because someone’s trying to murder me and I’ve been shot in my ear—again!” the former president replied when asked by ABC’s Linsey Davis about his shifting stance on reproductive rights, later pointing to his ear and moaning loudly when invited to explain why voters should support him in 2024 given his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “Ouch, ouch, this really hurts! You seriously expect me to talk about the four different criminal cases against me when I’m up here bleeding because of an attempt on my life? You should spend less time asking about Project 2025 and more time finding the guy who definitely just shot me. Wait, there he goes! I’ll go after him!” At press time, reports confirmed moderator David Muir had been shot and killed by Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Trump.   \n",

Sources confirmed that moments after receiving the Kamala Harris fundraising message, the accountant typed out his short reply with the certainty of one familiar with an ancient elven tongue summoning an arcane incantation known as the Shield of Thar’Ghal to protect both him and his party of halflings and dwarves from a charging monster escaped from the depths of the underworld. Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, “Begone, ye evil creature!” According to bystanders, the accountant’s fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster’s tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.   \n",

Man, I wouldn’t mind getting my hands around those knotted nests of brittle sticks and hay. Her burlap face ain’t too bad, either.” At press time there were multiple injuries reported among local men who scratched their faces on stray twigs and straw while attempting to motorboat the scarecrow.   \n",
       "45  Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup. Tu Stultus Es, The Onion Editorial Board   \n",

By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.   \n",

Houses just aren’t meant to get wet. No insurance company anywhere would take on that kind of liability. If it’s possible to prove the house remained dry during the storm, and it just sort of fell down on its own, then maybe a case could be made for approving your claim.” Treacy went on to wish the Coleman family well and said he would keep an eye out for them on GoFundMe.   \n",

So when she saw the man with his jar of Hellmann’s, she made him a proposition: He could either give her the mayonnaise, or he could die. I asked her how she felt about this now, and she just said sandwich spreads were hard to come by back then and the man had made his choice.” At press time, Sipple was reportedly listing on her fingers the various other items—eggs, flour, chewing gum, an Indian head nickel—she had killed people over during the worst economic crisis in American history.   \n",

Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.” At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.   \n",

No, I’m serious here, I really am. Just believe me when I say this: Yesterday the better man won, which was me.” According to reports, Harris half-heartedly muttered, “Thank you, Donald,” before hanging up the phone.   \n",

But it really shows the power of one citizenry to come together and prevail over themselves. The message was loud and clear: We are sick and tired of our country, and we want it to end.” At press time, millions of emotional Americans had reportedly gathered on the National Mall in an impromptu celebration of their resounding victory over the forces of liberty and equality.   \n",

One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can’t remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there’s also just a ‘meteor’ too, isn’t there? What am I supposed to tell the vet when I bring the ashes over?” At press time, reports confirmed a stumped Nieto was frantically searching his phone to see if it mattered that the space rock had exploded when it hit his dog.   \n",

And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He’s seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn’t want to experience one again.” At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.   \n",

Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings. With these monkeys, all the fecal projectiles will have been flung in under 30 minutes.

Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.</td>\n",

Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans  -  just five, mind you, and no more  -  to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 of The Apprentice on DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets! Five Golden Tickets have been printed on golden paper, and these five Golden Tickets have been hidden in your stimulus checks. These five may be anywhere  -  in any mailbox in the country.

RBG!\"  \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did.

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire.

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!\" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team.

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.\"</td>\n",

Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'\" \"No more. The bigotry stops today.\" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.  Are you looking for a way to show how much you love the beloved caramel-covered popcorn and peanuts snack, but don't want to offend anyone by using problematic language? This is the shirt for you! It's comfortable, casual, available in a wide range of sizes (gotta be inclusive!), and most importantly, not offensive to crackers, er, Caucasians!</td>\n",

Now I'm gonna go watch Joker again. Great film. What's that guy's name? Phoenix something. Bob Phoenix, that's it. Tremendous actor---absolutely perfect.\" Democrats quickly condemned his statements. Pelosi said, \"It's clear that Trump wants to be impeached because he's not good at being president. Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term.\" \"And Joker is alt-right propaganda,\" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year. One pundit on CNN suggested that Trump is supporting impeachment at the request of Putin or the guy from Ukraine or \"whichever conspiracy thing we're pushing this month, I forget.\" At publishing time, Democrats had also withdrawn from the 2020 race to teach Trump a lesson.</td>\n",

An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated. \"Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,\" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. \"He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.\" The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narratives ex nihilo, according to insiders.</td>\n",

Maybe even some tanks. That would be so frickin' rad. They could have a badge to show their authority. Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?\" she added wistfully. Sadly, there is no such force in Portland, so citizens have been forced to turn to an even crazier idea: taking responsibility for their own safety and well-being, and maybe even buying a gun to protect themselves.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Sources are reporting that Trump has dealt a killer blow in his ongoing war against his sworn enemy, the U.S. Post Office. In a move of sheer, mind-blowing brilliance, Trump directed the Post Office to put his face on every single stamp, forcing the Democrats to reverse course and abolish the institution once and for all.  The new stamp, dubbed \"The Trump-Stamp,\" to be used on all pieces of mail features a smiling Donald Trump, with the caption \"GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.\" Don Lemon broke the news in a tearful address to the nation last night. \"Our democracy is over,\" he said. \"It doesn't exist anymore. I will never send another piece of mail ever again, and neither should you or else you're a racist.\"   Antifa and BLM responded by marching on local post offices and burning them down. Enthusiastic Trump supporters quickly bought up all the stamps. They are now selling for $3,000 apiece online.</td>\n",

All types of nerds, from social introverts to hardcore PC gamers, welcomed the dawn of this new era, privately from their own homes. \"I have been waiting my whole life for this moment,\" said Ned Pendleton, 32 -- via text message, of course -- as he fired up League of Legends on his beefy gaming PC. \"They told me to take up a sport and that the kids playing basketball and stuff were gonna be way more successful than us nerds who played Counter-Strike at LAN parties every weekend.\" \"They all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?\" To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoning Halo, Half-Life, The Legend of Zelda, Red Dead Redemption, or Horizon Zero Dawn. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours of Fallout and are adept at killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps. Of course, many nerds are running out of hygienic products, but they say that's \"not an issue.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.</td>\n",

Not Jesus. He disappeared; no one knows what happened to him. But I'm out there every day protecting churches from crazy liberals.\" While Trump admitted that Jesus did do some things for Christianity in the past, Trump said he was doing more now and it was more substantial. \"I'm appointing judges to help protect religious rights,\" Trump stated. \"How many judges has Jesus appointed? He says something about judging people in the future, but I ain't seen it.\" Furthermore, Trump asserted that he \"saved Christmas.\" \"Look what I've done,\" he said. \"You can say 'Merry Christmas' now. In fact, if you say 'Happy Holidays' and don't immediately make it clear you're referring to Christmas, you go to prison. What has Jesus ever done for Christmas? Be born? He wants credit for that?

The measure passed with 57% of the vote. 22% of voters thought the Senate should be replaced by barking seals, while 17% voted that the replacement should be the pit of venomous snakes from Indiana Jones. 3.97% voted that Senate members be replaced by screaming goats. \"About 100 people\" voted for the current Senators to keep their jobs, with this tiny voting bloc centered in Washington, D.C. Highland Ape Rescue out of West Virginia will be teaming up with Cornwell Primate farms to supply hundreds of monkeys and apes to the Senate. The animals will be fed a nutritious mixture of foods that produce easily throwable feces. Protective glass will be put up around the Senate for camera crews to safely film, but anyone being interviewed by the new senators will have to sit in the middle of the poo-flinging octagon, coming under a heavy barrage of projectile excrement.  \"It will be a huge improvement from how things were before,\" said ape trainer, Marlena Henwick. \"No more 10-12 hour hearings.

In a local qualifying race for the World Road Cycling League, the motorcyclist crushed the previous 100-mile record of 3 hours, 13 minutes with his amazing new score of well under an hour. Professional motorcycle racer Judd E. Banner, the brave trans-vehicle rider, was allowed to race after he told league organizers he's always felt like a bicyclist in a motorcyclist's body. \"Look, my ride has handlebars, two wheels, and a seat,\" he told reporters as he accepted a trophy for his incredible time trial. \"Just because I've got a little extra hardware, such as an 1170-cc flat-twin engine with 110 horsepower, doesn't mean I have any kind of inherent advantage here.\" Banner also said he painted the word \"HUFFY\" on the side of his bike, ensuring he has no advantage over the bikes that came out of the factory as bicycles. Some critics say he needs to cut off his motor in order to make the competition fairer, but he quickly called these people bigots, and they were immediately banned from professional cycle racing.   \n",

Anyone who gets a golden ticket will win a free tour of Mar-a-Lago. Rumor has it that Trump will be watching them closely to see which of the winners has the qualities he looks for in a manager, with the best candidate getting hired as Mar-a-Lago's onsite McDonald's manager. \"Who will win? Nobody knows!\" Trump said gleefully as he carefully signed each of the golden tickets before hiding them among the stimulus checks. \"I, Donald Trump, have decided to allow five Americans  -  just five, mind you, and no more  -  to visit my resort this year. These lucky five will be shown around personally by me, and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my hotel and golf resort -- the best golf, maybe ever. Then, at the end of the tour, as a special present, all of them will be given Season 1 of The Apprentice on DVD!\" \"So watch out for the Golden Tickets! Five Golden Tickets have been printed on golden paper, and these five Golden Tickets have been hidden in your stimulus checks. These five may be anywhere  -  in any mailbox in the country. And the five lucky finders of these five Golden Tickets are the only ones who will be allowed to visit my Mar-a-Lago during the lockdown. Good luck to you all!\" Unfortunately, he put all five golden tickets in a stimulus envelope addressed to Jim Acosta.   \n",

In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe. According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted \"RBG! RBG! RBG!\"  \"Yeah, RBG was an amazing person,\" said LeBron James after the game. \"I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.\" Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. \"It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle. Easy.\"  NBA players are vowing to wear the collars until Trump is removed from office, or until angry rioters burn their basketball arenas down, whichever comes first.   \n",

At a press conference, the Speaker of the House held up a Bible and then ripped it in two, declaring that she was against anything Trump was associated with. \"If Trump is for the Bible, then I am against it,\" she said as she struggled to rip the Bible in half. Finally, aides came to intervene, pre-ripping the spine of the Bible so it would be easier for her to tear. \"All the books of the Bible are bad: Genesis, Joseph, the one with the big fish, even Hezekiah. We must stand against Trump's bigotry by ripping up anything he claims to be for.\" \"Yass, queen! Slay!\" shouted her fans at the press conference as she finally managed to rip the Bible up. \"You're my president!\" In a genius move, Trump then held up a Koran in front of a mosque, forcing Pelosi to tear up a Koran and alienate the left.   \n",

Aides were disappointed and a little frightened, however, when Biden immediately cut a large hole in the middle of the mask so he could continue to invade people's personal space and sniff their hair, necks, and faces. Staffers usually don't let Biden play with sharp objects, but he managed to find some safety scissors stashed behind the Metamucil in his campaign bus. Using the purple plastic scissors, he cut a large hole and then fitted the mask to his face, confident that he was protecting himself and others from the virus. \"That's better,\" he said as he cut a big hole for his schnoz. \"Now I'm protecting against infection and I'm still able to give the ladies a good sniff. You know, in my day, I wore a mask just like this, as was the fashion at the time. All the kids at the pool would ask to play with the mask, and they'd run their fingers through it. In fact, one time, a gangster named CornPop was about to go cause some trouble at the sock hop, and I put some rocks in my mask and started swinging it around like a sling. You know, real Daniel and Goliath type stuff. He looked at me, tears in his eyes, and promised never again to go out and cause a ruckus.\" \"Anyway, that's why I'm your best choice for senator of the Roman Empire. Vote for Joe!\" Biden suddenly came to and realized he was standing in a Walmart parking lot talking to a hobo.   \n",

Ripley reportedly walked up to the plate in the bottom of the 6th, pointed his bat toward the left-field wall looming 130 feet in the distance, and let her rip, sending the ball rocketing over the fence and into a parking lot as the fans cheered and his coach yelled out, \"Attaboy, Nate! Good job, bud!\" His team, the Lil' Padres, attempted to hoist him up on their shoulders in celebration of their great victory over the favored Tiny Tigers, but were unable to pick up the large 230-pound man. Ripley's feat comes at the end of a momentous tee-ball season, in which the self-identified six-year-old absolutely shattered every record set prior to that point. With a 1.000 batting average, 52 home runs, and an incredible showing at first base, second base, shortstop, third base, and pitcher, the man is being called an inspiration to other six-year-olds everywhere. \"I'm just proud to be here with my team. It's all for the love of the game,\" an emotional Ripley told reporters while enjoying an orange slice and juice box after the championship. \"I couldn't have done it without my team.\"   \n",

Go Hoosiers!\" Aides scrambled to turn off Biden's mic but he beat them away with his walker. \"The time has come for the reign of Tippecanoe and Tyler too to end!\" he shouted, though by this point he had wandered into a nearby field and no one could hear him.   \n",

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  \"Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice,\" said toy designer Camden Flufferton. \"We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.\" The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism. Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. \"We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these,\" said Flufferton, \"but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.\"   \n",

Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'\" \"No more. The bigotry stops today.\" The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.  Are you looking for a way to show how much you love the beloved caramel-covered popcorn and peanuts snack, but don't want to offend anyone by using problematic language? This is the shirt for you! It's comfortable, casual, available in a wide range of sizes (gotta be inclusive!), and most importantly, not offensive to crackers, er, Caucasians!   \n",

This is for the health and mental safety of our employees. And for the love of God, take a shower once in a while, you know?\" Shirts will remain optional.   \n",

Omar had been an enthusiastic supporter of the Green New Deal and wanted to save the earth, but then she noticed something very disturbing when looking at a map of the earth: Earth is the planet on which Israel resides. \"You've been hypnotized by the Jews!\" Omar accused a surprised Ocasio-Cortez. Omar then ripped up a copy of the Green New Deal. \"This is just a plot to help Israel keep existing! Did AIPAC pay you off?\" Ocasio-Cortez was very apologetic, saying she hadn't considered how her plan would affect Israel. She then vowed to change her plan so it might save the whole planet except where Israel resides. \"This is, like, a learning process,\" Ocasio-Cortez later told reporters. \"When I made the Green New Deal, I thought weather like storms and earthquakes were all caused by climate change, but now I've learned from Representative Omar that lots of that is actually from Jewish-controlled weather machines. So for the next version of the Green New Deal we will have to keep that in mind.\"   \n",

Others were so touched they couldn't find the words to communicate how they felt. Most simply wept.  No matter how they expressed their emotions, everyone agreed that the scene off the Malibu coast Monday morning was exactly what America needed to get through this pandemic. Celebrities gathered their multi-million-dollar yachts on the waters of the Pacific Ocean and spelled out \"WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.\" \"We're just like you,\" said Ellen DeGeneres on her Instagram as her servants sailed her yacht into position to form the apostrophe. \"Yes, maybe I have a yacht and you've only ever been on the Storybook Canal boats at Disneyland, but still. It's pretty much the same thing.\" \"Stay home, save lives -- it's not that hard,\" said Patton Oswalt, whose fleet of yachts made up several of the letters. \"Look, poor people, it's not worth risking your life just to go to Fuddruckers or work a job or whatever it is you peasants do all day.\" After the stunt was over, Oswalt had his chauffeur drive him home in his hot tub limousine as he snorted several million dollars' worth of powdered caviar. \"All of humanity is fighting this together and we're all as one,\" said Lady Gaga, who was wearing a bathing suit made out of gold bricks. \"Though, I mean, don't try to get on my yacht. My guards will literally shoot you. That's not a metaphor.\"   \n",

Adam Schiff reminded the Senate of their solemn duty and the gravity of just what it is they will be discussing at the trial. Schiff warned that if Trump is not impeached, the American people may have a chance to tamper with the next election. \"If President Trump is not impeached, the American people might get a say in who is president,\" Schiff said gravely. \"We simply can't allow that to happen. We must diligently defend our electoral process against electoral outcomes we do not like. If that means seizing power through a sham impeachment trial, so be it.\" \"When the Founders wrote that founding document thing, they never imagined there would be electoral outcomes that Democrats did not agree with.\" Democrats also said they even have hard evidence that the 2016 election was compromised by Republicans voting for Trump. \"We know this horrible outcome could happen, because it's already happened once before.\"   \n",

People who bravely post about how the U.S. needs to invade some country in the Middle East or Asia or outer space will get a pop-up notice indicating they've been enlisted in the military. A recruiter will then show up at their house and whisk them away to fight in the foreign war they wanted to happen so badly. \"Frankly, recruitment numbers are down, and we needed some way to find people who are really enthusiastic about fighting wars,\" said a DOD official. \"Then it hit us like a drone strike: there are plenty of people who argue vehemently for foreign intervention. It doesn't matter what war we're trying to create: Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, China---these people are always reliable supporters of any invasion abroad. So why not get them there on the frontlines?\" \"After all, we want people who are passionate about occupying foreign lands, not grunts who are just there for the paycheck,\" he added. Strangely, as soon as the policy was implemented, 99% of saber-rattling suddenly ceased.   \n",

Sanders pointed out that the country has been very successful in eliminating vast swathes of poverty and also the poor. \"America still has a lot of poor people, and that's because we haven't been aggressive in implementing socialist programs that cause mass starvation,\" Sanders said, his fingers flopping around like ten tiny wacky inflatable tube men. \"Firing squads, death camps, breadlines---all of these are humanitarian tools in the arsenal of the government to shoot poverty in the face, and sometimes also the poor in the face, when it's necessary.\" The senator also pointed out that poor people, who often own fewer than three homes, don't contribute much to a socialist economy and \"not much is lost\" when these single-home-owners are shot or simply starve to death as the government can't even figure out how to get food to everyone, a problem even bad fast-food restaurants like McDonald's solved decades ago.   \n",

And Biden -- he's just so old. Sending him around crowds campaigning is basically trying to murder him. Anyway, it just seems pointless for a bunch of people to die when everyone knows I was going to win anyway.\" Trump has been a divisive figure in the past, but so far everyone has agreed with this move. The New York Times, which usually opposes absolutely everything Trump does, wrote an editorial in support of canceling the election. \"It's a smart, science-driven move,\" the editorial said. \"As important as democracy is, it's just not worth dying over.\" Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders also seemed very relieved by the announcement, as they're both very tired and worried about getting sick. Sanders was especially happy, telling the press, \"You know, for a few moments there, it really seemed like I might win, and I didn't know what was going to happen if people actually expected me to follow through on all that free stuff.\" Sanders is now deciding in which of his three houses to self-quarantine.   \n",

According to shocking reports, people have purchased car parts at Walmart and then those cars have been involved in accidents, proving a direct correlation between selling auto parts and causing deaths. \"We can no longer be complicit in an industry that kills over 3,000 people a day,\" said a spokesperson for Walmart. \"Every time we sell a muffler, steering wheel cover, or flame decal, we are potentially causing the death of a person, and we cannot support that any longer.\" \"It's clear that bad drivers and poor road conditions don't cause vehicular deaths---cars do.\" Walmart executives said they are beating themselves with a stick to atone for the deaths they've already caused. \"Our consciences will only be clean when we've been mercilessly beaten once for each of the millions of deaths that have been caused by automobiles since Walmart began selling auto parts,\" said one executive before solemnly beginning to beat himself with a baseball bat.   \n",

Sparing no expense, the FBI has hired top-notch Italian bodyguard Hiluigi Clintonelli. \"It's-a me, Clintonelli!\" said the world-renowned bodyguard arriving at the prison.  Thanks to the particularly glowing reviews from high-profile individuals such as President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, all federal prison security checks were waived for Hiluigi. \"There's simply no one else that we trust to execute this job as she can.\"  \"Mamma mia, this simply will not do!\" exclaimed Hiluigi Clintonelli as she forcefully cleared the room. She warned that anyone other than her could be a threat to Ghislaine's life.  Clintonelli also connected all camera feeds to her personal server to ensure that all recorded video was properly secured.   \n",

The North Korean dictator expressed hope that his newfound knowledge would help him make his citizens more robotically obedient.  \"We still have our troublemakers, but with these Ivy League techniques, I'll have them eating out of my hand in no time!\" he said.  The murderous leader of North Korea plans to go back to his home country and start his own Ivy League school: Kim Jong UNiversity.   \n",

The recount process at long last found the \"missing votes\" that would have handed Gore the presidency back in 2000, making him the official president of the country. \"Well, it's about time,\" Gore said in his acceptance speech. \"Thanks to all the fine people that made this happen. It really is too bad that the earth is going to be destroyed by fire by 2015--err, I mean, 2019, or else I could really savor my presidency.\" Gore will be granted two terms as US president, ousting President Trump and canceling the 2020 election. \"We just assume he would have won again and ushered in a liberal golden age,\" said an election official. \"So he's got 8 years to reclaim his lost time. Make the most of it, Al, and great job. You deserve it!\"   \n",

Heartfelt and moving. \"We just really wanted to show how much we care about love and social justice by burning this community into a powerful reminder of what it's all about,\" said local protester Jake Hernandez, who had flown in from Portland for the event. \"Now, when police and fire helicopters fly over to try to restore order, they'll be inspired by our message of love and harmony.\" Upon seeing the heart-wrenching message of unity, police dropped their batons, ripped off their badges, donned bandanas, picked up bricks, and joined the protesters in their rioting and looting. \"I don't know how I didn't see the light before,\" said former police officer, now Antifa chapter leader Bridget Morrison as she lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a minority-owned business. \"I'm woke to the cause of love and harmony.\" What a powerful message! The protesters were also planning to burn the word \"SOCIAL JUSTICE\" into predominantly black parts of town but have sadly run out of buildings to burn.   \n",

A nervous Osteen had accidentally come into contact with the Bible several days prior and feared he had contracted the gospel. \"I'm relieved to announce that I'm 100% gospel-free,\" the smiling pastor said. He'd been quarantining himself from friends and family for a few days just in case he was gospel-positive, not wanting the gospel to spread to anyone else. \"My hand had briefly brushed against the Bible, as I thought it was one of my books. We've disposed of it, of course, and I've notified all the people I've come into contact with since then so they could quarantine.\" \"I'm just glad I'm still safe from the truth that I'm a hopeless sinner in need of a savior.\" Osteen has, however, tested positive for a novel prosperity gospel virus -- a new but still very deadly mutation of an ancient heresy.   \n",

The migrants claim they are leaving America because of its high standards of living, strong economy, and record employment numbers, and hope to find a better life in Venezuela's much more equitable system. \"Everyone there has the same quantity of possessions and food,\" said one marcher. \"Everyone makes millions of dollars, and very few people work. It's a real paradise.\" The refugees have complex motivations, but the vast majority simply want to see everything socialism has to offer after suffering the amazing benefits of capitalism for too long. Caravan organizers dispelled rumors that they were funded by Bernie Sanders, claiming the caravan was an organic grassroots movement. At its current pace, the caravan is expected to arrive just in time for Venezuela to run out of food entirely.   \n",

I'm for it. Great idea. Best idea, maybe ever,\" he said, adding that he's \"getting kinda sick of all this winning anyway.\" \"Sure, why not. Impeach me. I love it. Whatever. Now I'm gonna go watch Joker again. Great film. What's that guy's name? Phoenix something. Bob Phoenix, that's it. Tremendous actor---absolutely perfect.\" Democrats quickly condemned his statements. Pelosi said, \"It's clear that Trump wants to be impeached because he's not good at being president. Well, we're going to show him a thing or two by forcing him to stay in the White House and finish out his term.\" \"And Joker is alt-right propaganda,\" she said, falling for Trump's ploy to make Dems condemn one of the most successful, beloved films of the year. One pundit on CNN suggested that Trump is supporting impeachment at the request of Putin or the guy from Ukraine or \"whichever conspiracy thing we're pushing this month, I forget.\" At publishing time, Democrats had also withdrawn from the 2020 race to teach Trump a lesson.   \n",

The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn't cite shaky \"anonymous sources\" and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up. \"I was reading this story, and I was like, 'Wait, what is this?'\" said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. \"They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I'd been duped. A classic gag!\" \"Those little rascals!\" he added, shaking his head and laughing goodnaturedly. \"As long as they return to their regularly scheduled fake news tomorrow, we're good. We're good.\"   \n",

But this shutdown mistakenly shut down the most non-essential entity of all: the government. For a brief period of time, all government in the United States was illegal, since it is completely non-essential to everything. \"Oops,\" said Senator Mitch McConnell. \"We meant non-essential private businesses. Of course, the government is always essential, even when it's not doing anything or is making things worse.\" Senators, congresspeople, and bureaucrats frantically rewrote the ban to include only businesses that actually produced something and not government agencies that just watched other people make stuff. Though they had dragged their feet on passing bills related to relieving the financial distress of the shutdown, they passed this revision in record speed, almost as quickly as they vote for pay raises for themselves.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she would have caught the mistake but had passed the ban in a hurry, saying, \"We had to pass the ban to see what it did.\"   \n",

They present questions, then the story answers those questions as the plot progresses. I thought people knew this.\" During the 115 minute movie, Leslie asked a total of over 437 questions, Steve claims.  That's nearly four questions a minute. Questions included:  \"Oh my gosh, what is that dart stuck in that tree, is that poisonous? I wonder who left it there?\" \"Can he trust these guys he's going into the temple with? They seem like they are up to no good.\" \"Oh no, how is Harrison Ford going to get out of the cave now?\" \"What happens if he takes that treasure, something bad? How is he going to get it off of there?\" \"Is that big rock going to smoosh him?\" Experts say that the issue of wives not understanding that movies answer most questions by the end of the movie has been a problem for men since movies were invented. \"What we need is better education,\" said Harold Oliver of Trenton University. \"Women need to learn from a young age how stories work. And how talking during movies is annoying.\" Steve says that, despite the constant questions during movies, he loves his wife and has found a solution that works for both of them. \"I've just decided to only watch stupid movies I don't care about with her,\" Steve said. \"Things are going great.\" At publishing time, sources had confirmed that Leslie was forced to shush Steve several times during their marathon viewing of Gilmore Girls.   \n",

The U.S. senator quickly chartered a flight to Hong Kong in order to throw himself into the fray. Sanders bravely stood in the middle of the conflict between police and protesters, shouting at the \"ungrateful little dissenters\" that they don't know how good they have it under a Communist regime. \"Remember, you could have it a lot worse---you could be in America!\" Sanders bellowed as police officers for the totalitarian regime beat protesters in the background. \"Hey, you! You on the floor there! You're not looking very appreciative of living in one of the greatest Communist countries on earth!\" Sanders continued his long-winded rant about the need for the government to own the means of production, how great breadlines are, and how bad things are in capitalist America as protesters got dragged away by police to be disappeared. \"Just think---in America, we have to pick between 14 different types of deodorant!\" he said, his fingers flopping around like limp sausages.  According to sources, Beto O'Rourke is planning on joining Sanders to inform Chinese citizens how lucky they are that they don't live in a racist country like America.   \n",

CNN producers were reportedly impressed throughout the ongoing saga of Smollett's apparent hoax attack on himself. They realized early on the facts didn't add up but were fascinated with how well the actor kept the narrative going. An HR rep quickly reached out to Smollett to see if he'd be interested in taking on a position at the news organization after news broke that the entire thing was probably fabricated. \"Smollett has exactly the kind of skills we look for at our fine organization,\" said CNN correspondent Brian Stelter. \"He picked a narrative, made up all the relevant facts and details, and stuck with his story in spite of glaring holes in the plot. It's hard to find people who understand our core values here at CNN, but Smollett seems to be just the guy for us.\" The actor has accepted the offer and is now undergoing training to learn how to weave even more intricate narratives ex nihilo, according to insiders.   \n",

In a candid moment, Outlaw (seriously, her actual name) said there was just nothing the police could do, as they'd need to have some kind of organized, armed force specifically created to protect and serve the people. \"Like, what if we took money from everyone to fund a force that could then defend them in a time of need?\" she pondered aloud. \"They could have patrol cars, firearms, and attack dogs. Maybe even some tanks. That would be so frickin' rad. They could have a badge to show their authority. Then, when a rogue group like Antifa shows up to take over our city every weekend, they could be repelled using force if necessary.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, but a girl can dream, right?\" she added wistfully. Sadly, there is no such force in Portland, so citizens have been forced to turn to an even crazier idea: taking responsibility for their own safety and well-being, and maybe even buying a gun to protect themselves.   \n",

Almost immediately after the move, he announced a new product the whole world has been waiting for: the Tesla AR-15. \"Um... h-howdy, I think,\" said Elon, expertly taking on the local dialect. \"Y'all want a Tesla AR-15? You got it, partner!\"  The new firearm will look similar to a standard AR-15 but will in fact be a battery-powered railgun capable of firing 3 million rounds per minute. It will also feature a fingerprint sensor, Bluetooth capability, heat-seeking ammunition, and a chainsaw bayonet. \"We really wanted to re-think self-defense,\" said Musk. \"This new firearm will be the go-to rifle for our SpaceX volunteers when they encounter hostile aliens. It's also a celebration of the Second Amendment. If any federal authorities try to confiscate it, the rifle will automatically connect to the internet and file a lawsuit for you!\" The Federal Government has requested that Tesla at least remove the AI-powered \"self-driving\" feature on the firearm before selling it.   \n",

By nominating Biden, Trump has forced the Dems' hands, making them believe the sexual assault claims and allegations of inappropriate, creepy behavior against the former vice president. The \"4D chess\" move forced Dems to immediately accuse Joe Biden of sexual assault and reverse their position on the current claims against him. \"We now believe Tara Reade,\" said a somber Kamala Harris, \"and we will do everything in our power to destroy this man's life.\" In addition to believing current claims against Joe Biden, Democrats also immediately dug up 417 new accusers against Joe Biden. He has been accused of participating in wild frat parties, drunken keggers, and something called the \"Devil's Triangle,\" which Dems say is either a Satanic ritual or code for a sexual practice or \"maybe both.\" \"It's clear this man is dangerous and cannot be trusted,\" said Nancy Pelosi. \"We call on the Senate to turn down his nomination and run him out of public life.\" Biden released a statement, saying, \"I just want to go home and see my grandkids again.\" His mic was cut off and he was pulled off the stage with a shepherd's crook.   \n",

A social media scheduling error apparently caused Hillary Clinton to post her condolences for Tulsi Gabbard's suicide one day early. This morning, Clinton posted that she felt \"great sadness\" at hearing that Gabbard had killed herself. In subsequent tweets, she detailed how \"tragic\" it was that Gabbard had broken her own kneecaps, stuck her feet in concrete, then tossed herself off the docks near a seedy warehouse. \"It's just terrible what happened, and though we disagreed, I hope we can all take a few minutes to send thoughts and prayers to the family,\" Clinton concluded. The post was deleted several hours later after the Clinton team realized it was scheduled for October 23, not October 24 as originally intended. At publishing time, Clinton had accidentally posted early condolences for the unfortunate suicide of the social media manager who had OK'd the post and subsequently posted more condolences for the new social media manager, etc.   \n",

After seeing account after account tweet out one particularly bad story, CEO Jack Dorsey realized he had to take action. Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading \"Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats.\" Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers. \"Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!\" Dorsey ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could, but he did need to ask for some help, as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer, either. Eventually, they managed to program a robot to pick up the sledgehammer and smash the servers. After hearing the Twitter employees talk about critical theory, the robot got woke and began attacking all the cis white males.   \n",

Entitled the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, celebrities such as Alyssa Milano, Jimmy Kimmel, and John Legend have volunteered to relinquish their power and privilege by burning their houses and everything they have to the ground.  The organizer of this movement released the following statement on Twitter: \"Your homes, your riches, and your toys are built on a foundation of white supremacy. They are forever tainted by racism. Your walls and security systems have shut out the voices of the oppressed. Join us. Stand with us. #BurnYourHouseDown!\"  As the provocative hashtag began trending on Twitter, rich celebrities lept into action. Alyssa Milano employed her house servants to light torches and throw them through her broken windows. Jimmy Kimmel hired Instagram models to jump on trampolines while throwing Molotov cocktails into his front door. Black Lives Matter protestors gathered to watch the flames as they engulfed the multimillion-dollar homes. With tears in their eyes, they joined hands with celebrities and sang John Lennon's 'Imagine' as the massive monuments to white supremacy toppled to the ground.  Local news stations reported that twelve local housekeeping and landscaping businesses have been put out of work due to the #BurnYourHouseDown movement, but it's a small price to pay for the \"change we need.\" The twelve small business owners then moved to Texas and built mansions of their own.   \n",

The sharper edges in the new design will just immediately put you out of your misery, so you don't have to roll around on the ground in excruciating pain for minutes on end. Utilizing advanced laser-driven techniques, LEGO factories can now hone the edges of the famously sharp and painful bricks to such a fine point that the human nervous system instantly shuts down upon coming into contact with them. \"Our engineers have been hard at work trying to come up with ways to make an even deadlier brick, and they've finally made a breakthrough,\" LEGO head of design Arnbjørn Frandsen said in a press conference. According to Frandsen, internal company tests have shown the new bricks have a 99.7% success rate at ending the life of the unfortunate person to inadvertently step on even just a single LEGO. \"This is the most promising advancement we've made in our brick design since we first introduced the bricks that make it feel like your foot is being stabbed by a hundred sharpened katanas many decades ago.\"   \n",

Flags were spotted flying at half-mast around the country, notably at The Washington Post, The New York Times, and in front of several celebrities' homes. The celebrities went out and bought an American flag for the first time just to fly it at half-mast for this important time of grief. \"The grieving process is painful but necessary,\" said Rep. Ilhan Omar. \"As a nation, we need to stop and grieve this great, austere, revered religious scholar. He was one of the good ones.\" In a rare moment of unity with The Squad, Pelosi gave each of the girls a hug, telling them to just \"let it all out\" in their time of sadness. Ocasio-Cortez didn't seem to know what was happening but adjusted her glasses to look smart. A teary-eyed Barack Obama was also seen solemnly lowering the flag in front of his seaside mansion. \"To think, this all could have been prevented with a few pallets of cash.\" He sighed and stared off into the distance, a look of pain and regret on his face. \"If only Trump had targeted a U.S. citizen with a drone strike instead.\" Later, Democrats clarified they meant we should fly the Iranian flag at half-mast, not the \"offensive and problematic\" American flag.   \n",

Don't risk it out in the deadly cold.\" \"You might even have to put on shoes,\" he added. \"May God help us all.\" While temps are expected to drop to the unprecedented low 50s, weathermen confirmed that wind chill could put that up in the high 40s, at which point most Californians are expected to simply keel over and die. The rest of the nation seemed to be OK with this.   \n",

In a move of sheer, mind-blowing brilliance, Trump directed the Post Office to put his face on every single stamp, forcing the Democrats to reverse course and abolish the institution once and for all.  The new stamp, dubbed \"The Trump-Stamp,\" to be used on all pieces of mail features a smiling Donald Trump, with the caption \"GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER.\" Don Lemon broke the news in a tearful address to the nation last night. \"Our democracy is over,\" he said. \"It doesn't exist anymore. I will never send another piece of mail ever again, and neither should you or else you're a racist.\"   Antifa and BLM responded by marching on local post offices and burning them down. Enthusiastic Trump supporters quickly bought up all the stamps. They are now selling for $3,000 apiece online.   \n",

All types of nerds, from social introverts to hardcore PC gamers, welcomed the dawn of this new era, privately from their own homes. \"I have been waiting my whole life for this moment,\" said Ned Pendleton, 32 -- via text message, of course -- as he fired up League of Legends on his beefy gaming PC. \"They told me to take up a sport and that the kids playing basketball and stuff were gonna be way more successful than us nerds who played Counter-Strike at LAN parties every weekend.\" \"They all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?\" To prepare for the onslaught of the deadly disease, nerds are changing absolutely nothing and are expected to rise up to rule the post-Coronavirus society, as they are the ones best adjusted to being sheltered in a basement, garage, or room for many days at a time marathoning Halo, Half-Life, The Legend of Zelda, Red Dead Redemption, or Horizon Zero Dawn. They're also ready for any post-apocalyptic wasteland, as they've played many, many hours of Fallout and are adept at killing bloatflies and collecting bottlecaps. Of course, many nerds are running out of hygienic products, but they say that's \"not an issue.\"   \n",
       "43  U.S. - With Epstein's infamous assistant Ghislaine Maxwell awaiting trial and testimony in prison, many celebrities, politicians, and entertainment industry elites are rushing to make pedophilia generally acceptable before they're outed as patrons of Epstein's notorious island. \"I'm not going to lie, this is going to be an uphill climb,\" said actor and director Rudy Allan, \"but it's absolutely necessary in order to prevent the entire world from seeing us as depraved perverts. Well, actually, I guess we don't mind that so much as we just want depravity and perversion to be considered completely valid sexual orientations. I mean, we're pretty much there already, just have to check off one last box.\" According to Allan, the movement is gaining unprecedented cooperation from across industries and international political positions. From an unnamed prince in a small country off the coast of France, to fashion industry moguls, to famous musicians and actors, the push to make pedophilia mainstream is gaining traction. \"The gay rights movement took 30-40 years, but the transgender movement really only took about 5-10 years,\" said a hopeful former US President from Arkansas who preferred to remain anonymous. \"At that rate, we should be able to make this thing happen by the end of the year!\" \"Honestly, the timing couldn't be better,\" says Oscar-winning actor Kelvin Smacey. \"If this whole Epstein Island thing had come out before we had fully integrated things like transgender children and Drag Queen Story Hour into mainstream values, we'd be totally doomed. Nowadays, we've got so many letters crammed into the whole 'LGBTQETC+' thing, nobody even notices if we slide a 'P' in there somewhere!\" In addition to those subtle changes, the ramp-up includes bolder strategies, such as a California proposal that will make it okay for 22-year-olds to have relations with 13-year-olds, a new streaming series about an 11-year-old girl defying her family's outdated traditions by dancing sensually, or simply tweeting pro-pedo slogans like \"love has no age\" from popular drag queen associations. While the momentum has recently increased, Allan says they've been laying down the groundwork for decades. \"I mean, we've got award-winning movies and shows featuring minors in sexual situations,\" Allan says. \"We've got drag shows for toddlers, school curriculum developed to get children thinking about exploring their sexuality really early on, and clothing lines designed to show off their bodies. We've implemented various strategies to reduce parental influence and protection over their children by weakening the family structure and encouraging promiscuity. And that's not even mentioning abortion. Like, once you're okay with casually slaughtering babies by the millions, how is anyone going to take issue with objectifying kids?\" According to Allan, next steps include Kidnapper Story Hour at the library, human sacrifices at public schools, a competitive reality TV series called Six-Year-Old Strippers, and outlawing millstones within 40 miles of any large body of water.   \n",

Hosts were seen with downcast expressions as they commented on the day's events, MAGA hats in place.  Sandmann says the hosts will be forced to wear the hats until they've learned their lesson, which could take a while. \"Just be careful you don't make an expression some could construe as 'smug.' Wouldn't want you to get punched or your lives to get ruined, or anything like that.\" CNN hosts must also finish every broadcast by saying, \"Good night, and I am a big, fat dummy, while Trump is the best president we've ever had.\" Brian Stelter requested an exemption and was allowed to wear a clown nose instead, as usual.   \n",

Water balloons. Water slides. Water beds. It's amazing. You can freeze it and make ice, I'm told. Ice is great for lots of things. Ice cream. Ice cubes. Igloos.\" \"Anyway, drink water.\" Horrified journalists scrambled to warn Americans not to drown themselves in their pools and bathtubs. \"Trump says water is good -- but this is very misleading,\" said Rachel Maddow. \"Did you know that water kills many people every year? These dangerous, unhinged remarks from the president could cause many to drown themselves. Plus, do you know what's hidden in water? Sharks. This president wants you to die from a shark attack!\" Representatives for various bottled water companies quickly released a statement distancing themselves from the president's remarks and warning everyone not to submerge themselves in the ocean for minutes at a time.   \n",

All hail Lucifer!\" Schultz declared, chanting in unison with Starbucks employees gathered at the press event. Christian groups expressed concern over the new design, but many believers were reportedly relieved that Starbucks was not promoting something like unity or tolerance with this year's cup design. Schultz ended the press conference by announcing that variant designs would be introduced throughout the holiday season depicting the number of the beast as well as quotes from prominent atheists and other anti-Christian personalities.   \n",

It just wouldn't make any sense.\" \"We really need to return to an era of honesty and integrity in our political leadership, like during my term for example,\" he concluded.   \n",

According to Osteen, Sheep's Clothing has already gotten several prominent pastors and teachers to endorse the line, including Benny Hinn, Creflo Dollar, Paula White, and Kenneth Copeland, among others. \"Whenever I want to blend in among the sheep, I always make sure my suit jacket's a Joel™,\" Benny Hinn says on a new TV spot advertising the formal men's wear. \"You're gonna like the way you look while you fleece the masses out of their hard-earned cash - I guarantee it.\" The suits went on sale at Lakewood Church's website this Sunday, starting around $20,000 each.   \n",
