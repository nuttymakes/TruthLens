Conferences of the smug are no match for Satan’s foot soldiers,"GOOD people who achieve squat in echo chambers with canapes – this was my initial reaction to the advent of two conferences focused on the crap state of the world. The first is thecurrent conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, otherwise known as ARC, foundedin June 2023. They meet in Londonistan. The second is the forthcoming Church and State conferencecoming soon to Brisbane. When funky acronyms, slick websites and bells and whistles arrive, you think: Hmm. Not to mention the comfortable on-stage couches and the being-among-friends vibe. And no room for 'deplorables' at £1,500 a throw, I'm told was the price of a ticket – with a £400 discount offered to people ARC wanted there, the rumour mill has it. The comfort of being right (in both senses of the term) without actually moving the needle. The contrast can be found in JD Vance, speaking truth to power in the den of his (and our) enemies in Munich. His harsh words about his audience of European globalist establishment grifters have gone around the world several times. They suggest bravura, intent, action, steely composure, truth and . . . Donald Trump, the figure that still makes many staid comfort-conservatives clench the buttocks. There is no greater exemplar of the performative conservative class than Greg Sheridan ofThe Australian. Peter Smith atThe New Catallaxynotes: '. . . he who no longer refers to Donald Trump as a despicable human being but who, so far as I can tell, has never apologised for so doing'. Indeed. Non-apologies count. Not in a good way. And are noted. These people are pathetic, really. They are content to be cerebral chin-strokers, while hoisting the white flag. Over and over again. Rod Dreher, a speaker at the ARC conference, summed up one of the key purposes of these events: 'Good morning from London, and the first day of the ARC conference. Big opening dinner for speakers and donors last night; as a speaker, I got to go. Was so, so great to see many old friends there . . . Just now, after breakfast, I walked out of the hotel restaurant, and there sat two of my favorite people in all the world . . . Oh happy day! Oh happy next three days!' Source: Rod Dreher emailed newsletter, February 19, 2025. Fellowship. I get it. All fine and dandy. We all need our mutual support mechanisms. But the line between 'fellowship' (Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, really?) and a dry gulch, an echo chamber, a right-of-centre ghetto, is a fine line indeed. Wonderful speakers at these endless conferences – some of whom I know and like – use beautiful words to make absolutely no impact on their enemies and ours. Douglas Murray left the audience of 4,000 'speechless'. I am sure he did. He is very, very good at this. You might agree with just about everything he said. That isn't the point. To repeat, our enemies are domestic Marxist revolutionaries, post-modernists, woke automatons, Chinese communist imperialists, Muslim colonialists, globalists seated in Europe, corporate fascists, American neocons and British liberal progressives parading in conservative clothes. I am yet to hear a single international conferencer pull all of this together. To address the real meta-problems. I say wonderful speakers. Not all are wonderful, though. Any conference that gives Michael Gove a slot and an invitation cannot be taken seriously. He was a two-timing sneak of a politician and, far worse, a covid criminal. The multi-millionaire who appointed Gove as editor of theSpectatorhappens to be the co-founder and co-owner of ARC, Paul Marshall, who also ownsGB News.The mob who sacked Mark Steyn and Dan Wootton. Neither of these heroes has a place, nor has Kathy Gyngell, myTCWeditor. Bilderberger Niall Ferguson, inevitably. Anyone who is a friend (and biographer) of Henry Kissinger isn't a friend of mine. Beautiful speaker, though. The inevitable Jordan Peterson is there. Both are on ARC'sexclusive Advisory Board. RFK Jr recently said: 'NOTHING is gonna be off-limits.' Source: Ed Dowd's Telegram channel, February 19, 2025. He was referring specifically to chronic disease investigation, but his words refer to much, much more than this. They are a call to action. They resonate. RFK Jr is feared by all the bad guys. Utterly feared. As is Kash Patel. As is Tulsi Gabbard. These people are impactful. Consequential. Far more importantly, they are revolutionary. If our circumstances are as dire as the ARC team suggest, why aren't THESE people there? Oh, of course, they are too busy across the Atlantic, actually doing things. A report intheTelegraphsaw the group as a corrective to the 'chaos' and 'excesses' in American conservatism during the rise ofDonald Trump. Could that still be their real purpose? The ARC has been billed as a right-wing competitor of Davos, no doubt because of its 'global leaders space' recruitment strategy. But those who see here some sort of conference equivalence entirely miss the point. Davos ain't a talkfest. The people who attend the Swiss Alps shindig are bad actors with power who do actually run the world. They are Satan's foot soldiers. Pitting an opposing talkfest against them takes us nowhere. This is a category error. I worked for a quarter of a century in economic development, generally at the local and regional level. I attended many conferences. Endless conferences. You felt good being there. Among friends. Being part of the smart set. But the one great insult across the years was that these endless meet-ups of the great and good, with their well remunerated keynotes, was 'talkfest'. That was always the greatest fear of delegates at these things and of observers. What was it all for? It was, in essence, performative. Process. Part of the deal. It hasn't changed. The sins of the performative conservative conference class are sins of omission, not of commission. I have mentioned the speakers not at the London conference. What about the topics not addressed? Covid: Will any of the speakers there expose the truths daily reported in the alt-media? Will Michael Gove apologise for his covid sins? Will Paul Marshall explain or seek to justify his sacking of Mark Steyn and friends? Nope. Will Niall Ferguson admit that the elites of whom he is a paid-up member admit that his ilk is the problem? The whole problem. The key word is 'smug'. No one suffering under the yoke of tyranny likes smug. They like anger-driven action that will free the oppressed. The grieved outsiders currently feel far more comforted by the 'nothing is gonna be off limits' view of the world articulated so well by RFK Jr and by the sheer determination of those who say it than by champagne swilling, globetrotting conservatives feeling good about life in London. Or in Brisbane. It is time to put a bit of stick about, not just to glory in being right (in both senses of the term). It is an irony that one of the most discussed topics at the London conference has been JD Vance's speech in Munich. Will any of them get the deep point here?",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-21T01:20:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/conferences-of-the-smug-are-no-match-for-satans-foot-soldiers/
Throwing the SAS under a bus,"THE relationship between the public, justice, the electorate and the law is getting more complex. Potentially it's been a worse one for the SAS, the Armed Forces and the Defence of the Realm. In an inquest that opened last year, acoroner has ruled that SAS soldiers did not need to use lethal forcein an operation in which four IRA terrorists were killed in 1992. A file is therefore being passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Unlesshe does the decent thing and resigns, Lord Hermer, Sir Keir Starmer's human rights lawyer pal, is unlikely to decide either that there is no case to answer (killing armed terrorists being the Army's job) or that it's so long ago that pursuing this is not in the public interest. Harmer might recuse himselfas one of his clients was former head of the IRA Gerry Adams. Don't hold your breath. Let's look at the facts, from the ground up. The rules of engagement for soldiers in Northern Ireland came from Parliament and were known as 'The Yellow Card' after the card carried and learned by rote by every soldier in the province. Soldiers in Northern Ireland had no more rights than a private citizen, so the provisions of the Yellow Card were pretty clear. Essentially soldiers were allowed to open fire on terrorists who were about to commit, were committing or had recently committed a terrorist act and there was no other way to stop them. Warnings were mandatory 'before opening fire unless . . . to do so would increase the risk of death or grave injury to you or any other person'. The Yellow Card never had statutory authority; soldiers who killed terrorists were subject to arrest and interrogation by local police to determine whether they had committed a crime. Read that again: any soldier who had just shot and killed a terrorist to protect you was almost immediately arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, or worse. Why? Because although the government sent him to uphold the law with a loaded rifle it didn't give him any special rights to use it. At one time during the Troubles soldiers were so concerned at the immediate consequences of shooting that they were failing to open fire at legitimate targets. The fundamental question for the soldier was 'Do I shoot now?' Confronting an armed terrorist, the soldier was making this decision under mortal peril and with massive time pressure. Arresting an armed terrorist – also in fear of his life – is far from straightforward. As there is no requirement in common or military law for soldiers recklessly to risk their life, taking the shot is usually the right answer. If they don't shoot the terrorist survives to kill, bomb and maim the public again. In this action four IRA men were returning to waiting getaway cars after an attack on the Coalisland police station; a total of ten IRA men were there. An SAS unit was waiting for them and they engaged the IRA men without warning. The four who attacked the police station were killed and three of the others were wounded. There is no doubt that the dead men were armed IRA terrorists. There is evidence that some of the dead were killed at close range when they were on the ground, having already been hit by multiple bullets. So what? The decision to kill them had been made when the first round was fired. Armed men are a lethal threat and, unlike in the movies, a hail of bullets seldom delivers instant death. A dying terrorist may have a grenade in his pocket, so he's still a threat to the soldier and his colleagues. A firefight and its aftermath are no place for the squeamish. The salient point is whether the 12 SAS soldiers opening fire believed they could find any way of arresting ten IRA men, at least four of whom were armed, at night in hostile territory. Clearly they thought not, hence they engaged. On the evidence before him the coroner thought differently, as is his right – indeed his duty.Last year he found that a similar action in 1991 which killed three IRA men was lawful. His independence is not in question, it's the law itself that is wrong. Now, 33 years later, the SAS men potentially face a criminal trial. Notwithstanding the coroner's opinion, that result seems wrong – 96 per cent of those polled by theTelegraphopposed it. At the time there was little sympathy for the IRA men outside the Irish Republican and Nationalist movements. The public were hugely supportive of the SAS and the armed forces then, as they are now. The law, as created by a selection of politicians of all parties over almost half a century, has failed. It's not just the elite SAS that are being failed, it's every serviceman and woman, and indeed the society they seek to defend. The deficiencies in the legal status of the combatants in the Ulster Troubles were known since it began. The failure to find an end to the arguments when peace came was rank moral cowardice that is all too typical of Westminster. In 2023 the Conservatives belatedly introduced the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to prevent this sort of prosecution. The Labour Party had a manifesto commitment to repealing it, because the High Court has found it in contradiction to, you guessed it, the European Convention on Human Rights. Hilary Benn is proud of introducing the repeal Act. When pressed, the likes of Hilary Benn, Lord Hermer and Two-Tier will say that the UK leaving the ECHR would send the wrong message to the world and damage our international reputation. They may go on and say that countries such as Russia aren't members of the ECHR. That entire argument is complete cant; it may make sense in a university debating club or over a glass of champagne in Matrix Chambers, but it's balderdash. The list of countries not in the ECHR incudes the United States, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Dubai – all top destinations for the wealthy fleeing the UK. One of the most powerful messages we sent to the world was when the SAS emerged from obscurity and ended the Iranian Embassy siege. The message was stark and clear: 'The UK does not deal with terrorists.' International terrorists steered well clear of us and the UK became a valued partner in the establishment of SAS-like units across the world. (Note for Lammy: that's what soft power looks like. It comes from having a very competent military that is feared globally, so other nations tread softly round your interests and seek your friendship.) Now Labour wants to throw the SAS and the rest of the armed forces under a legal bus rather than support them. It was a manifesto commitment in the general election, but no one noticed or kicked up about it. Why? Because the self-appointed intellectual elite wanted a left-wing coup – which is what the election turned out to be. Ex-KGB man President Putin must have laughed when the left triumphed here in July. Sixty years of sedition (the KGB's speciality) may have paid off too late for the Soviet Union, but it's done for us.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-17T01:18:00+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/throwing-the-sas-under-a-bus/
Monkeypox mania continues to take its toll on common sense,"WARS are so inconvenient, especially when they hamper the efforts of the public health lobby to eradicate the latest killer disease. Recently in our favourite source of manufactured anxiety about all things pandemicky,Global Health Now, there was a link to an article inThe East Africanunder the heading 'Conflict in the eastern DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] hampers fight against mpox'. The source of the news report was the XinHua News Agency, the press outlet of the Chinese Communist Party. Where accurate reporting on viruses is concerned, surely nothing can be read into that. Proving that monkeypox continues to be an epidemiological nonentity, as we have been at pains to point out in these pages for several years, for examplehere, the report says that this year alone in Africa diagnoses with monkeypox have surpassed 9,959 (so is that 9,960?) and deaths total 85. That puts the infection fatality rate of monkeypox at less than 1 per cent and an infection rate across Sub Saharan Africa (population 1,243,107,741) at 0.000081 per cent. Even if the figures applied only to the DRC (population 102.3million) the infection rate is 0.0097 per cent. Juxtapose that with the fact that fighting in the Congo has alreadyclaimed 700 livesthis year. Of course, death from an infectious virus is no laughing matter and monkeypox looks like a nasty infection to contract. However, in the developed world it is almost totally confined to gay men. In fact in the DCR, where most cases are reported, over 83% of monkeypox casesare linked to sex workand disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. It should also be considered, in relation to figures related to monkeypox from the DRC, that malnutrition is endemic there which puts people at greater risk of succumbing. According to theGlobal Hunger Index, the DRC scores fifth with Somalia in first place.Pregnant women and children are at most risk of malnutritionin the DRC. Fit and healthy people experience mild symptoms with little to fear from monkeypox. Even our own NHS, no stranger to whipping us into a frenzy about viral infections as with the recent 'quad-demic' which seems to have left most of us standing,says that monkeypox'is usually mild and can get better within a few weeks without treatment'. People in the DRC need food yet the WHO response to monkeypox is to push vaccines which, they say, are 'at the heart' of their response. That presumably includes monkeypox vaccines for babies which are being rolled outwithout clinical trials. After all, what could possibly go wrong? GAVI, otherwise known asThe Vaccine Alliance, are responsible for the distribution of vaccines in the DRC. They get their funding from many sources and they are closely linked to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which recently, along with the European Union, hosted a 'high level pledging summit' seeking funding from governments and 'Billanthropists' for the work of GAVI. GAVI, which hasreceived over $4.1billionfrom the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides, along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,18 per cent of the funding of the World Health Organization. The Foundation has a permanent seat on the board of GAVI. Clearly, such funding does not come without a few chains attached. According to the Gates Foundation,vaccines have become their biggest investment, raising the question of whether Gates expects a financial return on his investment. With79 per cent of the Gates Foundation stock holdings being in biotech companies, which manufacture vaccines, the Foundation has a vested interest in pushing vaccines worldwide. They did this effectively during the covid fiasco. Perhaps Bill Gates has enough money and is simply addicted to the power that vast wealth and philanthropy can buy. One thing is for sure, as explained by Daniel Jupp in his bookGates of Hell: despite his self-proclaimed efforts to give away his fortune, Bill Gates miraculously seems to get no poorer. Whatever happens in the world, people like Bill Gates continue to profit from the cycle of hysteria induced over non-existent pandemics: Gates invests in vaccine manufacture; Gates funds GAVI and the WHO; the WHOapproves and pushes vaccines; GAVI ensures that the vaccines are distributed and governments buy them; vaccine companies make money; Gates (probably) earns a return on his investment; Gates invests in vaccine manufacture . . . repeat. Monkeypox is simply the latest vector for vaccine-derived profit and the poor people of the DRC are simply the latest victims of the scam. I repeat: the people of the DRC need food, not vaccines.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-14T01:17:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/monkeypox-mania-continues-to-take-its-toll-on-common-sense/
When Panama defeated Trump’s forebears,"WHETHER Donald Trump carries out his threat that the US willtake back control of the Panama Canal– a warning he reinforced in his inauguration speech on January 20 – remains to be seen. Being partially of Scottish descent, perhaps he should be wary of venturing there; 326 years ago, the Isthmus of Panama saw one of the most woeful chapters in Scottish history unfold: the Darien Scheme. The ill-fated project was Scotland's attempt to break away from England's economic dominance and establish its own overseas empire. A company of investors was formed to found a colony, which would be named Caledonia, near the Gulf of Darien on the Caribbean/Atlantic Coast of the isthmus, about 200 miles east of today's Panama Canal. The ambitious aim was to open a land link to the Pacific Ocean, around 50 miles away. The investors envisaged establishing a thriving trade route across the isthmus, with a town to be called New Edinburgh as the entrepôt where tariffs would be charged. Gold mines and fertile plantations would add to the riches, and the wealth would flow back to Scotland. Instead, the dream died a squalid death in the swampy, rain-lashed, disease-ridden jungles of the isthmus, along with around 2,000 would-be colonists. There are several excellent books about Darien. One of the most accessible and comprehensive accounts is John Prebble'sDarien: The Scottish Dream of Empire(first published in 1968 asThe Darien Disaster). Prebble explains how the scheme came about at the end of the 17th century, amid the Scottish establishment's simmering resentment of England. Although both nations had shared a monarch since 1603, Scotland, which still had its own parliament and laws, was very much the poor relation. It languished under England's Navigation Acts, which crippled its seaborne commerce, whilst bad harvests and drought brought famine. The country was in an ever-deepening slough of despond. The initial driving force behind the Darien Scheme was William Paterson, a wealthy Scottish-born financier and trader who co-founded the Bank of England in 1694. He helped to form the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies to promote the project. However, its attempts to set up a base in London were thwarted by the East India Company and garnered the disapproval of the King, William III. William did not want to risk war with Spain, which claimed sovereignty over the Isthmus of Panama as part of its lucrative empire in the New World. In response, the Scottish company retreated to Edinburgh and made a public appeal for investors. The response was astonishing and, within weeks, around 1,500 Scots had raised £400,000, which was around 20 per cent of the wealth available in Scotland and equivalent to some £66million today. On July 14, 1698, five ships, carrying 1,200 pioneer colonists, set sail from Leith. The expedition was shambolic from the start. Beset by storms, fog and becalming, the fleet did not reach the Orkneys until early August. When it finally headed west into the Atlantic, there was a snag – no one knew exactly where Darien was. It was not until they reached the West Indies that they met up with an old buccaneer who agreed to guide them. Meanwhile, deaths began mounting from the bloody flux and fever. The fleet reached Darien on November 2 and, at first, it looked like the paradise they had envisaged. From an anchorage in a sheltered bay, the colonists went ashore and started clearing land for growing crops and building New Edinburgh in the form of wooden huts. However, planting proved difficult, and the tropical heat and incessant heavy rainfall made conditions intolerable (Darien is one of the wettest places on Earth). The local native Kuna (or Guna) tribes were friendly and brought gifts of plantains and fruit, but they were unwilling to buy the combs, mirrors and other trinkets the colonists had brought as trade goods. Meanwhile, King William had ordered the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean not to supply the Scots or give them help of any sort. Ships of other nations which occasionally anchored at Darien would only trade food and other supplies for gold, which the colonists did not have. To make matters worse, the leading colonists soon split into squabbling factions, the main division being between seamen and landsmen. The sailors lived aboard the ships in relative comfort and safety while the rest faced the brutal environment of the rainforest. Eventually, food began running out, as supplies that had been stored aboard the ships for months were rancid. Rationing was imposed, with colonists each getting just one pound of maggot-infested flour per week, but only those who could work were fed. As tropical fevers and malaria struck the starving hordes, deaths continued to mount; by Christmas Day, the total was 76 and, by March, there were 200 graves, with ten or 12 deaths per day. There was a brief moment of elation when Spanish troops were repelled in a jungle skirmish, but the fear of a stronger attack and the deteriorating conditions led to the colony being abandoned on June 18, 1699, leaving behind a cemetery with 400 graves. At least another 400 colonists died trying to get back to Scotland. Only one ship, theCaledonia, made it, arriving in November with just 300 men aboard. A second fleet of four ships, not knowing of the abandonment, had already been sent out to Darien three months earlier, carrying 1,300 people. Before they arrived on November 30, 160 had died en route. Expecting to be greeted by a thriving colony, one of the new arrivals wrote: 'We found nothing but a vast howling wilderness.' After coming under siege from the Spaniards, the colonists agreed to leave Darien, and it was finally abandoned on April 11, 1700. None of the ships returned to Scotland, with hundreds of those aboard dying en route to Jamaica, where they were refused help, or to the North American colonies. In all, around 1,000 are thought to have perished through sickness and shipwreck. Scotland's vision of a bounteous empire had turned to dust, and the recriminations were rancorous. The returned colonists were reviled as cowards, riots ensued, and those who had sunk their money into the scheme angrily counted the cost. Scapegoats were sought and in a scandalous act of vengeance, three innocent English sailors were hanged in Leith on a fabricated charge of piracy in April 1705. The collapse of the Darien Scheme is said to have helped push Scotland into signing the Acts of Union with England in 1707. One provision of the treaty was that Scotland would be paid a sum called 'The Equivalent' (£398,085) which would essentially repay the Darien investors their capital, plus five per cent interest. Today, New Edinburgh has been reclaimed by the jungle and the mangrove swamps; all that remains of it is a shallow defensive ditch dug by the colonists. There was some morsel of memory in that the bay where the fleet first arrived was known as Puerto Escocés (Scottish Harbour), but that has been renamed Sukunya Inabaginya in honour of a Panamanian general. However, all is not lost. In the nearby San Blas archipelago, the inhabitants have renamed theirsmall island Caledonia, in honour of the Scots who had arrived with such high hopes and left amid such heartbreaking failure.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-01T01:19:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/when-panama-defeated-trumps-forebears/
"Bravo, JD Vance, speaking up for real Europeans","We make no apologies for publishing a further response to JD Vance's seminal, possibly epoch-changing speech to EU leaders in Munich last Friday. On Sunday Dr Frederick Attenboroughrelayed the Vice President'sdevastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its Europeanallies. YesterdaySean Walsh analysed Vance's 'massacre'of the Euro commissars and their British counterparts. Today, from the USA, we have a vote of thanks from British-born Bernard Carpenter along with his excoriation of the outraged legacy media's response. THANK you, thank you, thank you so much, Vice President Vance, for expressing what so many ordinary Europeans feel. Your recent speech at the Munich Security Conference might have upset a few elitists but gave great pleasure to those who love free speech and freedom of conscience on both sides of the Atlantic and offered hope to those feeling crushed by open borders and the social pathologies to which mass immigration gives rise. Thank you, too, for giving permission to those who lament the demise of their national cultures and the Western/Christian civilisation which once gave a sense of common heritage and belonging to a continent that created the modern world. The horror on the faces of those gathered to hear the speech was a sight for sore eyes, a delicious pleasure for those of us who are supposed to keep our mouths shut and go along with all the woke nonsense for fear of being labelled as one of the myriad terms ending in 'ist'. How lovely it was to see those smug, holier-than-thou, highly credentialled, gilt-edged globalist aristocrats looking so outraged. How dare a man who grew up in poverty in the Appalachian Rust Belt have the temerity to lecture so august a body of technocrats on subjects such as the freedom of citizens to criticise their lords and masters and reject the godless ideologies they foist on those they govern? But dare he did and many here in America and in Europe are loving him for it. Needless to say, not all welcomed his speech. The legacy media reacted as you would expect.'Vance shocks Europe', blasted America's newspaper of record, theNew York Times, accusing him of defending 'a divisive far-right political party in Germany', presumably AfD (Alternative for Germany), although Vance did not mention it by name. Incidentally, which Europe is Vance accused of shocking – anti-mass-immigration Eastern Europe, the Europe of men and women struggling to make a living, fearful to go out at night due to high rates of crime, people who fear being arrested for posting on social media or expressing their Christian faith, Europeans who resent the rewriting of their histories and are deeply troubled by the rubbishing of their distinctive cultures, Jews compelled to hide their identity on the streets of European capitals due to rising rates of anti-Semitism? Surely none of those just listed. It goes without saying that it has in mind the Europe of technocratic elites who are now determining the fate of a once great civilisation according to their godless visions of utilitarian dystopias 'made more sinister', to quote Churchill, 'and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science'. Elsewhere in the paper, Vance is accused of 'attacking a German consensus on Nazis and speech . . . decades-long approaches to political extremism that were designed to prevent another Hitler'. CNN seeks to indict him for dealing in 'half-truths' and trying to reignite popularism in Europe, as if it needs any help from American politicians, but seriously undermines its journalistic authority when it describes the electoral disaster that the British Conservative Party suffered last year as proof that populism is past its peak in a Europe which is 'a little wiser now' than it was during Trump's first administration. If the Conservative Party is an example of populism, then I'm in line to become the next living prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. When it comes to the legacy media and their negative reactions to Vance's Munich speech, I could go on and on. It seems to have offended all the right people, theGuardianleading with the hysterical headline:'JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe's leaders'. The BBC even used the adjective'weird'to attack the speech, dusting off a word which was used to attack Trump and Vance last summer. It didn't work then, and it's unlikely to work now. The BBC at least got it right when it said that Vance'accused European governments of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech', but failed to consider the veracity of his accusation. Before I finish, allow me to list some of my thoughts on the now-infamous speech and why I and many others loved it. I loved it because Vance mentioned specific examples of how ordinary men and women have been negatively affected by their governments' authoritarian tendencies, people who have fallen foul of hate-speech laws that should have no place in a democratic society. Of course, such a list could become very long indeed, as we've seen over the last 20 years or so. But by naming people such as Adam Smith-Connor, found guilty of praying outside an abortion clinic in my home town of Bournemouth, and alluding to other examples of those prosecuted for exercising their God-given rights to express themselves freely, Vance has put a face on this Orwellian evil. Above all, I loved his speech because he articulated what millions of Europeans are thinking but are too cowed by the increasingly authoritarian administrative state to express themselves for fear of the very real possibility of punitive consequences. And, my dear elites, stop using fear of another Hitler as an excuse to stifle free speech. Arresting people who criticise feminism or tell tasteless jokes will do nothing to prevent the return of fascism, but unrestricted immigration and draconian restrictions on free speech will drive decent men and women into the arms of those on the supposedly 'far right' that the left claims to be the greatest existing threat to liberal democracy at a time when Europe is importing millions of immigrants who despise everything liberal democracy claims to stand for. The spell has been broken, and we must be grateful to Vice President Vance for making that clear to those assembled in Munich to hear him speak so plainly and so forcefully.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-19T01:19:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/bravo-jd-vance-speaking-up-for-real-europeans/
RFK has the vaccine cultists in a spin,"IF HE sticks to his word, Robert F Kennedy Jr will be a bull in a china shop, causing havoc and shattering egos and ethically dubious contracts in the lucrative governmental-pharmaceutical complex. During his pre-confirmation grilling by senators, RFK seemed to backtrack on many of his stances, but perhaps this was playing the game to ensure his approval. He is now Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services, so let's hope for some real changes. Certainly his opponents fear that he will disrupt established relationships between federal agencies, universities, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry. Not having online access, I sometimes buy theNew York Timesto observe how the progressive elite maintains its version of truth in the face of a 'populist' onslaught. Monday's edition was startling. While controversies rage over Ukraine, the Middle East, the Mexican border, tariffs and a blaze of presidential executive orders, the biggest villain forNew York Timescolumnists is not Trump but RFK. The opprobrium is intense: the three leading opinion pieces were all directed at the former Democrat's threat to the status quo in medicine and public health. Given the substantial funding of mainstream media, directly by Bill Gates and indirectly by Big Pharma, it would not be too far-fetched to suspect that theNYTis appeasing its paymasters. 'Sorry, Mr Kennedy, most Americans want their shots' was the preposterous headline of one of the columns. According toCaitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, while there are many things that divide American public opinion, everyone agrees that 'vaccines are good'. That's all vaccines, whatever their stage of development and testing, and whatever their safety and effectiveness. 'Vaccines remain enormously popular', Rivers boasts, as if she's writing about a brand of soft drink rather than biochemical injections. The majority of Americans don't take the flu shot, so people don't necessarily agree with her. The Amish don't take any vaccines at all, and they're the healthiest folk. And at least a fifth (probably more) refused the 'Fauci Ouchy' despite the punitive covid mandates. Rivers is concerned that hundreds of Americans are dying every week from covid, although she doesn't note whether they've had the supposedly life-saving vaccine. Rivers bemoans a research finding that college students who read a 'falsely balanced' report on vaccine safety were led to believe that the evidence was not as settled as the medical establishment claims. Rivers shows herself as a vaccine cultist who will not hear any contrary argument. Vaccines must remain routine, and referring to RFK she concludes that 'leaders who undermine this basic tool may find themselves on the wrong side of both science and voters'. I thought that the vaccines were meant to be lauded as a 'miracle of science' rather than a 'basic tool', and as for voting, RFK was appointed on a manifesto of Trump's electoral landslide. Another column issues a deadly warning about RFK. According toGregg Gonsalves, another epidemiologist (Yale School of Public Health), 'just asking questions' is a silly notion of vaccine and virus sceptics. In South Africa, he asserts, more than 300,000 people died as a consequence of an ignorant political leader denying science. RFK doubts the official narrative that HIV causes Aids, attributing this to a conspiracy by the former head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Gonsalves regards RFK's carefully researched bookThe Real Anthony Faucias a work of fiction. Like the health minister of Thabo Mbeki's government in Pretoria, who denied the HIV-Aids link and promoted a diet, RFK is dealing in 'debunked canards' and 'science denialism'. For Gonsalves, RFK is more dangerous than Mbeki, and he looks forward to when 'our own Manto Tshabalala-Msimang leaves in disgrace'. He notes that once Mbeki and his health minister were gone, South Africa developed the largest antiretroviral drug programme in the world. But he has nothing to say about the iatrogenic hazard of these drugs, which are suspected of killing singer Freddie Mercury among many others. The leading column was written by former NIH directorHarold Varmus, who believes that the Trump administration and the appointment of RFK 'endangers public health'. Varmus moans that 'never before have I seen my profession so politicised as it is now', arguing that 'the executive branch is waging war on American scientific enterprise'. Scientists working for federal departments cannot focus on research grant applications because they are worried about their jobs. Varmus is scathing on RFK: 'One of the country's most notorious vaccine critics is now the health secretary, despite his history of spreading misinformation, his disparagement of the Department of Health and Human Services staff, and his bizarre and immature behaviour.' RFK and other cranks are still linking vaccines to autism, Varmus claims, long after this was fact-checked. But the suspected causal connection has never been disproved, and there is a clear temporal relationship between autism diagnoses and the steady increase in childhood vaccinations. How many injections would Varmus, Rivers and Gonsalves want before they too start asking questions? Varmus also railed against covid sceptic and likely NIH director Jay Bhattacharya, for his 'outlandish proposal' to deprive institutions that suppress academic freedom of NIH funding. Vaccines must be protected at all costs. The three columnists all believe that after Trump and RFK depart, everything will go back to normal. But more and more people have become aware that Big Pharma and its money-spinning vaccines are not primarily for their benefit. Shots are now being fired at the fraudulent 'experts' and profiteers, who may never get back on their undeserved pedestal. Nevertheless, there is much to be done to make America healthy again.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-19T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/rfk-has-the-vaccine-cultists-in-a-spin/
What does Dom Cummings know about covid that we don’t?,"DOMINIC Cummings wantsregime change. 'To the max', he says. His opening salvo came, without any hint of irony, last Armistice Day. Alleging there's been a 'criminal cover-up' by a network of official scientists headed by Dr Anthony Fauci, Cummings said on X: 'The Fauci network should be rolled up & retired en masse with some JAILED.' [His emphasis] Very much hope one of the first things new administration does is say: we are publishing ALL the files on covid, lab leak, funding of gain of function, Fauci, the international correspondence on lab leak including with leading UK scientists and government, there will be public... Claiming the 'old regime lied and destroyed trust', Cummings called for the incoming Trump Administration to publish 'ALL hidden information on the covid vaccine' and 'ALL the files on covid, lab leak, funding of gain of function, Fauci, the international correspondence on lab leak including with leading UK scientists and government.' The news of outgoing President Biden's pre-emptive pardon for Fauci, backdated to early 2014, will surely have come as a disappointment to Cummings, but what's he really after? He's calling on the Trump administration Mark 2 to inform on its prior incarnation. Cummings's belief is that Whitehall is blocking an investigation into 'how and why' Boris Johnson was given 'monumentally false adviceand encouraged to pass on this duff advice to the world' over the 'lab leak' theory of SARS-CoV-2 origins. [His emphasis] He's had a public gripe with the Cabinet Office since January 2024 over one page of his Covid-19 Inquiry Witness Statement having been redacted by the Cabinet Office on 'national security' grounds. 'When I checked with the Inquiry they confirmed this means thatthe judge also will not see such redactions– even though the joke Inquiry fought legal action to get access to private messages on the basis it needsall informationto judge the ""general context"" of decisions', wrote Cummings, adding: 'Clearly this doesnotinclude absolutely critical information on ""general context"" that would embarrass Whitehall.' [All emphases are his] Evidently, there is information that Cummings is aware of that is not in the public domain which he sees as being in his interests to be publicly known. Call it an insurance policy against any future criticism over his role in pushing the Prime Minister into putting the entire country under house arrest, while simultaneously enabling pharmaceutical interests and their academic partners to avail themselves, like pigs at a trough, of lavish public subsidy. All for the greater good, of course. For a pyromaniac anarchist such as Cummings, the pandemic was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experiment from the centre of power, with his pre-formed vision for government reform and the loosening of procurement rules he desired to achieve it. Once all the guardrails were removed because it was an alleged emergency,all the risk taken to unleash enterprise and deliver science-led economic growth could be socialised while the eye-watering corporate profits were privatised. The 'monumentally false advice' and embarrassing critical information Cummings appears most interested in are the 'lab leak' theory and theProximal Originspaper which was organised by Sir Jeremy Farrar in February 2020 to promote his preferred SARS-CoV-2 origin story, that it was a zoonosis: an animal virus that evolved naturally to infect humans. In retrospect the very idea that an inert piece of genetic code encased in protein incapable of surviving outside a host cell has a preference for survival in any particular living species is another unexplained oddity. Nevertheless the objective was to restrict questions about SARS-CoV-2 to those two options. This excluded closer examination of other possibilities: flu had been rebranded to create a profit bonanza for pharmaceutical companies; that there was no new virus but that via thenocebo effectpeople's own minds, stoked by fear, were making them sick; or the most sinister, that there had been an intentional release of a lab engineered virus in China by people outside Chinawho were already developing countermeasures. 'Whitehall's top scientists and the top intelligence officials walked into the PM's office and told the PM and me that lab leak ""is definitely false"" and ""a conspiracy theory"",' says Cummings. Ever the contrarian, he says he knew they couldn't have been right because 'James Phillips, a scientist and original ""weirdo & misfit"", said to me: their confidence is totally misplaced, there are MANY highly suspicious signals – and he was clearly right.' Cummings doesn't name the top Whitehall scientists in question but presumably Lord (Patrick) Vallance, then the Chief Scientific Adviser, wasn't amongst them.Sir Jeremy Farrar says in his bookSpikethat on January 31, 2020, the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) finally wrung a recommendation to issue a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) declaration out of its emergency committee at the third time of asking, it was Vallance who informed the UK intelligence agencies of suspicions, raised the day before by Dr Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Institute in California, that the virus was laboratory-engineered. By informing the intelligence agencies Vallance elevated the Chinese pneumonia outbreak to a biodefense and national security threat, activating the preconditions for the use of Regulation 174 to authorise an unlicensed vaccine to stop the spread of a pathogen. Farrar says Fauci informed US intelligence the same day and for good measure the Australian government were informed by Dr Eddie Holmes, the man who publicly released the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2 on January 10, a day before the China Center for Disease Control made it public. Vallance was the prime mover of the Vaccine Taskforce inside government. He convened a 'preliminary Sage meeting' on January 22, while the WHO preliminary field visit to Wuhan was already under way, in the expectation that the World Health Organization would declare a PHEIC. Then, says Farrar, on January 27 Vallance convened his first meeting on developing vaccines and therapeutics. Another proponent of the lab leak version of the origin story is President Trump's newly confirmed Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), John Ratcliffe. He served as director of National Intelligence for the final year of Trump's first term when corona-madness gripped the world. Soon after Ratcliffe's confirmation, the CIA said that they believed SARS-CoV-2 arose due to a lab leak from Wuhan although they described this assessment as 'low confidence'. The lab leak story has Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance as the arch-villains funding dangerous research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who were responsible for it leaking because they had poor biosafety standards. This framing is favoured and promoted heavily by former Assistant Secretary for Preparedness & Response (ASPR) Dr Robert Kadlec who has been industriously muddying the waters since he left office in January 2021 having successfully delivered his Manhattan Project for Biodefense which we know as Operation Warpspeed. Under international law, countermeasures, even medical ones such as the now widely used but inadequately tested mRNA ones the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) designed and which Moderna and BioNTech commercialised for them (they license the same patent from the NIAID), may be used only in response to an illegal act by a foreign state. The lab leak is a cover story, but it's an important one that needs to be maintained at all costs. Cummings appears to remain as convinced now as he was in 2020 that SARS-CoV-2 arose from a lab leak and therefore the lockdowns and the Vaccine Taskforce that he was so intimately involved with were justified. While he appears to remain unable to see that launching a new mode of gene therapy vaccines was the entire object of the exercise,an X post on December 11suggests that he has a further grievance. Having said that the Vaccine Taskforce wouldn't have happened without him and Vallance forcing it on the Cabinet Office he wrote, 'The old regime jabbers nonsense about ""disinformation"" – the true disinformation is the old regime working with the vaccine companies & some official scientists to HIDE data that we PROMISED would be published.' Cummings is suggesting that an aspect of the agreement that he had with Vallance when the Vaccine Taskforce was set up has been abandoned. He believes the withholding of certain information is having 'catastrophic effects on trust in vaccines and science in general'. I don't know exactly what information he's after, but I'm intrigued. The FDA has already released all the data from the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine trials after a successful court challenge. The data that is being hidden with the complicity of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is real world safety data. Perhaps he's seen the light and is trying to get out of the path of the oncoming train.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-17T01:16:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/what-does-dom-cummings-know-about-covid-that-we-dont/
Fix Britain before lavishing OUR cash on these bonkers projects around the world,"IF, LIKE me, you've been watchingTrump 2then you will no doubt have been followingthe debateabout USAID. In recent days, Donald Trump,Elon Muskand Secretary of State Marco Rubio have all suggested that for too long the organisation which oversees foreign aid spending has been run by 'radical left lunatics' and riddled with fraud, corruption and waste. Ever since TeamTrumpreturned to power, social media has been filled with one astonishing revelation after another about how American taxpayers' dollars have been used to bankroll some truly bizarre, pointless, far-left projects around the globe, with much of this money going to people who basically hate America and the West. Like the $1.5millionthat's goneon 'advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces'. The $47,000 on funding 'a transgender opera' in Colombia. Or the $2million on sex changes in Guatemala – seriously. All of which raises an intriguing question for those of us looking on from across the pond, and one that my friend Douglas Murrayasks intheSpectatorthis week. Given that Americans have finally seen sense on foreign aid, when will the British? It's a good question. After all, am I the only person on these islands who finds it utterly mind-boggling that despite the British people grappling with the worst cost-of-living crisis since the Second World War, and a country which is visibly in managed decline, their leaders in Westminster are still sending an eye-watering£15.3billionof taxpayers' money every year to people overseas? Am I the only one, furthermore, who cannot understand why, such is the abysmal state of our National Health Service that we are leaving millions of British people on record-long hospital waiting lists and treating them in hospital corridors and car parks while sending, in 2023, some £250million to Ukraine, £164million to Ethiopia, £115million to Afghanistan, £109million to Syria, £100million to Yemen, £99million to Nigeria, £97million to Somalia, £64million to Pakistan (or £133million this year), £62million to Brazil, and £57million to Bangladesh? And am I the only one who struggles with the fact that we have just taken winter fuel payments off British pensioners to save a paltry £1.5billion and are smashingfamily farmsto raise just £500million while our leaders are sending millions in foreign aid to China and India, which have been sending people into space? Am I the only one who thinks all this is completely and utterly insane? Not so, according to recent polling. While you certainly won't hear about it among theelite classin Westminster, for whom foreign aid, likemass immigrationand woke idiocy, is a sacred value that can never be challenged, the reality in the country is that nearlytwo-thirdsof British people want to see the amount we spend on foreign aid sharply reduced. And you know what? If you look at the following list of projects that British taxpayers are funding overseas, you'll soon conclude they are entirely right to think this way. Here, as a starter, are ten projects (taken from the Government website) that hardworking British taxpayers are funding overseas while their own country and people decline. 1.Empowering institutions and civil society in Palestine Don't worry about empowering our collapsing public sector institutions and fraying communities here in Britain. Why? Because the British state is too busy sending your money to improving the 'viability, legitimacy and inclusion of governance and service delivery, protecting and supporting civic space, and empowering women in Palestine'. Empowering women in Palestine? Good luck with that. What about empowering the hundreds of thousands of women and girls here in Britain who were assaulted by therape gangsand now deserve a full national inquiry (one, apparently, we cannot afford)? Total budget: £35,499,984 2.Climate adaptive farming in Nepal While the British state issmashing family farmsto raise a few hundred million for Rachel from Accounts, your hard-earned taxes are going towards 'building climate adaptive farming opportunities and improved livelihoods for women and marginalised groups in Nepal'. What about the very marginalised and vulnerable people within our own rural communities who are being smashed to pieces by Net Zero policies, new taxes, and an urban elite minority that clearly hates their way of life? Can they not be prioritised for once? Total budget: £1,813,574 3.Protecting workers' rights and decent employment for Syrian refugees and migrant workers in Turkey Wondering why millions of British people are out of work and relying on welfare? Think we should create programmes to get them off benefits and back into work? Well, hold that thought because right now the British state is too busy sending a big chunk of your money to support a 'Refugee Response Programme' in Turkey, which includes 'promoting decent working conditions for refugees' and something called the 'Coordinating Group of the Global Coalition for Social Justice', which advocates for, you guessed it, social justice ideology. So we are paying to help Syrian refugees and migrant workers in Turkey find decent work while somehow being unable to get one in nine Brits off out-of-work benefits and back into employment. Total budget: £18,111,761 4.LGBT+ rights around the world Another generously funded programme will, I quote, 'transform the lives of millions of LGBT+ people around the world by reducing violence and discrimination against the LGBT+ community and by improving access to services and legislative reform'. I have no idea what any of that means but it's clear this involves transferring money from British taxpayers to 'grassroots LGBT+ organisations'. This is very clearly yet anotherDiversity, Equality and Inclusion(DEI) initiative with no stated goal or expected outcome beyond the very vague 'inclusion and diversity'. How about we suspend this programme for a while and use the enormous budget to instead pay for 113,000 winter fuel payments for British pensioners? Just a thought. Total budget: £34,000,000 5.Supporting 'knowledge sharing' in India This fund supports India's development 'through innovations, evidence-building, and knowledge-sharing, while co-designing interventions with Indian and UK institutions to inform policies and promote sustainable outcomes'. I don't know what that means either. What I do know is that devoting large sums to 'sharing knowledge' in India, which has vast economic resources and its own space programme, does not seem like a productive way to use taxpayers' hard earned money. Total budget: £729,393 6.Teaching languages to children in the Arab world Don't worry about declining standards inBritish schoolsor the disastrous impact of endless covid lockdowns on British kids, because the British state is too busy splashing cash on teaching languages to children in the Arab world. This programme sends money to 'socially disadvantaged children' in Arab nations, which some will think could be better spent helping kids who are falling through the cracks in many of our own working-class communities – kids who, let's be honest, are less fashionable and interesting to the elite class than kids in the Arab world. Total budget: £1,520,612 7.Funding feminists in Iraq Don't worry about the British women and girls who were raped, abused and harassed across 50 British towns – we can't afford anational inquiryfor them. What we can afford right now is to give millions to 'grassroots, women-led, feminist civil society organisations and women's rights organisations in Iraq'. What the British taxpayer really needs is to spend money on 'fostering women's meaningful participation in society and decision making in Iraq'. Total budget: £5,000,000 8.Helping obese children in China China is one of the most developed nations on the planet with enormous technology and resources at its disposal. So why, you might ask, is British taxpayers' money going to help 'urban populations' in China which 'show a rapid rise of obesity owing to unhealthy diets and imbalanced energy intake'? Seriously, why on earth are we giving money to this when, I think at least, we should be spending this money on the estimated 4.3million children who are living in poverty here in Britain? Total budget: £1,006,949 9.Climate change, gender, equality and social inclusion in Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania Here's another classic. Your money is being spent on conducting 'country-level studies in Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania'. Working closely with key actors from government, the private sector and civil society, this project 'will update previous studies on the economic costs of climate change and costs of adaptation to include gender equality and inclusion dimensions'. More money no doubt for a bunch of academics to travel to these nations, hold conferences and write reports nobody will ever read. More pointless work, more waste, at your expense. Total budget: £901,275 10.Governance and Climate Engagement in Nigeria Last but not least, another example of taxpayer cash being spent on a country that is perfectly capable of funding its own work on 'governance and climate change challenges', namely Nigeria. Once again, we encounter a sea of meaningless terms such as 'governance challenges' and 'tackling social exclusion', with no real detail on what this money is being spent on or how the effectiveness of these programmes will be evaluated, if they are evaluated at all. It is, put simply, anotherwokeinitiative disguised as a valuable intervention and one that will yield no visible benefit to the British taxpayer who is funding it to the tune of some £40million. Total budget: £38,799,273 I could go on. I could point to the£1.3millionBritish people are giving to 'increase the representation of women in the Mauritian renewable energy sector' —a country that is also demanding that we give up the Indian Ocean territory. Or I could show how British taxpayers'have bankrolledChinese opera, cycle lanes in Mexico and road schemes in Malaysia, supporting parts of the world that are often richer than regions here in Britain. But I think you get the point. Despite already living through one of the worst cost-of-living crises on record, and despite the hardworking British people having already been forced to hand over billions to fund the elite's obsession withmass immigration,Net Zero, and their failure tofix our broken borders, they are also having to fork out some £15.3billion on often pointless and absurd projects in other parts of the world. I simply do not think this is right or fair. It is neither treating British taxpayers with the respect and decency they deserve nor offering them value for money. Which is exactly why, when I travel across the country giving speeches and talks to the Forgotten Majority, I often come back to this key point. Let's fix Britain first before helping the rest of the world!

The climate scaremongers: We’re all going to drown! – Part 98,"BY THE end of the century, cities such as London, Hull and Cardiff will be under the sea, says the latest research. Now where have we heard that before? It is of course exactly the same scam they wheel out every year to scare the public witless in the hope of persuading them to give up fossil fuels and return to the Dark Ages for their sins. TheDaily Mailhave fallen for this latest crock of nonsense, hook line and sinker. They report: 'The idea of entire cities being plunged underwater might sound like the plot of the latest science-fiction blockbuster. But it could become a reality in just 75 years, according to a terrifying study. 'Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, have predicted that global sea levels could rise by a staggering 6.2ft (1.9metres) by 2100 if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions continue to increase [meaning that] towns and cities around the world could be plunged underwater – including Hull, London and Cardiff. ' The article is full of images of cities under water, including the 305ft Statue of Liberty with only her torch above the surface. It also features maps highlighting the areas of the country which would be flooded, courtesy of the Green Blob-funded climate lobbyists Climate Central. This new research basically takes the already absurd UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts of sea level rise and doubles them. Meanwhile back in the real world, sea levels around Britain have been rising at the same steady rate of around 2mm a year since the late 19thcentury, long before supposed 'man-made global warming' began. And the rate is not even accelerating, as often falsely claimed. The chart below for The Battery, New York, shows the massive disconnect between actual sea level rise and the various official projections. Of course we've had silly scare stories like this one for years now. As long ago as 1957, physicist Dr Joseph Kaplan was warning that the oceans would rise by 40ft in the 'next 50 or 60 years'. In 1983, the US Environmental Protection Agency reported that sea level could rise as much as 11ft by the end of the 21stcentury. In 1989, the director of the UN Environment Program claimed that entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels by 2000, while in 1995 the IPCC's scientists said that most of the beaches of the US east coast would have disappeared within 25 years. One of the leading climate scientists of recent decades, James Hansen, then head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, was very specific in 1988. He claimed that New York's West Side Highway would be under water within 40 years. Needless to say, the highway is still there and full of traffic. As for the Maldives, the perennial poster child for sea level scares, not only are the isles not under the waves now, but they have carried on building airports and holiday complexes as if they were going out of fashion. The simple fact is that sea levels around the world have been rising at the same barely measurable rate since the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-19thcentury. There is fully documented evidence that glaciers from the Alps to Alaska and from South America to New Zealand began retreating at this time, and often at much faster rates than now. There is also plentiful evidence of rapid glacier growth during the Little Ice Age, historically documented at the time in Switzerland, for instance, and the discovery of trees uncovered by melting glaciers in Alaska and Patagonia which have been carbon-dated back to the Middle Ages. The gradual rise in sea levels we see now is part of a much longer cycle of events. London did not disappear beneath the waves in the Middle Ages, and it won't this time either. It's only money! ED Miliband has handed another £2billion of your money in subsidies to the Drax power station in North Yorkshire so that they can carry on burning virgin forests for another four years. In any normal world, this would be the very definition of insanity. The current contract for three of the four units at Drax expires in 2027, having already netted them an estimated £8billion in subsidies. Miliband is so desperate for the reliable dispatchable electricity they produce that he has agreed a four-year extension at even higher prices. This is despite the undoubted environmental damage they cause by burning wood pellets. The new agreed price is £158/MWh at today's prices, and this will go up with inflation every year. Currently, depending on market prices, Drax typically earns about £140/MWh. Given that the wholesale market price for electricity has been around £70/MWh for most of the last year, the cost of subsidising Drax will be around £2billion, all paid for on electricity bills. The higher price will also apply to the fourth unit, which has a separate contract that runs to 2031 at a price of £138/MWh. Miliband has tried to justify this latest piece of profligacy by quoting an 'independent' analysis by business management consultant Baringa, which claimed that the deal couldsave consumers £3.1billion.This analysis was far from independent, though, having been commissioned by Drax themselves for the purpose of lobbying the government. In reality, gas power stations are supplying electricity at half the price offered to Drax, so Baringa's claims do not hold water. Burning wood pellets in power stations is even more polluting than coal, as they are less energy dense. (I am talking here of real pollutants, not CO2). The practice is also responsible for widespread environmental devastation in North America, where Drax sources most of its wood. Environmentalists there have been alarmed for several years at the impact on virgin forests, where whole swathes of woodland are being cut down for pellet mills. Drax maintains it uses only offcuts and waste wood, but this is disputed by locals who testify to seeing lorries full of whole tree trunks trucked into pellet plants owned by Drax. The BBC'sPanoramareported on this last year – seehere. The logic of using biomass is that when the forests regrow, the carbon emitted from burning will be reabsorbed by replacement forest. But this new growth will take decades, by which time yet more trees will have been cut down and burnt. Moreover evidence from America suggests that these forests will never grow back again, certainly not for a long time. They have taken centuries to get to the stage they are now, and there is no interest in replanting them. The whole thing is, of course, a con. The EU says that emissions from biomass don't count in countries' CO2 budgets, so it offers an alternative to gas, the emissions from which do count towards Net Zero. Neither the EU or UK care that more carbon dioxide is actually being pumped into the air when Drax is switched on, not less.

Ruling that declares: Hamas welcome here,"THE headline in theDaily Telegraphreads: 'Court gives Gazans right to settle in UK.' It would have been more appropriate to have said 'Court writes final UK suicide note.' The family of six from Gaza who were granted entry used the Ukraine Family Scheme as a vehicle to obtain the right to come to the UK. Their application was initially refused by a lower-tier immigration tribunal because of the obvious issue of it being outside the Ukraine programme's rules, and also that Parliament decides which countries benefit from any resettlement schemes. But, of course, the decision was appealed against. An upper tribunal judge overturned the lower court's decision using the ubiquitous 'Article 8 right to a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)' argument. The judge in question, Hugo Norton-Taylor, demonstrates again the two-tier character of our judiciary. In this case, it is elevating the court above Parliament and indeed the law itself, by putting a concept of 'human rights' above the actual rules. He noted that the family were facing a humanitarian crisis as a consequence of the Israeli government's indiscriminate attempts to eliminate Hamas – a leftist anti-Israel canard espoused by a judge in a court ruling. This is not democracy; it is Leftist Woke demagoguery. The judge is the son of Richard Norton-Taylor, a formerGuardianjournalistrenowned for his anti-Israel beliefswho last year endorsed a petition calling for Haringey council in north London to 'stop supporting genocide in Palestine'. This decision could well accelerate the numbers entering our country with alien cultures that actively seek to alienate ourselves from our own country, by changing the basis of our society, laws, morality and culture. The Gazan family come from a population that voted in a proscribed terrorist organisation on the ticket of global genocide of Jews and eradication of a democratic country. An overwhelming majority of that population still support Hamas and its actions and goals. Large numbers took part in the October 7 pogrom and subsequent detainment and abuse of hostages. Those actions included the murder and kidnapping of British citizens. These are people we should not be allowing into our country – we have enough problems with the Islamists and Hamas supporters already in our midst. There are two million Gazans. How many will hope to use this ruling as a precedent to gain entry to the UK? How many will be Hamas operatives? How many will have taken part in October 7? How many of them were involved in the imprisonment and abusing of Israeli hostages? Sir Keir Starmer, under public scrutiny at PMQs, has said Judge Norton-Taylor made 'the wrong decision' and added: 'It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration, it should be the government that makes the policy, that is the principle, and the Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole which we need to close in this particular case'. Starmer refused to answer Kemi Badenoch's question of whether he will bring forward new legislation or amend his Borders Bill to stop any would-be immigrants from any country in conflict around the world coming into the UK. The Prime Minister obfuscated and deflected, and asserted that Labour were taking control of the immigration issue. However, Lord Hermer, the Attorney General, has recently stated that this government will abide by all international law and conventions, and will never leave the ECHR: so exactly how Starmer intends to control immigration, when leaving judges the gaping loophole of the ECHR, and its all-encompassing Article 8 get-out-of-jail-free card, for all aspiring immigrants is beyond comprehension. Lots of hot air, waffle and hopes that this will all go away and be forgotten in the ever-churning news cycle. Our country is out of control, in the hands of madmen and women who have no wisp of common sense, being steered by a dysfunctional moral compass, and with an apparent hatred of Britain and its indigenous working-class citizenry. We might as well put up a sign on the cliffs of Dover saying 'Roll up, roll up, Hamas supporters welcome. Come and drive the last Jews out of Britain.' Our suicide note to the world.

JD Vance blasts Britain’s thought police in explosive Munich speech,"IN AN extraordinary address at the Munich Security Conference, US Vice President JD Vance warned that the greatest threat to Western democracies was not external aggression but the erosion of free speech within their own societies. Britain, he argued, was leading the charge in policing thought, with European nations following close behind. Vance'sspeech, widely expected to focus on geopolitics and the war in Ukraine, instead delivered a devastating critique of the systematic suppression of dissent by Britain and its European allies. Invoking the Cold War, he argued that the West once defined itself in opposition to regimes that criminalised dissent and censored opposing views. Yet now, he said, it was Western governments adopting such tactics themselves. 'Unfortunately,' he said, 'when I look at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners.' He went on to suggest that European elites, rather than upholding the democratic principles they claim to champion, had become fixated on controlling speech and political outcomes. 'Now, to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic,' he said, 'it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don't like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election.' Vance argued that curbing free expression in the name of political stability was a self-defeating strategy. 'I believe that dismissing people, dismissing their concerns or, worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy,' he said. In a speech liberally sprinkled with examples of free speech suppression, Vance reserved his sharpest criticism for the UK, as a society in which the government was increasingly encroaching on matters of individual conscience, treating religious expression as a form of subversion. He referencedAdam Smith-Connor, a British Army veteran who was found guilty of breaking the Government's new Buffer Zones Law (the catchily titledPublic Order Act 1986 (Amendment) (Abortion Clinics) Regulations 2023) which criminalises silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person's decision within 200 metres of an abortion facility. Successive UK governments have argued that such zones are necessary to prevent harassment outside clinics, though critics contend that the measures criminalise peaceful expression. Smith-Connor was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution. In Scotland, too, he noted, new legislation has led to concerns over the policing of private prayer. 'This last October [...] the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called ""safe access zones"", warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law. Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe,' he said. The letter, referenced by Vance, was sent following the passage of theAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Actin June 2024, which makes it an offence to attempt to influence someone's decision to access, provide, or facilitate abortion within 200 metres of an abortion clinic. Is his claim accurate? Technically, yes. While the law does not explicitly criminalise private prayer inside homes,the letter warnedthat activities in private residences could be unlawful if they were 'intentionally' or 'recklessly' visible or audible within the buffer zone. Official notes to the legislation cite the example of a resident inside the safe access zone displaying anti-abortion signs with the intent of deterring access to abortion services. In theory, a resident who prayed loudly enough to be heard outside, perhaps leaving windows and doors open, and especially with the aid of amplification, could also be in violation. Vance did not spare the rest of Europe. He criticised EU officials – or 'EU Commission commissars' as he termed them – for their threats to shut down social media platforms during periods of civil unrest. Such measures, he argued, were little more than an attack on public debate. '[T]he moment they spot what they've judged to be ""hateful content"", or to this very country where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of ""combating misogyny"" on the internet.' He also lambasted Romania forannulling the resultof the first round of its presidential election when a hard-right candidate came first, and condemned Sweden forimprisoning a far-right activistinvolved in Quran burnings. These actions, he suggested, demonstrated how European governments were increasingly willing to restrict speech to avoid controversy or discomfort. 'We must do more than talk about democratic values. We must live them,' he said, urging European leaders to uphold free speech rather than curtail it in the name of public order or social cohesion. Vance was not blind to the issue in his own country, however, acknowledging that the US had also struggled with free speech in recent years. 'I will admit that sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation [...] Our own governmentencouraged private companies to silence peoplewho dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth.' Whilst Vance's critique was directed at the Biden administration's approach to online discourse, he insisted that the Trump administration would take a sharply different stance, making opposition to censorship a pillar of its foreign policy. 'There is a new sheriff in town,' he declared. 'And under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer them in the public square.' Perhaps predictably, his address ruffled feathers in a room filled with priggish European technocrats, many of whom have championed expanding 'hate speech' laws and increasingly restrictive digital regulation in recent years. Carl Bildt, the co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations and former Prime Minister of Sweden, condemned Vance's remarks, dismissing them as politically motivated. 'At best it was totally irrelevant to European or global security concerns. At worst it was blatant interference in the [German] election campaign in favour of far-right AfD,' he wrote on X. Mr Bildt added that the speech had been 'significantly worse than expected'. In the UK, the Liberal Democrats were also quick to push back, with foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller criticising Vance's remarks. 'Britain will not take lectures about political freedoms from the acolyte of a president who tried to undermine American democracy and now praises Putin. The British people will see straight through this hypocrisy,' he claimed. Not all responses were negative, however. Reform UK's Rupert Lowe welcomed Vance's intervention, posting on social media: 'The Americans have got a real hero in JD Vance.' With the UK and EU continuing to expand their respective legal frameworks around speech regulation, and the Trump administration now positioning itself as a staunch defender of free expression, the transatlantic divide on free speech looks set to widen further.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-16T01:20:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/jd-vance-blasts-britains-thought-police-in-explosive-munich-speech/
Power without responsibility – the disgrace of our elected dictatorship,"IT HAS become an established principle in most of the world's constitutions that certain features of the constitution should be protected. This is achieved by requiring that any change to the constitution is to be subject to a referendum of the electorate at large. The majority needed is usually set high enough to ensure that any change has a fairly widespread base of support. The British constitution is unique in that there are no entrenched provisions. This is due to its slow evolution over many centuries. The origin of political power in the United Kingdom lies in the unfettered power of the early medieval monarchs. The consequence is that unfettered power resides in 'The King in Parliament'. With the development of a constitutional monarchy and the Parliament Act of 1911, power now resides exclusively in the House of Commons. This power is absolute and subject to no constitutional restraint. We thus have an elected dictatorship. For centuries, change in the constitution was relatively slow with few abrupt changes. Times of great civil disturbance occasionally made changes which proved to have a significant impact on the constitution, for example the signing of Magna Carta by King John in 1215 or the passing of the Bill of Rights in 1689. These arose from political exigencies. We now have a new development: the conscious and planned innovation in our constitutional arrangements by civil servants and politicians. Perhaps the first of these was the British adherence to the Treaty of Rome in 1973. This 'joining the Common Market' resulted in the sly subjection of much of parliamentary power to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). This principle had been established in 1964 with thedecision of the ECJ in the Costa case. The constitutional implications of this were deliberately obscured. Jean Monnet, aneminence grisebehind the EU project, explained that to overcome national sentiments it would be necessary to 'to zig a little, to zag a little' – perhaps one of the most elegant descriptions of political deceit in history. The very sloppy way in which we withdrew in 2020 means that the European law and the ECJ still has some place in British law. In 1997 the government headed by Tony Blair embarked on a programme of so-called 'reform'. In fact these were not reforms but constitutional changes that have had a profound impact on the UK.Miller cases The most significant change was the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into English law in 1998. This Act provides that every future Act shall be interpreted so as to conform to the requirements of the ECHR. These so-called 'rights' are so broadly expressed that courts can make almost any decision they wish and hence create a great deal of law that would never gain the support of the vast majority of the electorate if they were given a choice. This was followed by the devolution Acts for Scotland and Wales. These were designed to create Labour fiefdoms in these jurisdictions. The effect, certainly in Scotland, was the opposite in that a vehicle was established for separatist sentiment. A wedge had been placed in the United Kingdom. The Office of Communications Act 2002 and the Communications Act 2003 created Ofcom with the remit of protecting the public from 'harmful or offensive material'. Subsequent legislation, such as the Digital Economy Act 2017, has brought almost every public medium under the control of Ofcom. The Online Safety Act 2023 further extends the range and authority of Ofcom, which now has extensive censorship powers over every aspect of public communication. In 2005 the Constitutional Reform Act, reflecting theoretical notions of the 'separation of powers', destroyed the careful balancing of institutional powers evolved over centuries. A Supreme Court was created that, it was held, would have the same powers as the previous judicial committee of the House of Lords. Many voices expressed the view that this body would, simply by virtue of its title, enlarge its powers. This indeed emerged when the court violated the 1689 Bill of Rights and successfully interfered with the powers of parliament in theMiller cases. This has established a precedent which may place the courts above parliament. A key link in the relationship of the legal system and parliament was the role of the Lord Chancellor, previously the equivalent of Speaker to the House of Lords, a presiding judge in the High Court, and head of the judiciary. These roles were replaced with three separate individuals, the Lord Chancellor being removed as a judge. In 2003 many of the functions of the Lord Chancellor were transferred to a new Department of Constitutional Affairs; this in turn was replaced with the Orwellian-sounding Ministry of Justice. In 2010 the Constitution and Governance Act established the Civil Service Commission and the Civil Service Code which in effect removes the civil service from ministerial control. The Equality Act 2006 and the Equality Act 2010 extended the non-discrimination concept to the following 'protected characteristics': age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. This had the twin effects of opening up a lucrative source of litigation for human rights lawyers and severely limiting the rights of individuals to make personal choices. In 1966 the House of Lords issued a practice statement in which it unilaterally gave itself legislative powers. The development of Judicial Review has also significantly increased the authority and power of the judiciary. Parliament has been ineffective in controlling these accretions. The extraordinary growth inunelected government-appointed agencies, operating without effective parliamentary, legal or democratic control, has further complicated government. It seems they disburse some £50billion a year, a third of public spending. Many of these legislative measures interact, producing a larger impact than they would on a standalone basis. Any government with a large majority can steamroller any legislation it wishes through parliament; it has absolute power. The effect of all this legislation has been to make it almost impossible for a government to effect any policies which reflect the wishes of the electorate. It also enshrines significant power in a virtually independent, self-perpetuating and privileged civil service. The Reform UK party has suggested that perhaps a great Repeal Act is required; others, similarly, that a roll-back of this legislation is necessary and have called for a 'Restoration Act'. It may be argued that we need to entrench some vital parts of our constitution and personal rights behind the bulwarks of a requirement to refer such matters to a referendum. Most constitutional theorists argue that this is impossible given the unfettered power of parliament; which includes the inability to fetter future parliaments. However given our national history and temperament it is possible to conceive how it might be done without violating our existing constitution. However, the next government will have enough to do without worrying about constitutional reform. First, then, a Comprehensive Repeal Act!",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-19T01:18:00+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/power-without-responsibility-the-disgrace-of-our-elected-dictatorship/
"Global warming, the fallacy built on a 120-year-old blunder","IT WAS the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) who made the assertion at the turn of the last century that the Earth was 30 deg warmer than could be expected because of 'greenhouse' gases. He based his calculations on results from the lab of the absorption in the infrared (heat) spectrum by carbon dioxide. It could not be tested, of course! You cannot remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to see if the temperature drops. Not ten years later the calculation was criticised by the American physicist Professor R W Wood, often regarded as the father of infrared (IR) photography. He performed a simple experiment to assess the belief that greenhouses act as a radiation trap, that the glass (itself an absorber of IR) radiated back into the greenhouse IR heat coming from the ground causing it to warm even further. Note on the Theory of the Greenhouseby Professor R W Wood, 1909: 'There appears to be a widespread belief that the comparatively high temperature produced within a closed space covered with glass, and exposed to solar radiation, results from a transformation of wave-length, that is, that the heat waves from the sun, which are able to penetrate the glass, fall upon the walls of the enclosure and raise its temperature: the heat energy is re-emitted by the walls in the form of much longer waves, which are unable to penetrate the glass, the greenhouse acting as a radiation trap. 'I have always felt some doubt as to whether this action played any very large part in the elevation of temperature. It appeared much more probable that the part played by the glass was the prevention of the escape of the warm air heated by the ground within the enclosure. If we open the doors of a greenhouse on a cold and windy day, the trapping of radiation appears to lose much of its efficacy. As a matter of fact I am of the opinion that a greenhouse made of a glass transparent to waves of every possible length would show a temperature nearly, if not quite, as high as that observed in a glass house. The transparent screen allows the solar radiation to warm the ground, and the ground in turn warms the air, but only the limited amount within the enclosure. In the open, the ground is continually brought into contact with cold air by convection currents. 'To test the matter I constructed two enclosures of dead black cardboard, one covered with a glass plate, the other with a plate of rock-salt of equal thickness. The bulb of a thermometer was inserted in each enclosure and the whole packed in cotton, with the exception of the transparent plates which were exposed. When exposed to sunlight the temperature rose gradually to 65°C, the enclosure covered with the salt plate keeping a little ahead of the other, owing to the fact that it transmitted the longer waves from the sun, which were stopped by the glass. In order to eliminate this action the sunlight was first passed through a glass plate. 'There was now scarcely a difference of one degree between the temperatures of the two enclosures. The maximum temperature reached was about 55°C. From what we know about the distribution of energy in the spectrum of the radiation emitted by a body at 55°C, it is clear that the rock-salt plate is capable of transmitting practically all of it, while the glass plate stops it entirely. This shows us that the loss of temperature of the ground by radiation is very small in comparison to the loss by convection, in other words that we gain very little from the circumstance that the radiation is trapped. 'Is it therefore necessary to pay attention to trapped radiation in deducing the temperature of a planet as affected by its atmosphere? The solar rays penetrate the atmosphere, warm the ground which in turn warms the atmosphere by contact and by convection currents. The heat received is thus stored up in the atmosphere, remaining there on account of the very low radiating power of a gas. It seems to me very doubtful if the atmosphere is warmed to any great extent by absorbing the radiation from the ground, even under the most favourable conditions.' This critique might have put Arrhenius's calculation into the bin, so to speak, but as it was not a very important matter anyway (global warming was not an issue at the time) it remained as a current idea, and physics textbooks tended to repeat his hypothesis without criticism – they were doing so well into the 1970s when I was teaching physics. This error remained undetected in the mainstream (which is not to accuse Arrhenius of any mean motive; scientists make mistakes all the time, even good ones). But in the late 1960s and early 1970s it was revived by another Swedish scientist, Bert Bolin, because there were fears that a new Ice Age might be rapidly approaching. The hypothesis was that CO2 in the atmosphere might cause some warming and might just stave it off! Bolin speculated this possibility but even he could not be sure, and said so. In the 1970s and 1980s temperatures started to rise. Bolin's resuscitation of the Arrhenius hypothesis now took a more sinister turn: Global Warming, caused, of course, by the increase in the burning of fossil fuels. Still no one was checking Arrhenius's calculations, indeed they were actually using them! In the Apollo missions thermometers were left on the moon's surface. The results were quietly published by NASA at the time – I suppose they thought that the moon's surface temperatures were hardly headline news. But there was a mammoth surprise! The moon also showed a 30deg temperature excess above that expected which, by Arrhenius's calculations, should not be there as there is no air and therefore NO greenhouse gases on the moon! Here was a good test of the Arrhenius hypothesis, yet it showed that his calculations must be wrong. What was the mistake? Arrhenius, to simplify his calculations, had treated the Earth's surface as 'thin'. He ignored the fact that heat absorbed on the surface would be partly conducted (and stored) below the surface. The Earth acts as a storage heater, meaning that temperatures did not fall, at night, as far as theory predicted. The same with the moon, of course. By now all sorts of alarm bells should have been ringing about 'global warming' being caused by CO2, but sadly most of the scientific community decided to ignore them. Scientists who drew attention to the issue were not listened to, but ignored, sidelined and very often personally abused. Peer reviewing ceased to be about detecting error, but rather maintaining the accepted narrative. Instead of error spotting it became heresy spotting. So we conclude that the whole Global Warming edifice is based on an error made more than 120 years ago. Once that is realised, the edifice will collapse. Yes, reputations will be wrecked, some industries ruined, subsidy fortunes destroyed, but maybe lessons can be learned (trite, I know!) Science can maybe recover from this debacle, but it cannot be treated as some kind of infallible oracle ever again.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-18T01:18:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/global-warming-the-fallacy-built-on-a-120-year-old-blunder/
"Ukraine peace deal, and Starmer, set up for failure","WE ARE due to learn tomorrow of the American plan to end the war in Ukraine. This plan will be presented byGeneral Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump's special envoy, at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group summit in Brussels. There has been a deal of inspired guesswork about what Kellogg's proposals might be – but it is not hard to come to some ideas at least. Kellogg is an experienced and pragmatic officer, and as well as a distinguished military career he served in the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. I had the pleasure of serving with him twice. Any plan to end the war would consist of two phases: Phase One would end the fighting; Phase Two would end the war. Phase Two will take a great deal of hard negotiating, and the Russians are in no mood to compromise – why should they? They are winning the war at the operational and strategic levels, if suffering tactical setbacks. Let us therefore look at Phase One. The positions of Russian and Ukrainian troops would be frozen on their current lines, generally east of the Dnieper River. It would then require a third party, probably Nato, to monitor this line and, if necessary, enforce compliance with any ceasefire agreement, although that would depend on the mandate which would have to be agreed by both parties. At once we run into problems. Putting Nato troops from any nation east of the Dnieper will place them into direct contact with Russian forces, with all the possibilities of miscalculation by either side. Then there is the issue of finding the troops. Any ceasefire line is likely to be around 800 miles long,requiring around 200,000 troops to police it effectively. This means an army level headquarters with three corps and their constituent divisions and corps troops. A force would deploy an observation line of ground troops, with additional overwatch from satellites, drones and aircraft. Backing the first line would be reaction forces: artillery and missiles are the most manoeuvrable force elements, followed by attack helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and finally ground formations. The only Nato nation capable of fielding the framework, with at least one of the corps, is the US – but the US Government has alreadyruled out any boots on the ground. It is possible that American air power might support ground troops, but that has not been confirmed. Also, we must understand that a headline figure of 200,000 means that to keep such a force in place with suitable troop rotation periods for two to three years actually requires 600,000 troops. The US Joint Chiefs know this; nor do they have any intention of confronting Russia at this point. They also clearly understand that to deploy the whole of the V Corps and then follow it up would effectively fix the US Army on a static line, giving its enemies freedom of action elsewhere. There are other possible contributors – Turkey has large enough armed forces, but the Ukrainians are most unlikely to agree to a large force of pro-Russian, pro-Iranian Muslim troops on their territory. Poland might make up at least part of a corps – but without a US lead, this is all make-believe. Underlining the US position is their hand-over of the duties of host of the Brussels meeting to the UK. Sir Keir Starmer, of course, has jumped at this opportunity, clearly without having understood that the absence of a US contribution makes any Nato effort shadowy. Why is Starmer so keen? Because he is in the throes of negotiating a new defence 'pact' with the EU, which would place British forces under the control of the unelected, unaccountable, EU Commission –the first step in his attempts to undo Brexit through the back door. Starmer has been explicit that the UK is ready to take the lead on a European force in Ukraine –note the language. But again, there are serious problems. Without US participation, the most that European Nato could manage would be a peacekeeping-type force of lightly armed troops – well, we know what happened with such a force at Srebrenica, for example. And the leadership? For any nation to take the lead in such a force it would have to provide a sizeable contingent. The British Army can barely put a single brigade in the field, much less keep it there. Its qualifications and credibility for leadership are simply smoke and mirrors. Even if such a force were deployed, the very best case that could be hoped for would be to freeze the conflict permanently, as has happened in Korea since 1953. The worst case would be that Zelensky would be obliged to make serious territorial concessions which would be unacceptable to a significant proportion of his people and his army. Most estimates say thattwo-thirds of Ukrainians are opposed to such concessions; many of these are very far right, neo-Nazi elements such as theAzov Brigade. One possible outcome would be a Ukrainian civil war, which the Russians would simply watch. Interestingly,following his comments that territorial concessions could be made, Zelensky followed Starmer's visit to Kiev by showing up briefly and quietly in London last week. There is a view that this was to reconnoitre his bolt-hole for the day that he has to flee his country; of course, I cannot comment. It is possible to reach only one conclusion from all this: that the so-called peace deal, and with it, Starmer, are being set up for failure. With no possibility of finding the troops or the command and control for a ceasefire monitoring force and with Zelensky backed into a corner on concessions, the proposed deal will founder. Trump, of course, will be able to say that he tried but was let down – as usual – by European countries and by a Ukrainian government unable to make any compromises. The aid tap would then be turned off and with the European shot-locker empty, the war will drag on pointlessly.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-11T01:19:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/ukraine-peace-deal-and-starmer-set-up-for-failure/
Miliband sacrifices Britain to his global warming god,"THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION of Great Britain is well under way and proving a highly successful venture, thanks to one man and one man alone: Ed Miliband. Given free rein by Sir Keir Starmer, Miliband has been religiously concreting fracking wells, shutting down North Sea oil and gas exploration, and enthusiastically acceding to a misguided and out-of-order judge who has banned the expansion of two important North Sea oil fields, Jackdaw and Rosebank. He has been hard at work atremoving ten per cent of food-growing farmlandto install solar panels (made in China) and destroying yet more farmland for wind farms and the thousands of additional pylons needed to transmit the unreliable power from them. The utter absurdity of it is made even more outrageous becausewind and solar rely on subsidies, currently £12billion a year, to ensure that the operating companies (mostly foreign owned) make a profit regardless. That's not the end of this farce. Under the so-calledContracts for Difference, when the renewables are generating more electricity than the grid can handle, the operators are paid to turn them off. With electricity prices the highest in the developed world, and four times higher than in the US, what remains of our manufacturing industries are closing down – Port Talbot Steelworks, Grangemouth Refinery, and Vauxhall factories to name but some – or they are moving abroad. Meanwhile,coal-fired power stations in Germanyare being restarted, and having theirlives extended in Australia. In Britain, thelast one was shut downin September 2024 and demolished. Miliband's fanatical promotion of wind and solar power is accompanied by lie after lie. Power prices will not come down; they will continue to go up. Jobs will not be created; they will be destroyed. It takes seven staff to run a 12-turbine wind farm; a 1,400-megawatt coal fired power station in New South Wales, Australia employs 378 staff, not including all the employees of the supplying coal mine. The tragedy is that it's all totally unnecessary. The global warming crisis, as awake TCW readers already know, is a fiction. None of the world's wind farms, solar farms and electric vehicles is necessary, rather a polluting waste of space, effort and, above all, money. Not one of the multitudes of rent-seeking scaremongering organisations has ever produced a scintilla of provable evidence for manmade global warming. None of the wildfires, droughts, floods, hurricanes or other so-called extreme weather events is unprecedented. Empirical data in the public record going back centuries proves this. Eminent scientists have demonstrated there is no climate emergency, that climate change is natural and has been going on since Planet Earth was formed. Interestingly too, historical data unfailingly shows that warm periods in the past thousands of years have been followed by increased CO2 in the atmosphere, not preceded by it; the mediaeval warm period and the Roman warm period being good examples. All of this is detailed inClimate: The Movie. It also explains how and why the climate cult been so enthusiastically embraced by so many supposedly well-educated and smart world leaders and industrialists. It also debunks the widespread belief that 97 per cent of scientists are said to agree that CO2 is warming the planet, a figure that is entirely fabricated, based on 77 anonymous scientists who, out of 10,257, responded to a survey. The original rebuttal made in a lecture given by Marc Morano of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) in 2016 is, typically, no longer accessible online. Everything is either blamed on or seen to be responsible for climate change: dramatic weathers are the symptom;growing your own vegetablesin your allotment or cows are the cause. It's the reason forincreasing rat populationsin cities around the world, in case you missed that one. Panicked by this onslaught of 'annihilation' terror,over 300 local authoritieshave declared a climate emergency. As the madness comes closer to affecting every aspect of our everyday lives, can it be stopped? The vigorous pursuit of climate change indoctrination throughout schools and universities, and too many beneficiaries of the global climate lobby – of USAID and Bill Gates – peddling scare stories daily, make it a tough but not impossible challenge. The arrival of 'drill, baby, drill' Donald Trump in the White House and his pulling out of the WHO and the UN, while also dismantling USAID, offers a glimmer of hope. We have to hope it has not come too late for the UK. Hopefully, we won't have to say goodbye to all the trappings of the developed world's agreeable lifestyles and say hello to austerity and poverty, the all-too-real dystopian horrors that Miliband fanaticism will bring.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-09T01:18:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/miliband-sacrifices-britain-to-his-global-warming-god/
A noxious encounter on the 14.18,"IN ONE of life's strange coincidences, just as I clicked on an article titled 'The sorry state of British train etiquette', an argument broke out on the 14.18 to London. A man sitting across from me had taken offence at the foul odour produced by another passenger. The stench was pungent, reminiscent of a sewage works at the height of summer. I know it wasn't me (promise!), and unless the irate chap was performing the world's greatest Uno-reverso, I suspect it wasn't him either. Given the seating arrangement it could have been only one other person. This gentleman – if I were to hazard a guess from Nigeria – had spent the journey variously chatting on speakerphone and arguing the toss with ticket conductors. Perhaps such antics had already lit the fuse of the accuser's anger. To many, farting can be the basis of much hilarity. At my workplace I don't believe I have had a single shift without colleagues making some ribald reference to flatulence. Sometimes it seems that it is at the foundation of the organisation's sense of humour. At one point I thought myself above it before, one day, consuming too much cabbage, and having to adopt the humour myself. The scales fell from my eyes as I realised I was no different from them. It reminds me a bit of that line inBlackadder, where the Baron Von Richthofen so admires the role the lavatory plays in the British psyche: 'For you it is the basis of an entire culture, for us it is a mundane and functional item!' Yet, on public transport I think such gaseous emanations are beyond the pale. Perhaps in 2025 this renders me irredeemably conservative and dull, but I can live with such accusations. Public transport constitutes a strange middle world of the private and public. Whilst naturally cheek-by-jowl, everyone strives to be in their own little world. Only the drunks or the mentalists break that barrier, intruding on the carefully constructed bubbles of others. Given this mix of the public and private, I think it perhaps the best environment in which to observe society's changing mores. Many of the public behaviours instilled in me throughout my childhood – such as not staring, not making too much noise, not having one's feet on the chairs, making room for others, helping people with their bags – have all fallen by the wayside or become endangered species. Indeed, the article referenced at the beginning lists various faux pas (at least to the averageTelegraphreader's mind) such as listening to music on speaker, yet it apportioned no blame, as if such behaviours miraculously fell from the skies and landed on our sorry heads. The lack of attribution is the case for many modern manifestations. A colleague's son was recently slashed across the face with a knife after an attempted robbery by a 14-year-old. It is 20 years since I was 14 (tempus fugit!) but I have zero recollection of being afraid of being stabbed. Punched by a chav? Certainly (and where did all the chavs go?), but being stabbed? Not so much. Now it's just one of those strange phenomena which have imposed themselves rudely on to what was once a relatively genteel culture with a smattering of scummery. That omnipresent fear of the knife – once unknown but now ubiquitous – has result in what may euphemistically be called socially suboptimal outcomes. Certain demographics in London are, to a large extent, socially untouchable due to the underlying fear that comes with any confrontational interaction. Take, for example, jumping the turnstile on the Tube. As a student in London some 15 years ago I don't recall seeing this on a regular basis. Today, however, I see it without fail every few days. To notice that it is a certain demographic doing so is a hate thought. No doubt nobody says anything because of the culture of fear that pervades the modern world. Similarly, open social misconduct has becomede factoallowed. My girlfriend was recently on an Overground train near Wembley. In the carriage were four youths of a certain background happily smoking weed. And why would they not? What have they to fear from a) the decent citizen too scared to say anything lest they get a blade in the belly or b) the authorities, similarly too frit to fail their DEI training? The standards, it seems, are falling across the board. This manifests itself across many areas: for example the zebra crossings in my part of London are by no means a way of crossing the street with unalloyed right. In perhaps a third of cases cars will happily zoom past as you are already on the crossing, thereby violating the Highway Code. 'Violating the Highway Code'! How dull I sound. Such dreary notions are fuddy-duddy by now, surely. In fact, crossing the road with a hint of danger is something I have, historically, associated with developing countries. Memories of dashing across roads in Vietnam while dodging scooters come to mind. No doubt in Lagos or Kinshasha there are similar challenges while trying to get to the other side of the street. And thus, ladies and gentlemen, that is where we are heading. From a first-world nation into a second. Still, hopefully not a third, but I am sure there's time for that.

"Muslims can openly criticise Christians, so why not the opposite?","DEPUTY Prime Minister Angela Rayner is reported to be planning a 16-person'Islamophobia Council', the aim of which will be to deal with anti-Muslim discrimination in the UK. As a Christian minister and open-air preacher, I find this a matter of grave concern. Part of the problem is the existing definition of Islamophobia issued in November 2018 by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslims. It states: 'Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness'. This statement has been formally adopted by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party, the SNP, the Scottish Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. A total of 52 local councils in England have embraced the statement, as have 22.7 per cent of Welsh councils. This appalling definition inspired by multicultural wokery ignores the glaringly obvious fact that Islam is not a race, but a religion. What we are witnessing here is the employment of the universal fear of being branded as 'racist' engendered by the leftist-liberal establishment in recent decades in order to prohibit any legitimate rebuttal of Islam, especially by those who believe the Christian Scriptures. This fear of being branded as racist has of course led to the failure to deal with the rape-gang crisis afflicting so many of our towns over many years.The Independent Inquiryinto Child Sexual Abuse was established by the Home Secretary in September 2014. It issued its final report in October 2022. In February of that year one of the Inquiry's reports spoke of 'extensive failures by local authorities and police forces' to deal in any effective way with the grooming gangs. TheSecretary to the Inquirysaid: 'We need to break the culture where people are worried that they might be accused of being racist just because they record factual information.' As an open-air preacher, I frequently have to critique Islam, not because Muslims are my particular focus – I am preaching to every person I see in the high street – but because Muslims approach me and directly challenge my Christian beliefs. Furthermore, they do not hesitate to tell me exactly what they think about the falsehood of the most fundamental doctrines of Christianity. May I give some examples. My Islamic friends (and I am pleased that they approach me) often say: 'Your Bible is corrupted. There are numerous versions; it is completely untrustworthy, and has been hopelessly altered.' Now since the Bible is the word of God, this constitutes an assault upon the integrity of the Christian revelation, and even upon the nature of the Trinitarian God, for it is the Holy Spirit who has breathed out the Scriptures. I well remember a time in a high street in a town not far from my church in South Buckinghamshire when a passing Muslim lady shouted out as I was preaching, 'The Bible is a lie!' She did so without any hesitation or fear of a possible adverse response. Her comment of course did not lead to the police rushing to the scene. Muslims frequently come up to me and say, 'Jesus is not God' and 'How can God have a Son? It is impossible'. Again this represents a denial of the most cherished beliefs of Christians. Muslims claim that God is one, and reject the trinitarian truth that God manifests Himself to the world in the three Persons of the one Godhead. So they openly repudiate the wonder of the incarnation. They also deny that Jesus died on the Cross, which in Christian theology is the only basis for anyone to be saved from their sins. In other words, our Muslim friends publicly deny all that is basic and non-negotiable in the Christian Gospel. When a follower of Muhammad tells me that Jesus is not God's Son, it is a blasphemous statement as far as I am concerned. I find it offensive and repugnant. To deny who Christ really is to deny God the Father also,as we see in John 5:23. This verse, among many others, is plain evidence that Christians and Muslims do not worship the same God (though many compromised and woke churches will claim that they do). Indeed, the Bible teaches that all religions which deny the deity of Christ and teach salvation other than by His sacrificial death cannot by definition be true, and must therefore be rejected. The Christian has a duty before God not to conceal the truth, and so his rejection of other faiths must mean publicly as well as privately in one's conscience. The critical point, however, is this: I actually support the freedom of Muslims to say that Jesus is not God's Son, and to denounce the Christian Scriptures, even though it offends and grieves me. In contrast to what Islam teaches, religious truth can never be maintained by the State trying to compel a person's conscience, a grave mistake which many have tragically made in church history (and which is one of the reasons why I am a nonconformist). However, this liberty granted to Muslims in the UK to publicly repudiate devoutly held Christian beliefs must be reciprocated by Islam and the Left, when it comes to Christians critiquing Islam. What if a Christian speaks publicly of the real and frightening danger which converts to Christianity from Islam often face in majority-Muslim contexts around the world, and even in the UK? What if a Christian minister publicly asserts, as he must, that Jesus Christ is the only way to God, and that there is no mercy and salvation to be received through any prophet of any other religion? If he then names those other religions, and Islam is one of them, will he suddenly become a criminal whom the State must silence? In fact, the Christian is demonstrating his love for his Muslim neighbour when he tells him that Jesus Christ is God's Son and the only way to be eternally saved and reach heaven (John 14:6). However, by faithfully preaching Christ crucified for sinners, every true preacher is effectively denying the validity of all other faiths, including Islam. What wickedness it would be to stigmatise him as a criminal who is motivated by base, racial bigotry. Finally, if Islamophobia and racism are such serious problems in the UK, why is it that so many followers of Islam from around the world have chosen to come and live here and are still endeavouring to do so?",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-10T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/muslims-can-openly-criticise-christians-so-why-not-the-opposite/
How Trump is halting the funding of BBC bias,"AS THE Trump administration begins reorganizing andcutting major funding to the US Agency for International Development(USAID), revelations are emerging that the organization financed groups, including some media outlets, engaged in smear campaigns and censorship against dissident voices. The agency, known as afront for US intelligenceoperations, has financedregime changeand other American interests worldwide. It also funds news organizations that are aligned with US foreign policy objectives. This includes large international organizations that, in turn, fund smaller media organizations likeBBC Media Actionand theInternational Fund for Public Interest Media, chaired by the former head of theNew York Times. USAID also directly funds smaller media organizations and evenruns its own media initiativesto undermine regimes the US deems problematic. The website Reporters Without Borders,which lamented the Trump cutsto USAID, reported that in 2023 theagencyfunded 6,200 journalists, 707 non-state news outlets and 'supported 279 media-sector civil society organizations dedicated to strengthening independent media'. Recent reporting by journalists such asSayer Jiof GreenMedInfo,Lee Fang, andMichael Shellenberger and Alex Gutentagof Public News, has linked that funding to the smearing and censoring of independent journalists and platforms within the US and internationally. 'USAID has long functioned as a geopolitical instrument, using media funding to shape narratives favourable to Western governmental and corporate interests,' Ji toldThe Defender. 'While it presents itself as a development agency, its deep ties to intelligence operations and state-sponsored influence campaigns are well-documented. Media organizations receiving USAID funding are not independent — they are extensions of state power, laundering government-sanctioned narratives under the guise of journalism.' Ji reported on Substackthat BBC Media Action, the BBC's international charity, received substantial funding from USAID – 8 per cent of its 2023-2024 budget, according to aBBC press statement. He said BBC Media Action has faced accusations of engaging incensorshipunder the guise of 'combating misinformation' and that it leverages the BBC brand to shape media narratives, including about public health, vaccines and pharmaceutical products. Ji said this is concerning given that BBC has expanded its influence through projects like theTrusted News Initiative(TNI), a self-described 'industry partnership' that worked with Big Tech forms to identify 'misinformation' and 'disinformation' on their platforms. Claiming to combat misinformation about Covid-19, TNI's work has been tied to suppressing viewpoints that contradict the mainstream pharmaceutical and governmental stance on public health, like those ofGreenMedInfoandChildren's Health Defense(CHD). 'The revelations regarding USAID's funding of BBC Media Action and its role in the Trusted News Initiative (TNI) further solidify what many of us have long suspected: Censorship is no longer a covert operation but a fully integrated transnational enterprise designed to suppress dissent and monopolize narratives,' Ji said. CHD is one of several plaintiffs in alawsuit against TNI, alleging the initiative violated antitrust laws and the US Constitution when its members collectively colluded with tech giants to censor online news. Fang reported on Substackabout other 'anti-disinformation' groups financed by the 'sprawling' USAID that have targeted American journalists and politicians. These include theZinc Network, which he saidtargetedreporter Max Blumenthal, politician Vivek Ramaswamy, and Representative Andy Biggs. According to Fang, the USAID fundedv-Fluence, a pesticide industry public relations consultant, which dug up dirt on American food journalists — including Michael Pollan and Mark Bittman — who criticized industrial agriculture. v-Fluence ran a campaign to intimidate critics of toxic pesticides, targeting environmentalists Vandana Shiva and Nnimmo Bassey and reporter Carey Gillam as part of its broader effort 'to downplay pesticide dangers,discredit opponents, and undermine international policymaking harmful to the pesticide industry,'The New Ledereported. USAID financed news outlets in Ukraine, includingThe New Voice of Ukraine,VoxUkraine,Detector Media, and theInstitute of Mass Information, which spread rumours that Americans who favour peace negotiations with Russia are agents of the Kremlin, Fang wrote. The media outlets targeted Jeffrey Sachs, Tucker Carlson, Glenn Greenwald and John Mearsheimer, Fang reported. Fang said the influence of those groups 'extends far beyond' Ukraine. VoxUkraine is an official Meta fact-checking partner, he said, and Detector Media produces disinformation reports that circulate widely in Western media. 'Despite branding as independent outlets, these organizations are heavily reliant on USAID,' Fang wrote. USAID funds theOrganized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project(OCCRP), a major — if largely unknown – organization that works with dozens of major newspapers to publish major investigative stories. Drop Site News revealed in aninvestigative reportpublished in December 2024 that OCCRP, which it called 'one of the world's most influential global investigative news organizations', has received more than half of its funding from the US government, largely through USAID. The investigation found that funding gives the US government direct influence over editorial and personnel decisions at the outlet. Fang also reportedthat USAID's sister nonprofit, the National Endowment for Democracy, fundsCoda Story, an anti-disinformation news outlet in New York. Shellenberger said in avideo posted on Xthat USAID's work extended beyond funding news agencies to promote ideas favourable to US interests. It also included developing intelligence tactics abroad that it then used domestically to counter misinformation. Shellenberger said: 'To combat alleged misinformation, the censorship industrial complex used counter-terrorism and intelligence tactics developed abroad, including psychological operations and repurposed them to shape domestic opinion and thought. 'USAID has, in recent years, been funding censorship worldwide through its countering disinformation program, which is part of its consortium for elections and political process strengthening. This work has included funding for so-called fact-checking organizations.' As the revelations about USAID's funding to journalism went viral, former Fox News producerKyle Becker reported on Xthat Politico had received $8.1million from the agency and that USAID's funding freeze had led to a payroll problem at the outlet. His claims went viral and provoked dismissive fact-checks by mainstream media organizations. Fang said that according toUSAID contract records, the agency paid $44,000 for subscription services to the news service. Politico, like other outlets including Bloomberg and LexisNexis, offers high-priced data-industry news subscriptions for tens of thousands of dollars. The $8.1million figure came from all government subscription payments to Politico — not just from USAID — and there is no evidence the USAID funding freeze was related to the payroll issue at the outlet. The $8.1million figure, however, has highlighted the fact that most mainstream news organizations, includingtheNew York Times,Reuters, and the Associated Press receive significant income from various government agencies through subscriptions and other funding. And USAID does fund many 'questionable news operations', globally that ought to be subject to scrutiny,Fang wrote: 'And unlike Politico, there is actual evidence that the freeze on USAID spending is impacting the American government's quasi-shadowy constellation of news operations all over the world. 'Voice of Americareported""independent news outlets"" in more than 30 countries, including Austria, Ukraine, and Myanmar, are facing cuts or are at risk of shutting down over the USAID freeze. Ironically, of course, Voice of America is also funded by American taxpayers.' Ji said that subjecting these organizations to scrutiny and defunding them is an important step, 'but only if it leads to widespread public awareness and systemic resistance'. Organizations like BBC Media and others can find new sources of funding, 'unless there is mass rejection of their authority'. He said: 'The key is decentralization — building alternative platforms, supporting independent journalism, and challenging censorship throughlegaland political action. The exposure of these ties is a wake-up call: free speech is under siege, and only a vigilant, informed public can reclaim it.'",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-10T01:18:00+00:00,BBC Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-trump-is-halting-the-funding-of-bbc-bias/
Liberal attitude to underage sex at heart of Oxford abuse scandal,"The feeding frenzy over the Oxford abuse scandal will be mighty, righteous and great. Many will blame social services and the police for being completely useless, which they are. Others will blame the perpetrators 'of mostly Pakistani heritage' and of course they are primarily to blame. Inevitably, 'society' will be blamed for treating the victims of this abuse as trash because of their background and I have no doubt that many professionals did believe this. I am pointing the finger at the liberal culture of 'All the sex, All of the time"" and non-judgment. We now live in a society where few dare declare any behaviour as wrong. To be judgmental is to be damned. The report asks why wasn't something done in the face of grotesque abuse of children. The author concluded that there was, ""beyond any lack of knowledge or clarity, an acceptance of a degree of underage sexual activity that reflects a wider societal reluctance to consider something 'wrong'."" So it was not lack of knowledge about the abuse but a reluctance by society, when it comes to sexual activity amongst children to consider anything 'wrong'. This lack of willingness to condemn any behaviour wrong directly contributed to the horrific abuse of these girls. The report also believes, because contraceptives can be given to an underage minor even though by law they are unable to consent to sex, that ""it is no wonder there was confusion and a lack of confidence in taking action"". So the report believes that the practice of giving contraception to underage minors also contributed to the unwillingness by authorities to take any action and save these girls from further abuse. The report also states: ""The law around consent was not properly understood, and the Review finds confusion related to a national culture where children are sexualised at an ever younger age and deemed able to consent to, say, contraception long before they are able legally to have sex. A professional tolerance to knowing young teenagers were having sex with adults seems to have developed."" In other words the constant sexualisation of teenagers in British culture at an ever younger age caused the professionals to tolerate minors having sex with adults even when abusive. So there we have it – a quagmire and sewer of abuse where adults turn their backs while other adults target and ruthlessly abuse underage girls. We would not want to be judgemental now would we? It is time adults got back on the high horse and starting calling a spade a spade – underage sex is illegal and wrong.",The Conservative Woman,2015-03-04T10:50:08+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/laura-perrins-liberal-attitude-underage-sex-heart-oxford-abuse-scandal/
Why the BBC must be abolished - now,"IT'S HARD to believe that it was nearly 40 years ago, in 1986, that the Peacock Report first mooted subscription to replace the BBC licence fee. In due course, they said. Or that it is 22 years since David Elstein, the former chief executive of Channel Five, was appointed in 2003 to head a Conservative Party review of the future funding of the national broadcasterahead of the renewal of its Royal Charter. It recommended the licence fee should be reduced and commercial broadcasters be allowed to bid for funding to make public service programmes. If it sent a chill wind down the corridors of Broadcasting House, it was not for long. Like the NHS, the BBC has stood impregnable and unreformable. The hopeless Tories failed to bite the bullet not just then, but ten years later when the Charter came up for renewal again. 'Due course' has never arrived. Nor I doubt will it arrive in 2026 Critics of the BBC 'tax' point out that now, unlike their NHS dependency, people do have a choice – they do have somewhere else to go that they can afford. In fact the last twenty years have seen myriad sources of education, information and entertainment for people to turn to. Just within a few years of their launch, streaming services led by the US giants Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Apple TV+ 'had attracted voluntary subscriptions from nearly 70 per cent of UK households, even as the number of homes paying the licence fee started, unprecedentedly, to decline',David Elstein observed before Christmas. The annual household exodus from the licence fee he noted was between 400,000 and 500,000. So you would think, logically that the BBC's time must finally be up, as the next Charter renewal approaches in 2026 as a new round of discussions has already started on the future of the BBC's funding. Both the Labour Government and the BBC are said to be exploring ways to reform the licence fee and are reviewing the funding model. Will these reviews will 'go far enough'? Or 'will fall back on to tired platitudes and ignore the modern failings of the BBC'. That's what the campaign group Defund the BBC fears – that once again the conclusion will be that the BBC is too 'special' to be subject to the marketplace of the media industry; that no funding model other than enforced taxpayer funding is suitable; that the funding reviews could also be quietly jettisoned at any point and plans for reform sidelined. Hence their report launched this week on the future of the BBC licence fee,Outdated, Outpaced and Out of Touch. It states the obvious, yet again, that the licence fee is out of date and must be scrapped, that BBC has 'stubbornly survived' as the media world has 'changed beyond recognition'. (They might have added a 'why', which I would suggest is down to successive governments who for their own reasons have wanted to keep the BBC onside.) Now they say it is an 'adapt or die' moment, that the BBC must move to a subscription model or be axed. The report in many ways mirrors Mr Epstein's argument, that its funding does not allow it to do what it is meant to do as exemplified by its Proms coverage, managing he noted to bring only 26 of last summer's 73 Proms to our TV screens, and only six actually on the night of the performance. Therefore the argument goes it is neither in the best interests of the taxpaying public nor of the BBC. In order to save this and other bits of BBC magic that the Defund the BBC report details it is time to 'properly explore' the commercialisation of the BBC and turn it into a subscription service like Sky or Netflix. It warns it is 'rapidly becoming obsolete with precipitous falls in consumption between generations' with the rapid switch to the 'fundamentally different' pattern of streaming platforms – a 'defining change' in how the public is choosing to watch television. Elstein in his article also warns of a technological barrier currently propping up the licence fee disappearing: 'This barrier is the legacy of installed viewing systems which incorporate a TV tuner (unlike a laptop, tablet or smartphone, which have smaller screens). Between 5million and 8million of these are replaced each year, each typically capable of bypassing live TV by use of broadband, but nearly all still including a TV tuner. If a major manufacturer chose to market a large smart screen without a tuner, eliminating the need to buy a TV licence, there might be a rush for the doors.' The tipping point could come at a 30 per cent 'at which the exodus [from the licence fee] gathers unstoppable pace'. The Defund the BBC report details the stunning success of streaming platforms in 'remarkable contrast to the decline of traditional broadcast TV'. Viewers will spend more on streaming services than traditional TV packages for the first time this year, they say. If this proves accurate, it will have taken only 13 years for streaming platforms to have eclipsed traditional broadcast media.Their report also points out that the BBC has 'lurched from failure to scandal in a seemingly unending cycle of mistakes and problems' and the public's view and support is 'a long way from its rose-tinted heyday'; that people are looking at the BBC and find it 'lacking judgement, lacking common sense and lacking the ability to remain impartial when many of its staff have clearly been captured by ideology.' Scandals I would add that, because the BBC is unaccountable, they have shockingly got away with – ridden rather than lurched ove – leaving a trust deficit. Just 25 per cent of the UK believe that the BBC is 'generally neutral'. A running financial deficit despite a total income of nearly £6billion in 2023 – more than twice that of its longest-running domestic rival, ITV – you would think the writing was on the wall; that turning the BBC into a subscription service was a no brainer. Can best future for the BBC be 'to continue to yoke the taxpayer to the unjust licence fee and continuing decline?' they ask.For the BBC and Labour, well yes. The BBC have not resisted subscription for 40 years to give into it now. Their 'soft' power as State supported monopoly is huge and they know it. It is far too important an instrument of state propaganda for any uniparty government to risk, particularly Labour. Despite the undeniable catalogue of failure – falling standards, limited coverage, inefficiency and licence fee collapse, it is just too powerful a driver of the progressive left, globalist political narrative for Labour to relinquish. This home grown British counter-disinformation service does not depend onBarb viewing figures. Its website thrives on the internet –even without its USAID support. With the full support of the State regulator Ofcom it is invincible. Take covid, lockdown and vaccine – who was more effective than the BBC in transmitting both fear and censure for non-compliance? That is why it has to go. In 2014 the BBC revealed unswerving preference for maintaining the licence fee; their dismissal of the subscription option backed up by a blog packed with 40 lies by their Head of Policydenounced by Elstein:'I have chosen to call them lies, because there is not the slightest attempt to present any kind of balanced picture. It is a bad faith exercise, and deserves the strongest epithet in condemning it.' Is there any reason to believe the BBC will behave differently today? As long as critics premise their lobbying on the appeasement tactic of 'how can we guarantee ""our"" BBC and enhance the product on offer for Britons in a world of endless technological disruption?' as MP Sir John Hayes's puts it in the foreword to report, I suspect not. It is not 'our' BBC and has not been for a long time. It has had the benefit of the doubt for far too long, cynically delivering only the wokest and most subversive of the Proms as a sop to its prior justification. It is not there to be 'guaranteed'. No ifs or buts, the BBC licence fee has to be abolished, the Charternotput up for renewal. 100 years is enough. We don't have a duty to save it. Critics mustn't let sentiment crowd their judgment. That should be the warning and certainly a Reform UK commitment from Day One of their government.

Robert F Kennedy Jr's magnificent fight back against the demented Democrats,"ROBERT Kennedy Jr's second Senate confirmation hearing for HHS secretary at the end of this last week dominated on social as well as on mainstream media. But there the similarity ended. The MSM's reporting of the former Democrat who the Left love to dub as a conspiracy theorist for telling the truth about covid vaccines, couldn't have been more different. While tweeters on X were sharing RFK's brilliant take down of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (who both seemed in danger of losing their minds at times) the out of touch MSM remained oblivious to how unhinged the Democrats have become. The similarly derangedGuardianreported these demented Democrats haddelivered repeated blows on our hero. Well no, they hadn't and they didn't. They left RFK unbowed, not even bloodied; they were the defeated ones – their hypocrisy and partisanship exposed by Kennedy in this searing statement: 'There's no such thing as Republican children or Democratic children. These are our kids. 66 per cent of them are damaged ... And all these Democrats are opposed to me for partisan issues. They used to be my friends, agreed with me on all the environmental issues I've been working on for my whole career. Now they're against me because anything that President Trump does, any decision he makes, has to be lampooned, derided, discredited, marginalized, vilified.' You can watch this 'grilling' and how he dealt with it in this full recording of the second confirmation hearing here: Senator Mike Crapo summed it up well and fairly at the end: 'You've gone through the most thorough vetting process that any committee in this Congress puts anybody through and I think that you have come through well and deserve to be confirmed . . .

Why did police name man who burned the Koran and put his life in danger?,"POLICE have publicly named a man and disclosed his address after he was charged with allegedly burning pages of the Koran, despite the clear and immediate risks posed to those accused of 'blasphemy' by radical Islamists. The 47-year-old haspleaded guiltyto causing racially and religiously aggravated intentional harassment, alarm, and distress after setting fire to the Islamic holy book in Manchester city centre during a live stream on social media. At Manchester magistrates' court, the prosecution said the act had caused distress to a bystander, Fahad Iqbal, who attempted to intervene. In a victim impact statement, Iqbal told the court: 'I was quite shocked, disgusted and offended. I'm a Muslim. I still can't believe someone would do this. When he began to burn the Koran, my heart was about to break out. This is the most emotion I have ever felt.' Despite his guilty plea, Greater Manchester Police's decision to disclose the defendant's personal details has provoked serious concerns given the well-documented dangers faced by those accused of blasphemy. The Free Speech Union believes GMP should have liaised with the Crown Prosecution Service before making these details public. The failure to do so will almost certainly result in a direct threat to his life. Footage posted on X shows a man standing in the Glade of Light, a memorial for victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, setting fire to pages of the Koran. Following the arrest, Assistant Chief Constable Stephanie Parker said: 'We understand the deep concern this will cause within some of our diverse communities and are aware of a live video circulating . . . We made a swift arrest at the time and recognise the right people have for freedom of expression, but when this crosses into intimidation to cause harm or distress, we will always look to take action when it is reported to us.' During the hearing, the defendant – who was visibly distressed and in tears – was defended by duty solicitor Zoe Earle. District judge Margaret McCormack, while acknowledging defendant's recent loss of his daughter, told him: 'The Koran is a sacred book to Muslims, and treating it as you did is going to cause extreme distress. This is a tolerant country, but we just do not tolerate this behaviour.' The judge ordered a pre-sentence report, with sentencing scheduled for April 29. As part of his bail conditions, the defendant is banned from posting on social media. The incident follows a broader crackdown across Europe on acts deemed blasphemous. Social media posts accompanying the Manchester video claim the act was carried out in solidarity with Salwan Momika, the Iraqi-born activist at the centre of a major diplomatic crisis after publicly burning copies of the Koran in Sweden. Momika, who sought asylum in Sweden, set fire to a Koran outside Stockholm Central Mosque in 2023, triggering protests across the Middle East. His actions led to violent demonstrations, diplomatic protests, and a tightening of Sweden's laws on public desecration of religious texts. Last week, Momika was shot dead in his Stockholm apartment in what police described as a targeted attack. In recent years, Sweden and neighbouring Denmark – both historically strong defenders of free expression – have moved to restrict Koran-burning protests under pressure from Muslim-majority countries. Denmark has criminalised the public desecration of religious texts, including the Koran, punishable by up to two years in prison. Sweden, meanwhile, is considering legal measures to curb religiously offensive protests deemeda national security risk, following the successful prosecution of right-wing politician Rasmus Paludan for hate crimes after he burned the Koran during protests in Malmö in 2022. These legislative shifts follow lobbying from theOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation,which has long sought international restrictions on the so-called 'defamation' of Islam. In bowing to diplomatic and security concerns, Scandinavian governments have set a perilous precedent, one in which secular democracies prioritise religious sensitivities over individual freedoms. Blasphemy laws were abolished in England and Wales in 2008, reinforcing the principle that religious beliefs should not receive special legal protection from criticism. While the Public Order Act 1986 makes it an offence to use threatening words or behaviour intended to stir up religious hatred, Section 29J – which was introduced precisely to prevent the reintroduction of blasphemy laws in another form – explicitly protects expressions of criticism, antipathy, ridicule and even insult toward religions and their adherents. Yet despite these safeguards, recent cases suggest a shift toward indirect enforcement of blasphemy restrictions via laws concerning public order, hate crime and incitement. In this case, Greater Manchester Police arrested the man on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. This charge originates under the Public Order Act 1986 – most likely under Section 4A or Section 5 – but is treated as 'racially or religiously aggravated' under Section 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which increases the penalty where hostility toward a racial or religious group is demonstrated or presumed. Nowhere is this shift more evident than in English schools. In Wakefield, four students were suspended in 2023 after a Koran wasaccidentally scuffedat Kettlethorpe High School. Though an internal investigation confirmed there was no malicious intent, West Yorkshire Police recorded the incident as a 'hate occurrence', and one of the pupils – who was autistic – received death threats, briefly forcing him into police protection. Also in West Yorkshire, a teacher in Batley wasdriven into hiding in 2021after displaying a cartoon of Muhammad during a religious studies lesson. This single act, undertaken during a lesson on blasphemy, led to several days of demonstrations outside the school gates, with large groups of Muslim men gathering outside the teacher's family home. In response, the school swiftly suspended the unnamed teacher pending a formal investigation. Gary Kibble, the headmaster, issued an 'unequivocal apology' for the teacher's use of a 'totally inappropriate image'. Footage on social media showed police reading out the headteacher's apology statement to the mob. After receiving death threats, the teacher was put into police protection and remains in hiding nearly four years on. According tohis family, he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and is unlikely ever to return home. Across Europe, a pattern is emerging. While legal mechanisms are increasingly used to suppress religiously offensive speech, the parallel threat of mob violence ensures that even those who escape prosecution face severe consequences.

"Racist? Xenophobic? No, sick and tired of being ignored about migrants","LAST WEEK the Office for National Statistics bulletin informed us that our population will grow by five million by 2032 and ten million by 2047, driven entirely by immigration. This was my comment in a Migration Watch press release: 🚨 This is more than worrying, it's an unfolding disaster 🚨pic.twitter.com/d4hikFLbcN I wrote a commentary in last Wednesday'sDaily Mailin which I said that I am a first-generation immigrant myself. You can read the articlehere. I wrote: 'My parents and I came to this country in the 1950s from our native Cyprus, then still a British colony. 'My parents came because they wanted to embrace this country's values and culture. 'However, that is not the case for a great many immigrants today who, under the much-trumpeted value of multiculturalism, cleave to their own values while politicians beat us over the head with the repeated mantra that diversity is our strength. 'They can say it as often as they like, but the reality is this is not a belief held by a vast swathe of the electorate. Indeed, the failure of both Labour and the Conservative parties to control immigration – legal and illegal – was the overwhelming reason many voters turned to Nigel Farage's Reform UK at last year's election. 'In a recent survey, more than 70 per cent of those polled said they wanted an end to uncontrolled immigration. 'This is not xenophobia or racism. It is simply the view of a population who are sick and tired of not being listened to.' In Thursday's edition of theTelegraph, an interesting report had the headline 'Britain reliant on foreign mothers to stop fertility rate falling through the floor'. This almost makes it sound as if it's by design. The paper spotted that while the fertility rate of foreign-born mothers has increased in the last couple of years to 2.03 per woman, UK-born women's fertility rate has fallen to 1.54, a 31 per cent difference. As we at Migration Watch have been saying repeatedly, this means that migration is now the sole reason for rapid population growth. The higher birth-rates of foreign-born mothers, and even more, the high level of foreign immigration, simply means that the ethnic minority proportion of the population will exceed 50 per cent (in other words become the majority) sooner than previously thought – the mid-2060s. A little nugget was uncovered by the perspicacious Karl Williams at the Centre for Policy Studies: in the first six months of 2024, more than 78,000 health and care visas were issued. Just 15,650 of these were to actual workers while 63,000 were to their dependants. Four dependants for each minimum-wage worker. The top five nationalities accounting for the visa were India, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Ghana. It gives an inkling as to why legal migration is so out of control, and why we doubt that net migration will fall to anything like the 340,000 per annum from 2029 that the ONS has been advised will happen. Then on Thursday came the Border, Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill. The most pointless piece of legislation imaginable. It will achieve nothing. It most certainly will not smash the gangs; the boats will continue streaming across the Channel. The legislation is tantamount to issuing an open invitation to carry on regardless. You can access the Home Secretary's House of Commons statement byclicking here. The statement was breathtakingly vacuous, reflecting the vacuity of the Bill. The Rwanda Act will be repealed – of course. Yvette Cooper's statement includes this cringeworthy sentence: 'The Bill sets out new, transformative measures to provide law enforcement agencies with stronger powers to pursue, disrupt and deter organised immigration crime.' These gems too. The legislation will be: 'Creating new offences for supplying, offering to supply or handling items suspected of being for use in immigration crime, for example the buying, selling and transporting of small boat parts'; 'Creating a new preparatory acts offence for collecting information to be used by organised immigration criminals to prepare for boat crossings'; 'Creating new powers to enable the search for and the seizure of electronic devices'. And this: 'These new counter terror-style powers, including making it easier to seize mobile phones at the border, along with statutory powers for our new Border Security Command to focus activity across law enforcement agencies and border force will turbocharge efforts to smash the gangs. 'The Bill makes it an offence to endanger another life at sea, to act as a deterrent to boat overcrowding and reduce further tragic loss of life among those making the perilous Channel crossings.' At the same time the Bill will water down border laws introduced by the Tories only two years ago designed to block illegal migrants from obtaining citizenshipand to force them to submit to scientific age checks. Seriously, Home Secretary? You really believe this Bill is going to smash the gangs, stop the boats and deter migrants from trying to cross the Channel illegally to claim asylum?

Should Reeves be sacked for breaking the Ministerial Code?,"THERE IS a clause in the Ministerial Code that states no conflict should arise or 'could reasonably be perceived to arise' between Ministers' duties and private interests. That brings us to Chancellor Rachel Reeves's 'farmer-harmer' inheritance tax raid on British family-owned farms. In theory, this new tax was intended to help raise money to fill the supposed £22billion 'black hole' in the public finances which Reeves mysteriously found five minutes after the Labour 2024 election landslide. If you believe the Starmer/Reeves claims about the black hole, most of the tax rises in the Reeves 'Bankrupt Britain' Budget lasts November could appear to make sense. As the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, explained referring to the tax rises,that businesses would just have to 'suck it up'. Unfortunately for Rachel and Darren, businesses have decided to not 'suck it up'. Instead new hiring has been cancelled, tens of thousands of people have been told they will be losing their jobs, several massive investments such as the AstraZeneca £450million new vaccines manufacturing plant (a cause of alarm, if not outrage, to the manufacturer's many critics) have been cancelled and many entrepreneurs are leaving the country. Moreover, as the Reeves/Starmer/Jones Budget plunges the country into a recessionary doom loop, tax revenues will collapse and any possible increase in tax revenues will be eaten up by the massive increase in the government's out-of-control spending andborrowing costs. Back to the farmer inheritance tax. Given the outraged reaction of British farmers, some might wonder why this reform was introduced. For one thing, it will be collected quite slowly as it will be paid over ten years after a farmer dies, so it will not be a quick fix for the 'black hole'. Moreover, like all new taxes, it will generate considerably less revenue than planned as farmers consult advisers to find ways of avoiding it, such as gifting their assets years before their deaths. There are several possible explanations for the 'farmer harmer' tax. These are not mutually exclusive: some or all may be true at the same time. On a basic level, some might see this as a typically vindictive Labour assault on a group they feel have traditionally voted Conservative and therefore there are no votes to be lost by penalising them. In fact, just as Stalin demonised the 'kulaks' for allegedly causing food shortages by hoarding grain, Labour may be hoping that their mostly inner-city electorate will cheer Labour's farmer-bashing when supposedly greedy millionaire farmers are landed with new taxes on their supposed 'massive wealth'. A further explanation is that the farm tax may force many smaller farmers out of business. This would allow the Labour government, possibly using the vehicle of the government-owned Great British Energy, to pick up these farms at knock-down prices and convert them from what Labour seems to see as 'useless' food production to much more useful (in Ed Miliband's eyes) wind and solar farms. There is a third and possibly more interesting reason for Ms Reeves's enthusiasm for her new tax. In 2015, the City investment group Aberdeen Asset Management, now calling itself 'abrdn' – perhaps Aberdeen decided capital letters were racist or something equally ludicrous – bought the multi-billion dollar US-based FLAG Capital. FLAG stands for 'Forest, Land and Agriculture'. Abrdn also launched a couple of multi-million pound funds to invest in UK forestry and agricultural land. In a 2018 interview with an agricultural investment publication, abrdn seems to express frustration at the difficulty in acquiring farmland in the UK due to so much being owned by families who had farmed the land for generations and so were unwilling to sell out to companies such as abrdn: 'given the family ties involved in the farmland sector, there may be multiple interests (not just financial)that could potentially create challenges in the ownership shift to purely financial owners'. 'Purely financial owners' are, of course, financial predators like abrdn which want to get their hands on British farmland. Abrdn is one of the biggest real estate owners in the UK and, in its December 2023 annual financial report, it cites its ownership of nearly £76billion of real estate assets and its intention on growing this area of its business. However useless the Tories were in power, it was hardly likely that a Conservative government would find a way to start confiscating agricultural land so it could be flogged off to City investors. Abrdn proudly claims that it does not make donations to any political party. But there are more subtle ways of influencing government policy than buying them and their wives fancy spectacles, clothes and underwear. Abrdn's big opportunity seems to have come with the impending election of Starmer's Labour government. In July 2024, the left-wing think tankDemos published a report titled 'The Future of Inheritance Tax in Britain'. A key issue covered in the Demos report is the number of exemptions from inheritance tax in the UK. Demos writes: 'The UK is unusual in offering 100 per cent relief for owned businesses and agricultural property, and not counting most private pensions for inheritance tax purposes.' If you've looked at Rachel Reeves's changes to inheritance taxes, in particular those concerning SIPPs and inheritance tax on agricultural land, you might detect more than coincidental similarities to the recommendations of the Demos report. The main sponsor of the Demos report was abrdn through their abrdn Financial Fairness Trust operation. Abrdn manages at least £506billion UK and global assets. So, what we appear to be seeing is a deliberate attempt to break the stranglehold farmers have on land ownership in Britain similar to the way the Dutch government used restrictions on fertilisers and other tactics to force some of their farmers out of business so the government could use the land for other purposes – mainly housing for migrants and energy production. Incidentally, the CEO of abrdn, Douglas Flint, was appointed by Rachel Reeves in December 2023 as part of a ten-person panel to advise her on her plans for government. Furthermore, abrdn is now one of the 14 members of the Treasury's newly-formed NISTA (National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority) set up by Reeves in October 2024. All this suggests there may be serious breaches of the ministerial code in the way that Rachel Reeves has apparently used a tax reform – the removal of the inheritance tax exemption on farmers – to further the business interests of a financial company, abrdn, with which she has very close connections. By forcing farmers off their land, because many will be unable to pay the new inheritance tax, Reeves seems to providing an excellent opportunity for her 'friends' at abrdn to buy agricultural land at very attractive prices. Given lawyer Starmer's apparent obsession with adhering to rules and regulations, it could seem astonishing that he hasn't yet sacked Reeves for what seem to be blatant, self-serving breaches of the ministerial code in the way Reeves appears to have used taxes to assist abrdn's commercial interests.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-03T01:19:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/should-reeves-be-sacked-for-breaking-the-ministerial-code/
"Don’t be bamboozled by the dystopian Stargate Project, President Trump – an open letter","Dear Mr President, The first week of your second term started off with radical intent. On Day 1 you rescinded 78 of President Biden's executive orders and signed 20 new ones,more than any other President on his first day. However, it is your Oval Office announcement on day two about the AI Stargate Project, named suspiciously to evoke memories of Operation Warp Speed, a project you unfortunately still view as a triumph of your first administration, that has set alarm bells ringing. The Stargate Project is a new companyplanning to invest $500billion over the next four years 'to build new AI infrastructure [by which they mean data centres] for Open AI in America'. It was set up by four partners: Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT; Oracle, the world's third largest software company whose name is taken from the codename for the 1977 project it undertook for its very first customer, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm, and MGX, an AI and technology investment firm established by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund in 2018. More and bigger data centres usually means more surveillance, which was meant to have gone out of fashion in 1989 with the Berlin Wall coming down, symbolically ending the Cold War with the 'Free World' winning. It consigned to the dustbin of history the hitherto most efficient and prolific of personal data gatherers, the East German Stasi, with their vast network of informants andpredilection for collecting genital swab samples from detainees to more effectively target police dogs on their delicate bits should the need arise. They may be more sophisticated but this new Stargate outfit is, I suspect, after something just as sensitive, each individual's unique DNA signature, and curing cancer is the heartstring they're tugging on to make it palatable. Sure, the company is promising it will deliver 100,000 construction jobs in the US, but does the personalised 'precision' cancer 'vaccine' market really need up to 20 new data centres to make it viable? The danger, Mr President, is that Stargate could be the portal to a far more dystopian future than the one presented in the Oval Office. Aspects of the project bear a strong resemblance to the War-on-Terror panopticon, theTotal Information Awareness project. This Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project envisioned tracking every aspect of an individual's activities and interactions with other people for terrorism prevention purposes. Just imagine the possibilities for surveillance if something like the £37billion Test and Trace system the UK built to map the spread of SARS-CoV-2 could be linked to every other bit of information that exists in databases about a person? A single unique identification number for each person, call it digital ID if you will, would make AI data mining of the interoperable databases so much easier. It's Stasi-like surveillance on steroids. Who needs informants when people inform on themselves? mRNA was the stardust sprinkled on the announcement by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison who said, 'Cancer diagnosis using AI has the promise of just being a simple blood test, then beyond that, once we gene sequence that cancer tumour you can then vaccinate the person, design a vaccine for them – design a vaccine for every individual person – to vaccinate them against that cancer and you can make that vaccine, that mRNA vaccine, you can make that robotically using AI in about 48 hours.' If only that little fairy story were true, Mr President. One of the first people to call it out was Dr Robert Malone, the originator of the idea that mRNA could be used for vaccines. He said: 'Who doesn't want a universal cancer vaccine? Who doesn't want to have this miracle that Larry Ellison is predicting? I would be the first to applaud, however, having been in this space for my entire career and knowing what the setbacks and challenges are, I gently say, I wish them luck. The cancer market is a multi-trillion dollar global market. It doesn't need government incentives, unlike biodefense.' Prior to the pandemic, BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac, the only mRNA company whose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA 'vaccine' failed to obtain an authorisation, all started out in the business of developing mRNA gene therapy cancer therapeutics. Historically cancer has been a far more lucrative market than vaccines. BioNTech was the leader in this area but prior to 2020 60 per cent of its cancer projects failed to progress from early trials. In fact one feature shared by the mRNA genetic vaccines pumped into people over the last three years is that by an amazing coincidencethey've been found to contain the same short gene sequence [called a PAM sequence] required as a tag for the recipients genome to be edited using CRISPR-Cas. Could this be necessary to help the cancer vaccines work, or is eugenics back in fashion under another name? It sounds to me, Mr President, as if Mr Ellison's been talking to Moderna, a company whose origins lie in DARPA's War on Terror-era Super-Soldier 'Killproofing' project. They were set up to commercialise the modified-RNA genetic vaccines DARPA dreamt up and which were sling-shotted into a money-spinning behemoth by Operation Warp Speed. Moderna invested heavily in robotic manufacturing and say they are an'AI first company'who want to use it to turn their scientists into 'super human creators'. As they put it, their 'changemakers' are 'Embracing the Creator's Spirit'. Little good and great harm came out of their original effort to slap things up in 48 hours – the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine – and now I suspect they want to play God again, which is where Mr Ellison and the Stargate AI come in. It sounds like an excuse to collect individuals' unique DNA sequences. Putting cancer back on the agenda would help Merck recoup their investment in Moderna.In 2016 Merck handed Moderna cash to build its factory in Norwood, Massachusetts,as part of their personalised cancer therapy collaboration. It was separate from the infectious disease collaboration that Merck announced it haddivested itself from on the day the UK's MHRA authorised use of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 injectable and just before Moderna's profits rolled in. Some proposals called for DNAgenetic fingerprints to be included in biometricnational digital ID systems. The lure of personalised cancer vaccines could be attractive enough for some people, blissfully unaware of any potential downsides, to give up these genetic fingerprints voluntarily. There are more sinister possibilities for the use of this information. It's already been posited thathuman immune system altering bioweapons could be developed. What risks could possibly be posed by allowing AI databases to design personalised cancer vaccines [biotechnology intended to alter the human immune system] in 48 hours? There's another danger. In the darkest version of a dystopian future, DNA genetic fingerprints could enable companies to claim ownership of individuals' DNA.There are two legal rulings that could make this possible.The first involves a company called Myriad Genetics Ltd which tried to patent the BRCA breast cancer gene. In 2013 a US Supreme Court judgement ruled against Myriad saying that naturally occurring human DNA couldn't be patented but synthetic DNA could. The second legal precedent was set in a Canadian court judgement against Percy Schmeiser, a farmer whose wheat was contaminated by genes from Monsanto patented wheat – the rule is that even without consenting to receive the licensed product, the recipient is bound by the patent licence. This meant Schmeiser case could no longer plant his own seeds because they were contaminated with genes Monsanto owned. If patented genes administered by mRNA have integrated into someone's DNA or their offspring's DNA, could the patent owner in this disturbing dystopian future own and control those people? It's too early to tell, but not inconceivable. What Stargate AIasked the US government for help with was ensuring that there is sufficient electricity supplyto operate the data centres. Mr President, you have pledged to issue 'emergency declarations' to ensure they get it saying, 'We have an emergency, we have to get this stuff built. They have to produce a lot of electricity, and we'll make it possible for them to get that production done very easily.' The emergency here seems to be linked to Moderna's falling profits and share price. It's easy to see why Stargate AI and its deliberate echo of Operation Warp Speed captured your attention, but it would be a misfortune for humanity for you to miss the danger signals a second time. These data centres may be privately built and operated but upon closer examination it appears to be a wolf in sheep's clothing hiding outsourced elements of DARPA's Total Information Awareness project.

Why do some vaccine-injured people wake up - but others don't?,"AS COVID VACCINE injuries started mounting up, and the topic became somewhat less taboo in the media – albeit always accompanied by boilerplate text about how the benefits outweigh the risks – some of us expressed hope that injured people would'wake up'to the risks of the shots, creating a wave of awareness and action. Some vaccine-injured people recognised what happened to them, accepted it, and joined the campaign for better research and vaccine safety. Yet, this has not uniformly been the case. A good many others remain in the dark, despite dealing with sudden and ongoing mystery illnesses. These people grope for answers, pinning their symptoms on catch-all explanations like stress or long covid (a more politically favourable diagnosis thanpost-vaccine syndrome), or awkwardly straddling the cognitive dissonance arising from the clash between medically recognised post-vaccine side effects and deeply held faith in the Saviour Vaccines. Why do some vaccine-injured people accept what happened to them, but others don't? Brendan and Michelle's stories offer insight. In an opinion piece for theSydney Morning Heraldthis week, we meet Brendan Foster, a communications professional and former journalist from Fremantle. Brendan had a heart attack after his Covid vaccine and has been going downhill ever since. His anecdotal is equal parts description of his injuries and social signaling that he belongs to the correct tribe. From, 'I kept getting sicker. But you won't catch me reaching for a tin foil hat': 'I had a suspected mild heart attack just over two years ago. ""Probably just a reaction to the COVID vaccine,"" a series of medicos cheerfully informed me, as some nurse grimaced while shaving away swathes of my matted chest hair to attach ""stickers"" for an ECG.' Brendan had no prior health conditions. After several days in hospital, a cardiologist tells him he has myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle. 'The medical condition was of unknown origin, but it might've been triggered by a recent COVID jab. Whatever caused that coronary blip,I had no regrets about getting vaccinated.I haven't wavered.There have been no urges since to look up flat earth theory.' Despite the possibility ofpermanent heart damage, Brendan would do it all again. Regretting getting a shot that ruined your heart would be like believing the earth is flat. The poor man has since been back to the Emergency Department (ED) five times with heart issues, thinking he's going to die. 'After getting zipped and zapped in the hospital, the diagnosis is always the same: pericarditis. I'll spare you the medical mumbo jumbo, but it's swelling of the tissue surrounding the heart. Both myocarditis and pericarditis have been linked to the COVID vaccine and the virus itself. For the record, I've had COVID once and am fully vaccinated.' Now Brendan has myocarditisandpericarditis. You know what's worse than the cardiac risk of covid or the vaccines? Increasing your risk by having both. If I were the editor, I would have insisted that Brendan detail whether the covid infection was before or after the first heart attack. However, it is unlikely that 'a series of medicos' would have attributed his heart attack to the vaccine if, a) he hadn't just had the vaccine, and b) they could reasonably pin it on a covid infection instead. Again, Brendan emphasises that he's definitely not a conspiracy theorist: 'To make the bold claim that cardiovascular conditions could be caused by one or more of the potions to prevent the virusisn't some crazed, anti-vax conspiracy theory– as the Albanese governmenthas a website dedicated to exactly that. Maybe both have caused my cardiovascular complaints. However, no one in the medical fraternity can confidently say which one... ...I was more than OK being one of the walking ""vaccine injured,"" convincing myself I was part of that glum utilitarian idiom:the greatest good for the greatest number of people.' Brendan's hedging – his illness might not really have been caused by the vaccine. But if it was, he'd be fine with it, because that would make him a human sacrifice, part of a prehistoric ritual that has recently come back in vogue. Unfortunately for Brendan, he's getting sicker by the day. He was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called hemolytic anemia, a potentially fatal disorder in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. Apparently, there is evidence to suggest that both Covid infection and the vaccines can cause hemolytic anemia. He has terrible brain fog, and also has relentless hiccups which he thinks might be due to the jabs. But: 'Just to be abundantly clear:I am pro-vax.I didn't have one nanosecond of doubt about the importance of getting the jab, not only for myself but for my loved ones. History is littered with illogical moments, butfolk refusing to get inoculated against COVID would be one of humanity's dumber choices.' 'I might die, my quality of life is severely degraded, and I suspect it is due to the Covid vaccines. But please do not think I am anti-vax or that I regret my situation. Volunteering as tribute is the only logical thing to do when faced with the unnecessary risk of life-threatening injuries from medical intervention that doesn't prevent infection or transmission.' A megatrillion people would have died: 'Without the vaccine, it's estimated another 20 million people would've died. More than 7 million have already perished because of the virus. There is no denyingthe COVID-19 vaccine is one of the greatest achievements in medical sciencethat substantially altered the course of the pandemic. But I think we need to acknowledge that it's just possible that thousands of us are still battling serious health issues because of the jab. I can assure you that I wear no tin foil hat.' I want to place my hand on Brendan's shoulder, look him in the eye and whisper, 'You got the vaccine. You're a credible professional. You believe in Science. People respect you. You are not a cooker.' 'The Australian government has paid more than $32 million in compensation to people who had adverse reactions to COVID vaccines. However, they stopped accepting new claims in September. There have been calls from academics and medical professionals for Australia to develop a permanent vaccine compensation scheme. Given no one seems to understand the long-term impacts of subjecting our bodies to a quick succession of jabs, it might not be a bad idea. But I guess like me,we may never know what is making us sick.' Brendan just spent his entire opinion piece telling us that both he and medical professionals suspect he is badly injured by the covid vaccine with conditions that are also recognised by the Australian Government. At the same time, he says he doesn't know what made him sick, and he's desperately afraid that people might think that he is a conspiracy theorist for talking about his injuries. I posted this story on Instagram and received many comments about how stupid Brendan is. Unlikely. I reckon he's probably quite smart –smart enough to engage in some gymnastic motivated reasoning. As beautifully explained by SubstackerGurwinderin an article titled 'Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things,' motivated reasoning is the deployment of one's intellect in service of one's base instincts (e.g. social belonging) and ideological biases (e.g. religious adherence to The ScienceTM️). Evidence suggests that intelligent people are more prone to motivated reasoning than those less intelligent, and that this is the case on both sides of the political divide, says Gurwinder. While less intelligent people are more easily misled by others, more intelligent people are more easily misled by themselves. There are plenty of reasons why someone like Brendan might be so motivated to build a fortress of denial. Fear of being out-grouped. Attempting to resolve the cognitive dissonance that clangs through his opinion piece, and presumably his head on a daily basis. Avoidance of painful feelings (like betrayal and grief). And, lack of courage to examine his own beliefs and change them if needs be. There are potentially others. This is the kind of person who gets a glimpse of the Matrix and chooses to stay plugged in anyway, even though he can't shake the feeling that things aren't adding up. 'I understand that mindset because I used to be him. I read it and I go, ""I get it,""' Michelle Hunder told me over the phone. But Michelle, a successful Melbourne-basedmusic photographer, had a very different response to her Covid vaccine injury. Michelle got her Pfizer shots at the height ofMelbourne's world-famous lockdowns, in September 2021. It was a starkly different life from her day-to-day before the pandemic, travelling the globe with music artists. Getting vaccinated, we were told, was the only way to go back to normal. 'I would have done anything to get my life back,' she explains. 'Everything I'd been working towards for 15 years I hit in 2019. It's not a job. This is everything to me. The thing that feeds my soul. I love what I do so much.' Michelle's cardiac symptoms started with the first shot and escalated after the second. Unlike Brendan, the vaccine link wasn't recognised at first by the medical professionals she went to for help. Michelle presented at ED five times with severe chest pain, but was told she had anxiety and to seek therapy. However, 'I knew straight away from the first night that I ever presented to hospital that something was very wrong, and it was related to the vaccine, which I had had four days before,' says Michelle, adding that she has never tested positive for Covid to this day. It turns out, Michelle was right. In 2022, she was finally diagnosed by a cardiologist with pericarditis caused by her Pfizer Covid vaccinations. How did Michelle call it correctly so early in spite of medical gaslighting, while Brendan is still tying himself in knots despite acknowledgment from medicos, scientific papers, and the Australian Government that there is a high probability that his conditions are vaccine-related? Michelle reckons curiosity, education, and readiness have a lot to do with it. 'I have a very curious mind. I was always extremely left-leaning until probably 2017, 2018,' she says. 'I just started to listen to alternative views, and I found it really, really great for balance. And I really started questioning a lot of stuff that my friends and a lot of people had thought as gospel, just to open up my own worldview.' Incidentally,research showsthat curiosity is the strongest countermeasure against ideological bias. Due to being 'weirdly obsessed' with evolutionary biology, one of the people Michelle tuned into before the pandemic wasBret Weinstein, an evolutionary biologist with a deep knowledge of bat viruses. Weinstein happened to become one of themost famous skeptics of the Covid wet market origin theorybecause of his uncannily specific expertise. As Michelle had already followed Weinstein for some time, she trusted his ability to parse scientific information. So when Weinstein started questioning elements of the Covid dogma, including vaccine safety, Michelle's curious mind tugged on those threads, and she sought more information. None of this convinced Michelle not to get the shots – her desire to get her 'dream life' back was by far the greater motivator. But when she was injured, there was already enough mental scaffolding in place for her to be open to assessing the facts of her situation on their merits. She was ready. It wasn't easy, though. 'I see what happened to me as such a destabilising event, because it literally flipped everything that I had believed for 40+ years on its head,' Michelle recalls. Not only was Michelle 'very pro-vax,' having taken every shot she'd ever been offered in her life, but she says 'I just had never had any reason to distrust the government, which sounds crazy to a lot of people, I'm sure.' 'It's like an entire worldview. Until something really shakes you to your core, it's really hard to see the other side.' Michelle says it was socially and emotionally challenging to speak up about her vaccine injury, but as a music industry professionalwith a profile, she felt a responsibility. 'I felt like I'm not one of those people that if you see, you're gonna think, oh, they're a kooky f*cking anti-vaxxer,' she says. 'I'm like, no, look at me, I'm one of you. You lefties, I was pro-vax, I was one of you, I was compliant, I'm in the music industry, I'm in the arts industry and this happened to me.' Online, Michelle was attacked from both sides. Pro-vaxxers called her an anti-vaxxer – an argument that she says is 'intellectually dishonest.' 'The truth is I went and lined up and got two vaccines. I got a second one even after I was injured. So how the f*ck do you call me an anti-vaxxer?' But vaccine skeptics also came at her. 'Some people called us ""sheep"", or said it was our fault for what happened because, you know, people were trying to warn us. But like, you're just being bombarded with, ""This is safe. This is fine. You're gonna be fine.""' It's understandable that being ostracised from all angles would be an experience people like Brendan might want to avoid. Michelle doesn't give herself credit for this, but I will – it requires a degree of courage to take that risk. Going through this experience has been a growth opportunity for Michelle in this regard. 'I have so much admiration for people that were able to stand their ground and go, [covid vaccination] doesn't feel right for me,' she says. 'Like, that's strength of character. I think I am that person now, but I wasn't that person then.' Most of all, Michelle says that what got her through was the unconditional love and support of her husband, and close friends who were able to listen to her experience without judgment – even if it didn't align with their own beliefs. Faced with a dead end from the medical establishment in terms of treating her symptoms, Michelle sought help from a naturopath and began to heal. Three and a half years on, she says she's pretty much fully recovered. During that time she has done a tonne of media interviews and continues to raise awareness about the difficulties that Covid vaccine-injured Australians face in seeking diagnosis, treatment, recognition, and compensation. Contrary to the simplistic adage that the vaccine rollout was just an IQ test, the reasons people got the shots were complex and multi-layered. So are the reasons for some injured people resisting the awful realisation that they were collateral damage in the rollout. As someone who's been through the process and come out the other side, Michelle says it's important for injured people to be heard, understood, and recognised. Pejorative labels like 'anti-vaxxer' and 'sheep' trigger 'immediate shutdown of a conversation.' What injured people need when they come forward is 'empathy and understanding,' not abuse. Media reporting still undermines the lived experience of the vaccine-injured, with excessive emphasis on the rarity of their conditions, and editorial choiceslike putting 'vaccine-injured' in quote marks. 'You're like, what? I literally have a piece of paper that says that I've got pericarditis [from the vaccine],' says Michelle. There also needs to be 'large-scale government acknowledgment of us because that's the thing that has not happened, that's what we have not had,' she says. The need for acknowledgment from the officials who promised that the vaccines were safe and mandated them on the public is a common theme expressed in testimonials like those found onJab Injuries Australia, or featured on last year's 7NEWSSpotlightTV special. 'The lack of acknowledgment is actually retraumatising over and over, and the lack of compensation is another retraumatising event,' says Michelle. Although there's no question that Michelle's pericarditis was caused by the vaccine, she was not able to qualify for thefederal compensation schemebecause she did not spend a night in hospital. Ironically, she went to hospital multiple times, but was turned away by dismissive medical professionals. The compensation scheme closed in September last year, having paid out only $38.6 million (AUD) for 418 approved claims of 4,941 received. At the time, there were 1,057 claims still being processed – the remainder had been rejected or withdrawn. Michelle has now joined aCovid vaccine injury class action, along with more than 2,000 other Australians. 'I want there to be some type of historical record about what happened to us,' she says. 'That's the only thing that's important to me now. It's the principle, you know?' It's possible that official acknowledgment on this scale could even give people like Brendan the cover they need to finally accept what happened to them, too.

Sam Harris popularised the term in this context with the publication of his bookWaking Up, and the accompanying meditation app,Wake Up. The concept of waking up is also linked with unplugging from the simulated reality ofThe Matrix, as did Neo in the cult 1999 sci-fi film of the same name. Characters who became aware that the Matrix existed were offered a red pill (unplug, choose to live in reality) or a blue pill (go back to blissful ignorance, stay plugged in to the simulated reality), hence the popular terms 'red pilled' and 'blue pilled' to denote a person's level of consciousness. White pilled (awake but hopeful) and black pilled (awake but pessimistic) are spin offs of these terms. Since the pandemic, the term waking up has been used colloquially to refer to the ability to smell the B.S., primarily as regards Covid propaganda, but also state/globalist propaganda on a range of other issues. In this article I use the term to mean an awakening to the facts about how things are, such that it requires the reevaluation of preexisting beliefs, one's conditioning, and the narratives one had previously (and probably unquestioningly) employed to make sense of the world. This may or may not also involve a spiritual element, and/or further analysis of state-sponsored propaganda.",The Conservative Woman,2025-02-01T01:16:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-do-some-vaccine-injured-people-wake-up-but-others-dont/
Extending the licence fee will make the BBC even more unpopular (if that’s possible),"ONCE again, our government does not understand. It doesn't seem to matter whether it is the Labour Party or the Conservative Party in power: neither has managed to grasp the utter failure of the BBC to remain relevant or popular in the UK. After all, if the BBC was still a competent, respected and well-run organisation it would not be constantly begging for more money. In their millions, the British public have rejected the BBC. The Corporation's licence fee income has fallen off a cliff –by 30 per cent, the Government admits. A fullhalf million people cancelled their licences last year alone. This 'BBC-exit' is not all down to competition from streaming services, as the Government and the ever-supportiveGuardianwould have us believe. In fact if you don't have a BBC licence you are already banned from watching live sports or any other live streamingwhateverchannel (terrestrial or on-demand service like Netflix) it is on. As ever the Government is being less than honest. The main reason for the unpopularity of the licence fee is the unpopularity of the BBC – its unrelenting woke, left-progressive worldview, its repeated insistence on trying to defend the reputation of sexual predators, its ideological agendas from trans and DEI to unfounded climate scaremongering, all reflected in its plummeting editorial standards which deny informed debate and limit its journalistic impartiality and investigation. This is what has driven viewers away in their multitudes. What then of the response of this Labour government to the question of the BBC's funding crisis and future? Is it to embrace the free market and accept that the BBC's failings are responsible for the mess it is in, and let the public speak? Is it to acknowledge that turning it into a subscription service would be the best way to reflect its value and popularity in the fragmented market that they claim is its undoing? No, of course not. Rather its reponse is to double down with further licence fee constraints on a public that may not want to watch the BBC at all, to ignore what already makes the licence fee unpopular, which first and foremost is the iniquity of its being the prerequisite for watching any other terrestrial channel or any other live TV on any other service. Their latest outrageous idea is to force households thatonlyuse on-demand services such as Netflix or Disney+ to be made to pay the licence fee too, even though these channels, for which they already pay subscriptions, are all they watch. What sort of message does this send? Well, it's another example of the Labour government's refusal to accept people's free choice. It's another example of the Labour Party and the state overreach, this time dictating to the public the terms on which they can access any of the entertainment and information they choose – and making them pay for it via a licence fee for the privilege on top of their subscriptions of choice. It would be daylight robbery. Why on earth should you pay for something you don't use? Too few people understand this – that if you opt out of the licence fee you are 'not allowed' to watch any other live channel and if you do you risk of having TV Licensing monitors on your back and taking legal action against you. Before now, it was hard to see how the BBC and its licence fee could get more unpopular, but this would do it. If you ever wanted implicit government acceptance of the failure of the BBC, here it is. The BBC is failing, so we must force those not using it to pay for it. What comes next? How far will this government go in its strangulation of choice to desperately save the BBC? Will we see the licence fee extended to videos on YouTube? Podcasts on Spotify? Maybe scrolling on X will require paying the licence fee. Extending the licence fee will not solve anything. It will just fuel the ever-growing discontent with the BBC.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-31T01:18:00+00:00,BBC Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/extending-the-licence-fee-will-make-the-bbc-even-more-unpopular-if-thats-possible/
Untested – the mass-produced covid vaccines that skipped clinical trials,"WHAT IF the vaccine you received had not been in a clinical trial? For millions of people worldwide, this is precisely what happened when they unknowingly received a covid vaccine manufactured using a process where the end product had never been trialled in humans. This manufacturing shift resulted in significantly higher rates of adverse reactions – 13 times more in some cases – representing a regulatory failure with profound implications for public trust and safety. Yet, the UK Covid-19 Inquiry tasked with investigating these critical decisions has avoided addressing this issue, which lies at the heart of the controversy on regulatory failure. Imagine a chef perfecting a recipe in a small kitchen, only to mass-produce it in a factory using different ingredients and techniques. In December 2020, the UK's drug regulator, MHRA, gave a temporary authorisation to a mass-manufactured vaccine (Process 2 or P2) without requiring human trial data. Available safety and efficacy data were based solely on Process 1 (P1), the small-scale clinical trial method. MHRA relied on lab-based'comparability' studies to justify the switch, but these assessments failed to account for potential risks posed by even minor manufacturing changes. This article delves into how the critical manufacturing switch occurred, why it went largely unchallenged, and implications for public health, safety, and regulatory accountability. Crucial difference between P1 and P2 Even small changes in manufacturing can significantly affect a final product's safety and effectiveness. Pfizer/BioNTech gave the public a different product to the one tested in clinical trials; it was a 'bait and switch'.The industry uses the phrase 'the process is the product' because of wide variation in the end product can result from small changes in the manufacturing process. Process 1 (P1)was used to produce vaccine administered in clinical trials. This small-scale, lab-controlled method relied on purified materials to create DNA and mRNA, ensuring minimal risk of contamination. MHRA relied on safety and efficacy data exclusively from P1-manufactured vaccines. Process 2 (P2)by contrast, was designed for large-scale vaccine production. This method involved growing DNA templates in vats of E. coli bacteria – a faster but riskier approach that can introduce contaminants such as bacterial DNA fragments and endotoxins, substances that can trigger a vast range of pathology. When mass manufactured batches were first given to humans, on 8th December 2020 in the UK, MHRA had seen no trial data of these products. The data they had seen analysed in the regulatory submission was up to the cutoff on 14th November 2020 andthere was no data on P2. MHRA authorised a P2 batch (EJ0553), on December 2, 2020,based solely on laboratory-based 'comparability assessments'between P1 and P2; there was no human testing. MHRAjustified making this decisionbased only on these comparability studies, by claiming there had been 'full-scale validation' of the manufacturing process, but this was focused entirely on quality and quantity of RNA. MHRA also failed to ensure that the public was informed of this massive unknown and the potential risks involved. Informed consent would have been possible if there had been more honesty about uncertainties. Instead, the public was subjected to a barrage of 'safe and effective', including from the regulator themselves – the MHRA itselfsets theterms for theadvertising and promotion of medicines and effectively prohibited any caveats on the 'safe and effective' mantra. Avoiding the Hard Questions On January 22, Dr June Raine, the then CEO of MHRA, was questioned under oath about MHRA's testing of covid vaccines. The convoluted way the question was phrased allowed for an evasive response. It is no wonder the inquiry failed to properly discuss this issue, as it would expose a monumental failing on the part of the regulator. The question that should have been asked is, 'Was the product given to the public manufactured using the same process as the product given in the trial?' The answer to that would have been 'no'. Instead, Raine was asked about the difference between batches tested by MHRA and batches given to the public. MHRAdiddo limited testing of batches from the mass manufacturing process, but that is not the issue which is that there was no clinical trial of the P2 product used for the vaccination of the public! The question,at 25:35 minutes: 'Some have suggested that the batches, which were delivered to the United Kingdom for use amongst its population, [...] were batches that were produced by a different manufacturing process [...] as had been tested by the MHRA. So, bluntly, the suggestion has been made [that] you tested and authorised and certified a certain number of vaccines made by manufacturing process A, and then the manufacturers actually delivered vaccines to the British population produced as a result of a different manufacturing process, and one, by inference, which had not been tested.' Raine replied,'My understanding is that the manufacturing process would have been the same.' Note that that Hugo Keith KC deliberately refers to process A and B to distinguish the manufacturing of different batches. This was a further obfuscation as Pfizer/BioNTech always refer to the clinical trial manufacturing as Process 1 and the mass production as Process 2. When Ruth O'Rafferty of Scottish Vaccine Injury Group was questioned earlier in the week, her attempts to raise the issues (at 32:37 minutes) were quickly shut down with a claim that there was no time to discuss these topics in such detail. The failure to address these issues is because what happened is nothing like what should have happened. The regulator was relying on evidence that was entirely inadequate to demonstrate a sound safety case for the vaccines. What should have happened MHRA should have insisted on comprehensive data showing that conclusions drawn about P1 were comparable to P2 based on what happened in humans. For the purposes of this article, we shall leave aside the fact that the harm from P1 was not fully disclosed to MHRA and, even then, therisk of a serious adverse event of special interest(which were conditions identified in advance as being worth watching for) was 1 in 800 for Pfizer and Moderna combined and 1 in 990 for Pfizer. Pfizer did set outa plan for a direct comparisonbetween Process 1 and Process 2 products, but said it should be'post-approval'because of the'urgency of the current pandemic'. Pfizer'sclinical trial aimedto compare P2 in 250 participants per lot. However,this comparison was abandonedon February 9, 2021. Only252 people were given P2as their first and second dose. Despite this, P2 products with known manufacturing differences were distributed to millions worldwide. In September 2022, the trial was terminated. Pfizer said that'given the number now administered worldwide, the originally planned comparison of manufacturing processes is no longer warranted.' The trial records say that theFDA and EMA agreed to early completion of this trialhaving 'removed the objective to describe the safety and immunogenicity of prophylactic BNT162b2 [...] produced by manufacturing ""Process 1"" or ""Process 2"" because of the volume of BNT162b2 now distributed and administered globally using manufacturing ""Process 2,"" making this comparison unwarranted'.MHRA havestated,'this process comparison was not conducted as part of the formal documentation within the protocol amendment.' Results comparing the 252 given P2 against those given P1 doses have never been disclosed. However, even without a control group, differences between Process 2 lots were stark, with the EU processing plant having twice as many adverse reactions as USA sites, 10.4 per cent vs5.5 per cent. Figure 1:Comparison of Adverse Events byManufacturingSitefor Process 2 (P2) Vaccines (mostly given as dose 3), December 2020–March 2021 This figure shows percentage of adverse events reported among individuals who received P2 vaccines, broken down by manufacturing site. The EU manufacturing site showed a significantly higher adverse reaction rate (10.4 per cent) compared to the USA site (5.5 per cent), illustrating inconsistencies in vaccine quality across production facilities. December 2020 to March 2021 The first batch given in UK was EJ0553. On November 27, 2020, Commission on Human Medicines (CHM)said of the first two batches(which had been rejected by the MHRA labs*), 'it is not currently feasible to compare these two batches to those given to subjects in clinical trials.' That evening, these dud duo batches were switched for two alternative batches and then a third was added. They reconvened a meeting on the next morning. One of these contained visible particulate matter, and one had RNA that was the wrong size. The batch with floaters in it was the infamous EJ0553 – the first batch used in the UK. The CHM fearedthey were not getting the best quality batches, and that 'it may be the case that the batches the FDA are evaluating are further along the development lifecycle than those allocated for the UK.' Later, their worst fears were realised. The company said the EJ0553 vial had failed to meet their own acceptance quality limit based on visual inspection. They did not know the ratio of lipids to RNA nor the overall potency (the measure of how much spike was likely to be produced). The minutes say,'The company further explained that these particles did not alter the concentration of the drug product and they did not think this would have an impact on safety and efficacy of the product. However, as these wererejected vials[italics mine],they did not perform a potency test on these rejected vials.'The company explained that 'the appearance of these lipid-associated particles increases at the end of the filling line'.Nucleic acids clump and lipid nanoparticles float; both could result in a higher concentration of product in the last batches to be filled. The batches they were first offered may have been worse than these, but that does not excuse using these ones. The CMHminutessaid that variable potency testing 'makes interpretation of the available data difficult'. They noted that the potency test would be passed if between 30 and 100 per cent of cells produced spike, saying:'The limits for in vitro cell expression were also wide being set at 30 per cent or above. This could lead to large differences across batches.' They added, 'a concern was raised that if the product has less than 50 per cent RNA integrity, it may suggest that half of the product is not what it was laid out to be.' However, they then declared it reassuring that 'the later developmental batches have a higher level of RNA integrity that is more comparable with the earlier clinical batches.' The focus throughout seemed to be a concern that junk vials might not have the same efficacy. There was minimal discussion on safety even though they had seen no data comparing these P2 products with P1. The defence for using these vials was that they 'were not understood to be associated with a change in concentration of RNA containing LNPs'.That claim did not appear to be based on data, nor should it have provided any reassurance regarding safety, which depends on factors beyond the concentration of the active ingredient. Three days later, Lord Bethell signeda temporary use authorisation. EJ0553 became the template for all subsequent UK Pfizer batches, despite the absence of clinical safety data for P2. On 21st December, the EMA gave a conditional authorisation for Comirnaty (the brand name) and MHRA authorised for use in the UK both batches from the 'dud duo', EE8492 and EE8493, which were rejected in November. A later trial showed the true nature of EJ0553 was indeed very different to P1. Evidence emerges As P2 was used and people were affected, MHRA should have been alarmed by the signals. From the first day of rollout, doses of EJ0553 coincided withthree cases of anaphylaxis among 400 initial recipients, affecting those with a clinical history of anaphylaxis. By March 2021, breast screening programs noted 11 per cent of dose 1 recipients and 16 per cent of dose 2 recipients exhibitedlymphadenopathy, a 'swelling of lymph nodes' that 'usually settles within a few days' – a dramatic increase compared tothe trial's P1 product rateof 0.4 per cent. Adjustments tobreast screening protocolswere required to avoid false cancer diagnoses. In April 2021, Pfizer submitted evidence showing significantly higher rates of adverse reactions among clinical trial participants who received P2 (see Figure 2). These participants were originally part of the placebo group and had not previously received the P1 vaccine used during the initial clinical trial. Following the temporary authorizations, most participants in the placebo group were promptly vaccinated with the P2 product, making medium- and long-term safety analysis impossible. Despite the stark increase in adverse reactions among these individuals, Pfizer dismissed the findings, stating that the excess reactions wereas expected. Figure 2:Adverse Reactions in P1 vs. P2 Recipients in Clinical Trials, Pre- and Post-UnblindingThis figure presents data fromPfizer's FDA submission, comparing adverse reactions between individuals who received P1 vaccines during the blinded trial phase (roughly around December 2020) (Table 60) and those who were given P2 vaccines as a third dose after two placebo doses up to March 2021 (Table 65). Adverse reaction rates were notably higher in the P2 group, despite the relatively short follow-up. Despite this, MHRA did not re-evaluate the trial findings in light of this, nor did they respond to signals in Yellow Card reporting. Furthermore, they ignored a disproportionately high rate of adverse events in women given P2 compared to near-equal rates in those given P1 in clinical trials. Pfizer's June 2021 Periodic Safety Update Report (figure 3) detailed this stark gender disparity. This was reinforced byLareb's findingthat 48 women and 19 men experienced prolonged lymphadenopathy. Figure 3:Gender Disparity in Adverse Reactions: P1 vs. P2 VaccinesThis tablehighlights a stark gender disparity in adverse reaction rates between clinical trial data (P1) and real-world data (P2). While P1 showed higher adverse reactions in males (middle column), P2 data from real-world administration revealed significantly higher rates in females (first column), suggesting a fundamental difference in the reactogenicity of P2vaccines. In September 2021, MHRA was first presented with trial data on P2. This was not data regarding the 252 participants given it as dose 1 and 2, but was on just 306 trial participants who received P2 as a booster. Both the original batch from the UK rollout and one of the batches rejected outright by USA and UK were two of the three batches (EJ0553 and EE8493) used in Pfizer's boostertrial. The recipients of these P2 boosters had a 5.2% lymphadenopathyrate. In comparison this was 4.3 per cent for those receiving P2 inthe adolescent trialand 0.4 per cent forP1. These findings indicate a 10- to 13-fold increase in reactogenicity. Did they act? No. They said nothing until December, then on Christmas Eve 2021, they added this fact as a footnote to a tablesayingthat 'a higher frequency of lymphadenopathy (5.2% vs 0.4%) was observed in participants receiving a booster dose (third dose) compared to participants receiving 2 doses'. This statement misleadingly framed reactogenicity as booster-related rather than acknowledging its roots in the P2 manufacturing process. Lymphadenopathy wasjust as common with dose 1when P2 was given. In reality, 85 per cent of lymphadenopathy cases occurred after the first two doses, with some persisting beyond six months. The difference was not the dose; it was because P2 was given. The elevated rate of lymphadenopathy and other adverse events is indicative of a marked inflammatory process likely linked to P2 manufacturing processes. Contaminants such as endotoxins or residual plasmid DNA may contribute to these signals. It could be something else or a combination of factors – the exact cause is as yet unproven. Unlike largely endotoxin-free P1 batches, risk of endotoxin in P2 usingE. colitoproduce key materialsis higher. Conclusion MHRA's failure to address differences between P1 and P2 in their safety analysis undermined public trust. Millions of people received a product with a 13-fold higher reactogenicity than P1. Key safety signals – such as lymphadenopathy, gender disparities, and reactogenicity – were overlooked, raising serious questions about regulatory accountability. These decisions have had lasting consequences, from deaths and injury to denial of high adverse reaction rates and widespread public confusion and concern. It is long past time for an overhaul of our regulator, MHRA. * N.B. These first two batches were called EE8492 or CTM12 and EE8493 or CTM13 and had also been rejected foremergencyuse in the USA on 20th November 2020.The rejection was because of 'differences in applied label'.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-25T01:21:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/untested-and-uncontested-the-mass-produced-covid-vaccines-that-skipped-clinical-trials/
"Behind that bland mask, Starmer is a ruthless tyrant","HAS THIS country ever suffered such a cold-hearted, calculating, dishonest Prime Minister? And are we experiencing a government, under the iron rule of Two-Tier Keir, that will become impossible to remove? The seemingly bland Sir Keir Starmer is fast emerging as one of those most dangerous of people – a silent but uncompromising ideologue.Few have questioned his past, but we should. Why did he embark on a trip to a work camp in Soviet Czechoslovakia in 1986, at the height of the Cold War?Hereare Comrade Keir's details from the Czechoslovakian secret police archives. What or who motivated him? On what basis did he qualify to besecretary of the communist Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyersfor 20 years until he was appointed as DPP? Read their stand on what they call 'the recent far right insurrectionary activities' following the Southport murders to see Starmer's joined-up thinking with his previous UK communist attachment. Then there is his curious obsession withending the death penalty worldwide, detailed by Laura Perrins on Tuesday. Sir Keir has risen to the top of the Labour hierarchy through a deftly camouflaged insincerity and crafted dullness – no one offended, no one an enemy. He dislodged the noisy old-school communists such as Corbyn who were calling too much attention to their hard-left proclivities and made people think he was centre left. Yet under scrutiny his path to victory looks to be one of carefully hidden but even more tyrannical purpose of the 'true believer'; his position the culmination of his own 'human rights' march through the institutions. He won the election thanks to an almost universal disillusionment with the Tories, but also thanks to a gamut of barefaced lies – to farmers, business owners, students, pensioners, WASPI women, and the whole white- and blue-collar working population, all the while conveying a stodgily safe persona to the middle classes. Along with Starmer came a majority cohort of eager socialist MPs, happily endorsing his ruination of Britain and destruction of freedoms. Never have so many empty-headed nodding bean-counters filled the Chamber, genuflecting to his every word, enabling him to implement his Socialist serfdom 'human rights for everyone else' multicultural dream, whatever the cost. Despite the economic downturn and chaos brought upon Britain in just six months of his tenure, the outing of his lies, hypocrisy and greed followed by revelations of Labour involvement in and Starmer's obfuscation over Pakistani rape gang activities and, last but not least, his blatant lying and cover-up of Axel Rudakubana's extremist and violent past, amazingly overa quarter of the population still support him and Labour. There can be little doubt that under the bland exterior Starmer is ruthless and implacable. A country traumatised by vile rape gang revelations and the even more terrifying Southport murder trial facts, needed a leader able to empathise with people's fear and horror. But instead of being truthful and reassuring the families of the victims this would never be allowed to happen again, he attacked, demonised and imprisoned the justifiably outraged, blaming them, not the perps nor the government multicultural policy behind it, and now that their outrage is vindicated he lays the blame everywhere except at his own front door, the ticking metronome of the true believer almost audible in his head: tick tock, tick tock, keeping a steady, robotic cadence as he delivers in monotone whatever lies he is propagating at the time to the great unwashed whom he disdains. The ghost of Stalin has one hand up his back and Davos Man has the other as he projects the casual, callous indifference of the anti-human virus they both share, visible in his treatment of OAPs, farmers, rape-gang victims, the victims of the Southport demon and their relatives alike, in fact to all those with concerns about the country's direction of travel, on whom his two-tier justice relentlessly falls. Will the 4,000 pensioners that he previously assured Parliament would die if the winter fuel allowance was withdrawn draw warmth from his assertion that they are doing their bit to fix the NHS through their sacrifice? Will thousands of farming families feel their lost pastures and herds are better off under the ownership of BlackRock or other voracious conglomerates? Will the thousands of raped and tortured under-age girls be happy their cases are not going to become public knowledge because the vast majority of perpetrators, enablers and politicians covering up these crimes will never be called to face justice, while ever more fighting- and raping-age illegal immigrants are welcomed into the country and housed and fed in these communities? Will the parents of the Southport victims ever have the opportunity to look Starmer in the eye and ask him why he covered up the facts of the case or why, after he had hastily laid flowers in the town, did he rush off to give assurances of safety to the Iman and congregants of the local mosque? Predictably he refused the full public inquiry needed into the rape gangs in favour of toothless local inquiries, run by the very people who have brushed their local scandals, culpability and criminality under the carpet to date. Will the public inquiry he has called into the Southport terror prove any better or does it reflect a ruthless confidence that it can steered from the start into making recommendations to suit his 'true believer' purposes? Almost undoubtedly. He seems unperturbed by criticism, impervious to his plummeting popularity – Guido reported a new low yesterday – butdoubles down instead. The latest extension of hate crime destines all those who don't wind in our necks and stay silent on the issues that most concern us to be targets of Starmer's swift justice, with speedy trials and excessive sentences. British white working classes and any citizens who support them are to be disdained and marginalised. If that means trampling over our children's safety to protect his freedom-killing, dehumanising ideology and his own power base, so be it. This is the brutal moral-free zone that our PM inhabits, leaving me with one question that should concern us all.

‘Diversity is our strength’: The cult of the True Believers,"ON FRIDAY, Konstantin Kisin tweeted the following: 'Something I've often wondered about: if ""diversity is our greatest strength"" why is it that we have to be reminded of that after every terrorist attack?' Something I've often wondered about: if ""diversity is our greatest strength"" why is it that we have to be reminded of that after every terrorist attack? The reason is that the governing powers – both left and right – really believe it. When they say diversity is our strength or, as Fraser Nelson would say, Britain has experienced an integration miracle, it's because deep down in their heart of hearts, they think it is true. That's how bad things are. That's why things are the way they are and why it is so difficult to make any real change. This is how it goes these days in the West. There is another diversity stabbing of children, three little girls in Southport, or the Afghan 'asylum seeker' who killed a two-year-old boy and seriously wounded other infants in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, or the murder of 22 at an Ariana Grande show aimed at little girls, or the gang rape of girls in multiple towns, or the murder of journalists over a cartoon in a magazine, and before the bodies are cold we will be told that diversity is our strength. We are told this because they believe it and you better believe it too. And if you don't believe it, you will end up likePeter Lynch, rounded up by the Old Bill for not believing that diversity is our strength and then killing yourself in some Godforsaken British prison. Sadly, we are controlled by the True Believers. The True Believers are in Downing Street and the entire legal system is chock-a-block with them. They are in the media, academia and many corporations. To understand the True Believers I turn to Thomas Sowell. In his brilliant 1996 book,The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social Policy, Sowell describes how the governing class view the world and themselves. They have a particular vision of the world that they believe is moral and a better vision of the world than the ordinary British voter has (my words, not his). Sowell: 'The rise of the mass media, mass politics and mass government means that the beliefs which drive a relatively small group of articulate people have great leverage in determining the course taken by a whole society.' It makes perfect sense that Sir Keir Starmer was PM when the Southport massacre occurred. Starmer built his career as an articulate lawyer, which is why he sounds so wooden in politics. That career was at one of the most left-wing sets in the bar, Doughty Street Chambers. The very talented barristers at Doughty Street will judicially review the government to death should they dare enact a policy that has the support of the voters such as deporting foreign rapists or cutting back the welfare state. These lawyers are the anointed and they have a vision of society that is very different from that of the ordinary British voter. It is no coincidence, then, that Sir Keir Starmer leveraged his talents to pretty much end the death penalty in certain jurisdictions where the Privy Council still has authority. This means that all this chat about Rudakubana receiving the death penalty is a waste of time and energy. The anointed have already settled that matter. Starmer, of all people, is not going to pull the UK out of numerous international human rights agreements so the UK can hang 'em high. If you knew how ridiculous this sounds you wouldn't bother tweeting it. (For the record, I do not believe the death penalty should be given to someone who commits a crime under 18. Sorry.) Starmer has links to an army of lawyers who, as I have said, have spent their entire careers judicially reviewing the government when that government tries to implement a policy they have a mandate for. When they are not doing that they can be found at the immigration tribunal arguing why the latest rapist shouldn't be deported to whatever Godforsaken country they come from. All of this was made possible by Tony Blair and the Human Rights Act 1998 that has imposed his vision on society long after he left office. Genius, when you think about it. It is this vision of a diverse Britain imposed by a relatively small group of articulate people using the Human Rights Act 1998 (paid for by the taxpayer via legal aid) that has been imposed on Britain for the last twenty to thirty years. And you fools thought you could change it all at the ballot box. Don't be silly. Sowell states that according to the anointed, 'problems exist because others are not as wise or as virtuous as the anointed'. If you apply this to immigration you understand why we are where we are. The voters are stupid, they are not experts, they don't understand that the economy needs immigration. Our NHS needs to steal nurses from poorer countries. As for those less virtuous, these are the racist, fascist and Right Wing Thugs that walk among us. Sowell again: 'People are never more sincere than when they assume their own moral superiority.' As such, when the politicians and lawyers or the lawyers who are now politicians (the very worst kind of leaders) say, diversity is our strength, they really believe it. They know that a diverse Britain is a morally superior one to the one you have in mind – one that is less diverse. This is why they do what they do. This is what is so frightening, far more frightening than any conspiracy theory or idea that they intend to destroy Britain with open borders and mass immigration. It's the exact opposite: they believe they are improving Britain with mass immigration. Therefore they believe that by importing the father of Axel Rudakubana they are Making Britain Great At Last. That's your horror story. The elite have a vision of Britain and it is one of open borders and ultra-diversity. The elite believe their vision is morally superior to yours and if that means that a few thousand girls get raped by a few 'bad apples' and a few girls get stabbed here and there, this is the price you must pay for a Better more Diverse Britain. Mark Steyn says: 'Sir Keir is, as a practical matter, an accomplice of the stabbers and gang rapists. He would rather your pre-adolescent daughter gets anally branded and your kindergartner dies from up to 122 stab wounds than permit the citizenry to dissent from the state ideology that ""diversity is our strength"". Which, as a practical matter, means that those who would destroy our society retain a monopoly of violence.' And he is right on that: Starmer is willing to let these horrors happen because they are worth it for a Diverse Britain. Think about it. Do you really expect any of the ruling class who have inflicted this horror show (including Conservative leaders such as Cameron, May and especially Boris Johnson, as well as Tony Blair) to say, sorry, we got it wrong. This would cause a total psychological breakdown. How would you feel if you realised that ayou were partly responsible for the deaths of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, that their blood was on your hands? It's not going to happen as that amounts to nothing less than treason, child rape and child murder. So we are left with articleslike this from theSunday Times. Usually I like Matthew Syed, a perfect example of an integrated child of immigration if ever there was one. But that piece made me feel sick. I don't know how you could write about 'hope' after reading the victim impact statements delivered by the families in Liverpool Crown Court. I haven't felt hope, only profound sadness. Lately, I have lingered extra-long at my ten-year-old daughter's bed time. 'We would do anything to hold Alice one more time,' said her devastated family. They will never get that chance. Ever. Atheists like Matthew Syed and Keir Starmer believe that the parents of Alice, Bebe and Elsie will never see their children again. There is nothing else. Yet they talk about 'hope'. I get to hold my daughter whenever I want. When I think about those families it hurts but I experience only a millionth of the pain they must feel every hour of every day. For them, there is no hope. And to pretend otherwise is an insult to them. I don't think there is much hope for Britain either. Not while the anointed keep pushing their vision on to everyone else. And they never even asked for permission.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-28T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/diversity-is-our-strength-the-cult-of-the-true-believers/
Beware the expedient Christianity of the secular Left,"BY NOW, you've probably heard of Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde. You will likely be aware of the homily she gave at Tuesday's post-inauguration 'interfaith prayer service', which took place in the Washington National Cathedral (a beautiful interior, though closed at night in case any homeless people wander in). The sermon was an unremarkable, scripturally adjacent exercise in performative wokeism, addressed personally to the new president (bad pulpit etiquette to single out a congregant). Safe to say, it's caused quite the stir. Bishop Budde has a wonderfully Dickensian name and, although my research is admittedly rushed, is of a familiar ecclesiological type. Her Jesus is not the challenging and discomfiting religious revolutionary of the Gospel accounts, but the agreeable hippie of more recent invention. She is a proponent, it seems to me, of that untroubling and therefore inadequate theological tradition which insists – against all evidence – that the primary goal of the religious life is to be nice. Here's the bad news: it isn't. Christian teaching is that each of us is called to be a saint, and the saints that we revere were not always nice to be around; that's how they were able to become saints. I've found this whole business energising, not because of anything the bishop said, but because of the reaction to it. The normal M.O. of secular liberals is to look at believers such as myself with despairing condescension. However, the Jesus-lite apologetics which shaped this act of clerical self-indulgence have been welcomed by the legacy media and its internet outriders. Following Bishop Budde's intervention, many of these intellectually fulfilled sceptics have stumbled upon a previously hidden inner evangelical core. Having left the Church after readingThe God Delusionand concluding that they are 'spiritual but not religious', they have suddenly been reminded that there isanotherMessiah. Not the one who conquered death and was the intersection of timelessness with time, that stuff is by-the-by, but the guy who used the parable form to signal his endorsement of open borders, and to correct that earlier draft which mistakenly suggested that biological sex is fixed. This is a recurrent heresy, to think of Our Lord without regard to his Jewishness and to ditch the Old Testament on the grounds that He came not to fulfil it so much as to apologise for any offence it might have given. * Now that this Bishop has delivered a message that is balm, many of them have overnight become biblical scholars and evangelists for this comfortable version of Our Lord, a Jesus who is only too keen to conform to the ideological fashions of a godless age. Funny though this is, it really won't do. As St Paul reminds us, it is the function of the Church to go on Mission to the secular world, not to lazily embrace the transient orthodoxies of the day. Bishop Budde has been congratulated for her 'bravery' in standing up to this supposedly odious President, and his obnoxious indifference to Christ's second command, that we should love our neighbours as ourselves. In reality, it is not 'brave' to preach in a way that is guaranteed to curry favour with the secular Left. That's theHave I Got News for Youversion of evangelisation – telling your crowd exactly what you know they want you to say. If Bishop Budde really wanted to speak Christian truth to power, she could have used her pulpit and reputation as a liberal pastor to call out the powerful interests and enemies of Faith, which have seized and bastardised the honourable traditions of moral liberalism to the exclusion of many people of various faiths. As is always the case, things immediately go wrong as soon as we wander unguided off the Word. The issue of border security and repatriation is particularly relevant. The biblical narrative is written in the language of geography, nation, territory and border: The Fall is a story of exclusion from a place; the early history of the Jewish nation is a chronicle of exile. Plots of land are set aside in the Old Testament and thereby sanctified as places of right worship. In the Abrahamic faiths, borders perform a moral function. In the Christian tradition nations are families which have a duty to love the stranger, it is true, but not in cases where charity crosses over into subversion. Jesus instructs us to love our neighbours even when – especiallywhen – we do not feel well disposed towards them, but this requires that we have neighbours, and therefore the stable social order which makes neighbourliness possible. We must extend hospitality to the extent only that it does not become self-destructive. To cherry pick the words of Our Lord, or to read the Beatitudes through a secular lens, risks the amusing but irritating mass confirmation bias that was on display in the aftermath of Tuesday's event. We should worry that the message many have taken from Bishop Budde's sermon is not one of Christian love – oragape– but its opposite: that you should love your neighbour as yourself unless that neighbour happens to be Donald J. Trump. Those determined to hate on the new president have thought themselves into positions which add up to a theology of disdain, more dogmatic and intellectually eccentric than anything the Church has to offer. These new and temporary converts are unfamiliar with what happens in Church, and, if they were, they'd not be so insufferably smug about all this. Nobody listens to the homily;that is the point of it. While Budde was castigating him for his homophobia, it's quite possible that Trump's mind had wandered back to a few hours earlier, when he was busting out moves to the most famous gay anthem ever written. Our culture is spiritually thirsty, but the water this bishop was offering has a too much salt in it. *This tendency is beautifully critiqued in Brant Pitrie'sJesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-26T01:20:00+00:00,Faith &amp; Family,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/beware-the-expedient-christianity-of-the-secular-left/
'The most disgraceful period of recent history’ – MPs savage the MHRA,"ON Thursday January 16, Conservative MP Esther McVey led a backbench debate in the Commons criticising our drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). She highlighted the MHRA's historical failings in investigating harmful drugs, its abysmal record regulating covid vaccines, its lack of transparency, fatal conflicts of interest, its failed Yellow Card early warning system and its intimidation of journalists. She then lambasted the organisation, established in 2003, for ignoring covid vaccine safety signals which she said caused unnecessary injury and death, and for taking four years to publish minutes from a meeting with the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) that discussed covid vaccine benefits versus risk. 'Full of redactions', it left readers with 'more questions than answers'. The MHRA had removed the CHM minutes from its website by the weekend. One can only hope to reinstate the redactions. In July 2020, Baroness Cumberlege published areport, led by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review (IMMDS), into the MHRA which described the organisation as 'disjointed, siloed, unresponsive, and defensive'. Nothing has changed, as highlighted in this importantdebate. The good news is that the House recognised 'that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency continues to need substantial reform'. The Hansard transcript stretches to 25 pages with 13,000 words, so here are the edited highlights. ESTHER McVEY (Tatton) (Con) This House notes that the yellow card system for reporting suspected adverse drug reactions is failing, with no process for following up on serious or fatal reactions and conflicts of interest, with 75 per cent of the MHRA's funding being derived from industry fees. It also notes the MHRA's delayed response to reports of myocarditis, pericarditis and vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia following covid-19 vaccination, despite action from regulators in other countries; and calls on the Government to fully implement the recommendations in the IMMDS Review and to acknowledge the harm done to patients and the financial burden on the healthcare system as a result of the MHRA's widespread regulatory failures. Alarm bells rang for many of us when, in March 2022, Dame June Raine, the chief executive of the MHRA, boasted of the agency's transition from watchdog to enabler. Twenty years ago, the Health Committee reportThe Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industryfound that the MHRA was unusual in being one of the few European agencies 'funded entirely by fees derived from services to industry'. Not much has changed since, with the MHRA continuing to gain 75 per cent of its funding from the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, the agency's transition from watchdog to enabler does little to quell suspicions of conflicts and the implications that has for patient safety. One of the most worrying issues is the MHRA's mismanagement of the yellow card system. The reporting scheme should be a valuable source of information about possible harms, and act as an early warning system, but there is gross under-reporting to it. As the IMMDS's 2020 review put it, the system is 'too complex and too diffuse to allow early signal detection'. Under-reporting is a big problem [only 10 per cent of reactions reported] because it makes it difficult to spot safety signals and assign causation. That then translates into unnecessary harm or death, with devastating side effects from treatment going unnoticed for years, months or even decades. In 2021, the MHRA reacted slowly to strong signals that there was a serious problem with the AstraZeneca vaccine causing an autoimmune condition called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Denmark and other European countries suspended the vaccine for all age groups on 11 March 2021. The MHRA, by contrast, only started to restrict the vaccine in some age groups nearly two months later, on 7 May – yet there was a signal in the yellow card reports as early as 8 February. How many people were needlessly exposed to a risk? It is worth noting what happened when theDaily Telegraphreported on the potential causal link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots in March 2021. The journalist who wrote the story received a threatening call from the MHRA warning that theTelegraphwould be banned from future briefings and press notices if it did not soften the news. The system does not work. We know from freedom of information requests that the MHRA does not have a process for investigating and following up individual yellow card reports. We know that the retrieval of follow-up information from the yellow card database still requires manual extraction and that only 54 per cent of deaths reported as possibly linked to exposure to one of the covid-19 vaccines were followed up by the MHRA. That is extremely worrying or, as Matt Hancock infamously described it in a 2021 WhatsApp message, 'shonky'. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, replied to that message by saying that the system 'needs to get better'. In the Commission on Human Medicines meeting on 18 November 2020, the expert working group asks if Pfizer was 'required to respond to the 36 questions asked by MHRA'. In response, the MHRA confirmed that 'there is no formal obligation to reply'. Why is there no formal obligation to reply? Surely it is essential, when making such an important decision as to whether to allow a new vaccine to be rolled out to the nation, to have those replies. The minutes do not specify the 36 questions. Indeed, they do not appear to have been mentioned again. I asked a written question last week to see whether, in the spirit of openness and transparency, the MHRA would publish those questions, and any answers received from Pfizer. The response was that the MHRA does not intend to publish those questions or any subsequent responses. Why not? Is this not a matter of public interest? Those issues were not resolved before the MHRA gave the green light to start the vaccination of the nation. Particularly worrying is the issue of lymphopenia, where blood does not have enough white blood cells, [lymphocytes are white blood cells crucial to the immune system] which was reported in phase 1 of the trials and then went away – not because they fixed the problem, but because testing for the condition was not conducted in phases 2 or 3. GRAHAM STRINGER (Blackley and Middleton South) (Lab) One of the things we should remember is that the MHRA and the whole of the health industry are swimming in a sea of pharmaceutical sharks. Pharmaceutical companies produce some extraordinarily wonderful products that keep us safe, but they also produce huge profits, and sometimes they get their products on to the markets by telling lies, or certainly by sins of omission. DANNY KRUGER (East Wiltshire) (Con) The vaccines were developed at a frantic rate. The Government managed to act at great speed, largely because they bypassed Whitehall. But significant questions remain, about whether the vaccines are genuinely safe and effective. It is right that people ask questions about the data on excess deaths and wonder if there is a connection with the vaccine. Ultimately, there is only one way to answer that question: to have the data. However, we do not have access to that data. The Government hold it and, extraordinarily, they have made it available to the pharmaceutical companies that produce the vaccines, but not to researchers – individual-level death data that shows who was dosed with what vaccines and which of them died. The UK Health Security Agency has admitted that the data exists, but has refused to release it, almost unbelievably, because of the risk to the mental health of the relatives of the dead. That begs the question, does the data show a link between the vaccines and those deaths? We have a genuine problem with the regulation of the medical industry and of medical products. I very much welcome the appointment of R. F. Kennedy to the role of Health Secretary in the United States. He will shake things up over there. Perhaps the Minister can be our own RFK over here and bring some genuine transparency to the health system. SHARON HODGSON (Washington and Gateshead South) (Lab) The MHRA needs urgent and substantial reform. One area is the need for mandatory reporting of adverse events to the yellow card by healthcare professionals. Contrary to responses I received when I asked questions on the topic in the House, which argue that the current system works, it does not. It is broken. The current voluntary system, which doctors enjoy, enabling them to choose whether to log side effects and complications to the MHRA yellow card, is simply unacceptable. This voluntary system has led to many adverse events going unreported. The system must be made mandatory, but that fix alone will not work if the data is there but is not used. RUPERT LOWE (Great Yarmouth) (Reform) The biggest challenge in the MHRA's history was the covid response, and it failed. It enabled the biggest assault on civil liberties and economic prosperity in my lifetime, which was lockdown – the greatest scandal of them all. It was, quite simply, the most disgraceful period of recent history. The MHRA's insistence on vaccines for all enabled lockdown restrictions to continue for as long as they did. It must take part responsibility for the consequences: vast NHS backlogs, mental health issues rife, soaring alcohol-related deaths, obesity booming, children's development wrecked, long-term illnesses mounting, increased substance abuse, domestic violence on the rise, unnoticed child neglect, fathers missing the birth of their children and elderly loved ones left to rot and die alone. We were not even allowed to mourn the dead properly. The wicked list is endless. None of it was based on any science, and certainly not the vaccination of almost the entire population – including, disgracefully, young children. This was a hideous dereliction of duty by the MHRA. It was not just children it forced the covid vaccination on, but tens of millions of people who had absolutely no need for it whatsoever. The question is: who regulates the regulator? Who protects against regulatory capture? How did the MHRA allow politicians, celebrities and even its own agency to describe these vaccines as safe and effective, when yellow card data clearly showed it is not universally safe and certainly not universally effective? KARIN SMYTH – Labour Minister for Secondary Care The MHRA plays a vital role in fulfilling the Government's health mission: balancing its responsibilities to maintain product safety and championing innovation. I will be clear about the role of an enabler. It is about enabling innovative products to reach patients without compromising patient safety and without unnecessary delay. On supporting safety, the MHRA recognises the need constantly to seek to improve its safety monitoring systems to deliver better results for people. Recent improvements include implementing the new Safety Connect IT system, following recommendations from the Cumberlege Review. This IT system will improve the efficiency of reporting and processing of yellow card reports, much of which we have heard about today, supporting the prompt identification and assessment of new safety concerns.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-24T01:21:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-most-disgraceful-period-of-recent-history-mps-savage-the-mhra/
"The more you know, the more you know you don’t know","WE HAVE JUST celebrated approximately the fourteen billionth New Year that the universe has enjoyed since it came into existence. A few hundred million years after that, what we now know as the Milky Way galaxy started to form. Much later, about ten billion years after the presumed Big Bang, our solar system coalesced out of gravitationally ""pregnant"" cosmic dust, followed shortly afterwards by planet earth. Soon, despite the brutal heat of the boiling rocks, the first single-cell life forms came into existence. Nobody knows why, or how, or even exactly when. Neither does anyone really know why it took a further two billion years for earth to develop atmospheric oxygen and to evolve multicellular life. It was not until a further thousand million New Years had passed uncelebrated by Jackie Bird that the first animals and plants evolved. They were led out of the primordial darkness by thegreen seaweedswhich are still with us in a myriad different forms. A further five hundred million years went by before life suddenly exploded into a staggering variety of different species in what is today known as the Cambrian Explosion. Once again, nobody knows why. Another thing nobody can explain with confidence is why that was followed by so many catastrophic mass extinctions. Around 440 million years ago about half of all the life forms on earth were wiped out for no apparent reason. Eighty million years after that, the Late Devonian extinctions wiped out the majority of all the remaining species, once again with no-one now able to offer a convincing explanation. A further ninety million years later the Permian-Triassic extinction killed off more than 80% of all marine species—though not the seaweeds—and nearly as many land ones. With events speeding up, it was only another 50 million years before the Triassic-Jurassic extinction wiped out almost as high a proportion of species as its predecessor had. Yet again, this was an event for which no explanation has been widely accepted. Not even Karl Marx had a scapegoat for that one, and of course Brexit had yet to happen. Finally came what is known as the Cretaceous-Maastrichtian extinction a mere sixty-five million years ago. Despite its name, it had nothing to do with the European Union, being so named because a Belgian geologist called André Dumont found the fossilised remains of a giant sea monster near Maastricht. Now known as the Mosasaurus, these huge creatures—some as long as a small CalMac ferry—swam the world's oceans for fifteen million New Years; fossils have been found as far afield as Morocco and South Dakota. Without global cooling, those areas would still be under water today, as would Westminster, Washington DC and Holyrood, which would all now be covered with kelp, sea anemones and crab droppings, to the general benefit of mankind. This most recent of the great extinctions accounted for three-quarters of all species known to have existed before it, including the Mosasaurus and almost all of its fellow dinosaurs except birds. The archaeopteryx was an ancestor of the gannet. The cause of this catastrophe is now widely thought to have been a nine-mile-wide asteroid which hit the gulf of Mexico, travelling at 50,000 miles an hour. The impact released energy equivalent to that of five million nuclear detonations. But it was to be another 63 million years beforeHomo erectusappeared. As Keir Starmer doubtless knows, thisHomowas the original tool-maker, developing the stone hand-axe that was to change the world by starting the process in which the brain took over from the body as the source of human power. Toolmaker One had a cranial cavity that was approximately the same size as the Prime Minister's, though it was slightly exceeded by that of Neanderthal Man, who evolved another million years later and developed the faculty of speech. If that sounds recent in the longer sweep of history, it is important to bear in mind that the emergence ofHomo sapiensis even more recent than that. It emerged on the East African savannah just 300,000 years ago, possibly less. However, not much was achieved in terms of the rise of civilisation for a very long time. Agriculture did not develop in non-equatorial latitudes until after the most recent period of global warming, at the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. It is thought the population of the entire earth then was about 2 million, which is less than half that of Nairobi today. So, for 13,999,990,000 years the earth lived without settled communities and the need for impersonal rules of general behaviour, what we now call ""law"". Nothing much happened. But as soon as communal life established itself, and primitive proto-law emerged as an organising force, we started making tools more sophisticated than hand axes. Within five thousand years we had invented writing. Thus 98.75% of the earth's history went unrecorded, even on stone tablets. Four thousand years after that, paper and printing changed the way both law and authority were thought of and exercised because written material could now be circulated. The same happened more recently when electronic communications started to create an inter-connected global community out of many previously independent national units, though this had the disadvantage of making law harder to enforce. But the lucky part of humanity was able to retain control over things they had invented, and not have them stolen by more powerful neighbours. Without that, human development would have been very different, and might not have happened at all. The most spectacular result of the ability to advance technology on the basis of control over intellectual property has been the James Webb Space Telescope. That remarkable instrument, a million miles away in space, has enabled us to study the earliest stages of the evolution of the universe, from its probable origins in the alleged Big Bang, using infrared telescopy of adequate quality for the first time. The point I wish to stress is thatalmost everything I have written above was unknown to the most sophisticated European scientists as recently as the late eighteenth century. But the more that has been discovered since then, the more we realise there is yet to discover. Logically, that means that by the time we know everything, we will have come to realise that that we know nothing. Is the mind of God like the inside of a ping-pong ball? But I digress. The really important point is that rational, or ""sapient"", life on earth isrecent.That is the overarching thought which emerges fromAlexander von Humboldt: a Concise Biographyby Andreas Daum, the latest book on one of the first explorers to help revolutionise humanity's view of its own origins. Humboldt was born in Berlin in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1769, the same year as Napoleon was born in Corsica. In a standing rebuke to the degeneracy of modern educational ideas, the man who was to become one of the most important scientists in world history, never went to school. Professor Daum describes some of the tutors that Alexander and his elder brother Wilhelm were given: ""Johann Christian Kunth stood out among the boys' teachers. In his Lutheran background and appetite forBildung(self-cultivation through education and knowledge), he embodied the central role that the Protestant bourgeois family played in the social basis of education in the state of Prussia... Alexander benefited especially from his interest in geography. Kunth arranged for private sessions with Berlin scholars and opened doors for Alexander to new intellectual worlds. Christin Wilhelm von Dohm, later famous as an advocate for the emancipation of the Jews, familiarised the brothers with questions of national economy, trade and statistics. This thematic range allowed them to perceive global economic interconnections beyond Prussian mercantilism."" (p. 13) If Humboldt became known for one thing beyond his investigative travelling (mostly in northern Europe, Russia and the Americas) it was his more general idea that the whole of natural history is interconnected, that all life has common roots. His lack of formal schooling helped keep him out of the mental tramlines of his time. So too did the fact that he never finished a university course or took a degree. Humboldt enrolled at the new university of Göttingen in the summer when the French revolution broke out, but left after spending much of the next two and a half years travelling and meeting interesting scientists who were happy to share their knowledge with him. He was his own ""director of studies"", deciding about his reading and travel on the basis of his own curiosity, which is the only honest way to study. ""For Humboldt the natural scientist, his weeks in England were the most productive,"" Daum says. (p. 23) He met Joseph Banks, the botanist who had travelled on James Cook's voyages, and Henry Cavendish, who discovered the properties of hydrogen. Neither man, incidentally, ever took a university degree either. Humboldt then went to Paris where he met the great chemist Antoine de Lavoisier (whose only degree was in law). This French aristocrat ""explained the role of oxygen in combustion."" (p. 24) It was he who discovered the relationship between oxygen and combustion. Cavendish was an aristocrat too—son of the Duke of Devonshire—while Banks came from a wealthy gentry background in Lincolnshire. The four of them were amongst the most influential figures in world science, yet there was not a single ""qualification"" between them. Clearly there was something to be said for the freedom to follow your own interests in the pre-rational age. Once the limiting prejudices of mechanical rationality and materialism arrived in Europe with the French revolution, that started to change. Inferior people were allowed to judge the activities of their superiors, about whose work most knew little or nothing. Lavoisier was guillotined on a trumped up charge in the last days of the Terror in 1794. The fact that he was officially exonerated less than two years later did not help science recover the genius who the ""democratic"" mob had killed in their rage to impose liberty, equality and fraternity. Once again, the thought recurs of howrecentall these new discoveries were in the cosmic timeframe. Humboldt lived in a period when nobody was sure how rocks had come to be. Were they laid down on the ocean floor—a theory known as Neptunism—or did they have volcanic origins—Vulcanism? Geology was then known as ""geognosy"" and was a by-product of raw material mining. Edinburgh's James Hutton was a pioneer in the same field at about the same time. Like Humboldt though independently of him, Hutton came to the conclusion that the world was an interconnected system, embracing both biological and geological processes. His reputation in this respect was another victim of the new fad for rationalism in the nineteenth century age of the machine. Another lesson for modern man is that Humboldt avoided politics all his life. He took no interest in it and had no shred of nationalism in his approach to scholarship. His favoured place of work was Paris, and he wrote many of his books in French. But he was still happy to return to Germany regularly, and settle there in later life. ""Humboldt was the catalyst for a politically fraught but lasting entanglement of German and French culture. He resisted all attempts to fix ideological and political boundaries. To that extent, his declaration of allegiance to France as his 'second fatherland' was a rhetorical gesture that reflected his pragmatic view of the world."" (p. 129) This book is a fascinating and readable account—partly due to its brevity—of the life of an important scientist much ignored by modern scholarship, even in Germany (as the Guide to Further Reading emphasises). It should be compulsory reading for the intellectual pygmies who still inhabit the Holyrood ghetto which so catastrophically mismanages the Scottish educational system. Everything is geared to making children ""job ready"" when education really ought to be based on stimulating curiosity and teaching the ability to communicate enthusiasm for the subject you are curious about. Those were the primary virtues which Humboldt embodied all his life. They are even more relevant in the digital age when materialistic rationality has gone on the offensive against creativity and intellectual freedom.

Is Trump a Deep State stooge?,"I AM SURE that, like me, you enjoyed the sugar rush of Trump's inauguration with the marching bands, the public humiliation of the Democrats and his rapid signature on multiple worthy Executive Orders. Sadly, day two of the Trump Presidency proved to be as depressing as some wise souls were fearing. At a press conference with Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI and creator of ChatGPT and Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, Trump endorsed a joint venture to invest up to $500billion in infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence. The three CEOs are the prime movers in the initiative, named Stargate. Microsoft is amongst the investors. Stargate, initiated during the Biden administration,has already started to build data centres and the electricity generation needed for the development of the AI infrastructure. Perhaps the shiny new initiative would be better named Hellsgate. In September last year Ellison waxed lyrical about his vision for anAI-powered surveillance future. He predicted that 'citizens will be on their best behaviour because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on . . . We're going to have supervision.' Ellison enthused about linking the project to digital health records and stated that the project would enable cancer to be diagnosed and mRNA vaccines to be created for individuals within 48 hours. His statements prompt the question as to what is considered 'best behaviour' and by whom. From bitter experience, we know that the digital prison he envisages will inevitably lead to mandatory vaccinations, carbon allowances, a digital currency and a profusion of more experimental 'safe and effective' poisons leading to our virtual enslavement. Sam Altman's sister Ann has recentlyallegedthat her brother groomed her and sexually abused her between 1997 and 2006.Altman has denied the claims. Elon Musk has criticised Stargate. He believes that SoftBank has raised only $10billion of the $100billion startup costs. Musk is also involved in alawsuit against Altmanwhom he claims has changed the open source venture OpenAI into a profit-based enterprise. 'OpenAI Inc has been transformed into a closed source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world, Microsoft.' There's a surprise. Shortly before his inauguration Trump had a three-hour meeting with Epstein's friend, the Stargate and OpenAI investor Bill Gates, at Mar-a-Lago. Instead of arresting him, Trump seems to have had a jolly chat about 'world health'. Although the US will no longer support Gates's World Health Organization, there was no mention of the Trump administration withdrawing its lavish funding for the Gates-founded GAVI, the (WEF-aligned) Vaccine Alliance. Operation Warp Speed 2 is no doubt in the offing. In view of the above it is likely that we will be kept waiting for prosecutions of the rich, entitled and famous who raped children at Epstein's various properties and the true story of the events of September 11, 2001. Perhaps 'The Donald' is just another Deep State stooge.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-27T01:16:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/is-trump-a-deep-state-stooge/
Climate Bill threatens us all with starvation (not that the MSM wants to know),"THE Climate and Nature Bill has its second reading in Parliament on Friday this week, January 24. The Private Member's Bill poses the biggest threat to the future prosperity of the UK of any Bill ever to have been introduced and already has the public support of 192 MPs. Yet there seems to have been little or no discussion of it in the mainstream media. (A quick Google search confirms this). Credit then to Bev Turner for her recent GB News video about it, which you can watch here. Readers may recall that we covered the BillonTCWa couple of weeks ago. A quick recap: The stated aim of the Bill is to 'tackle the climate crisis and environmental disaster'.It will supposedly do this by: That final provision is especially pernicious, as imported emissions account for nearly half our total emissions. Currently the Net Zero Act commits the UK only to reducing territorial emissions, i.e. those generated within our own geographical borders. Partly because of climate policies, a lot of manufacturing has been offshored. But because we import the goods instead of making them here, our consumption has not changed. The new Bill would demand that we actually reduce consumption. The Bill does not specify what annual emissions should be, as it is cumulative emissions between now and 2050 that matter. However its own logic makes it clear that total emissions, including imports, will have to be cut by about two-thirds from today's levels by 2030, and virtually eliminated in the following ten years. What would this mean for the UK? Three years ago, a Government commissioned report byUK FIRESlooked in detail at the implications of a 45 per cent cut in territorial emissions by 2030. It concluded that it could be met only with 'significant restraint' across all sectors, an understatement if there was ever one. (UK FIRES is a collaboration between the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London.) The report stated that car use would need to be drastically cut, along with consumption of beef, lamb, milk and cheese. Heavy goods vehicle mileage would have to be cut by half. Almost all UK airports would have to be shut, leaving only Heathrow, Glasgow and Belfast. New gas boilers must be banned by 2028, and the use of construction materials and cement halved. That was just for a 45 per cent cut. AnotherUK FIRES reportlooked ahead to Net Zero in 2050. By then all consumption of beef and lamb must be phased out, and fertiliser use drastically reduced. All UK airports would shut and all shipping to the UK eliminated. The researchers said that people should wrap up warm in winter and heat rooms only if people are sitting in them. The use of fossil fuels, of course, would have to be completely phased out. Meanwhile the construction industry would no longer be able to use cement, mortar, steel or plastics, and instead would have to focus on retrofit and adaptation of existing buildings, using recycled materials. The same would naturally apply to any infrastructure project. But neither of these reports addresses the issue of imported goods, which would also have to be reduced virtually to zero, both because of embedded emissions and the ban on shipping and air travel. Take food. We currently produce 54 per cent of the food we eat. Quite how we would manage to feed ourselves with half of our food supply gone does not seem to have occurred to the authors of the Bill, who say we can manage instead on 'low carbon fruit, veg, nuts, pulses and grains'! Given that the UK livestock and dairy industry will shut down too, with arable farming devastated by the ban on fertilisers, people will literally starve to death. We will not be able to import cars. Nor will we be able to make them ourselves, as we will not have the high-quality steel needed once our blast furnaces are closed. We won't be able to import the lithium batteries, rubber, plastics and all sorts of other components required. Forget about driving less, owning a car at all will soon be a thing of the past. Then there's important stuff like electrical equipment, industrial machinery, computers, specialist metals and so on. We tend to import much of this because we don't have the specialised expertise and equipment necessary. In a sane world, countries import what they cannot make as well themselves, and specialise in what they are good at instead. Without access to the best equipment and technology, the UK economy would quickly go downhill. In addition, raw materials, though less visible, are also of vital importance – chemicals for example. The Bill demands that the production and import of fossil fuels be ended 'as rapidly as possible', which invites the question of how we will make all the things that are part of everyday life, but which need fossil fuels for their manufacture. Even if we had the expertise to make everything we buy from abroad, we would not able to build the factories needed without steel and cement, nor fill them with machinery. Then there are all of the diesel-powered diggers, bulldozers, dumper trucks and other construction equipment needed. And where will Ed Miliband get his precious solar panels, wind turbines and batteries when we cannot import them from China? As if that was not bad enough, the Bill insists that any development or activity that threatens nature must prioritise the protection of nature, calling for the UK Government to 'restore and expand natural ecosystems, and protect and enhance biodiversity'. All activities must prioritise avoidance of the loss of nature. This requirement is so wide-ranging that any loony judge could ban any development, be it new homes, roads or even wind farms. The clause would almost certainly be used to 'rewild' large areas of the country. Quite apart from the devastating effects on lives, there is the question of how all of this will be imposed on the British public. How long will it be before there are controls on how much food we are allowed to eat, how many miles we can drive and how many goods we can buy? There will certainly have to be draconian import controls as well. Will we all be allocated a carbon budget, which will be tracked by the Government via our credit cards and bank accounts? When we run out of carbon credits, will our accounts be frozen? It may sound like science fiction, but banks are already offering something similar. Private Members' Bills rarely pass into law. But even if this one does not, the ideas contained within it are likely to become public policy sooner or later. As I wrote two weeks ago: Net Zero is already doing great harm, but if this Bill becomes law, the country will be unrecognisable in ten years' time. There will be energy and food shortages, industry will be decimated, private transport and foreign holidays a thing of the past. What we take for granted today will be unaffordable for most. And there will be nothing we can do about it.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-20T01:22:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/climate-bill-threatens-us-all-with-starvation-not-that-the-msm-wants-to-know/
The migrant-sheltering councils that want to avoid punishment at the ballot box,"THE PENNY is only just beginning to drop about the implications of 12 county councils applying to delay their elections until next year, nominally in order to pursue local government reorganisation, but which will deprive millions of people of their right to vote in May. Although the District Councils' Network (DCN), which has 169 member councils, hascomplainedand the Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe has expressed his outrage andsaid there is no justification for what they are doing, this latest abuse of democracy has received scant media attention and few seem to understand either why it is happening or what the implications are. The official basis for these councils' applications is Angela Rayner'sEnglish Devolution White Paper, quietly published just before Christmas under the guise of a 'growth' agenda but which revealed plans to replace England's county and district councils with unitary councils with populations of more than half a million. These will be mega-councils imposed on communities without any regard for the views of those who live in them, which inevitably will erode local democracy. On the back of this, councils were invited to apply for the Government's new scheme in the knowledge that if selected, they would be able to delay this year's elections until next year. Several have spotted an opportunity. The chairman of the DCN, Sam Chapman-Allen, has expressed his fury: 'Democracy is being sidelined with the local electorate being deprived of any democratic opportunity to give their verdict on a major reorganisation that will have far-reaching repercussions for the destiny of thousands of English towns and villages.' Furthermore, as he says, it makes no sense to give councils the chance to sidestep the local electorate before reorganisation proposals have been published 'when no one can tell whether this is something that residents would want'. That surely is the point. In the meantime a process that could lead to a six-or seven-year election gap nominally in order to pursue local government reorganisation, will serve to prevent newly elected councillors from scrutinising the these councils' ineptitude, inefficiency and last but not least their most controversial policy decisions. This clearly has its attraction for the 12 councils which have applied. Now the Centre for Migration Control has thrown further light on this convenient excuse for denying voters' right to replace their councillors. They have lifted the lid on one of the most highly contentious policies these councils share – housing for illegal migrants. What they have found is that in those very same counties there has been a way above average 344 per cent increase in illegal migrants since voters last went to the polls in 2021 – illegal migrants they have been housing since the last elections. Here are the main findings of their report: The 12 county councils set to deprive British citizens of their vote have seen a 344 per cent increase in the number of illegal migrants that they are housing since the last round of local elections. Across the whole of England, by contrast, the increase in illegal migrants being housed in hotels and residential properties increased by 184 per cent since December 2021 – from 51,060 to 94,117 in September 2024 (the latest available data). Sir Sadiq Khan's London – which is riddled with so-called'sanctuary boroughs'that 'value and celebrate refugees' – has seen one of the 'smallest' increases, of 177 per cent. This contrasts with 363 per cent in the East of England and 303 per cent in the South East. Across the entire United Kingdom, the total increase of 177 per cent means that the county councils now planning to disenfranchise their voters are the ones that have inflicted on them an uplift in illegal migrants that is twice the average increase across England. The paper breaks that 'uplift' down for each of these county councils since they last faced voters: The Centre for Migration Control explains: 'Although clearly the majority of the blame for this catastrophic state of affairs rests with the Home Office and its neutered attempt to 'stop the boats' and 'smash the gangs', voters should not be deprived of the chance to pass a verdict on the imposition that this crisis poses on their local community. 'The argument presented in favour of cancelling these elections is that, because of plans to reorganise local government, the costs associated with hosting a ballot are unjustified. This argument, of course, is perpetuated by the same political class all too happy to spend over £6billion a year on our asylum system.' Worse, as I pointed out above, the council reorganisation that the Government plans is anti-democratic in origin, execution and outcome. The Centre for Migration Control encourages you to contact your local councillor if you live in any of the following areas to let them know your concerns. Devon County CouncilEast Sussex County CouncilEssex County CouncilGloucestershire County CouncilHampshire County CouncilKent County CouncilNorfolk County CouncilSuffolk County CouncilSurrey County CouncilWarwickshire County CouncilWest Sussex County CouncilWorcestershire County Council The Centre's critique is uncompromising: 'After each nescient decision taken by politicians – whether at a national or local level – one has to wonder whether they really care about the concerns of voters. This disconnect is perhaps most acute on the issue of illegal migration and the fact that tens of thousands of individuals who broke into Britain are now being housed, fed, and entertained at the taxpayers' expense . . . while the country's pensioners are stripped of their winter fuel allowance . . . and thousands of Brits – including 4,000 service veterans – are forced to spend the night on the street.'

"A visit to Starmerland, 2034","TCW's Time Travelling Future Correspondent has made a short visit to the South of England in 2034. This is what he found: 'WE ARE about to start our descent towards Starmer International Airport. Please fasten your seatbelts.'The crackling message from the captain of the ageing BA Airbus was just about discernible. The stern gaze from a steward ensured compliance. The UK's one remaining airport, which I remembered as 'Gatwick', now has only one terminal. After some minor protests the all-powerful Committee on Climate Change have grudgingly allowed it to remain open until 2040. It was my first return to my country of birth since my family's departure in 2027 to a country in Eastern Europe that has managed to defy the eugenicist eco-communism contaminating most formerly 'Christian' countries. On landing, with the rest of my group of tourists, I was quickly shepherded through the mostly empty customs hall to an electric bus. On board we were greeted by our tour guide, Yasmin. She explained that our visit would allow us to see tremendous strides the multi-cultural United Kingdom has made to cement its place as the world leader in decarbonisation and true democracy. She handed out masks that she insisted we wore at all times. 'Another new covid variant has been detected,' she explained. Two sinister-looking men scrutinised us when we embarked. As the bus moved off I noticed that there were cameras above each seat. Yasmin told us that the curtains on the bus had to remain closed for our trip to the hotel. She did not explain why. On arrival, I could tell from the fading carpets that the hotel had once been a Premier Inn. In my room there was a television but no kettle. The television played a loop lauding various 'achievements' of the Government, and interviews with Starmer and his cronies. Dinner was scheduled for seven. We were told to be prompt because the power allocation would end at 8.30. The emaciated server brought us two courses that consisted of vegetables and insects. At precisely 8.30pm the building was plunged into darkness. After a fitful sleep interrupted by the occasional wail of sirens, breakfast consisted of a suspicious-looking muesli, a single slice of toast and a cup of chicory coffee. We then took the bus to our first destination. As we approached the recently built Starmergrad 33 we were allowed to open the curtains to see the bus pass through the heavily guarded 'Safety Sector' into the first of several 'Zones'. Yasmin enthusiastically described how each zonal resident had access to all they needed within 15 minutes of their home. As we drove along the clean and largely traffic-free streets we were taken through various areas named after the residents. I remember zones for Somalis, Nigerians, Syrians, Iranians and one for the English. They live in barrack-type buildings called Rayner Homes. Occasionally, we would notice a cyclist, and some glum-looking pedestrians. I saw no one over the age of 60. There are no pets – they were banned in the UK four years ago. We were allowed to disembark at the large 'Pfizer Wellness Centre'. As Yasmin extolled the wonderful facilities, we were kept at a distance from the queues waiting for their injections, pills and potions. After lunch of a watery soup we were driven to marvel at an 'Energy Zone'. We were allowed to open our curtains to observe mile after mile of wind turbines and solar farms. From memory I deduced that we were driving along the South Downs. Yasmin enthused about 'the wonder of Net Zero' just before we stopped to endure a long wait while the bus was recharged. During the remainder of our short holiday we were taken to various establishments such as the Gates Nutrition Factory Number 13, the Nike Sports Stadium Number 1 (formerly Wembley Stadium), the NVIDIA Data Centre XX and were driven past the Soros People's Assembly (the Palace of Westminster) and the Museum of Monarchy (Buckingham Palace). On the final evening we were treated to a mushroom omelette before being taken to a theatre where we were invited to admire the benefits of multicultural Britain. We suffered performances by the Brent Drill Quartet, the Pakistani Men's Interpretive Dance Troupe, a Transgender Guatemalan Choir and an interminable jam by the Rwandan Drum and Ukulele Orchestra. As the bus took us back to the airport I was able to look out through a gap in the curtains before one of the sinister minders shouted at me. In the space of a few minutes I saw no animals, but derelict and abandoned houses, a work gang overseen by drones and what looked like a large prison. The trip was every bit as disturbing as I had imagined. The Party is in complete control. The proles are cowed. The illusion of safety, the all-pervading surveillance and pollution of the mind and body by the State has destroyed their innate desire for freedom. I won't be going back.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-20T01:17:00+00:00,Features,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-visit-to-starmerland-2034/
Covid censorship and the shame of supine doctors,"THE inquiry into the disaster inflicted on the United Kingdom following the emergence, or possibly release, of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has ground its glacial route to the most important issue, that of how those killed and severely injured by the so-called vaccine have been ignored and vilified by a large proportion of their fellow countrymen. This is what Module Four of the Covid Inquiry 'Looking at Vaccines and Therapeutics' which opened last weekshouldbe about. That Dr Rosalind Jones and several leading medics and science critics of the novel mRNA and RNA vaccine rollouts and especially of the regulatory authority, the MHRA,havenotbeen called to give evidence, throws that into doubt. Anna Morris KC, who is representing family groups injured by the jab and made her second appearance before the Hallett Inquiry last week, made the issue of censorship central to her opening statement. She recalled YouTube's censorship of her preliminary statement to Baroness Hallett in September 2023 (reported byTCWhereandhere). It had left many of those attending in tears, laying bare the truth that so many have tried to suppress – of suicide, disability and death, the youngest victim being 14 and oldest 76, all caused by serious adverse reactions to Covid vaccinations. 'The treatment of the vaccine-injured in this country historically been a source of shame,' she had said. YouTube were not going to share those revelations. In herpreliminary submission last Tuesday, the opening day of this module, speaking once more on behalf of just a tiny proportion of the millions who have suffered harm, Anna Morris told the judge that 'the inquiry must understand thestigma and censorshipfor the vaccine-injured and bereaved'. She reported a poll of all family members which found that 74 per cent had been censored when talking about vaccines on social media. She also reported how doctors were instructed tokeep their concerns from the public, including from their own patients. The only thing missing from this presentation was any call for immediate withdrawal of these products to prevent further harm being caused in the next decade or so, by which time no doubt this report will have quietly been put away in a bottom drawer. No right-thinking person listening to Morris could be in any doubt about the industrial-strength censorship that allowed this travesty to occur. While the government, pharmaceutical companies and the regulators could perhaps be expected to follow their chosen route and to deny and hide their mistakes, what was most telling, and profoundly disappointing, was the action she described taken by the medical profession on the front line. With any new treatment side-effects are certain. The patient leaflet included with the medication says so. When a new treatment is used on such a scale as were these creations, it is vital that side-effects be promptly reported to allow rapid understanding and decision-making. Lives depend on it. In the event some 2,700 'fatal outcomes' of the covid vaccines have been reported. We have the Yellow Card scheme to allow these reports. But they have been ignored by the Public Health authorities, the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Executive of the NHS downwards and by medical professionals too. It needs to be stated clearly that the reporting of vaccine side-effects is not an optional task. When they give a treatment, whether a drug, a vaccine or any other intervention, they have a moral duty to monitor it and report any problems. It horrifies me to think that many of our GPs have never heard of, or used, the Yellow Card scheme. Are we to believe that they have never seen an adverse effect? Or is it simply that they choose not to? The problem has been shown to be even deeper. Since the start of the rollout, doctors' professional bodies and other medical organisations have steadfastly denied any link between injections and problems. Patients who have begged for help have been ignored or accused of having mental disorders. Doctors speaking out have been censored and struck off, ensuring that most remain quiet. The tyranny continues with the GMC calling the shots. The inquiry addressed this as a problem or result of not wishing to contribute to vaccine 'hesitancy'. But what they are facing now is no longer hesitancy, rather the start of patients' outright refusal to co-operate due entirely to doctors' refusal to listen to real concerns. This is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg as trust in vaccines has been all but destroyed. The current crop of mRNA offerings deserve nothing else than public scepticism. Even many of the 'traditional' vaccines, it is transpiring, came with far more risks than was ever acknowledged, an issue that needs separate study. But of immediate concern in medicine today are the plummeting levels of trust in doctors as a profession. They are victims of their own naivety. Many now see what was done and regret it, but remain quiet. Many still don't see or don't care. Or still post lies about the few who try to make the truth known. The covid event is a medical disaster that was, by and large, self-inflicted. Doctors hid behind telephones and denied treatment to injured patients. They refused to believe the evidence of their own eyes. They attacked their colleagues and still do. They put the perceived status of the profession above their duty of care. The dearth of doctors signing theHope Accord, which calls for the immediate suspension of all covid mRNA vaccine products, tells its own story. GP practices may still be earning their pieces of silver by injecting the now proven deadly genetic treatments. In truth it has cost them dearly. They have lost the trust and respect of the nation.

Labour's 'home-educated child register' is an interference too far,"I AM THE WORLD'S biggest advocate of home education and, in particular, Christian home education. My husband and I decided to home educate our children when our oldest child was a few months old. Fourteen years and six children later, I can honestly say that, as a family, we are thriving: we learn, we play, we laugh, we cry. We are forming relationships that we hope will last a lifetime. We also live on one income, pay twice for education (once for our children to go to government schools which we don't use, and again for the books and curricula which we do use), and fail to meet the criteria for Universal Credit because I do not leave my children for paid employment sixteen hours a week. I never dwell on these factors, since you could not pay me enough money to surrender to the State the quality and quantity of time that I have with my children. Now Labour'sChildren's Wellbeing and Schools Billwas voted through its second reading on January 8 and, with one swoop, the State is intending an overreach into the lives of families and loving parents. This bill could lose us the right to have the ultimate say over one of the most important decisions we will ever make with regard to our children: namely, how they are educated. Home-educated children are to be registered, and apart from details about the child and any other individuals or organisations that are part of the child's education, the register can chillingly require any 'other information the local authority considers appropriate'. Essentially, the local authority can ask for any detail it likes about our child or our family life, without parameters, and we are expected to provide it. If we do not comply, or provide the correct information (perhaps, we take more than fifteen days to inform them that our child has started an online biology class) then we may be fined. If the local authority thinks that our child is not receiving 'a suitable education', again based on no criteria whatsoever, they may request to visit our home. If we refuse the visit, this will work as a black mark against us. A 'school attendance order' may be issued, and if we do not comply, we may be imprisoned. I know many people think that a register for home-educated children is simple common sense, but I want you to think about this for a moment: what would you do if your child were being mercilessly bullied at school? What would you do if you found out your child was required to use the pronouns 'she/her' in relation to a classmate who was definitely a boy when he joined the school? What would you do if you felt that your child was not learning anything due to disruptive classrooms, or perhaps had a learning difficulty and lacked essential support? Is there a point where your utter devotion to your child would rise to the fore and you felt compelled to take matters into your own hands? You see, this is really the difference between home educators and the rest of the country. Pretty much everybody complains about their child's school; we just do something about it. Do you think that a decision made for the well-being of your child should lead to you being automatically treated with suspicion wherever you went? What if your local authority ultimately overruled you and insisted your child must attend school anyway? Now, I want to be very clear: I have absolutely nothing to hide. If you ask me about how we home educate, you will not be able to stop me. I could tell you about countless precious moments over the years when the sheer joy of the pursuit of knowledge has taken over. At various times, we have dropped everything to learn hieroglyphics, memorise the periodic table and recite all the presidents of the United States (well why not?). We have scoured the internet for videos about volcanoes because volcanoes are amazing. We have grown crystals, learned braille and memorised poems. We learn history (chronologically, imagine that!), Latin and logic, whilst my older children are embarking on a 'Great Books' programme. I could also tell you about my twelve-year-old daughter's thriving earring business and the little yellow book where she keeps a record of her expenditure and income. We are a tightly-knit family. We play Uno, Trivial Pursuit and chess. We also camp, build dens, design birthday cakes and have a house full of bookworms. However, at the point when the local authority asks to enter my home in order to ascertain whether I am providing my children with what they deem 'a suitable education', then every fibre of my being wants to push back. You see, it is not the responsibility of the Government to assess the education that we give to our children and to determine whether it is found wanting. It is the prerogative of the parent to assess the education offered by our local government and to decide whether or not it is up to scratch. If we do not think our local schools are good enough for our children, we should have every right to look to provide something better. Labour insists this bill is about children's well-being, but I can tell you that this bill does not care about well-being on three counts. Firstly, the bill insists that every primary school offers breakfast to qualifying pupils, whereas I can tell you that providing our children with breakfast is part and parcel of raising offspring. Breakfast presents those first few moments to express love, offer a hug and fill hungry tummies with something nourishing. Oats and milk do not cost that much and breakfast should not be outsourced to the State. Secondly, Labour says a home education register will prevent child abuse such as in the tragic case of Sara Sharif. That precious little girl should have been removed from her father forever from the moment she was born. Social services did nothing about the countless complaints to which they were privy. A register would have made no difference to her life and would perhaps have only muddied the waters since the local authority would have had thousands of extra families to sift through before dealing with the abuse case it already knew about. Thirdly, and perhaps most tellingly, many children are simply not thriving in government schools.

This sham ceasefire is a pact with the Devil,"THE world waited to see who would be the first three hostages Hamas released to Israel. Would they be alive, or already dead? Wouldthey include the baby Kfir Bibas, whose second birthday was on Saturday, the day before the start of phase one of the ceasefire agreement and hostage/prisoner exchange? Hamas are playing despicable and cruel mind games with the population of Israel in general, and the families of the hostages in particular – in how they release those poor abused souls who are still living, and the cold bodies of those they have murdered. And as the next six weeks of prolonged, drawn-out releases continue, the greater that psychological torture will be for the families still awaiting the release of their loved ones. It is expected that the living will be released first. My guess is that the Bibas family will be among the last, if not the last, hostages to be handed over. The first hostages released were Emily Damari, Doron Steinbrecher and Romi Gonen, three young women who have spent a year and three months suffering in the dank, dark, suffocating terror tunnels beneath Gaza. Abused and assaulted, not knowing what their fate would be, clinging to life. Emily is British, yet the British government were barely interested in her plight as they were too concerned about appeasing the Muslim vote in the UK rather than being seen to support a Jew above the cause of the 'Palestinian resistance'. Hamas made a spectacle of the release. Heavily armed terrorists in full Hamas uniform kept the handover under control for the cameras while Palestinian civilians crowded in, shouting abuse and spitting at the young hostages. After the six long weeks of phase one have elapsed, will there still be a ceasefire and further hostage releases possible, or will Hamas have violated the agreement forced on both Israel and Hamas by Donald Trump, eager to make a big impact on day one of his second presidency? Can a second phase be negotiated at all? There is much more work to be done before all hostages are released, and a permanent ceasefire attained. The next phase of negotiations will take place during this phase one hostage release, where in exchange for 33 hostages of unknown status (dead or alive), Israel is to release nearly 2,000 terrorists and detainees, including more than 700 prisoners who between them are responsible for the murders of around 2,500 Israeli men, women and children. In the meantime, rest assured that Hamas will keep pushing the boundaries of the current phase one agreement, flexing their propaganda muscles to keep their worldwide fan base enthused by their 'resistance'. Just 12 hours before the ceasefire was supposed to begin, Hamas broke the terms of the agreement by not naming the first three hostages to be released. They did eventually give the names, well after the cut-off time, and after Benjamin Netanyahu halted the start of the agreement in response. There are celebrations in Gaza and elsewhere, proclaiming this agreement as a victory for Hamas, and as a signal that murder and hostage-taking works and will be repeated. This deal is a pact with the Devil; any deal with Islamic terrorists is such. It encourages further terror, putting innocent people at risk worldwide – because this Islamic 'struggle' is for world domination, for a global Caliphate and the imposition of Islam and Sharia on every living soul. This agreement may be a tick in the Israel/Gaza box for Trump, and terror-appeasing political pygmies such as Starmer and Lammy, but it is definitely a problem for the rest of the world. When the post-ceasefire Islamist problems start again, the world will tell Israel to stop whingeing – you got your hostages back – and continue to pressure Israel to make further concessions to the blood-soaked monster that is fundamental Islam and its murder machine. Unless Trump green-lights and supports a total destruction of Hamas, when it becomes clear they are rebuilding their terror infrastructure, or simply to destroy any meaningful presence they have in Gaza, this ceasefire will be a huge boost to the Islamists' cause and encourage them to increase their efforts everywhere. And that includes the UK, where Islamic sectarianism has grown in power and influence, and has put four fundamental Islamic MPs into the heart of our democracy. Don't expect things to get any better while the West kowtows to Islam and its demands, and continues to welcome hundreds of thousands of migrants from Islamic countries, many bringing with them a culture that makes it acceptable, and attractive, to use white children as sexual slaves, and enforce Sharia law in their communities which refuse to integrate with or accept British law, culture and social standards.

Do the Jehovah’s Witnesses have something to teach us?,"AFTERI wrote here on TCWabout a court case where a Jehovah's Witness successfully sued a Spanish hospital for giving her a blood transfusion against her beliefs, I had an email from Mark Gratrix of the Witnesses' Public Information Department inviting me to lunch at their UK headquarters in Chelmsford, Essex. Many of us have conceptions, or maybe misconceptions, about the Witnesses, namely that they are against blood transfusions, that they go knocking on people's doors and believe that Armageddon, or the dreadful day of Judgment, is nigh. How much is true? I accepted the invitation and in a spirit of inquiry travelled on the Elizabeth Line to Shenfield, where I was met by Mark and his wife Melissa in a gleaming grey Volvo. But nothing prepared me for their impressive headquarters, a newly-built, eco-friendly 82-acre site where about 350 Witnesses live and work. I was ushered into their huge dining hall and partook of a delicious lunch of salmon, brown rice and salad. 'Do you have a lovely lunch like this every day?' I asked enviously. Yes, they said. A noticeable thing was that all the men were dressed in suits, ties and white shirts and wore polished shoes rather than clapped-out trainers. At a time when so many men are scruffier than ever, this formal attire was pleasant to behold. The women were neatly turned out as well, and everything was super-clean and efficient yet not remotely ostentatious. I was told that the place was built and is maintained entirely by volunteers. An obvious initial question I had was: 'Where does the money come from to run this estate?' The answer: voluntary donations. 'We never ask for money,' Mark said, 'but in all Kingdom Halls where we hold our services there is a discreet box where anonymous donations can be made. We Witnesses who live and work here are not paid as such, but all our needs are met. We trust to God, and somehow the books are balanced. We encourage visitors and offer guided tours, with no charges made. Our literature comes free of charge as well.' There was a happy atmosphere, and all the Witnesses I met were friendly and welcoming. Most are married, but there are no children living on the site. If any of the staff want to start a family, they have to leave the campus. It's not that they are against children, and they are certainly anti-abortion, but the HQ is strictly an adults-only space. As to their beliefs, they adhere strictly to every word of the Bible, believing that both the Old and New Testaments are the revealed word of God, and at the heart of every Witness's understanding is the injunction not to ingest blood or blood products. This holds even if somebody's life might depend on a blood transfusion. This procedure not been invented in Biblical times, but the rule,laid down in Acts Chapter 15, verses 28 and 29, stands. 'We understand that this comes from God,' said Gary McGuinness, director of Hospital Information Services, 'and we all carry a ""No Blood"" card which we hope will be respected by doctors and nurses if a Witness is admitted to hospital. Increasingly, medical procedures can be carried out bloodlessly and many Witnesses have had organ transplants, for instance.' Gary emphasised that this comes from a religious and not a medical perspective but is a deeply held core belief. 'If somebody is unable to give consent, such as a small child, the courts will step in and may overrule the parents. The only issue here is if the child's life is at stake,' he said. 'The command also applies to autologous transfusions, where the patient's own blood is stored for future use.' When it comes to other procedures, such as vaccination, consent must always be informed and freely given. Witnesses would never agree to a medical intervention made under duress. They follow a traditional Christian way of life where close Bible study is of prime importance. In marriage, absolute fidelity is expected and there is no such thing as 'living in sin'. Contraception is allowed. The only grounds for divorce are infidelity and domestic violence but both, I am assured, are very rare for Witnesses. They do not baptise babies or children, taking the view that the individual must be adult enough to make a personal choice. They don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, believing that these festivities have pagan origins. 'There is nothing wrong with giving an unbirthday gift,' said Mark Gratrix, 'but we don't observe birthdays as such. This does mean, though, that some of us forget how old we are,' he laughed. 'Some Witnesses celebrate their wedding anniversary, but we would regard it wrong to have a lavish wedding. Ours is a modest, balanced way of life with everything in moderation. We don't smoke or take recreational drugs, but we do enjoy a glass of wine, regarding wine as a gift from God. Nor would we engage in dangerous sports or anything that would put life in danger. This is all based on scriptural values and shows our appreciation for the gift of life.' There is, however, a large sports hall at their Chelmsford complex, as keeping fit and healthy is integral to their way of life. Mark said that their organisation is not hierarchical and that there is absolute equality between men and women, and all races. Interracial marriages are common among Witnesses. Perhaps their most controversial belief is that we are living in end times, that the world has become extremely wicked and that before long, God will intervene so that we may start again with all sin wiped out. This is known as the Battle of Armageddon and it is prophesied in the Book of Revelation. 'What was said in the Bible is coming true,' Gary McGuinness said. 'There will be a conclusion of the old system and God-given transformation will happen, where Jesus will reign on earth for a thousand years.' Jehovah's Witnesses cannot put an exact date on when this will take place, but they believe that the time is very near. And I think that those of us who are awake, or who have been forcibly jolted awake by the events of the past five years, would agree that the present times are more wicked and venal than any other era in history, and are ruled by overweening greed and lust for power and control rather than Christian virtues. Whether or not the world ends as prophesied, surely it is time to bring back some of the simpler, purer, Christian values which the Witnesses espouse and which have largely been lost sight of in our secular, Godless age. There are around 10million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide and it is perhaps significant that their numbers are growing, especially among the young. And yes, they do still go knocking on doors!

The climate scaremongers: Net Zero? You ain’t seen nothing yet,"A PRIVATE Members' Bill is currently wending its way through Parliament. Called the Climate and Nature Bill (CAN), it threatens to wreck the UK economy, damage lives and undermine democracy. And that's just for starters! It makes Theresa May's Net Zero legislation look like a walk in the park. Private Members' Bills rarely turn into law, but worryingly this one already has the public support of 192 MPs – you can check the listhere. And as we know, Theresa May's Net Zero legislation passed with barely a murmur, despite having no democratic mandate. Originally the brainchild of the then Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, the Bill is due for its Second Reading on January 24. It is based on the premise that the current legislation mandating Net Zero by 2050 is inadequate. It calls for UK emissions to be rapidly cut 'in line with the 1.5C target'. In effect, this means cutting emissions by about 90 per cent in the next ten years. If passed, it would oblige the Energy Secretary to create a new climate change strategy and present it to Parliament within a year. The Government would be required by law to 'limit the UK's total CO2emissions to no more than its proportionate share of the IPCC's remaining global carbon budget, for a 67 per cent chance of limiting heating to 1.5 deg C'. Worse still, it lays down that imported emissions are accounted for as well, not just territorial ones, ie those that occur within our geographical borders, as at present. When all emissions are counted, including shipping and aviation, UK emissions have fallen by only about 23 per cent since 1990, the Bill's proponents say. This is much less than the 48 per cent claimed for territorial under the current system. Given that territorial emissions are little more than half total emissions, such a target physically could not be achieved without radical changes to the UK economy, energy system and people's lives. We would have to do without most of what we currently import, for example. To meet the Bill's demands, total emissions, including imports, would need to be cut by two thirds by 2030, and virtually eliminated in ten years' time. It does not seem to have occurred to the Bill's supporters that if we eliminated UK emissions tomorrow it would not have the slightest effect, given that the rest of the world is still increasing emissions year-on-year. Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, for instance, world emissions of CO2have increased by 7 per cent, while ours have fallen. The Bill would make it law that both the production and import of fossil fuels must end 'as rapidly as possible'. Imports of food would have to be virtually eliminated as well since food emissions account for a third of our total, and we import half our food. Given that the UK would also have to shut down most of its meat farming, it is not clear exactly where we would get our food from. Apparently, the Bill's proponents believe we can live on 'low carbon fruit, veg, nuts, pulses and grains' instead! One of the most insidious parts of the Bill lays down a legally enforceable role for a 'Climate and Nature Assembly', a body similar to the Climate Assembly set up in 2019. This body is supposed to reflect the views of the public. In reality, the 2019 version took a handful of ordinary citizens, brainwashed them with the help of 'experts' and then presented their conclusions as 'public opinion'. We already have a system which gives the public the chance to offer their views – it is called elections. But this new Bill would go further. The Assemblies would not just be advisory. The Bill states: 'The Secretary of State must include in the strategy all recommendations of the Assembly that have the support of 66 per cent of its members, where those recommendations are also jointly proposed by . . . the Climate Change Committee.' Such a proposal would severely undermine democracy by taking away the rights of voters to make these choices and tie the hands of future Parliaments. As the Bill also states: 'If the Government fails to deliver a strategy that meets the Bill's objectives and fundamental principles, the Government can be challenged in the High Court through judicial review'. Therein lies the real threat. If this Bill becomes law, it will be activist judges who will be making decisions, not elected politicians. If all of this was not bad enough, the Bill not only wants to lay down laws about climate change, it also proposes exactly the same for 'Nature'. In its own words, it prioritises 'nature' in decision-making and calls to restore and expand natural eco-systems. Any development or activity that threatens nature must prioritise the protection of nature. And we must also address the UK's entire ecological footprint at home and overseasby accounting for the 'destruction of nature'. The Bill's supporters say that the UK's 'environmental footprint' must be reduced by three-quarters by 2030. Reducing something tangible like emissions is one thing. But how on Earth do you measure an environmental footprint (whatever that is)? It opens the door for any crackpot green outfit to sue the Government, and any left-wing judge to make whatever crazy decisions he wants. Nobody voted for this lunacy, yet 192 MPs plan to vote for the Bill, and no doubt many more will join them. Even if this Bill fails, the policies it contains will surely find their way into public policy sooner or later. Net Zero is already doing great harm, but if this Bill becomes law, the country will be unrecognisable in ten years' time. There will be energy and food shortages, industry will be decimated, private transport and foreign holidays a thing of the past. What we take for granted today will be unaffordable for most. And there will be nothing we can do about it.

Starmer’s 'star lawyer' and the great rape gang cover-up,"WE HAVE seen quite a political spat in the early days of the New Year: Sir Keir Starmer coming under fire from Elon Musk over his former role as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, and whether or not he was responsible for the lack of prosecutions of the rape gangs (a term which has finally gained traction over the euphemism 'grooming gangs'). Starmer has had a staunch defender in this: his former colleague Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West area from 2011-2015. Here, for example, Afzal responds to Musk directly: 'Under Starmer's leadership we finally tackled these abuses, which had previously been handled poorly He put me in charge, we brought 100s of offenders to justice & gave voice to 1000s of victims.' Rewriting history doesn't make it trueUnder Starmer's leadership we finally tackled these abuses, which had previously been handled poorlyHe put me in charge,we brought 100s of offenders to justice & gave voice to 1000s of victimsA simple google/twitter search would show this Afzal is lauded across the mainstream spectrum from theGuardianto theTelegraph: 'Nazir Afzal is a hard-bitten former prosecutor who took on the Rochdale child grooming gangs and the 2011 rioters . . .' But who is Afzal? And was his role really as presented? Afzal was born in Birmingham in 1962 to immigrants from the North-West Frontier province of Pakistan. He read law at Birmingham University, and spent his career from 1991 in the CPS, initially in London. Hebecamethe 'youngest person and first Muslim to hold the role of assistant chief crown prosecutor' and, to his credit, throughout his career, he seems to have had a focus on prosecuting issues which have particular traction in the Muslim population, including forced marriages and 'honour' killings. Indeed, as we shall see, he makes a strong show of violence against women being a particular area of his focus. He came to the limelight on being appointed Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West. This was shortly before the 2011 riots which, as with the riots of 2024, saw the justice system kick in swiftly when it chooses. But his fame chiefly rests on being the prosecutor overseeing the successful charges against one Rochdale gang. AHome Office Select Committee in 2012(chaired at the time, remarkably, by serial ethics-pusher Keith Vaz) questioned both Starmer, then head of the CPS, and Afzal regarding the changes to CPS procedure which led to the successful prosecution of nine members of the Rochdale rape gang. Here is Starmer churning out some the clunky managerialese that we have come to know, if not love: 'One of the things we did in light of the Rochdale ultimately successful prosecution was to walk through the decision-making from start to finish, from when the case first came to us, and then after that to gather together other cases we have throughout the organisation.' (I hope that's enlightening.) Later, Afzal states: 'What the director [Starmer] has tasked me with is to ensure that whatever good practice we have developed around Rochdale and the child sexual exploitation in the North West is rolled out and used everywhere. But let's be clear about this. This happens everywhere. It may well come in different forms.The vast majority of it takes place with white males being involved,but the point is recognising that there was a particular issue, it was one that we had to address, and we are now being seen to address it.' Vaz asks Afzal about whether race plays a role: 'From my perspective, it is an issue but not the issue. The issue here is predators preying on the most vulnerable in our society. They just happen to be from a particular ethnicity.' (Emphasis mine.) Afzal's role is clear: the 'star' NW Chief Prosecutor runs cover for the 'it's not just Muslims' sleight-of-hand (assisted, note, by Vaz himself who obscures the matter by solely referring to 'race' and not religion). In aGuardianinterview from 2014, he goes even further. 'Where there is involvement of Asian men or men of Pakistani origin, [Afzal] points to a practical, rather than cultural explanation – the fact that in the areas where grooming scandals have been uncovered, those controlling the night-time economy, people working through the night in takeaways and driving minicabs, are predominantly Asian men. He argues that evidence suggests that victims were targeted not because they were white but because they were vulnerable and their vulnerability caused them to seek out ""warmth, love, transport, mind-numbing substances, drugs, alcohol and food"". ""Who offers those things? In certain parts of the country, the place they go is the night-time economy,"" he says. ""Where you have Pakistani men, Asian men, disproportionately employed in the night-time economy, they are going to be more involved in this kind of activity than perhaps white men are. We keep hearing people talk about a problem in the North and the Midlands, and that's where you have lots of minicab drivers, lots of people employed in takeaways, from that kind of background. If you have a preponderance of Asians working in those fields, some of that number, a very small number of those people, will take advantage of the girls who have moved into their sphere of influence. It's tragic"".' Afzal is virtually presenting the gang rapists as victims themselves, exposed as they are to the temptations of working in the night-time economy. It's sickening stuff. This is a short step away from the fundamentalist Muslim website5Pillars: 'Its (sic) the open exposure to vices and western society's marketing of women as objects of sexual pleasure that influences these minority of Muslim taxi drivers who cannot control their whims and desires.' It is clear that, during Afzal's four years heading the CPS in the North West, some procedural changes were instituted which did enable – finally – some successful prosecutions to be brought. It may be that he had the central role in this which he is always happy to portray; we cannot know. But we can see that his public role was to cover for the religious and ethnic roles of the rape gangs, and in a way that surely must be painful to the victims. Afzal is not alone in this of course – this has been (in effect) UK state policy for over a decade. The Jay report of 2022 (behind which the Government has sought to hide, backed by Afzalhere) is a masterpiece of hiding the rape gangs under the cover of sexual abuse more generally. Both the Catholic Church and the Church of England are given prominence; Rochdale appears in the executive summary solely in connection with Cyril Smith; Rotherham not at all. Nazir Afzal resigned his CPS role in March 2015. He had been accused of sending a text message to a defendant (it is not apparent who, or what the case related to). Althoughexoneratedin an internal inquiry, he resigned anyway. The official line given, that his departure was part of a cost-reduction programme, makes little sense unless he was being paid a substantially higher salary than whoever replaced him. And inthisGuardianinterview he puts it down to being 'bored'. It appears a strange end for a 'star prosecutor' in the job for less than four years. Afzal subsequently became Chief Executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) in 2016, but lasted under a year in the role, with anotherresignationfor unusual reasons. After the Manchester Ariana Grande terror attacks, Afzal felt it more important to appear on television than continue the job. The APCC stated: 'Nazir told the board that he intended to go onQuestion Timeto discuss the recent events in Manchester. The Board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah. He resigned from his post in order to make this appearance.' Since then, Afzal has been the beneficiary of an enviable portfolio of appointments to the great and good. He was amemberof the Complaints Committee of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) for six years. He ischairof both the Catholic Safeguarding Standards Agency, and (sinceSeptember) the Church of England'sNational Safeguarding Panel.He is onOxfam's Safeguarding & Ethics Committee, and the National Police Chiefs Ethics Committee. He is the Welsh Government's national adviser on violence against women. He is Chancellor of the University of Manchester and chairman of the Lowry theatre and gallery in Salford (his credentials in the artsappearto be 'Minority communities love drama'.) He has published two books: an autobiography and a book on 'structural racism'. He misses no chance to introduce his personal history in his interviews, particularly the racism of his childhood. Afzal has been adept at the cross-party political playbook of what you may call 'soft concealment' in the rape gangs, a playbookrepeatedin the aftermath of the Southport murders: 'The driver here was male violence,' he told theNew Statesman.'We're missing the misogyny here. We won't know until the trial what were the motivators, if there were any, in relation to the alleged killer of these three girls. But a month before that, BBC presenter John Hunt lost his wife and two daughters [to an attack by] a white man. There were no demonstrations there, apparently . . .' Afzal's latest sensitive Islamic political question is the cousin-marriage debate.Here, in a video for the notionally right-leaning Pharos Foundation, he sets out his 'thoughtful, nuanced approach' to the issue. He is not in favour of legislating. His approach is 'informed by science' (where have we heard that before?): he cites the canard that 'only' 7 per cent of cousin marriage births result in genetic conditions, similar to births to older mothers; he even calls them 'conspiracy theories'. He cites Tommy Robinson making it 'difficult to have a discussion'. He appeals to personal autonomy. The legal and moral traditions of the UK are of course, nowhere mentioned. It is a helpful discussion, though, because it clarifies his position on 'community relations' generally: 'We need to be able to deal with these issues ourselves so that we don't give ammunition to those who would wish to divide us.' He talks about the 'direction of travel', and that 'not prohibition, but empowerment' being the solution. In other words: back off; don't legislate, let the 'communities' deal with it themselves. I come back to what he said witnessing the rape gangs still in operation earlier: 'I want the members of the community, as they are now doing, providing information, providing intelligence'. Afzal, the placed 'hero' of the Rochdale grooming gang persecution, is actually arguing for something very different: the policing of 'communities' (primarily) within themselves. He has been elevated to the role of being a spokesman for child protection and community relations. He has got there through running government-approved cover for the rape gangs, and other things. I have no opinion as to whether Afzal did himself aid any change in procedure that brought a handful of mass rapists to justice. If he did, he deserves credit. But I have seen nothing in his career or statements that mark him out as anything other than a low-level bureaucrat, any more than Starmer himself. He has been a public face to 'do a job', and has received quite some prominence since. His principal role has been to cover for the regime, and he has done this faithfully.

Will the rape-gang scandal be Starmer’s nemesis?,"ANYONE calling for a public inquiry into the Pakistani 'grooming' gangs and 25 years of industrialised drugging, rape and torture of young white girls across some 50 towns in the UK is,according to our Prime Minister, 'jumping on a far-right bandwagon'. In the words offormer Labour MP Rosie Duffield, by that Sir Keir Starmer demonstrated 'lack of basic political instinct' in response to an issue which now, thanks largely to Elon Musk, has finally and viscerally grabbed the public's attention. Replying to Kemi Badenoch's call last Wednesday for a public inquiry into the scandal, Sir Keir said it wasn't necessary. I doubt he had to work too hard to make sure his MPs agreed. It was voted down by 364 to 111, a majority of 253. His refusal to grasp the nettle, however, means it is already baked into the next general election campaign. With Reform UKcommitting to a public inquiry too, whether Sir Keir likes it or not it's here to stay. It is easy to see why Starmer dislikes the idea so much. Not only would his own former role as DPP come under scrutiny but a national public inquiry could lead to hundreds if not thousands of prosecutions: of perpetrators who are still walking free, of officials who ignored, minimised or deflected the problem, or were involvedin what is being referred to as a 'cover-up'– Labour Party officials, social workers, doctors and police working in Labour-run towns where the worst excesses have been committed. There's also the question of the sentencing to date. The scale and depravity of the crimes perpetrated by these gangs has no equal in our country's recent history, crimes which fall at the mostsevere end of the sentencing scaleand in terms of harm and culpability, given the 'aggravating' factors reported in many of the cases which have come to court (such as targeting of vulnerable victims, blackmailing and threats to secure the victim's silence).Five members of the Oxford gang were jailed for life, but none of the 24 rapists, traffickers and torturerssentenced at Leeds Crown Court last April was. Nor did any of theseven men sentenced last September at Sheffield Crown Court. Has the punishment so far fitted the crime? Responsibility goes right to the top. Former Greater Manchester detective and whistleblower Maggie Oliver believes the current PM himself must bear some responsibility for the widespread failure to bring those responsible properly to justice. She told GB news that as Director of Public Prosecutions Starmer 'made the decision, alongside the prosecutors, that the man who got a 13-year-old pregnant, didn't face charges of rape'. He is, she said, as'guilty as anyone' over failures to address grooming gangs. Given the shocking nature of these crimes, the long years over which girls were trafficked, tortured, drugged and raped, the implications are good for none of the three main political parties. It is a moral stain on their collective conscience. For the Labour Party, in control in so many of the towns involved, it is disastrous. During the Greater Manchester Mayoral BBC TV debate in April 2024, a question from a concerned father of two girls in Rochdale about the 'grooming gangs' was put to the panel of candidates which I was on as the Reform UK candidate. I made my position clear:I would call for a public inquiry. As I was making my statement, the camera cut to show the expression on the incumbent (and since re-elected) Labour Mayor, Andy Burnham. He looked distinctly uncomfortable. It was hardly surprising given the history of the report he commissioned for the Manchester area and local police follow-up failure.Laura Perrins reported inTCWat the time that the word 'disgrace' did not do it justice. Appallingly, Greater Manchester Police dropped an operation which had identified up to 97 potential suspects and at least 57 potential victims. The girls werehooked on drugs, groomed, raped and emotionally broken– one 15-year-old died. Despite police and social workers knowing what was happening the men weren't stopped. Abusers were freely allowed to pick up and have sex with children from care homes, 'in plain sight' of officials. As recently as August 2018, the Chief Constable refused to reopen the inquiry – while Andy Burnham was Mayor. Burnham would have been fully aware ofthe very different legal status a full public inquiry has compared to a 'report' that has no teeth and can be ignored if that is politically expedient. As turned out to be the case. Yet this is the same man who's called for public inquiries into almost everything else you could think of: nuclear test veterans, Aberfan, Bloody Sunday, contaminated blood, Post Office, Windrush, Grenfell, but never a mention of the child sexual exploitation gangs on his patch. Now, under the glare of public attention, he is calling for a 'limited public inquiry' (whatever that may mean) whilespeciously expressing his frustration that Westminster politicians had 'taken no interest' in the issue when those reports were published. Yet his problem was a local one: the Greater Manchester Police refusing to do their job. Instead of giving full-throated support to a vigorous no-stone-left-unturned public inquiry, Labour's strategy has been to turn attention back on to the Conservatives who could have called such an inquiry at any time in their 14 years in power. They are culpable too. Theresa May's troubled independent inquiry into historic child abuse, which ended up seven years later as the Alexis Jay Report, didn't even have the Pakistani rape gangs in its remit till towards the end, and then only tangentially. Labour's complicity in the cover-up potentially runs deeper. Town after town in a public inquiry will reveal officials and elected representatives on the council refusing recognise evil when it was staring them in the face, or denying that this was a Muslim problem. No wonder they want to stave off exposures of their complicity, making it far worse for the victims who suffered more and longer because of their denial. No wonder they don't want the rot from the top to the bottom of the party exposed. It is hard to see how they could survive as a political party under this spotlight.Yet with 76 per cent of the population believing there should be a public inquiry, unless Sir Keir Starmer starts to 'read the room' and run this risk no matter the consequences, this surely will be the beginning of the end of his leadership if not the end of the Labour Party. This issue will not go away. The public's mood can be summarised in the words of Dr Martin Luther King's most famous speech: 'No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.'",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-13T01:18:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/will-the-rape-gang-scandal-be-starmers-nemesis/
"Cancer is soaring, and still they deny the vaccine connection","THAT the covid vaccines have been a disaster is now clear in the minds of most informed people. As reported frequently in these pages, they patentlydo not workand they have a wide range of dangerous side-effects, including death. One of the side-effects of the covid vaccines is that they appear to cause cancer and cause existing cancers to accelerate, so-called 'turbo' cancers. It took a leading consultant oncologist, ProfessorAngus Dalgleishof St George's Hospital, London, to spot this and toshare his observations with colleaguesand with the general public. He hasbeen largely ignored. But it seems thatDr Dalgleish's observationsare vindicated. At last, a mainstream newspaper,theDaily Mail, has found fit to report the link in an article about the claims for compensation by families and victims adversely affected by the covid vaccines, including those who have developed cancer. However, as with the rest of the 'left stream' media, this is in complete contrast to some notorious outlets such asGlobal Health Now(GHN) andMedscape. The former does not even cover the well-reported and recent increase in cancer diagnoses while the latter, which does, fails to acknowledge that this might be linked to the covid vaccines. That cancer is rising is beyond dispute. NHS England,under the banner'NHS diagnoses thousands more cancers as cases rise by 5 per cent' states: 'The latest cancer registration statistics show more cancers were diagnosed in 2022, with 346,217 new diagnoses – on average 948 a day – compared with 329,664 in 2021 (an increase of 5 per cent).' This is accounted for by a 7 per cent increase in men and a 2 per cent increase in women. The increase is mostly in those cancers most common in both sexes: prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women. The only explanation NHS England can offer is that the rates partly 'reflect the work of the NHS in 2022 to encourage people to come forward for checks to catch up on the effects of the Covid pandemic' which led to 'a reduction in the numbers coming forward and starting treatment'. Incredible. The NHS, which we were imprisoned for the best part of two years to save, come up smelling of roses again; it is their 'work' that is contributing towards the current wave of cancer diagnoses. And it was the fault of the covid 'pandemic'. Nothing to do with the fact that they shut up shop for months on end and physically prevented people coming forward for diagnosis and treatment. NHS England, nevertheless, do say that their action (following months of inaction) only partly explains the present situation. No other explanation is offered. Reporting the same phenomenonunder the banner'Early Cancer Diagnoses Hit Record High in England'Medscapeoffer no explanation either. They couch their report in terms of 'a major drive over the last two years to encourage millions of people to come forward for potentially life-saving checks' including people 'at a higher risk because of hereditary or lifestyle factors'. Again, it is the heroic actions of the NHS which are responsible for the phenomenon, the so-called 'major drive on early detection'. I stand to be corrected but, as a periodic and recent user of the NHS and also as someone who has been specifically investigated twice in recent years for cancer, I am completely unaware of any such drive or, as described in anundated entryon the NHS England website, 'campaigns'. The various arms of cancer screening are described in these pages, and none seems to be especially dynamic or novel. Lung cancer screening for smokers and posting out kits for home testing for bowel cancer, for example, were quotidian even before the covid years. In all the above the mammoth in the room is, surely, the covid vaccines. Yet they are never mentioned in relation to the increased diagnosis of cancer coinciding precisely with the rollout of the vaccines. Of course, 'vaccine' is a term that should only loosely be applied to the experimental gene therapies that were developed and then tested on the population of the world in response to covid. We now know two things regarding the covid vaccines: first they were and continue to be rolled out with high levels ofDNA contamination; second, that the mRNA which is the active ingredient in the vaccines can be taken up into cell nuclei and becomeintegrated into the native DNA. Cancer is, essentially, a disease which depends on disordered replication of DNA, so-called mutations, when cells divide. There is therefore a plausible explanation for how covid vaccines could lead to cancer and, as Professor Dalgleishstated in these pages, 'the link between covid vaccines and cancer can no longer be ignored'. Sadly, it has been.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-13T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/cancer-is-soaring-and-still-they-deny-the-vaccine-connection/
Civilisation collapses as LA burns,"TO describe the scene as Armageddon is no hyperbole. For those who have never visited Los Angeles, the posh neighbourhoods are well known from popular movies and songs: Bel Air, Malibu and Sunset Boulevard. A local manhappened to filmthese exclusive Beverly Hills areas just before the fire in which the Pacific Palisades were destroyed. The devastation seems to symbolise something much bigger: the fall of Western civilisation. California would be a fitting site for such a human tragedy: it is home to the most affluent people in the world, from Hollywood celebrities to Big Tech innovators, who have emphatically supported the Democrat party. State Governor Gavin Newsom has presided over extreme woke policies and Net Zero puritanism but the LA blaze, perhaps, suggests that we have passed the point of no return. For Doug Casey, author ofCrisis Investing, Western civilisation is certainly collapsing. In an interview on hisInternational Manwebsite, he explains that 'it's unique among the world's civilisations in putting the individual – as opposed to the collective – in a central position'. Rational thinking was enshrined over mysticism, enabling the rise of science, technology and principled governance. I wrote on the demise of individualism back in 2019, before the contrived pandemic, when the greater good was enforced with draconian lockdown and coercive vaccination programme.The long march of individualism comes to a juddering halt, my essay on theHuman Eventswebsite, argued that while much of the developing world is on a liberalising trajectory, the West is reversing towards collectivism. Younger generations are being raised as pawns of the state, while they are fooled by the convenience, comfort and safety of the digital matrix. As Casey remarks, civilisation always collapses from within. The rot appeared in the First World War, although 'termites were already eating away at the foundations, with the writings of people like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl Marx'. Creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 was significant: whereas the dollar was previously the equivalent of a twentieth of an ounce of gold, paper notes became receipts for money which did not physically exist. People lost control of the value of cash in their wallets. Fast-forward to quantitative easing, inflation, enormous debt and a looming financial crisis and there is no certainty of us keeping our homes, whether we own them or not. The average Americans' standard of living has dropped since their government abandoned the dollar's last link to gold in 1971, as the fiat currency has devalued capital and discouraged saving. The state determines the value of assets, and stability has been overridden by speculators and central bank manipulation. Money is made from any economic turmoil, as in the global meltdown in 2007-2008, when the international banking set prospered. As Casey says: 'One hundred years ago, the richest people in the country – the Rockefellers, the Carnegies – made their money creating industries that actually made stuff. Now, the richest people in the country just shuffle money around. They get rich because they're close to the government and the hydrant of currency materialised by the Federal Reserve.' A cashless society will put banks in total control, and Casey regards this as the death knell of Western civilisation. 'The government will be able to monitor every transaction and payment. Financial privacy will literally cease to exist. In a primitive society, in your little dirt hut village, anybody can look through your window or pull back the flap on your tent. You have no privacy. This was one of the marvellous things about Western civilisation – privacy was valued, and respected. But that concept is on its way out.' According to Casey, the metastasising state is undoing Western morality. 'What keeps a truly civil society together isn't laws, regulations, and police. It's peer pressure, social opprobrium, moral approbation and your reputation. These are the four elements that keep things together. Western civilisation is built on voluntarism. But, as the State grows, that's being replaced by coercion in every aspect of society.' Casey warns that the West is going the same way as imperial Rome. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote that the more corrupt a society, the more the laws, but the relationship is not always in one direction. Tony Blair's administration passed plenty of laws as it sought to destroy the forces of conservatism. Similarities with the fall of Rome are poignant: self-absorption of the elite, falling birth rate and uncontrolled immigration. Late emperors looked on the masses with contempt. Hitherto leadership was by a priestly class, paternalistic but dutiful towards their charges. Today's professional-managerial class enjoy privilege and power, and feel that they deserve it regardless of the worsening experience and outcomes for the people below them. 'Diversity is strength' is the progressive doctrine, but it is patently false. The liberal West was built on social cohesion, and so its destruction is achieved by undermining it. When people cannot relate to their neighbours, or trust them, they will turn to the state for their needs. Enlightenment values are subverted by Cultural Marxist identity politics, with favoured minorities and stakeholders. Covering the Californian fires, YouTuber Antony Daniels featuredMel Gibson, who criticised the leadership failures of Newsom (he should spend less on hair gel). Reading between Gibson's lines, Daniels mused on the possibility that LA is being cleared for a purpose. The state coffers, emptied by the cost of tackling the fires, will miss millions of dollars in property taxes. But for years California has been pushing people out, replaced by a tidal wave of immigrants with no rights or property, while decriminalising drug abuse and shoplifting. In the 1980s the hip-hop band NWA rhymed furiously on the rich-poor divide in LA, and the police force that maintained it. But the lyrical provocation ofStraight outta Comptonwas relatively harmless, compared with the damage wreaked by the white Californian establishment. The fires are not the only cause of the LA clearance. For those spared by the flames, insurance companies will refuse to cover their properties. Consequently, banks will therefore not lend money, and existing mortgages will be revoked. This is becoming more obviously a controlled demolition, to 'build back better' for a two-tier humanity of a predatory class lording over a majority reduced to neo-feudalism. Some of the richest residents of Los Angeles are discovering, to their horror, which side of the tracks they will be on.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-14T01:19:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/civilisation-collapses-as-la-burns/
Immigration threatens your safety – the facts they try so hard to conceal,"ONE of the most infuriating things in politics is when leaders accuse voters of 'misinformation' while simultaneouslyhiding informationfrom them. You see it all the time. On mass immigration. On crime. And, as we've recently been reminded, onthe rape-gangs scandal. Such is the disdain and contempt with which politicians and civil servants treat ordinary people that rather than be transparent, open, and honest about the information they have, they either conceal it or refuse to collect it. Some days ago, for example, the Home Officerefused to publishinformation about the number of utterly depraved rape-gang members who have been deported, a policy that was first advocatedhere. At the same time, Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government have refused to hold a national inquiry into the shocking rape gangs which would yield crucial new information about what is a truly national scandal, especially in areas that have so far escaped scrutiny, no doubt because Labour MPs are terrified about what such an inquiry might find has been going on (is still going on?) in many Labour-held areas. What all this reflects is a concerted attempt by the elite class, by the British state, to conceal information and data which might challenge or completely undermine what we might call the 'Officially Approved Narrative'. The narrative which tells you mass immigration is only ever positive, multiculturalism is working just fine, and the people who are imposing these things on everybody else know exactly what they're doing. But do they? Do they really? No, suggests a damningnew study, the first major investigation of immigration and crime which has tracked down crucial information. Based on freedom-of-information requests submitted to dozens of police authorities, many of which were sitting on lots of information but refusing to release it, the findings, compiled by the Centre for Migration Control, make grim reading. Look away now if you are of the 'diversity is our strength' mindset. Here are the key findings which underline what is really happening on Britain's streets: Here's the arrest rate for different nationalities in the UK once you weight for their populationBrits = 12 arrests per 1,000 peopleSomalis 64.6 per 1,000 peopleMoroccans 70 per 1,000 peopleAlgerians 72.7 per 1,000 peopleIraqis 92.9 per 1,000 peopleAfghans 106.9 per 1,000... What does all this mean? It means that mass immigration isn't onlymaking you poorer; it's also making you and your family less safe. That is the key conclusion, even if it does fly in the face of the pro-immigration religion among the elite class. As many studies in other European nations have similarly found, in Britain immigrants are significantly more likely to be arrested for all crimes and are especially more likely to commit crimes of a sexual nature. Aspointed outin theTelegraph's recent crime league tables report, the blunt reality is that last year foreign nationals were arrested at twice the rate of British people, with over 130,000 arrests. That's quite a number, isn't it? While violent crime is by far the most common offence, also noteworthy is the fact that over one quarter of all sexual offence arrests last year were of non-British citizens – and over a third of these were for rape, including victims under the age of 13. Why do we remain such a soft touch on this issue? Just as astonishing and troubling as the findings is the fact that Britain has not introduced stricter visa protocols on nationalities who are much more likely to engage in crime. Why is this? If our leaders were serious about keeping the British people safe and secure they would be much tougher when scrutinising applications from the likes of Albania, Afghanistan, and Iraq, compared with those from, say, Western Europe. Even more remarkable is the utterly depressing fact that Britain does not require every immigrant to show a criminal record certificate, instead relying on a dodgy database shared with other nations. Hundreds of thousands are let into the country without having to submit detailed information about their criminal history. This, too, is utterly bananas. And then comes the glaring lack of data and information about this issue, which both reflects and reinforces the incompetence of the British state. As Rob Bates of the Centre for Migration Control rightly notes, if you want information about fashionable topics such as the gender pay gap in public sector institutions, or racial disparities, then you would have endless information at your disposal. Just ask for it and the heavens will open. But when it comes to more fundamental things, such as how to keep the British people safe and secure in their own country, or how much immigration is costing people through tax, welfare, housing, and more, there is a glaring lack of data. Well, now we know why – because it directly challenges the Officially Approved Narrative. Put it this way, why is the government not sharing this data and information every six months in a publicly available report? Why is it that Rob Bates has to submit dozens of freedom-of-information requests to police authorities up and down the country? It's just bonkers, all of it. Which is why, a few months ago, I launcheda national campaignagainst so-called 'misinformation', calling on the government and the state to start collecting and/or releasing information on a range of issues. Since then we've undoubtedly had some big successes, with the government and its various departments suddenly releasing all kinds of information – almost as if they know somebody is watching them and campaigning on this issue! Only a month or so ago we got a load of information about what was going on in prisons and how much all this was costing you, the taxpayer.And now, suddenly, we get all this information about immigration and crime, confirming our suspicions. Rob Bates tells me that he thinks this campaign and the push for data and information might have encouraged police authorities to play ball. I hope he is right. Either way, like him we will simply not stop demanding the release of information and data on your behalf and sharing it with the wider British public through our social media channels so that they too can challenge the Officially Approved Narrative. Because you know what? That narrative is increasingly falling apart.

Rachel Reeves and the parable of the last one holding the parcel,"PEOPLE like parables. Even those not very familiar with the Bible can probably tell you about the parable of the Prodigal Son, or the Lost Sheep. Two thousand years later, it seems we still need simple stories to highlight complex ideas. Thus we now have the parable of 'How Liz Truss trashed the economy' and certainly, if theDaily Telegraphis to be believed,we have the parable of Rachel Reeves 'running to China as the economy burned'. The biblical parables were Jesus's way of illustrating ideas and truths in a manner we can understand. They are eternal. The problem with these modern equivalents is that they often entirely misrepresent the truth for political purposes. It suits the cognoscenti to believe that the wicked Liz Truss, despite the fact she was PM for only 50 days, single-handedly trashed the economy. It serves a number of purposes. It hides the numerous errors prior to her office and neatly transfers the country's ills on to her. It was fine before 'that woman' is the subliminal message. It also acts as a grievous warning that woe betide anyone stupid enough to try to grow the economy through tax cuts. It's a parable against the alleged follies of free market economics. It simply acts as a popular beacon to alleged folly. Similarly we hear from theTelegraphthat Rachel Reeves might be even worse than Truss, as if the two were comparable, when clearly the policy responses of the two were polar opposites. One wished to cut taxes and regulation, the other rewarded public sector workers handsomely while raising a number of vindictive and short-sighted taxes. Can they both be such bogeywomen? What theTelegraphand others are doing with this analysis is pointing the blame at the last one holding the parcel while absolving themselves of any analysis as to why the parcel may have blown up on their watch. To be clear, I am no fan of Rachel Reeves. I thought her Budget was illiterate. It rewarded public sector failure handsomely with no regard to productivity while allegedly increasing the tax take by some £40billion. I say 'allegedly' because it won't raise anything like that much as the economy slides into recession, while causing substantial pain to working people through higher employer National Insurance charges and vindictive taxes on those opting out of state education, to give but two examples. It will be a clear lesson inLaffer Curve economics. Reeves is a very poor chancellor but to suggest she is the architect of the country's economic woes is absurd. Compounding them, yes, but the architect? Absolutely not. She is merely holding the parcel as the bomb goes off. Why so? Britain's malaise is not new. While a case could be made that John Major started the rot, the real watershed moment came with the election of Tony Blair. He, with Gordon Brown, set the UK on a path to delusion. Brown promised prudence, but Labour's inheritance was strong so at first blowing money on state interventionist legislative programmes while starting the process of raising taxes went largely unnoticed. Further, critically breaking the cultural consensus of the land which in time had real economic and social impacts that are only now being fully felt, slowly but surely corrupted the edifice. Worse, they set up a judicial legal state surrounded by a shell of quangos and sympathetic media, academia and judiciary, thus embedding an increasingly far leftist technocratic iron grip. The tragedy was that the Conservatives, with a sort of craven crush on Blair the political master, not only embedded New Labour's toxic legacy but greatly strengthened it. The policy choices over the last 25-odd years have been disastrous, but it took two major events to show that the Emperor had no clothes. The first was the 2008 global financial crisis, which arguably came about as a result in the US of Clintonesque early woke ideology encouraging banks to lend where they should not have. The result was a massive monetary distortion: printing an initial £450billion and, as disastrously, running a monetary policy for a decade and more of near-free money. This was the gateway to public spending delusion. The narrative of the then Conservative Chancellor George Osborne was of austerity, presumably to appease bond markets when the reality was that, while there was a degree of spending control, at no point did public spending fall in real terms. The second disaster was lockdown. The response may have been largely global but the Government's response was extreme even by deluded global standards. A further printing of another £450billion, furlough and the weakening of the work ethic, a massive expansion of the State to the tune of £200billion (in real terms), the dismantling of any semblance of border controls which has been hugely expensive in terms of the public purse and an overdrive in regulation focusing on Net Zero, DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) and massively increasing the minimum wage undermined the edifice. The scale of this delusion, which the authors of this policy still seem not to understand, is unprecedented in peacetime. First gradually and then quickly Britain abandoned free market economics – from the point when the private sector was in the lead, accounting for over two-thirds of the economy, to accounting for just half of it today. That productive half is increasingly hamstrung through a network of regulation and direction which would have been impossible to comprehend just a few years ago. From messing up the owned and rental housing market, the undermining of energy policy (so UK industry is paying four times as much for power as our US competitors despite the UK being blessed with substantial carbon assets) to directing the banks through extraordinary levels of regulation is inexcusable; the list goes on. Hardly a single rational decision. Theresa May's 'nasty party' hurt and boy, did the Tories decide to appease every interest that they should not have in a craven desire to be liked by those who would never like them. Boris Johnson may have been a showman and a credible communicator but the policy response was catastrophic. Debt on debt, regulation on regulation, DEI on DEI. Truss's attempt to gradually unwind this terrible mess, modest as her £40billion tax cut proposal was, was initially lauded by the City but met with horror by the very establishment who have taken the nation to the point of bankruptcy, literally. Unlike the parable of the Good Samaritan, they walked on by. Reeves's Budget was bad and mad but in truth, while a bit more vindictive than most, the magnitude of public spending increase is a fraction of what Johnson was responsible for while the tax rises, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are in fact a magnitude of increase slightly less than Sunak and Hunt burdened us with. However, the harsh reality now is there is no way back for Reeves. She may stumble for a while yet but the UK economy is not going to grow, confidence is shot and with that tax receipts will stagnate just as Reeves's spending is out of control. It is going to get rather worse for her and all of us. The OBR sees a fiscal deficit of £124billion this year falling to £107billion, then £95billion and less. To say this is optimistic is an understatement. Reeves is going to be forced back for yet more, which will further injure the golden goose. There is no happy ending to this. The delusion is too great. Now, however, the US has launched a broadside with the intellectual climate changing 180 degrees. Reeves will choose the wrong partner, getting into bed with the EU, but unfortunately for her this will simply make matters worse. The Conservatives say 'we told you so'. No they didn't. They are entirely complicit in this mess. Continuing the biblical theme, a road to Damascus conversion might be welcomed but far too many in that party cannot see the cliff edge ahead. The status quo simply cannot hold. Change will be forced. Reeves might be holding the parcel when the bomb goes off, but had she any understanding of economics she would see the writing on the wall and act with substantial spending cuts before it is forced on her, as they will be. There is no free money any more. We are all going to pay a large price without an urgent change of direction.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-15T11:18:36+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/rachel-reeves-and-the-parable-of-the-last-one-holding-the-parcel/
The real reason for Apocalypse LA,"THERE is not much that has me turning to the television and the BBC news, but the Los Angeles fire catastrophe is one of those events. Like most normal people I avoid the mainstream broadcast media but neither the papers nor Twitter can really convey the ferocity and devastation of the inferno that is engulfing much of LA. It is not an exaggeration to say that they really are scenes from the apocalypse. The problem, however, with the MSM is that everything is blamed on climate change. If there is frost on the ground in Ireland, it triggers a mass panic for toilet rolls and bread, and of course the schools slam their doors shut at the first sight of ice. We allegedly lived through some kind of 'weather crisis' last week although all was fine down my way. Obviously according to the MSM the wildfires in LA are all down to climate change. The fact that nothing works, as Mark Steyn always says, and that California has been ground zero for the most insane woke-DEI policies for decades, has nothing to do with it. Drug-taking and shoplifting, to name just two crimes, have been essentially legalised in parts of California. The streets have been handed over to homeless people, making life hell for the poor and minority law-abiding citizens. These crazy policies have been standard operating procedure there for years. We know by now that the mayor of LA, Karen Bass, was on a trip to Ghana as the blaze devoured her city. That fact alone sums it up. The warning phrase 'go woke, go broke' needs an update: adopt woke policies and you are in serious danger of losing everything as your house and neighbourhood are destroyed in a wildfire and you can do nothing as for some reason the hydrants are dry. Do not mistake this for some sort of sick 'I told you so' on the homeless and devastated residents of LA. It isn't. But it does demonstrate that if you sacrifice plain common sense (for example, we should do everything we can to get water in the fire hydrants) to crazy woke ideas, you run the risk of being personally damaged by such policies. I watched the great Victor Davis Hanson explain just how bad things are over there. He is a resident of California and described the tragedy as 'a DEI Green New Deal Disaster, something out of Dante'sInferno'. It is eight minutes of reality if you have time to watch it.

The UK grooming gang scandal is a Galileo moment,"This article contains graphicdescriptions of a sort that we would not normally publish but which, in this case, are in the public interest to do so. THERE IS a simple reason that the UK's grooming gangs scandal is so difficult for liberally minded people to wrap their minds around, and that reason is that the scandal is exactly what 'the far right' says it is: Mass, religiously and racially aggravated, rape of thousands of young white working class British girls by Muslim men from mostly Pakistani immigrant backgrounds, on an industrial and organised scale. Every racially aggravating factor you could imagine is present. First, there is substantial evidence that the young girls in question were targetedbecausethey were white. In these communities of Pakistani Muslim rapists, hardly any of the victims were Pakistani Muslim women. Second, the scale of the depravity and violence makes it clear that in many – if not a clear majority – of cases, the abuse was more than just about sex. It was about domination, enslavement, and humiliation. If you doubt me on this point, just readthis 2013 sentencing reportthat did the rounds on X (formerly twitter) in recent days. There's a quote from it later in this article that sums up the kind of thing you'll find in there. Third, there is overwhelming evidence that in many cases the abuse was covered up by the authorities and then downplayed by the media right across Britain because it was more ideologically convenient to ignore the mass rape of children than it was to confront the fact that a substantial section of the British Pakistani community harboured (and indeed still harbours) violently sexist and racist attitudes towards white non-muslim women in particular. The implications of that idea wereand aresimply too great for the liberal mind to contemplate its admission. If multiculturalism has a foundational myth, that myth is that all cultures are compatible with each other and that they can always peacefully and harmoniously co-exist in an open and democratic society. The British grooming gangs scandal shatters that myth. The United Kingdom, like most western democracies, is now a feminist society. Women have equal rights in law, and cultural and sexual politics have shifted dramatically over the past fifty years in favour of women. Pakistan remains a deeply entrenched patriarchal society where religious attitudes towards women, and particularly towards men's right to access women sexually, dominate. Throw in multiculturalism and tolerance and 'community cohesion' as major values, and then mix in hard-line Muslim attitudes towards 'kuffar' women and women who show more of their flesh than a burkha permits, and the UK gets the mass rape of young white girls by Pakistani Muslim men who believe themselves to have both a cultural and a religious right to use those girls as they see fit. When liberally minded people critique the Catholic church, they often cite the imprisonment in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII of Galileo Galilei, as a result of the latter's insistence that the earth is round and revolves around the Sun. When that story is recounted, it is presented as a morality tale about how the Roman Catholic Church is anti-science and anti-progress. But it is a human story at heart: Galileo presented evidence that shattered more than a millennium of religious certainty. Faced with evidence, Urban could either publicly accept that a thousand years of teaching had been wrong – risking people askingwhat elsewas wrong – or he could preserve the authority of the Church and silence the heretic. He chose to silence the heretic. The problem, if that analogy wasn't clear enough for you, is that the UK's grooming scandal shatters decades of liberal teaching about multiculturalism and might be expected to force people to admit that they might have been wrong. Given the choice between having that discussion on the one hand and writing off all those who raise it as heretics who need silencing on the other, modern British liberals have chosen the path of Urban. Thus, Tommy Robinson is a household name in Britain (and indeed Ireland) for his alleged 'islamophobia' while most of us have never heard the name of the man who branded his initials onto a 13-year-old girl, using red hot metal, on the sensitive skin next to her anal passage. His name is Mohammed Karrar. Here is some more of what he did to that child, in the words of the judge who sentenced him: 'You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand her anal passage. You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of GH, you also used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion.' Of course, the grooming scandal (which should really be called what it is – a mass rape scandal) is not the only evidence that the UK has an enormous multiculturalism problem linked primarily to the Islamic religion. A2017 investigationby the Guardian revealed that the UK has between 30 and 90 'sharia councils' in operation, which perform the essential functions of courts, granting divorces, regulating marital disputes, and operating as a parallel legal system. The Guardian is a liberal newspaper, but even it had to report that: 'In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils ""supported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages"".' This is not, to be clear, a British problem. It is a Pakistani cultural and Muslim religious problem that is taking place in the United Kingdom. What's more, the whole scandal underlines a fact that sends shivers down liberal spines: that elements of Pakistani culture and the Islamic faith pose a real and existential threat to women living in liberal democratic societies. If the state wishes to prevent threats to women (as the liberal state insists it does) and Pakistani culture and elements of the Islamic faith are threats to women, suddenly the conversations become – of necessity – very uncomfortable. Which is why liberal Britain is so desperate to avoid having them. For this cowardice liberalism in Britain and the wider west deserves nothing but contempt, scorn, and condemnation. A generation of 'progressive' political leaders of both parties in Britain from the 1970s onwards have consistently prioritised 'community relations' over the safety of their own little girls. Young women were allowed to be treated like human filth, while the entire apparatus of the state looked the other way lest it be accused of racism. All the while, towns like Rotherham and Oldham have been permitted to be turned into bastardised versions of Multan, Pakistan. I will leave you with this story, from 2017. It took place in the aforementioned Multan. A young girl was raped by a boy from her village. The victim had a brother. The perpetrator had a sister. The victim's brother was summoned before the village council and told that justice had been arranged: To avenge the rape of his sister, he would be presented with the rapist's younger sister – a 16 year old girl – andtold to rape her in turn. This is the culture that Britain has imported. It is the culture that dominates vast swathes of Northern England. The state, and progressives, having admitted it to their country, have a duty to quash it entirely. Racism and community sensitivity be damned.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-uk-grooming-gang-scandal-is-a-galileo-moment/
The progressives' contempt for the white working class,"THERE is a time to be angry. There is a time when it is a sin not to be angry. This is such a time. I have served in the armed forces. I have been a prison chaplain. I have been a minister in one of the roughest parts of Glasgow. I am not naive. Yet I was unable to finish readingthe details of the atrocitiescommitted by a mainly Pakistani Muslim rape gang on white girls. some of them pre-teen. These vile acts were committedprior to 2013yet have came to light last week. Why were they hidden? I think we know the answer. The great Dutch theologian, church leader and prime minister Abraham Kuyper never lost sight of thekleine mensen, the little people. He knew that the supposedly insignificant working-class people were ignored by the main parties and needed protecting. Our secular progressive elites have no interest in or concern for the ordinary working-class people of Britain. When a nation abandons the Bible, the most vulnerable pay the heaviest price. These were not grooming gangs: dogs are groomed. These were paedophile rape and torture gangs. Neither was this confined to Rochdale; paedophile rape gangs have been operatingin towns and cities throughout the UK.Poor white girlsfrom broken homeswere viewed as legitimate targets for rape and exploitation by men from a faith known for its disdain of women. This happened with the complicity of those charged with protecting children. Ina case from Bradforda 15-year-old girl was placed as a foster child in the family of her rapist and made to marry her abuser in an Islamic ceremony with her social worker present. During this period she was forced to convert to Islam and treated as a domestic slave. Mainly Pakistani Muslims preyed upon poor, vulnerable white girls. They were pimped out to others across Britain. Police and social services were so scared of being called racist or Islamophobic they did nothing to protect the girls or arrest the perpetrators. Sometimes they were orderedto do nothing.One girl claimsto have been raped by 150 men; this began when she was 13. Some girlswere murdered. The depth of the contempt the white progressive managerial class has for the white working class is all too evident; their oikophobia is rampant. The primary responsibility for these horrific acts belongs to the mostly Pakistani Muslim perpetrators. Yet it was the weakness and systemic failures of those with responsibility for protecting their own girls which should make us angriest. For them progressive ideology, especially immigration and multiculturalism, was so important that it was worthwhile sacrificing tens of thousands of working-class white girls. Ultimate responsibility lies with our politicians. These politicians are keen on punishing hate crimes. If there was ever a hate crime it was when groups of mainly Pakistani Muslims targeted vulnerable white girls on racial and religious grounds for industrial-scale rape and torture. These hate crimes were ignored. These horrific crimes would not have been allowed to continue unabated if our politicians had not prioritised multiculturalism and vote gathering, a combination of progressive ideology and moral corruption. The white girls were simply the wrong victims, their suffering got in the way of the progressive narrative. If it had been Asian girls the story might have been different. This scandal touchedthe whole of Britain, yet the currentLabour government refusesto hold a national inquiry, asLaura Perrins wrote inTCWyesterday.It is to be left to local authorities with limited resources to investigate these crimes. One doesn't need to be cynical to askwho is being protectedand which voting bloc appeased. It does the Conservative Party little good to try to assume the high moral ground and call for a national inquiry. They have just emerged from 14 years in power when they did nothing. The police would not have ignored these crimes without strong political backing and instruction. A law enforcement officer came to the conclusion that a 12-year-old who told police she hadsex with five adultshad done so in a '100 per cent consensual [way] in every incident'. Thankfully, he was overruled. Therewas the time when a 13-year-oldwas found half-naked and drunk in a house with a group of seven adult Pakistani men. It was the girl who was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The men were not even questioned, never mind arrested. By way of contrast, fathers who attempted to rescue their underage daughters from the houses in which they were being held and rapedwere arrested. From the copper on the beat to the highest-ranking officer, not one police officer has been disciplined or lost their job and pension. The same police who turned a blind eye to these crimes are still policing us. There has been a mass dereliction of duty amongst the media who pride themselves on 'speaking truth to power'. With a few brave exceptions, such asAndrew Norfolkof theTimesandCharlie Petersof GB News, they have chosen to ignore the elephant in the room. Our progressive elite are so out of touch with the people of Britain they can only see through woke spectacles.Dr Ella Cockbainof University College Londonwrote in 2013that she was concerned that the existence of child abusing networks run by South Asian men was 'fuelling racist rhetoric'. She was so blind to reality thatshe opined: 'It can seem that the greatest effrontery about grooming is not the abuse of children but the interracial sex itself.' The progressives simply cannot grasp how deeply they hold their fellow countrymen and women in contempt. They cannot possibly admit that they look down on the white working class. After all, being liberal-progressives they are the good guys. They are the enlightened. They are the moral arbiters. They are the ones who understand the whole picture. There is a certain parable about specks of sawdust and planks of wood which springs to mind (Matthew 7:3-5). Professor Alexis Jay, who conducted an inquiry into the mass rapes in Rochdale, wrote: 'The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.' To date no police officer has been disciplined, no social work director sacked, no politician held to account. While unwilling to protect the most vulnerable in society, the progressive managerial class are more than willing to protect their own. This societal calamity was papered over. That is no longer the case. The mass rape of white British girls is the most egregious example of the high-handed disdain the progressive powers that be have for the indigenous working class.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-08T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/progressive-contempt-for-the-white-working-class/
How dare Starmer reject a public inquiry into Muslim grooming gangs?,"SIR KEIR Starmer claims that politicians who are calling for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs are'jumping on a bandwagon of the far right'. In a press conference this morning (about the NHS, obviously, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, obviously) the Prime Minister not only rejected calls for a full public inquiry into the grooming scandal, or more accurately the Muslim child rape, trafficking and prostitution scandal, he also insulted politicians who believe such an inquiry is needed. It was a disgusting slur against anyone who has problems with thesystematic brutalisation of 11-year-old girls. To quote Sir Keir in full: 'It is something about the nature of our politics because once we lose the anchor that truth matters in the robust debate we must have, then we are on a very slippery slope and when politicians, and I mean politicians, who sat in government for many years are casual about honesty, decency, truth and the rule of law, calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far right, then that affects politics because a robust debate can only be based on the true facts and that is why this is actually an important point about our politics, not about what anybody may or may not say on Twitter.' A few things. First, it is noteworthy that this press conference was not about the child gang rape scandal but about the NHS, which in itself tells you all you need to know. As I have said before, there are very few subjects that get the lectern treatment: Far Right Thugs get the lectern treatment, the NHS gets the lectern treatment. How and why young white girls were raped and brutalised by gangs of Muslim men while authorities stood by is not worthy of the lectern treatment.This tells you all you need to know about Labour's political priorities. Second, how dare he? How very dare he say that calling for a proper statutory inquiry into the biggest scandal in British history, namely Muslim gangs of men raping, trafficking and prostituting thousands of white working-class girls, some as young as 11, around the country, while police forces looked the other way, is 'jumping on the band wagon of the far right'. Yes, there have been inquiries before. There was theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by Professor Alexis Jay, but that was a much broader inquiry into sexual abuse by the Catholic church, Anglican church and others. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry in 2014 after it was revealed that at least 1,400 girls in the South Yorkshire town were abused between 1997 and 2013. TheTimesreported: 'An eight-year investigation into multiple police failings during the Rotherham sex grooming scandal was condemned as a disgrace after its final report revealed that no officers have been dismissed . . . The IOPC's resulting Operation Linden investigation examined 265 allegations against 47 police officers by 51 complainants, most of them abuse survivors. It upheld 43 of the complaints and ruled that 14 officers ""had a case to answer"" for misconduct or gross misconduct.' One unnamed officer was said to have told the mother of an exploited childthat it was a 'fashion accessory' for Rotherham girls to have an 'older Asian boyfriend' and that she would 'grow out of it'. And there were other local council inquiries and safeguarding reviews. But as Sir Keir Starmer well knows – he is a human rights lawyer who normally cannot get enough of inquiries – this is very different from an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 where people are called to give evidence under oath. Starmer says that 'robust debate can only be based on the true facts'. Ok then, genius, order an inquiry into the rape gangs, and any possible misconduct by police officers under the Inquiries Act 2005 and we will get to the facts. As a bonus, all your human rights lawyer buddies will be quids in for years. Why is Starmer dragging his feet over a public inquiry? As a rule, politicians normally can't wait to order an inquiry. They demand inquiries over anything. We have the current ridiculous UK Covid-19 Inquiry which will tell us at the end of it all that we should have locked down harder and earlier. There is an Undercover Policing Inquiry. There is the Dawn Sturgess Inquiry, 'an independent Inquiry into the circumstances ofDawn Sturgess's deathin Salisbury on 8 July 2018'. There is theIndependent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan'to investigate the ""deliberate detention operations"" conducted by the British armed forces in Afghanistan between the period of mid-2010 to mid-2013 to determine whether any of the circumstances around any unlawful killings were covered up at any stage'. This is to name just a few. But for some reason, for some unknown reason, Sir Keir Starmer is refusing to hold a 2005 Act public inquiry into the sodomising and rape of working-class white girls. They are not worthy of this human rights lawyer's time and attention, it seems. Don't you know there is a Far Right Thug out there tweeting something mean? You know as well as I do that the Old Bill will be down on them quicker than you can say 'Mind how you go' to a Muslim rapist who is receiving a sex act from a minor in his car. (Yes, that happened.) No, nothing to see here, says Starmer, we have had all the itty bitty inquiries into these pesky white girls and their abuse that we need. (My words, not his, just to be clear.) Starmer said, in full: 'There have been a lot of reviews including localised reviews, including into Oldham for example, the mayor of Manchester did his review, and the Jay report was intended to look at the different types of exploitation that went on. It was a comprehensive review . . . This doesn't need more consultation. It doesn't need more research. It just needs action.' Don't play me for a fool. Sir Keir Starmer KC knows better than anyone that none of these inquiries are the same as a 2005 inquiry with proper terms of reference, focusing on Muslim rape gangs and any possible police corruption, with the power to call witnesses who must give evidence under oath. Starmer doesn't want an inquiry because he knows awkward things come out in inquiries. Facts. Truth. Logic. And often liberal beliefs can be slayed. No one is going to push Diversity is our Strength, or say that Britain has experienced an 'integration miracle', in the words of that half-wit Fraser Nelson, after such an inquiry, I reckon. No British Prime Minister wants to start unravelling the myth of integration or asking some tough questions about the Islamic faith. That could lead to the kind of facts and truth a Prime Minister could do without, thanks very much. The girls who were raped, sodomised, tortured and brutalised by Muslim rape gangs deserve a public inquiry. It is disgraceful that Starmer is refusing to order one. And it is disgusting to label those who call for one as 'far right'. It seems that the only time a human right lawyer rejects a public inquiry is when it is about Muslim grooming gangs.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-06T14:01:02+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-dare-starmer-reject-a-public-inquiry-into-muslim-grooming-gangs/
Welcome to the year of the 'Quad-demic',"WHEN I WAS a child, we had 'outbreaks' of diseases. Living very close to Aberdeen, I miraculously survived the famous (only if you lived near Aberdeen)typhoid outbreak of 1964, which hospitalised hundreds of people. The only thing it killed, temporarily, was the corned beef trade, as the outbreak was traced to a tin of the popularFray Bentos product. Life soon returned to normal, as did the consumption of tinned meats. That was the first and last 'outbreak' that I can recall. Almost anything that more than a couple of folks have caught since has been named an 'epidemic'. That sounded much more threatening, until it was superseded by the term 'pandemic', which seems to be the ubiquitous phrase for anything that used to be an epidemic. Trying to distinguish an epidemic from a pandemic is a fruitless task. The definitions seem to differ depending on where you look and, for all intents and purposes, are interchangeable. The problem for the public health brigade is that, clearly, neither term instils sufficient fear into the population, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 fiasco. Admittedly, they rode high for a time. However, very few people, for example, still wear face masks, apart from a few fainthearts, virtue signallers, and those once again mandated by theirNHS employers. Enthusiasm is waning for covid vaccines. Nevertheless, they must be given credit for their tenacity; they simply don't give up. In their efforts to paralyse us with fear, pepper the joy of the festive season with a little misery and turn our minds towards the perpetual worship of the NHS, we now have a new category of killer to cope with: the 'quad-demic'. In case you are interested, this is an allegedly lethal cocktail of 'flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus'. The quad-demic didn't seem to do the trick, as the irresponsible British public celebrated the birth of Jesus, visited their families and partied like it was 1999. The outcome? According toNHS England, this has resulted in a 'tidal wave' of flu and, in a week, a 70 per cent increase in hospital cases. On New Year's Eve, clearly concerned that we were not listening, the quad-demic has been upgraded with the epithet of'terrifying'. How do we know this? Apparently,over a quarter of British people, or at least those gullible enough to take a test, have tested positive for influenza. This does not take into account any false positives, which plague this kind of testing, and it does not report how many of these people were symptomatic. In other words, such testing statistics are virtually meaningless. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said that the worst of the tidal wave was on its way. There have been almost4500 flu patients every day, with 211 people in critical care. Therefore, 0.0078% of the population is hospitalised with flu and 0.00037% is in critical care. Expressed like that, the tidal wave seems more like a puddle in a car park. So, why the fuss? Obviously, it is to do with pressure on the NHS which, above all, must be 'saved'. The usual guilt-inducing measures are employed to imply that it is all our fault, thus it has been reported that the surge in infections will continue to pick up pace in the coming days as a result of more people socialising indoors over the Christmas and the New Year period. Mask-wearing is encouraged, social distancing rears its ugly head and our old favourite lockdown-style measures have been recommended by virologist from the University of Warwick, Professor Lawrence Young. Laughably, it is recommended that you isolate yourself if you have the flu. In my experience, as flu is a near-death experience, the last thing you would want to do is move, eat, drink or speak. Of course, like Covid-19, all things are not equal with flu. It tends not to strike people down in the prime of their lives; the NHS is not overwhelmed with athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts. People in general good health, while not immune to flu, tend to pull through. The usual suspects arethe most vulnerable: I am the last person to play down the severity of flu. I have had it and, as I write, my son, his wife and two of my daughters, both nurses, have it. It is a horrible infection which I sincerely hope to avoid. However,as explained by Dr Clare Craig, flu is not spread asymptomatically, therefore a person testing positive, who has no flu-like symptoms, poses minimal danger to others. Moreover, the flu virus is airborne, meaning that it quickly spreads after a few people with symptoms have it. To cut a long story short, there is very little that anyone can do either to stop it spreading or, once it is spreading, to avoid encountering it. Most people who do encounter the influenza virus will never know it, as their immune systems will deal with it. Attempts by our public health masters to terrify us into submission with the latest 'demic' are just that: attempts to terrify us. Given that they know the above facts as well as we do, and that measures such as face masks and lockdowns are futile, we can only speculate about their motives. If only there was a vaccine!",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T15:05:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-quad-demic-christmas-blown-out-of-proportion-and-a-happy-new-year/
How Labour is seizing more control over our children,"NEVER underestimate Labour and their determination to wrest any final vestige of authority and concomitant responsibility from parents and endow it on the oh-so-caring state. Labour's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill has its Second Reading tomorrow and given Labour's thumping majority it will be voted through. Even Sky News's reporting of it has been mildly critical. A few days ago it led with'Parents of the most vulnerable children will lose their right to home education'. This is to understate it. It is a further assault on parents' freedom from the state regarding the upbringing and education of their children, transferring even more powers from parents to the state – a process started by Tony Blair when he decided to centralise, control and regulate families by a programme which merged protection services and child care with the education system. All parents became potential abusers while abusing parents carried on being ignored. In fact it has failed abysmally to protect children. Now Labour are doubling down on failure with the last bastion of parental authority and autonomy from the state, home schooling, threatened. So never mind how bullied your child is or how much you object to a school's sex education, gender identity teaching or 'trans' policy, or how bad the educational ethos and standards are, your power to take your child out of school is to be heavily circumscribed. I have to apologise on behalf ofTCWfor being asleep at the wheel on this one and letting it slide, despite the formidable Rabbi Asher Gratt keeping me copied in on his almost one-man battle with the Government and his various exchanges with Labour bigwigs over his understandable concerns (as well as to the worse than dismissive responses that he has received). As Rabbi Gratt has pointed out repeatedly, ironically the Bill will undermine the very things you might have supposed the DIE minorities mantra stands for: the rights of minorities, cultural diversity and religious pluralism. In fact it never did. Diversity in 'multiculti' state education means one thing and that's what the woke choose it to mean – as an example, to celebrate Diwali but ban Christmas nativity plays in favour of 'Winterval'. Demoting Christianity in schools despite its being the country's religion for nearly two thousand years. The bottom line, however,as Rabbi Gratt detailed last month, is that this Bill is the most repressive and authoritarian of assaults on parents. The most repressive since Tony Blair instigated the nationalisation of children when he merged child protection services with the education system andput every child's ID into a national computer database in order to monitor their use of services. Of course this did nothing to stop child abuse and neglect, rather it treated all parent as potential abusers. What this Bill (planned under the last Conservative Governments) will once again introduce under the guise of child protection is a nationwide register of all children not attending school, a unique identification number for each child akin to a National Insurance number, and, most disturbingly, a requirement for parents to seek council permission to educate their own children at home if a child is under a child protection plan. It is nothing less than the state seizing control over our children, Gratt says: 'Under these draconian measures, the government assumes control over children's education in ways that have never before been seen in the UK. Parents will be forced to ""register"" their children like property and submit to the authority of local councils to determine whether their education is ""suitable"". The Bill not only criminalises conscientious parents who seek to provide an education aligned with their religious or philosophical beliefs, but it also sets a dangerous precedent for the erosion of fundamental civil liberties.' Ironically again, the Bill appears to be in direct violation of parents' rights as enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees parents the right to educate their children in accordance with their own religious and philosophical beliefs. Perhaps the most shocking measure is the introduction of a unique identifier for every child in England, a 'child-tracking number' which will be used across services to monitor and log the child's every movement, akin to a social credit system. Gratt cites civil liberties groups calling this provision 'deeply chilling' and reminiscent of surveillance measures seen in authoritarian regimes. The government claims that these measures are necessary for 'child protection'. Critics argue it is state overreach on an unimaginable scale. Rabbi Gratt is far from alone in his concerns. The activist education groupEducational Freedom are concerned that the right to home educate is seriously at risk, pointing to the Children's Commissioner's chilling explanation of the purpose of the register: 'If we get proper registers and we have our local authorities taking their responsibilities seriously to engage with these families, we may find that we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be.' Furthermore they point out that if you choose to home educate you now 'have to demonstrate your home environment is safe even if your education provision is top notch'. So it proposes in effect to circumvent other legislation to remove parental responsibility by the back door. What constitutes 'safe' in a home? Their other concern is that it does nothing to support parents to protect their children 'when the school environment is enabling them to be harmed'. As Gratt points out in his article, for decades parents in the UK have been able to educate their children at home without interference, 'a right that is rooted in centuries of common law. It is not just that if a child is under a child protection plan that the parents must seek council permission to continue home education, the measure effectively treats all home parents as suspects under constant surveillance, undermining the presumption of parental competence and good faith'. Both Gratt and Educational Freedom believe the Bill has profound consequences for vulnerable families, particularly those dealing with medical or special educational needs (SEN) children: 'By forcing parents to seek permission from council authorities, this Bill threatens to reduce the flexibility and personalisation that home education provides for children with complex needs.' This is nothing less than a surveillance state in disguise. As Gratt says, it is not about education quality, but about control, 'something you expect in authoritarian regimes, not in a democratic society'.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-07T13:42:16+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-labour-is-seizing-more-control-over-our-children/
Multiculturalism slays Rotherham's young girls,"Warnings, published in this article all the way back in 2014, of the dangers and consequences of multiculturalism, have been there for all to see. AsLaura Perrins so cogently arguedlast week,establishment elites have ignored them.Which is why, for the record, we decided David's spot on critique was too important to be allowed to moulder in the archive. IT'S ALMOST beyond parody, but the motto of Rotherham Council emblazoned on all its communications to the outside world that it is a metropolitan borough 'where everyone matters'. The grubby, right-on fingerprints of NewLabour's approach to 'public relations' are all over the phrase. Let's put the abuse figure into context. According to the local Children's Safeguarding Board2012-3 annual reportthere are 62,000 children in the area. 49% of the total are girls, so that means almost one in 20 of local girls was subject to abuse. Actually the percentage is slightly higher because the figures also cover the 16-18 age bracket. Alexis Jay– a prominent social worker in Scotland at the highest levels – minces no words in hertotally shocking report. What was being wickedly perpetrated on these vulnerable girls should have been glaringly obvious to all the relevant public-purse agencies from police to social services. But individually and collectively, they did nothing.- other than frequently to pour scorn on those who tried to report their torment. And the reason? Obviously in such complex cause and effect, there were many, but, to me, one paragraph leaps out beyond all others in the Jay report. It's this: 'By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.' In other words – untold, incalculable human misery has been caused because the authorities that should have cared about human welfare and bringing to justice these Asian gangs thought it was far more important not be seen as racist. As I write these words, I am incandescent with rage that this is happening in Britain. How can it be that those alleged public servants paid vast sums and provided with lavish pensions to protect the vulnerable could so blatantly prioritise issues of race above dealing with the unspeakable crimes detailed in the report? Already the sound of wriggling off the multiple hooks in the report can be heard. True, the leader of Rotherham Council has resigned, and true Ms Jay says there have been recent improvements in children's safeguarding. But elsewhere, the signs are that former children's minister Tim Loughton's demand that everyone involved in this horrendous scandal should resign are being ignored. With total brass neck effrontery, the police commissioner involved has apologised it happened on his watch, but says he will carry on. And on past form he will. It was Rotherham Council, let us not forget, which in 2012 became embroiled in another major scandal centred on racism, when its social services department decided that two perfectly loving and qualified adults could not continue to provide foster care for Eastern European children because they were members of UKIP. The woman at the centre of that scandal was Joyce Thacker, Rotherham's strategic director of children's and young people's services. Back then, she defended the decision. Her position was that anyone opposed to uncontrolled Eastern European immigration could not be a loving parent. Two years on, she is still in post, and now there is irrefutable evidence from the Jay report that the decision was not taken in isolation – those responsible for children's services and protection in Rotherham (they are listed on p38-9 of the Safeguarding Board's annual report) – seemingly put fears about being branded racist ahead of the wellbeing of children. Multiculturalism was the mantra of New Labour when it was elected in 1997, the year when this catalogue of abuse began. What's massively clear from its pages – and the lesson we must all now digest – is that this creed of political correctness has introduced a vicious cancer into our public institutions and into the mindset of our public servants. Yes, racism is a poison. But the pursuit of multiculturalism leads to consequences that are far, far worse.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-05T01:18:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-multiculturalism-slays-rotherhams-young-girls/
Fraser Nelson turns a blind eye to broken Britain,"IN WHAT I can only assume was a final act of revenge on theTelegraphbefore moving to theTimes,Fraser Nelson served up one of the worst pieces written by any journalist anywhere on Planet Earth in 2024. This includes Justine McCarthy and Fintan O'Toole at theIrish Times. On Boxing Day or St Stephen's Day, depending on which side of the Irish Sea you are reading this, Nelson gave us this gem: 'Britain's integration miracle is a beacon of hope amid instability. Keir Starmer talks doom and gloom, but this is an amazing country – never more so than now.' If that headline left you dreading what was to come, your instincts were correct. Nelson informs us: 'For decades, the British Crime Survey has gauged how many crimes have taken place, reported or not. It shows assault and neighbourhood crime down by 50 per cent over 15 years, bicycle theft down by 60 per cent over 15 years and criminal damage down by 75 per cent. Some crimes (snatch thefts,knife crimes)are rising, but in the context of a stunning overall decline. Our immigrant population has almost doubled while our crime rate has halved.' (My emphasis.) I don't think there is a single person in Britain who believes the streets are safer. Not a single one. Knife crime is indeed on the increase although Fraser Nelson seems to skip over this fact. Also, which would you prefer, a decrease in bicycle theft or an increase in knife crime? Would you prefer criminal damage (a minor offence against property) to decrease but knife crime increase? No, of course not. Most people would like to see knife crime decrease but it has been increasing in Britain. Much hangs on that termknife crime. It can include anything from murder with a knife, manslaughter to stabbing in the form of either GBH or ABH. In the year that saw the son of Rwandan immigrants accused of stabbing to death three schoolgirls in Southport (not the Welsh Christian choirboy the media first went with) I don't know how anyone could write that Britain has seen an 'integration miracle'. Sure 'knife crime' has increased, just ask the parents of Bebe King, aged six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, who never made it to Christmas 2024 'because of integration' or something. In fact, on Christmas Day itself two women were stabbed to death. TheTimesreported: 'A man has appeared in court charged with two counts of murder after two women died on Christmas Day following a knife attack. Jazwell Brown, 49, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, appeared at High Wycombe magistrates' court on Saturday. Joanne Pearson, 38, and Teohna Grant, 24, died after an altercation at a flat in Bletchley.Both women were from Milton Keynes.' Somehow, after a year that saw the torture and killing of ten-year-old Sara Sharif at the hands of her Pakistani father, Fraser Nelson was able to type the following: 'But we seem to have attracted immigrants who, by and large, are prone to integrate and strengthen the social fabric. The secret sauce is our concept of Britishness, which is not about ethnicity or religion but a way of life with global appeal. It's a set of values that anyone can adopt.' A set of values that includes a two-tier criminal justice system that is very accommodating to certain groups of criminals.Just ask the girls of Rochdale or the mother of Sara Sharif. Then we had this: 'This is not to deny the existence of serious problems, or jihadist nutcases. But the British experience is defined by smaller, less spectacular things that seldom make the news. A reminder came on Christmas Day, when Liverpool FC's Mohamed Salah, perhaps the best footballer in the Premier League, posted a picture of his family in matching pyjamas under a Christmas tree. He does this every year: to annoy the trolls who fume that, as an observant Muslim and captain of Egypt's national team, he should not be joining Yuletide festivities. As his picture gently shows, such petty sectarianism is just not the British way.' So, all is OK in Blighty. There is no issue with Islamic extremism. Proof of this is some millionaire Muslim footballer who likes to put the whole family in Christmas-themed jim-jams. So, those who have an issue with acid attacks, slaughtered schoolgirls, or tortured ten-year-olds are the deluded ones. Not the journalist who writes this kind of stuff. Nelson continues: 'To understand the long-term prospects of a country, look at its birth rates. Italy has just recorded its lowest ever . . . Britain is the only major European country not heading for a working-age population decline.' Now this sentence is another way of cooking the books. Britain has experienced a fertility crash the same as the rest of Europe, concealed only by immigration. Let's look at Britain's birth rates. They have been below replacement level for years and 2024 saw births outstripped by deaths for the first time in 50 years.Go on though, Fraser, tell me again about the cause for optimism. The underlying assumption seems to be that we can just import more workers, who somehow stay forever young and never get old themselves. It's a plan, not a very good one, but a plan. Nelson then talks about the lack of far-right groups in Britain (someone should inform Starmer of that) and finishes with: 'This is an amazing country – never more so than now. It may be an act of defiance to say it in this era of Starmer miserabilism, but we really do have more reasons than ever to wish each other a Happy New Year.' Look, I understand if you have had too much port over Christmas and you are writing your final column for a paper which has done doom and gloom better than any all year. Sure, you want to end on a high, but the truth is that Britainwasan amazing country;it was until the governing elites, including Conservative governments, trashed it with out-of-control immigration numbers. Tory governments also permitted woke beliefs to infect every institution that matters including the police, and oversaw a collapse in law and order and the rise of a two-tier criminal justice system. The tax burden is the highest it has been since the war. Yes, it was a great country, I enjoyed living there for 20 years but some of the above is the reason why I moved the whole family back to Ireland over a year ago.The decline has been hard to watch. What annoys me about Fraser Nelson's article is that he is conservative royalty. He is part of the conservative media establishment in the UK. If he doesn't speak up for the ordinary British man and woman who are not on board with the elite trashing of their country, defeat is inevitable. Journalists such as Nelson should be speaking up and defending the unique cultural character of Britain. Sure, immigrants can integrate but the scale of immigration in recent years will make this next to impossible and many have utterly failed to integrate. Media elites in the UK who declare that there is nothing to see here other than some footballer wearing a very fetching pair of pyjamas is not just bad journalism, it is an insult to those who have seen their country given away and have no power to stop it. It is a betrayal. Badly done by Fraser Nelson, badly done.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-30T01:21:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/nelson-turns-a-blind-eye-to-broken-britain/
Major study confirms covid jab harms mental health,"A STUDY of millions of citizens shows that covid vaccination 'significantly increased' the risks for depression, anxiety, various stress disorders and sleep problems. The same study showed the vaccinations 'significantly decreased' the risk for developing bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Two South Koreanuniversities randomly selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) claims database more than two million (2,154,189) Seoul citizens aged 20 and older who had received two doses of covid vaccines, and 350,983 unvaccinated subjects. Researchers excluded any with a history of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, dissociative, stress related, somatoform (SSD) or psychosomatic disorders (these are mental health conditions where people experience physical symptoms in response to psychological distress), sleep, eating and sexual disorders. This meant excluding almost half a million in the vaccinated group (435,390) and 42,629 in the unvaccinated group. The final number was 1,718,999 vaccinated subjects and 308,354 non-vaccinated subjects. Post covid infection mental health issues had been studied extensively but not post covid vaccination mental adverse events. This study redressed the balance, and the researchers concluded: 'Our population-based cohort study provides robust evidence for psychiatric adverse events (AEs) after covid-19 vaccinations. Furthermore, our study provided risks of psychiatric AEs according to vaccine type, revealing that the psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders) with increased risks due to covid-19 vaccination showed the highest risk in the case of heterogeneous vaccination.' Heterogenous vaccination means a combination of vaccine types, for example Pfizer combined with AstraZeneca. Study flowchart The results were published in the respected journalNatureand produced by scientists from Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital and Ewha Womans University Hospital. Scientists assessed 10,000 psychiatric adverse events over one and two weeks, then at one month and three months, and concluded that: 'Covid-19 vaccination increased the risks of depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders while reducing the incidence and risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.' It had no effect on sexual disorders or eating disorders, they said. They added: 'Our findings suggested that the relationship between covid-19 vaccination and mental illness may be underestimated along with the complexity of its impact on mental health.' The paper contained no case studies but there are many published, like this one from Indian scientists at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. A pro-vaccine, 18-year-old female student with no history of psychiatric problems, physical illness or substance abuse, and no family history of mental illness, was taken to accident and emergency (A&E) after reacting to her covid vaccination. Family members described her behaviour as bizarre and her conversation confused. Within three hours of receiving a Covishield, India's version of the AstraZeneca vaccination, she developed a high fever and diarrhoea. Neither improved with medication. She then became dizzy and disorientated and fell. Her fever subsided the following day, but she developed anxiety, insomnia and petit-mal seizures where she would stare into space. Over the next four days she was irritable, incoherent, and suffered delusions – she felt persecuted and experienced hallucinations with gods and demons. She tried to run away from home. At their wits end, her family took her back to A&E. Before being vaccinated, she had no history of seizures, delusions or depression and was on no medication. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and had not had covid. Doctors gave her a battery of blood and urine tests that showed no abnormalities or provided any other explanation for her sudden-onset mental health issues. A 31-year-old Hispanic male who worked as an office manager, was studied by scientists at Stony Brook University, New York. He had no history of mental illness or physical illness but was taken to A&E by police, exhibiting 'erratic and bizarre behaviour'. He told nursing staff he was clairvoyant, was talking to dead people and could hear people drumming outside his house. He also heard the constant voice of a co-worker who he believed was his girlfriend although in reality, he was not in a relationship with her. He presented as anxious and guarded and was described by medical staff as 'superficial and grandiose.' His symptoms began after receiving his first mRNA covid-19 vaccine and worsened after his second dose.Both patients are said to have recovered after treatment. Psychosis has been reported after existing vaccines like rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhoid and flu. The award-winning BBC foreign correspondentMalcolm Brabantwas in his fifties when he described how he descended into madness after a routine yellow fever vaccine in 2011. He became unwell within hours of receiving the jab and said he endured 'two years of unimaginable mental torment' – he was unrecognisable to his family and friends. He heard voices urging him to kill, believed he was the Messiah come to save the world while at the same time believing he was Lucifer. He was convinced that dead relatives urged him to drink his urine or eat his own excrement or brush his teeth with a lavatory brush. He recovered after several years but not before he was given electroconvulsive therapy and attempted suicide. Sanofi-Pasteur manufactured the yellow fever vaccine he received and although admit to reports of side-effects including mental disorders, said they were 'rare' and unlikely to have caused Brabant's psychosis. What mechanism can cause mental health issues to appear post-vaccination? There is limited data, but reports indicate that mental health issues could be caused by autoimmune encephalitis – inflammation of the brain caused by the body's immune system attacking healthy brain cells. The Stony Brook University researchers said that the disease covid-19 was also linked with psychotic symptoms and that 42 cases had been reported by January 2021. They hypothesised that covid-19 triggered a powerful immune response which resulted in a cytokine storm that could increase the risk of psychosis. University of Oxfordresearchers produced the graph below illustrating the increase in mental health outcomes after covid infection. Their study, also published inNature,said that the unvaccinated had an increased risk of developing psychosis rather than a decreased risk. Fear was a huge factor during covid, and the Indian researchers recognised that lockdowns, social distancing, financial insecurity, the fear of getting infected and future uncertainty, contributed to mental health issues. There is no doubt that existing conditions like anxiety, depression, grief, obsessive compulsive disorder, and psychosis worsened as the psyops surrounding the pandemic increased. However, pandemic onset mental health issues should largely have resolved in the vaccinated who would have been relieved they were protected and looked forward to 'getting back to normal'. Those who were vaccinated were sure that vaccines were the answer to their problems and would not be the cause of new ones. For that reason alone, the South Korean study is compelling. It showed that mental health issues increased in the vaccinated, rather than decreased as would be expected. It also showed that the unvaccinated, despite being branded granny killers and refuseniks, and under intense psyop pressure to conform, did not develop the same mental health issues.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-16T09:18:30+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/major-study-confirms-covid-jab-harms-mental-health/
"Why was Sara’s sadistic, murderous father not stopped? We all know why","MR Justice Cavanagh excused the jury inthe Sara Sharif murder trialfrom further jury service for life. This isn't a regular occurrence. He did so because of the horrific evidence that they had to hear during the eight-week trial.The judge told the jury: 'I know a murder trial is always stressful and traumatic but this case almost above any other has been extremely stressful and traumatic. You have performed your duty magnificently. I'm acutely aware the evidence you had to sit through has been very distressing and you wouldn't be human if you didn't find it upsetting.' Yesterday Mr Justic Cavanagh jailed Sara's 43-year-old father Urfan Sharif for a minimum of 40 years and her stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, for 33 years for the ten-year-old's murder. Sharif's brother Faisal Malik, 29, who was found guilty of causing or allowing Sara's death was sentenced to 16 years. What you must understand about the tragedy of Sara is not just that she was murdered in the most brutal and sadistic fashion possible. She was also tortured for her short life before her evil father finally ended her time on earth. In a trial of many horrifying details, surely this admission by Urfan Sharif in the witness box was the worst. Something that if you were a juror would stay with you until the end of your days. 'In a shocking admission to the court which left jurors open-mouthed, Sharif admitted to throttling her with his bare hands and battering her with a cricket bat, metal pole and mobile phone,even whacking her in the stomach as she lay dying.' If you saw someone do this to a dog, you would rightly conclude they were monsters. Now imagine doing it to a ten-year-old girl. This was the final sadistic assault on Sara at home in Woking, Surrey, by the person who was supposed to protect her. 'The schoolgirl suffered dozens of serious wounds including human bite marks and iron burns, as well as multiple fractures and a traumatic brain injury.' There will be the usual reviews and inquiries. But let's cut to the chase. This time it wasn't the fault of the social workerswho from my reading of things intervened and raised alarms time and again. The police were involved, social services were involved, teachers made complaints. And every single one was ignored. The problem was no one with any actual power was willing to stand up to Urfan Sharif. There were two critical points in the short life of Sara Sharif where if different decisions were made, this little girl might not have been tortured to death. The first goes back to before she was born. 'The local authority brought care proceedings for the children seven days before Sara was born. In a case summary of care proceedings, solicitors for Surrey County council said social workers had concerns regarding the care provided by Sharif and [Sara's mother, Olga] Domin and that children were not adequately supervised.' After her birth, Sara spent a week with her mother in hospital before being taken into foster care. She was made subject to a child protection plan. Her parents were allowed to see her three times a week. Urfan Sharif had already been arrested on suspicion of attacking three women including Olga Domin, as well as hitting and biting two children. Police stated there was not enough evidence to charge Sharif despite each woman's similar claims. At the hearing just after Sara was born a report to the family court concluded: 'Whilst the guardian is satisfied that there may be reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm . . . the advantages of the children remaining at home should [be] weighed against the potential harm to the children of removal, particularly to Sara as a newborn child, before we have a full assessment and understanding of these children and their parents' ability to meet their individual needs.' The guardian is an independent person appointed by the court to give advice. This person found that the test to remove a child, namely that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm, was fulfilled. But then they go on to hedge their bets and talk of the potential harm of removing Sara as a newborn. What absolute nonsense is this? The family were already known to the authorities for violence including serious domestic abuse. The advantages to Sara in remaining in that family were that she was tortured for ten years and then brutally murdered by her father and stepmother. What is more infuriating is that newborn babies are the easiest ones to place for adoption – couples want them. But no, the family court left her in the care of her mother and sadistic father. The worst decision was yet to come. The father and mother separated and now Urfan Sharif was with Beinash Batool. Asthe Telegraph reports:'The Family Court gave Sara Sharif's killer father shared custody of his daughter despite knowing he had been accused of abusing her siblings for years. In October 2019, almost four years before Sara was killed, the couple had been awarded shared custody of her by the Family Court. 'Sara's mother, who has learning difficulties, had given her consent for the children to be looked after by Batool and Sharif. Allegations of abuse and neglect had been made against both Ms Domin and Sharif at the time. This decision amounted to the death sentence of Sara Sharif.' Or asthe Times reports,after a history of allegations of abuse being made, 'Sharif applies to Guildford family court for custody of Sara. Sara had made a claim of abuse by Domin and Surrey council supported returning her to her father. Sharif is given custody of Sara.' And that was that. I hope that the family judge has a very happy Christmas indeed. I understand it can be hard to keep up, between the child protection plans, and the allegations of domestic violence, and the allegation of abuse by three different women against Urfan Sharif, and the allegations of burning children. For instance, in 2015 there was the following allegation. 'Sharif is reported to social services for waving a knife around at home in what he says was a ""zombie"" game. Social workers note that Sharif hit and kicked Domin at home and the pair threaten to kill each other.' Do not be confused between this hearing at that family court, and the test to be satisfied, and who said what about whom. Let's just keep this simple. If Urfan Sharif was called John Smith or Gregg Wallace and had this kind of history, I do not believe he would have been awarded custody of his daughter Sara in 2019. But because his name is Urfan Sharif he can do whatever the hell he wants, especially to women and children, and no one says stop. Other women, such as social workers or teachers, might try to stop him, but they are ignored. These men from Pakistan come over to Britain on a nonsense study visa or work visa or whatever it is,and they do whatever the hell they like. They can rape their way through Rotherham and Oxford, and no one says stop. They can traffic working-class white girls and rape them for years on end and no one says stop. They can threaten to set them on fire, or lock them in cages, and it will take years for the police to take action. Years. And they can import their first cousin from their village in Pakistan to marry them, and that's fine too. There's no push-back until now, and when a scientist conducts research into how damaging cousin-marriage is, it gets memory-holed. We all know why Sara Sharif, trapped in the family home after a family court judge awarded her abusive and sadistic father custody of her tiny body, 'was the victim of repeated beatings and scaldings, forced to leave school and carry out laundry chores for her stepmother while wearing a hijab to obscure her growing number of bruises and wounds'. We all know why 'a post-mortem examination revealed the horrific nature of Sara's death. Sara had endured 71 recent injuries, which included bleeding on her brain, multiple bruises on her lungs, a rare broken hyoid bone in her neck, and a large area of ulceration across her buttocks from an iron burn. Human bite marks were present across her body, with the evidence indicating that she had been hooded, beaten and restrained while scalding water had been poured over her ankles.' This happened because Diversity is our Strength. We would not want to upset the multi-culti apple cart, would we? Wouldn't want to point out that there can be vast cultural differences between immigrants. That would be racist. Even writing this might make me a Far-Right Thug.Remember it is much more important to sentence English grandfathers to entirely disproportionate sentences for Far-Right Thuggery than it is to charge and jail domestic abusers from Pakistan. Domestic abusers who treat women like trash. I don't know about you but I really have had enough of this Diversity is our Strength derangement syndrome. I'd settle for the basic principle that everyone is equal before the law, so that if you are accused of extremely serious offences, you are charged and tried, not awarded custody of your daughter who you go on to torture and murder. So, TCW reader, save yourself the hassle of reading the case review: I can tell you what will be in it. Chances missed. He was clever and manipulative. Blah blah blah. You know why Urfan Sharif got away with it for so long. I know why he got away with it for so long. And so do those who had multiple chances to save Sara Sharif from a life and death of unrelenting cruelty, barbarity and sadism. Shame on them. Sara Sharif. Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.Amen. (By the way, for the hard of learning, do not bother telling me I never write on white child murders as nothing could be further from the truth. I wrote about those twohereandhere. But we are stuck with our native child killers. So I don't see why we have to import more.)",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:22:00+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-was-saras-sadistic-murderous-father-not-stopped-we-all-know-why/
Stories from the illegal migrant frontline,"DESPITE what this inept and impotent Labour government will tell you, illegal economic migrants (to describe them as 'irregular' is a total misnomer, since they 'regularly' arrive here) continue to enter the UK via the Kent, Sussex and Essex coast. Meanwhile, as the Tories did before, the Labour government continue to lie about and obfuscate the actual figures arriving. Yes, they are head counting those being disembarked at Dover docks. But they are not, however, acknowledging the regular sightings by locals on the Kent coast of those coming in by the 'back door'. Many people think illegal landings occur only by 'water taxi', via the RNLI and Border Force, but this is a fallacy. Dinghy-loads of illegal migrant men are regularly seen around Dungeness in Kent, and on other stretches of the 440 miles of Kent and Sussex coastline, much of which is remote. And yet these invaders (let's call them what they are, for they will attempt if possible to come in under the radar, and they also dispose of their identity papers whilst crossing) have the effrontery to enter quite openly, even near to the houses that dot the coast. They then proceed to run across gardens and fields, many to pre-arranged (by GPS) waiting vehicles, usually driven by 'associates' already installed here. Dungeness, where in recent years I have taken many photos of illegal migrant landings, is an amazing area comprising 12 square miles of deserted cuspate foreland – the open country around it affording cover and a good escape route for migrants entering by this back door. Landings by lifeboat here have become infrequent; stopped by the authorities in 2023 because of the presence of a number of citizens and freelance and Press Association journalists. The inept Tory government didn't want them recorded. Nowadays, these occur only in extenuating circumstances, for example if someone on board is suffering from hypothermia, Dungeness being the nearest landfall for an ambulance. The fact, however, that it is a beach and Crown Property has meant people line me could carry on legally filming theunaccompaniedlandings of non-taxied individuals coming ashore illegally. On these occasions, often overnight or in the early hours of the morning, most present were local people, like me. A number of us have access to marine traffic apps and gadgetry that can monitor transponder messages between lifeboats and Border Force, and so we knew when a landing was imminent. we have watched how, without the aid of Border Force or the RNLI, these illegals arriving by stealth and disappear unmonitored into the Kent and Sussex landscapes. It is a recurring problem – their dinghies float back into the Channel on the outgoing tide, causing danger and nuisance to other Channel traffic. Besides being a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Dungeness is home to a large power station in the process of being decommissioned, an airport, and an Army firing range – three obviously major security risks, all of them having been compromised in the past. For example, during a raid on the airport in August 2023'crucial evidence about people-smuggling operations in the Channel was stolen'. Back in October 2020 at nearby Lydd Ranges a powerful nine-metre speedboat made landfall on the MoD beach in the middle of a target-practice session,which had to be halted. The following photographs, all taken by me, depict the general demeanour of migrant men when they arrive in the 'Land of Plenty', clad in their designer gear and armed with new mobile phones and new SIM cards programmed with lists of freebies available to them – and where to get them! You will notice in these images a distinct lack of women and children, although we do see them occasionally; the children are often screaming in fear, and I witnessed one particular horror of a toddler who came in on a lifeboat full of men, none of whom were related to him – his screams and the terror on his little face will live with me forever. Take time to look closely at these pictures – I leave it to you to decide whether these individuals are from war-torn or famine-stricken countries – also whether they deserve to be fed, clothed and housed by the British taxpayer whilst our elderly freeze in their homes and ex-servicemen lay their heads for the night in shop doorways. August 2022 This is of Katie Sweetingham, a Care4Calais volunteer handing out bulk-bought tracksuits to the new arrivals, who are mostly clad in designer clothing from North Face, Gucci and Prada. Sheonce told a French newspaper, 'Obviously, it's my priority to supervise them even before their arrival, to make them disappear from the sight of citizens and the media.' (use Google Translate) August 2022 A French SIM-card frame discarded by a migrant. Supplied by charities in Calais with new SIM cards, pre-programmed with details of where to get benefits (and often new phones), migrants discard old SIM cards overboard during crossings, along with old smartphones, because they are likely to contain incriminating information about their journeys. Some wash up on the shore. March 2020 The sparse landscape of Dungeness with the power station and old lighthouse in the distance, perfect landmarks for those wishing to enter 'under the radar'. Dungeness is about 21 miles from Cap Gris-Nez in Northern France. October 2023 An arrival at Dungeness showing all-male passengers. October 2023 A young girl (employed by a security company) passes by, provoking a reaction from the all-male illegal incomers. On this particular day only she, another girl colleague and one man were present. There were no police there to make arrests. The two girls were instructed to go to the men and ask them if they were carrying knives, scissors, or other weapons. I witnessed this. October 2023 Smiling faces of men safe in the expectation of warm beds and three meals a day plus extra spending money. No sign of destitution, hunger, or illness – and no sign of the gratitude or humility shown by genuine refugees – which refugees should surely include women and children. October 2023 As early as 2019 these posters had become evident around the area, although they are not seen so much now, despite the coast still being an open target for illegal incomers. Around 4.30am in June 2022 The boat has to be trailered up the sloping beach as the tide is out. May 2022: This is a landing in the early hours. This time children were evident. Highly dangerous by day and worse by night in poor visibility, given large vessels are active around the clock. Recently a two-year-old was trampled to death in a dinghy during a night crossing. Several children have died during crossings – possibly some we don't know about. May 2022 The illegal migrants are shown here in their waterproofs (which I believe are reused) issued – I was told by a Border Force officer – by the government. Even before the migrants set foot on dry land, this whole exercise has cost thousands of pounds and, sometimes, lives. October 2023: Migrant men, arrogance evident on their faces, as they pass me to board the air-conditioned coach hired to ferry them to the processing centre and thence to hotel accommodation. I am not sure what the gesture on the right means, but they have been seen giving the one-fingered ISIS salute. May 2022: A young migrant man sporting Gucci jeans (which, my research revealed, cost £660 a pair). I rest my case.

The climate scaremongers: Met Office fiddles the figures over Storm Darragh,"THE Met Office is gaslighting us. Last weekend Storm Darragh swept through the country, the Met Office leading the charge with the headline'Storm Darragh brings 90mph gusts and heavy rain'. The media faithfully followed suit with similarly apocalyptic claims, which probably came as a surprise to most people who thought it was just a typical spell of wet and windy weather. After all, winds that strong are truly exceptional, the sort that swept across large swathes of the country during the Burns Day storm in 1990. So where did these 90mph winds actually occur? The Met Office were quick to tell us! What the Met Office forgot to tell you was that all of these are in extremely exposed locations, and are far from typical of the country at large. Berry Head, for instance, is on the top of cliffs near Brixham, Devon, next to a lighthouse station and on an Iron Age hilltop fort. Capel Curig is high in the middle of Snowdonia, and Aberdaron is on another clifftop on the Llyn Peninsula. If you want representative wind speeds, you certainly don't measure them in places like these, any more than you would use the temperature on the Centre Court of Wimbledon. In meteorological terms, they are meaningless. Their only purpose is to generate headlines. And sure enough, wind speeds in places where people actually live were considerably lower. At Exeter Airport, for instance, just along the coast from Berry Head, gusts reached 58mph at most. In Rhyl, the area where the storm hit hardest, winds hit 60mph. Very windy, yes – but no more than the sort of weather we get every winter. To put Storm Darragh into perspective, Aberdaron holds the record for gusts in North Wales – 112mph in 1997. Darragh by contrast brought winds of 92mph there. If you check back through the Met Office archives, you can see that they never used to report on exposed locations such as these when reporting the weather. They knew that wind speeds there had no relevance. Indeed, it cannot be pure coincidence that their weather stations at Berry Head, Capel Curig, Aberdaron and Pembrey Sands were all opened in 1993. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these and others, such as the Needles on the Isle of Wight, were introduced around this time to inflate wind speeds for purposes of propaganda. We know that in recent years the Met Office has been busy setting up new temperature stations which are so poorly sited that they can read up to 5C too high. The transparent purpose is to be able to advertise higher temperatures. It is also now equally apparent that they are misrepresenting wind speeds for reasons of propaganda as well. There is a serious side to all this. In the past, people accepted that weather like this was normal. As a consequence, they were prepared and took sensible precautions when a storm was on its way. Nowadays, many have been conditioned to believe that the gales seen this week are exceptional. As a result, they are unprepared and panic. Stormy weather 100 years ago WITHOUT wishing to labour the point, it is no coincidence that we had the same bad weather exactly 100 years ago, as the Met Office's Monthly Weather Report for December 1924 reveals. (They used to be called 'Weather Reports', but in 2001 the Met Office started calling them 'Monthly Climate Summaries', proving that they don't understand the difference between WEATHER and CLIMATE!) You could of course look up virtually any year and you would find windy weather like this at some time in winter.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-13T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-met-office-fiddles-the-figures-over-storm-darragh/
Electric armoured vehicles? Net zero chance of that,"THERE have been several noises in the recent past about 'decarbonising' warfare. For instance, in 2021 the then chief of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston,set a target for British military aircraft to hit net-zero carbon by 2040. Another example is the plan set out in 2020 by the US military to have electric armoured vehicles, reported inPopular Mechanics under the heading 'The Electric Vehicle Revolution Is Finally Hitting the US Army'. Now it is reported that in the UK'Ministers are forging ahead with plans to use electric vehicles (EVs) for combat on the battlefield despite warnings from military grandees that they could put the Armed Forces at risk'. Let's take a look at the facts of the matter. First, aChallenger 2 tank weighs 64 tonnes and carries around 1,600 litres of fuel (16 MWh energy) weighing 1.3 tonnes and is expected to have a range of 300 miles. As a rough guide, let us use theTesla S long-range car: 2,100 kg weight, 100 kWh/544 Kg battery pack and a 300 miles range. By extrapolation, the Challenger tank will need a 3 MWh (64*0.1/2.1) battery weighing 17 tonnes. A Tesla Supercharger at 250 kW will take 12 hours to charge it. Anyway, where and how will it be charged in a combat zone?! Similarly, alight armoured vehicle (L-ATV) weighs 4,667 kg, with a range of 300 miles and has dimensions of 6.2m length, 2.5m width. Again, compared with the Tesla S, the L-ATV will need a battery of at least 220 kWh (100*4667/2100) capacity. Under 'peak sun',modern solar panels can produce 300 W per square metre. So, if the L-ATV has to be charged by solar energy, it has to be parked under 'peak sun' for about 48 hours to charge the battery, even if its entire top surface is covered by solar panels (220/[0.3 × 6.2 × 2.5]). It is also to be hoped that no rocks will be thrown at it by miscreants on the battlefield! Themaximum take-off weight (MTOW) of a Eurofighter (Typhoon) aircraft is 21,000 kg and it carries 4,000 kg of fuel with an energy content of 49 MWh. A battery pack with the same energy content would weigh around 13 times the MTOW of the aircraft, assuming a battery pack energy density of 5.44 kg/kWh, taking Tesla S as the guide. It is to be remembered that there are hardly any efficiency gains from running jet engines on batteries. It should be obvious that using electric vehicles for combat on the battlefield is a very silly idea. The reason appears to be that the government has pledged to put net zero goals at the centre of its defence industrial strategy. Astonishingly, a government source has said that 'new and emerging technologies can support decarbonisation efforts and improve battlefield capability, reducing the supply chain vulnerability of liquid fuel and also reducing the heat signature and noise of vehicles on the battlefield'. Never mind that it will clearly erode battlefield capability and increase supply chain vulnerability. For instance, will an adequate charging infrastructure be first established in the field before any battle is fought? People with common sense in the military have already called it a'crazy endeavour'and recognise this as nothing more than virtue signalling by the MoD. It is a pity a lot of money will be wasted on such idiotic ideas in pursuit of 'net zero'.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:59:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/electric-armoured-vehicles-net-zero-chance-of-that/
War on Microbes: The murky agenda behind the covid ‘pandemic’,"THE biodefense mafia don't really care whether zoonosis (a disease passed from animals to humans) or a lab leak was to blame for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They just want you to believe there was a pandemic and restrict causation to one of those two options. It's a false binary. Either explanation is a win for them because what they're really doing is setting an elephant trap. The objective is to perpetuate the 'War on Microbes', a taxpayer-subsidised pharma racket in which finding or inventing viruses in order pre-emptively to invent countermeasure vaccines can continue ad infinitum. Either excuse serves their purpose. On December 4, 2024, the House of Representatives sub-committee on the Coronavirus Pandemicreleased a 557-page report, 'After-Action Review on the Covid-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and a Path Forward'. Its finding? 'A lab leak is the most likely origin scenario, that the Chinese Communist Party was conducting dangerous research, and this type of dangerous research was notionally supported by the NIH [US National Institutes of Health],' said Chairman Brad Wenstrup. The conclusion was perhaps no surprise as Wenstrup, a podiatrist and US Army reservist who served in Iraq in 2005, was in 2021 amongst the first outside Dr Robert Kadlec's biodefense clique to push for a lab leak investigation. What the US now euphemistically calls 'gain of function' work used to be called bioweapons research. Kadlec invoked the right for the US to do it in 2003, justifying it as defensive threat detection work. However for the countermeasure part to be legal under international law, it needs an illegal act by another state to respond to, so someone else needs to be doing it too. Funding Chinese government research into zoonotic viruses is perhaps a second elephant trap as it sets up future scapegoats. For the pharma companies it's a win-win too. The US War on Microbes business model calls for outsourcing of vaccine development projects to private companies whose development costs are completely underwritten by the government, whose own researchers get a small kickback in the form of royalty payments while Pharma gets to keep most of the profits from the commercialised product. It's a merger of state and corporate interests. Left to a free enterprise model, we wouldn't be where we are because there is no viable commercial market for these War on Microbes vaccines. News coverage on the committee report has largely focused on speculation that perjury charges could be brought against former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) chief Dr Anthony Fauci and some of his subordinates who the Committee believed gave misleading testimony. Dr Peter Daszak, the Chief Executive of EcoHealth Alliance, who were the conduit for US funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for the bat coronavirus research the committee believes caused the pandemic, was accused of obstructing the committee's work. It wants them barred from receiving any future US government funding. Charges against Daszak and Fauci would be popular as there is an appetite for bringing someone to account. The prospect of perjury investigations and criminal charges or government funding bans stirs up waters already muddied by Dr Kadlec himself through his Senate Investigation. It doesn't matter if aerosolised bioweapons really work or if biodefense spending is necessary,all that our very own Colonel Jack D Ripper wantsis for there to be a widespread belief that human bodily fluids can be polluted by viruses so that the firehose of Manhattan Project for Biodefense funding to his corporate chums continues without interruption. The biodefense mafia are playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. So to anyone wise to the elephant trap, the House sub-committee report which affirms the need to 'Predict, Prepare, Protect, Prevent' makes depressing reading. It's a prescription for more of the same. Wenstrup and his committee believe that pandemics will continue to be recurring events, that Covid-19 was 'novel', that it emerged from a Chinese lab and killed millions, that Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute vaccines was a tremendous success which should be repeated in the future and finally that there was a cover-up which involved Chinese and American officials. First of all, at least five years of planning went into bringing us the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or rather the Manhattan Project for Biodefense. It began outside government as a response to the October 2014 US government funding pause on gain-of-function research on SARS and MERS coronaviruses and influenza viruses. Dr Kadlec, the architect of 21stcentury US biodefense policy, was the key driver of this plan. In a2009 interview published in the journalBiosecurity and Bioterrorismhe explained his preoccupation with stopping exotic pandemics, saying: 'The view I have is deeply rooted in the military, but medical in nature.' Within a month of the gain-of-function research moratorium which was an existential threat to Kadlec's threat detection-based rationale for funding gain-of function research and vaccine countermeasure development projects, Kadlec organised a biodefense study breakfast in Washington DC. ByDecember 8 he had set up his Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefensewhose report was the basis for President Trump's 2018 Biodefense Policy. Kadlec was also chair of the National Academies Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness to Catastrophic Events, organisers of a March 2015 workshop onEnabling Rapid Response and Sustained Capability Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk of Emerging Infectious Diseases. It was chaired by his old friend Dr Richard Hatchett, the Chief Medical Officer at BARDA (the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority). The keynote speaker was Dr Jeremy Farrar, then the newly installed director of the Wellcome Trust. Dr Daszakwas there too, on a panel discussingChallenges and Opportunities in Responding to Coronaviruses; Past and Present. The opportunity to be exploited was that coronaviruses cause the common cold, but could be made to be sound frightening enough that people might take a vaccine if one were to exist. The report published after the workshop records an unnamed person suggesting a 'Manhattan Project for Biodefense' was needed. By mid-2015 Farrar drafted the proposal for what was to become the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the vehicle used as a hedge against any future US domestic gain-of-function moratorium and which offshores US government biodefense vaccine projects to commercial partners. CEPI is now led by Dr Hatchett. Dr Barney Graham of the National Institute of Health and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Centre, who had beenresearching the similarities between RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and SARS coronavirus since 2006, proposed the prototype pathogen approach under which research into vaccines for one virus could be rapidly repurposed into vaccines for a similar virus. SARS and MERS vaccine development research in the US went underground and under the radar as RSV vaccine research. Graham's RSV patent was licensed to developers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 2020. On January 10, 2020, when the genome sequence for the Wuhan coronavirus was released,Dr Vincent Munster, the Chief of the National Institutes of Health's Virus Ecology Unit,sent Dr Ralph Baric an emailabout the 'novel' coronavirus saying, 'Perfect! Right between your favourite viruses :-)' It was no surprise: it landed where he put it when he wrote the gain-of-function section of the EcoHealth Alliance's now-notorious Defuse Proposal which the pandemic sub-committee said had been split up and funded by Fauci after DARPA declined to do so in 2018. Far safer for it to have been civilian rather than military funded. Of course the NIAID knew about the Manhattan Project for Biodefense – it issued Dr Baric with a task order (HHSN272201700036I) on September 15, 2019 to assess the efficacy of candidate coronavirus vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in mouse models. That's how it happened that Dr Baric was sent the Moderna NIAID jointly-owned mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates on December 16, 2019 before anyone was aware of a Wuhan flu. No one on the sub-committee questioned him about this. Dr Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Response (ASPR) who ran the US response to SARS-CoV-2, activated the US government disaster leadership group on January 3, 2020 (source Paul Mango's bookOperation Warp Speed), a mere three days after China notified the WHO that it had 17 cases of an unknown pneumonia. No one had died yet. DARPA then notified the research teams participating in their four-year Pandemic Prevention Project which began in February 2018 that the'novel' coronavirus was the next test(see last page). And Kadlec saidhis office spent 18 months planning a joint exercisewith the Japanese Ministry of Health on how to repatriate Americans from Japan in the event of a disaster or emergency. It just happened to have been scheduled for March 2020 but was brought forward a month to evacuate theDiamond Princess. How fortuitous, or more likely, how convenient. The Committee report also ignores the important but overlooked reasons why there was such an emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2 virus being 'novel'. The original SARS first emerged in 2002 during Gro Harlem Brundtland's tenure as Director General of the World Health Organization.The hyperbolic press releaseclaimed it still threatened the world but had been contained in five months. The Centers for Disease Control held a patent on it. Ten years later, the purportedly deadlier Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia. Between 2013 and 2015 there were ten failed attempts to have the WHO declare a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) over MERS.A conflict of interest declaration for the WHO Emergency Committeesays that researchers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands filed a patent on MERS coronavirus. Intellectual property rights is the first reason the 2020 virus needed to be novel. The second is to avoid the WHO Emergencies Committee declining to issue a PHEIC for an 11th time. Even so, in January 2020 WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had to ask three times before the committee obliged. Wasn't it lucky that, as Dr Munster pointed out, a novel coronavirus that fell between a bat coronavirus and the SARS virus the CDC held a patent on emerged out of China 'just in time' for the mystery virus phase of DARPA's P3 project, when 'just in case' coronavirus vaccines that licensed US government patents were being cooked up?",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/war-on-microbes-the-murky-agenda-behind-the-covid-pandemic/
This methane nonsense is a nasty protection racket,"DAIRY farmer Jamie Blackett was quite right to point out there ismuch nonsense written about flatulent cows and climate change. It's a great shame he didn't use hisTelegrapharticle to dispel it. Rather he amplified and tried to justify the nonsense, while gaslighting those who question the need to feed any synthetic enzymes to cows as promulgating 'febrile conspiracy theories'. I expected better of him. At least he admits that he has skin in the game because he sells his milk to Arla, who announced they are going to 'trial', on 30 British dairy farms, feeding the synthetic enzyme inhibitor Bovaer, 3-nitrooxypropanol, to cows to reduce their methane emissions. This is but the latest aspect of the lunacy being imposed on an unwilling people to 'tackle climate change to save the planet'. Feeding unnecessary chemicals to cows is a monstrous scam justified by the 'drive to net zero'. It needs to be shouted from the rooftops at every opportunity that the whole wicked business has nothing to do with the climate, cows' health or the production of milk and meat. It's part of the greatest grab of wealth in history from the mass of ordinary people to a few stupendously rich internationalist oligarchs, aided by our own government, who aim to control – if they don't already – the whole world. This methane-curbing nonsense is nothing more than a horribly clever protection racket, based on the fantasy of anthropogenic global warming. How is it a protection racket? Reduced to its essence, it involves farmers being forced to give the stuff to their livestock or else they will suffer the consequences of refusal. The last government (and it is vain to hope this one will be any better) was talking about making it mandatory to give the chemical to all cows by 2030. (What is the magic in 2030? Every repressive measure the state is going to impose on us has a deadline of 2030.) Let's consider a few facts that might show this racket for what it is. First, there is no evidence that the natural emission of methane from ruminants (or decomposition of vegetation in marshes or burning oil and gas) has the slightest effect on the temperature of the earth. Methane is a trace gas which comprises roughly 0.000193 per cent of the atmosphere – about 1,930 parts perbillion.It breaks down to its constituent parts of carbon and hydrogen over an estimated 7-10 years. The other bogeyman, CO2, without which life would not exist, is about 0.04 per cent or 430 parts per million. It's interesting to compare the number of cattle in the US in 2024 – 87million – with the number of ruminants that grazed the grasslands of the continent before the white man got going there in the 1800s. The best estimate is that there were 60million bison, 45million antelope, 60million deer and elk, 2million bighorn sheep and a million moose. Roughly speaking, there were twice as many ruminants 250 years ago as there are cattle today. One wonders what happened to all that methane they must have created over centuries, while at the same time their grazing and dung made the plains of the Midwest some of the deepest and most fertile soils in the world. It is proposed, at least to start with, that only dairy cows in 'zero grazing' indoor systems are to be given this synthetic substance, because all their feed is brought to them rationed. Apparently cows that go out to pasture will not be given it – yet – because it has to be fed regularly, in measured amounts. According to DEFRA's figures for June 2024 there were just under 5million cattle in England, of which 1.1million were dairy cows (down by about 30 per cent in 30 years). It is not clear what proportion of these was kept indoors all year round, but it is estimated that fewer than 20 per cent of dairy cows are housed permanently. The makers of this substance, a Swiss company, dsm-firmenich (they're so woke they've dispensed with capital letters) claim that feeding 1⁄4 teaspoon a day to each cow will reduce its methane emissions by 30 per cent. (Apparently the US sellers of the stuff, Elanco, recommend a tablespoon a day.) So let's assume there are roughly 200,000 cows kept inside, in Britain, all year round and they're all fed Bovaer; methane emissions from the national herd will be reduced by 30 per cent of 4 per cent of the national herd – that is by 1.2 per cent. It's hard to find out exactly what this chemical will cost, but it's somewhere between £50 and £100 per cow per year. The makers claim the cost will be reduced by half in 2025 when a new manufacturing plant in Scotland starts making the chemical. If there is no financial benefit from increased milk yield or health of the cows and there are concerns over the testing and safety of the substance, why would a farmer bother with it? And how would it be paid for? Not by selling dairy produce. Rather, farmers will become part of the 'self-sustaining carbon inset market'. In other words, they will be sucked into a fantasy world trading in 'carbon credits'. The amount of CO2e – a new catch-all formula for all 'greenhouse gas emissions' which includes methane, carbon dioxide and anything else considered to contribute to 'global warming' – not produced by the cows will be calculated by a third-party 'expert'. The expert can't measure the amount of gasnotproduced, but will verify the amount of Bovaer being fed, from which the amount of gas not being produced can be estimated and expressed in metric tonnes. This will be sold, through a company operating a 'carbon insetting marketplace', to big corporations to allow them to carry on as before. The money (less commission) will be paid to the farmer who has caused his cows not to produce whatever weight of gas the third-party expert certifies they aren't producing. The rest of the cost of feeding Bovaer is expected to come from state subsidies to the farmer. Why is the government encouraging – even mandating – the feeding of this chemical to the national herd? Ah, well, apart from the endless profits for the pharmaceutical company that will undoubtedly burgeon down the years, our government has signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement and it needs every little help it can get – even making up some fanciful reduction in 'greenhouse gas' emissions to bring the UK closer to 'net zero' by 2050. Even if we accept the warmists' claim that we have to mess about with the digestion of the world's cows, what's the point when saving the planet means that much of what makes life worth living will be destroyed to avoid something that might happen a century from now? It makes no sense to anyone capable of thinking. Blackett is wrong to say thateveryonewants farmers to feed this chemical to their cows to reduce their flatulence. Increasing numbers of people are waking up to the whole climate scam; the wind is changing, and judging by the public's reaction to Arla's announcement, causing sales of their products, particularly Lurpak and Anchor butter, to plummet, farmers would be well advised to resist this enforced medication of their cows.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-methane-nonsense-is-a-nasty-protection-racket/
Why NHS staff are shunning the vaccines,"NHS staff are boycotting covid and flu vaccinations while the government is busy promoting them to the public in a television and radio campaign. Concerned by the low uptake in the health service, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has appealed to healthcare practitioners to get jabbed. This season, only 14 per cent of NHS workers took covid jabs and only a quarter received flu vaccines. TheNHS saythis is because hospital staff are busy and have no time. Official figures tell a different story as NHS staff are taking double the days off sick post-covid vaccine rollout than they have since 2009. Unusually, in 2020, absences rocketed in the summer months; absence is traditionally low between May and November. Covid vaccines were offered to front-line staff from December 2020, a sharp rise in absences began in March 2021, three months into the rollout, when seasonal illness is traditionally waning. Sick days have doubled from the baseline of 3.75 per cent to 6.75 per cent, the highest since 2009, and have not dropped back to 2019 numbers which were between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent. Even during peak pandemic months, absences ranged between 4.75 per cent in February 2020 to 6.10 per cent in May 2020. One NHS doctor, who did not want to be named, said adverse reactions in staff and patients are contributing to 'vaccine hesitance'. She said: 'We have all noticed the adverse effects in our patients. Many of us have become vaccine hesitant after seeing the debilitating health issues our patients are now dealing with, and those we are dealing with ourselves. No health professional that I have spoken to wants any more boosters. 'The type of reactions we see range from local allergic reactions to a whole switch-on of histamine systems, such as POTS and MCAS.' Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), characterised by dizziness, is a blood circulation disorder which causes an abnormal increase in heart rate when standing up, while mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) causes allergy symptoms in multiple systems. Officially, the government recommends thecovid jabto care-home residents, all adults 65 and over, babies from six months and adults up to 64 in clinical risk groups.Fluvaccination is recommended to all ages including babies from six months. The ads fail to define these cohorts and feature the elderly, pregnant women, men, and children under 12 despite official figures showing that covid and flu pose minimal risks to them. Deaths are likely to occur in children and teenagers only if they have co-morbidities. The graph below is from the officialGreen Book, which provides the latest vaccination information to healthcare staff, and shows there have been just nine covid deaths in the six-month-to-19-year-old age ranges, and deaths only escalate in the over-60s. Every death is a tragedy, but a death caused by vaccinating a healthy individual is doubly so. Our drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says 90 per cent of adverse reactions go unreported, but even so, is busy recording stark, serious adverse event (SAE) figures. By the beginning of June this year, healthcare professionals and the public had reported nearly 3,000 deaths (2,707) related to covid vaccination since December 2020. Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and unknown brands of mono and bivalent covid vaccines have been available in the UK. MHRA summaries are culled from Yellow Card reports, last issued in the week ending June 2, 2024. Overall, 1 in 111 people injected experienced a Yellow Card adverse event (assuming one person submits only one report) while 1 in 148 people injected experienced an adverse event classified as serious; 1 in 180 reports were associated with a fatality. Over 1.5million adverse events had been reported (1,586,411) by then, involving half a million people (486,634); 75 per cent of reactions were considered serious. The MHRA defines serious as 'life-threatening, prolonged hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or congenital abnormality or birth defect'. Although the AstraZeneca vaccine has been unavailable since August 2022, it accounts for the highest number of total reactions at 885,374, compared with Pfizer's mono and bivalent jabs, 533,038. By now, most people have come into contact with covid. Those who contracted it enjoy natural immunity although the Green Book tells doctors that natural immunity wanes after one year. That is still double the immunity offered by vaccines which wanes aftersix months. In September 2020, nine months into the covid pandemic and before a vaccine was available, Oxford University issued apress releasestating that 'researchers found that natural infections with covid-19 produced a robust T cell response, including inducing T cell memory to potentially fight future infections'. Basically, this means that T cells help the immune system protect the body from serious infection, which is what healthcare experts claim vaccines do. Oxford's results were published in the journalNature Immunology. GPs boast a slightly higher uptake of both jabs than other healthcare professionals, but still only 23.6 per cent for covid and 42 per cent for flu, the highest uptake being in the South West of England. Doctors' surgeries in England were confused as the Green Book omitted GPs and frontline staff as being eligible for autumn covid boosters. The confusion stemmed from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's (JCVI) decision not to continue to recommend covid vaccination for front-line health and care staff in favour of 'local occupational health solutions' – or managing the risk. Officialstatisticsdo not support panic and expensive, multi-million-pound ad campaigns paid for by the taxpayer. The national flu and covid-19 surveillance report for week 48, November 28, said that although 'influenza activity increased' it had reached only 'low activity levels'. Covid was at 'baseline levels' , and remained stable, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was at 'medium' levels with increases in most age groups. RSV was practically unheard of until a vaccine was produced this year. England's Chief Medical Officer SirChris Whittyis urging people to get their flu vaccines despite the fact that infections halved between 2022/23 and 2023/24, with no indication they will be worse in 2024/25. Meanwhile, the respected independent, non-profit organisation the Cochrane Collaboration, who analyse clinical trials for healthcare interventions, found influenza vaccination offered little benefit. There are more than 200 viruses that can cause influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Symptoms include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches and pains, cough and runny nose. Doctors cannot distinguish between influenza and ILI without laboratory tests because both last for only a few days and rarely cause serious illness or death. Cochrane's stabilised review of 20 years' worth of papers (stabilised meaning there is no new evidence to contradict findings) discovered that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is oversold to all age groups and that only 2 per cent of adults get flu. Dr Tom Jefferson, lead author of the Cochrane review and Associate Tutor at Oxford University, said: 'Influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science. We have few trials, and masses of very poor-quality observational evidence.' After analysing 25studies conducted over a single influenza season in North America, South America and Europe, between 1969 and 2009, it found the vaccine reduced the chance of getting laboratory-confirmed influenza from 23 cases out of 1,000 (2.3 per cent) to nine cases out of 1,000 (0.9 per cent) in healthy adults. Around one per cent of people who contract covid die with it. Most who die have co-morbidities.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:21:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-nhs-staff-are-shunning-the-vaccines/
Why report the mass rape of white schoolgirls when you can pick on Gregg Wallace?,"WELL done to the insurgent group led by Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, a former al-Qaeda commander, who not only ended Bashar al-Assad's 24-year rule over Syria but also finally removed Gregg Wallace from the front pages. Although I suspect Wallace is still generating quite a few think/opinion pieces. If you hadn't heard of Gregg Wallace before, a greengrocer made good and a judge on the BBC's MasterChef, you certainly will have after last week. It was revealed by our media and 'middle-class women of a certain age' that Wallace was allegedly a bit of a sex pest on the set. Now, I have no time for such behaviour, I am not defending it and social conservatives have no business defending it either. This is stating the obvious, which I didhere. So, one more time; women deserve to be treated with decency, respect and professionalism at work (or indeed at home). Having stated this obvious fact it is now time to state another obvious fact, namely that the media coverage about this minor workplace issue has been totally and utterly disproportionate to the wrong committed. That a story which in most workplaces would be dealt with by the ladies in Human Resources should generate the headlines it did, and in particular the 'think pieces', tells us once again a universal truth about Britain: some victims count, and some victims don't.And what is glaringly obvious here is that if you are a middle-class woman of a certain age working in the media you count; if you are a white working-class teenage girl in Rotherham or Oxford you do not. You are seen as trash by the police and sacrificial victims on the altar of Diversity is our Strength by the political establishment. Therefore should you have your entire childhood stolen and your adulthood ruined because you are brutally and repeatedly raped and dehumanised by gangs of Asian/Muslim grooming men, so be it. If you are a middle-class media woman of a certain age and you are sexually harassed on the set of MasterChef, it is literally, quite literally, hold the front page. Polly Vernon was giventwo entire pagesto tell us all how she was harassed over the years at work (the stealth boast). I don't remember a single girl of the thousands who were brutalised in English towns being given this much space to tell us their stories. And don't bother dismissing this as 'what-aboutery'. What about, what aboutery? What-aboutery – very much like the lectern issue I talked about before – tells you all you need to know about the media's priorities. Not every story can make the front page or even page 10. The stories that do make the paper and the broadcast media are seen by our media to be more important than those that don't. I am not being conspiratorial; I have no time for such nonsense. It is a straightforward matter of priorities. We all have priorities. My children are my priority, my neighbour's children, although very nice, are not. Middle-class media women are a priority; raped and abused working-class girls are not. It's that simple. The other reason Gregg Wallace dominated the front pages is because he is the perfect villain: a white working-class geezer done good. So the media will go after him. But if you are an Asian man who treats white working-class girls as trash, something to be raped, passed around to other Asian men, urinated on and kept in a cage, you are rarely exposed as the child rapist and child trafficker that you are. This would jeopardise the sacred mantra of Diversity is our Strength. So it gets buried for decades until it becomes so obvious that someone somewhere has to say stop. TCW has spoken about the Rotherham scandal before. I did sohereandhereandhere. Indeed, even when cases came to trial, the abuse of these girls continued: 'When cases did eventually reach court, GMP left the young victims to be harassed and intimidated by the men who had previously abused them, sometimes at gunpoint.' Also, police took no action in the case of a 15-year-old who gave birth to a child of her 'pimp'. Amazingly I don't remember many headlines about raped girls being threatened at gunpoint by their abusers when their criminal cases eventually came to court. I am sure there is some white working-class man doing something inappropriate at work somewhere which deserves much more attention. Another example of the abuse that went on was: 'One child told GMP that her abusers kept girls in cages and ""made them bark like a dog or dress like a baby"" but took no action once she left Greater Manchester and was put in care elsewhere.' Lovely. The latest case that involved the brutal abuse of white girls by mostly Asian men came during the American Presidential election, so some lack of coverage was to be expected, but I don't recall any serious coverage at all. Like so many other cases,it sank like a stone. A West Yorkshire Police press release said: 'Two men have been convicted and jailed for sexually abusing young girls in Calderdale, bringing the total to 22. Legal restrictions and appeals against convictions meant we were unable to share the outcomes until today. The convictions follow an investigation launched in 2016 following reports of repeated sexual abuse of a vulnerable young girl between 2002 and 2006, starting when she was 13 years old.' Two days earlier a press statement said: 'Twenty men have been jailed for more than 219 years combined after being found guilty of raping and abusing young girls. Through a series of individual investigations and trials, the men were found to have sexually abused and exploited four girls between the ages of 12 and 16 in Calderdale.' I put 'Calderdale' into the Times search engine, and found that they reported the casehere. In fairness to the Times, they have been better at covering this scandal than others but if you put 'Gregg Wallace' into their search engine those results go on for pages and pages. It's ridiculous.The Times said juries had heard details of 'absolutely shocking offending', in which victims were treated as 'defenceless commodities to be abused and traded at whim'. Detective Chief Inspector Oliver Coates of West Yorkshire police, said the men had committed 'appalling sexual abuse on a scale which can barely be believed'. We should ask ourselves why this abuse could barely be believed. Because the media and some police officers (not necessarily this one) turned a blind eye to such abuse for decades. Nothing was permitted to challenge the sacred belief that Diversity is our Strength or Immigration Built Britain. That's why you hardly ever get a mugshot of Malik Quadeer, 67, who was found guilty of five counts of rape and jailed for 22 years, or Shahzad Nowaz, 45, who was found guilty of rape and making threats to kill and sentenced to 11 years, on the front page. It is much easier to slap Gregg Wallace on there for making 'inappropriate comments'.There we have it: some issues deserve the lectern treatment (Far Right Thuggery), and some issues don't (rape of thousands of girls in towns mainly in the north of England). Some victims count (middle-class women of a certain age who work in the media), and some victims don't (white working-class girls in Rotherham). The disgustingly disproportionate media focus on the alleged wrongdoing of Gregg Wallace, compared with the confirmed and brutal criminality of, say, Shahzad Nowaz of Halifax, tells us yet again how the mainstream media operate, namely in a ruthless and immoral fashion always designed to protect the Big Lie, that there are no downsides to mass immigration. The girls of Rotherham and Oxford would beg to differ.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-report-the-mass-rape-of-white-schoolgirls-when-you-can-pick-on-gregg-wallace/
"Debunked – the great Diversity, Equity and Inclusion myth","MOST thinking people come to realise that positive discrimination doesn't work. As a twenty-something idealist I was much impressed by President Lyndon Johnson's Project Headstart educational programme which began with the earliest years of 'deprived' children's lives. Twenty years later,when I looked up the research againI found most of the programme's advantages had been wiped out by age 11 and virtually all by 20. It was a complete waste of time and money. It certainly had little chance of compensating for a dramatic culture shift towards fatherlessness, particularly amongst blacks, from the 1960s onwards. (By 1988 60 per cent of black children were born to unmarried mothers compared with just 33 per cent in 1960.) Louise Casey's ('services'-based) interventions worked no better here. But the problem with socialist thinking is that when one intervention doesn't work they think they need more. When that doesn't work they take it as evidence of deep 'structural' or internalised discrimination that can only be 'made up for' by quotas. So they give up on educational standards and instead simply select and promote on identity characteristics. That is where we are at. Today ensuring full diversity, equality and inclusion is the top goal of education, the judiciary, banks and business. Forget profit or efficiency. The NHS is but one example where DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) trumps its prior (or what should be its prior) purpose, patient care. Lazy people will still think DEI policies mean well and therefore at least must be a good thing for a decent, fairer, kinder society and happier people in general. Well no, not even that. Dr Colin Wright, an evolutionary biology PhD and Manhattan Institute Fellow and the CEO/Editor-in-Chief ofReality's Last Stand, has blown a hole through this final myth too. 'In a stunning series of events,' hereports in his latest substack, 'two leading media organisations – theNew York Timesand Bloomberg – abruptly shelved their coverage of agroundbreaking studythat raises serious concerns about the psychological impacts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) pedagogy.' In the unreported studies, 'Through carefully controlled experiments, the researchers demonstrated that exposure to anti-oppressive (i.e. anti-racist) rhetoric – common in many DEI initiatives – consistently amplified perceptions of bias where none existed. Participants were more likely to see prejudice in neutral scenarios and to support punitive actions against imagined offenders.' These effects were not marginal: 'Hostility and punitive tendencies increased by double-digit percentages across multiple measures (and) perhaps most troubling, the study revealed a chilling convergence with authoritarian attitudes, suggesting that such training is fostering not empathy, but coercion and control.' Thestudy, conducted by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) in collaboration with Rutgers University, found that 'certain DEI practices could induce hostility, increase authoritarian tendencies, and foster agreement with extreme rhetoric'. Given the billions of dollars invested annually in such initiatives, Wright argues that 'the public has a right to know if such programs – heralded as effective moral solutions to bigotry and hate – might instead be fueling the very problems they claim to solve'. The implications of these findings cannot be downplayed, he argues: 'DEI programs have become a fixture in workplaces, schools, and universities across the United States, with a 2023 Pew Research Centerreportindicating that more than half of US workers have attended some form of DEI training. Institutions collectively spend approximately$8billionannually on these initiatives, yet the NCRI study underscores how little scrutiny they receive. While proponents of DEI argue that these programs are essential to achieving equity and dismantling systemic oppression, the NCRI's data suggests that such efforts may actually be deepening divisions and cultivating hostility.' We have exactly the same problem here in the UK with programmes which are equally divisive and politically motivated but can be counterproductive –all paid for by us. An estimate based onFreedom of Information requests to 6,000 public authorities cites the existence of approximately 10,000 public DEI jobs at a cost of £557million a year to the UK taxpayer. Why would we be paying that money to make people more resentful and more likely to bully?

"Marvel at Trump's resurgent America, weep for Starmer's desolate Britain","WE are about to witness a unique political experiment. We have two English-speaking countries which have just held elections and now both are about to implement completely opposing sets of policies. We'll be able to see which of these two countries has the right policies for the wellbeing of its citizens and which is driving its citizens into a dystopian hell of impoverishment, political oppression and unstoppable decline. OK, not much suspense there. I imagine you all know the answer. But let's still take a moment to compare the political decisions of the US and UK. Here a few of the key policy areas: Climate change Energy Immigration Taxation and public spending Free speech Health These are just a few of the main differences between Trump's America and Starmer's Britain which I can quickly think of. No doubt there will be many others I haven't mentioned. But perhaps the greatest tragedy is that, due to the Labour Party's oft-expressed loathing for Trump, Starmer will work to alienate Trump's revived and successful America, giving him an excuse to take Britain closer to the failing, over-regulated, high-energy-cost, free-speech-suppressing European Union.

"Exit June Raine, pursued by bare-faced lies","DR JUNE Raine, the career drug safety expert who has headed the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the last fiveyears, is stepping down. She's led a regulatory revolution which has, she proudly says, turned the agency from a watchdog into an enabler. There's no news yet on what she's doing next: perhaps a pharma sinecure awaits as a reward. So long, Dame June. You won't be missed. You've been a disaster. Your legacy is the still unfolding calamity of the mRNA gene therapies that masquerade as vaccines. When the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA 'medical countermeasure' was authorised on December 2, 2020, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following closely behind, you shamelessly told the public 'Your safety comes first'. Tell that to the families of Lisa Shaw, Dr Stephen Wright or the 75 others whose death certificates officially state the covid vaccines caused their deaths. All-cause excess death figures have risen since the covid vaccine roll out suggesting the real death toll due to these gene-therapy vaccines' unknown long-term effects is much higher. In an unfortunate oversight, the announcement of the MHRA's authorisation for use of the Pfizer/BioNTech product was made on the 59thanniversary of thewithdrawal from the UK market of thalidomide by its UK distributors. Thalidomide's history as the very first landmark drug safety event was well known to you, Dame June. Prescribed under the brand name Distaval for morning sickness and, oh the irony, to treat pneumonia and flu, it was tested in animals but not in humans before being placed on the market. It was advertised saying 'Distaval can be given completely safely to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child'. Five years and 10,000 babies later, 2,000 of whom were born in the UK, everyone could see from the catastrophic birth defects this wasn't true. Dr Frances Kelsey of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)saved Americans from the thalidomide disaster. Kelsey repeatedly asked for more safety data when 60 days was the norm for drugs to be authorised for use. The MHRA's slogan is 'putting patients first' which on your watch was interpreted to mean speeding up the time it takes to review marketing applications so that drugs reach patients faster. You, Dame June, are no Frances Kelsey. Dame Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, lavished praise on you at a2022 Medics Day event at Somerville, your old Oxford College, saying: 'The reason why the UK was the first to approve the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is because of June and the way she led the regulatory body here in the UK in a way that has never been led in any regulatory body anywhere in the world. And that is a phenomenal achievement.' You proudly expanded, saying: 'We tore up the rule book and we allowed [covid vaccine] companies to immediately start overlapping trials and large-scale manufacture being prepared at risk. We did not know if any would be effective . . . But you can see the layers of parallel working that went on. That can never be turned back now.' Safety surveillance wasn't an afterthought. The MHRA was planning for it even before the Phase 3 trials were under way. 'We began in the middle of June – six months ahead of time – 2020, to start to prepare what safety surveillance we would need,' said Raine. 'Kate [Bingham] at that point had thought that once the purchase had been made, the approval had been signed, ""home and dry"" and what I was able to share with you [Kate] was we only really learn about benefit-risk in clinical use and we knew that there would be a vast influx of reports of side effects. No effective medicine or vaccine is without them.' The inversion of benefit-risk was no slip of the tongue. The MHRA, our most Orwellian of government agencies, acts as a 'pro-innovation' industry enabler which in practice means the risks of rapidly assessed medicinal products or the new 'platforms' such as mRNA falls entirely on patients while the benefits accrue disproportionately to pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders as revenues and profits. It is apparent now that launching the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) pandemic prevention mRNA countermeasure platform was the singular objective of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. At the very first meeting of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)to discuss Covid-19 vaccines on May 7, 2020, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the Department of Health Deputy Chief Medical Officer, told members that 'a vaccine was of paramount importance'. The next minute he helpfully told them there was the potential for RNA vaccine manufacture to provide a million doses in a single batch. At that juncture, Moderna and BioNTech combined and over the course of a decade, had injected a thousand or so trial volunteers with their mRNA products. All of BioNTech's pre-2020 trial volunteers were cancer patients which inherently limits the availability of long-term safety data. Nonetheless the scale-up potential was tremendous even for an infectious disease such as Covid-19 which Public Health England downgraded from a 'high consequence infectious disease' on March 19, 2020, two days before Boris Johnson ordered the first national lockdown after Dominic Cummings and his Red Teampushed the panic button. Those same JCVI minutes state that the MHRA would 'help manage any concerns about vaccine safety'. It has certainly done that. The UK public were told that 'no corners have been cut whatsoever' in its authorisation of BNT162b2, which they were reassured had been tested in more than 40,000 people. What they weren't told by the MHRA was that to manufacture a million doses in a single batch, the manufacturing process was changed and although the upscale product was injected into a token sample of volunteers, the MHRA never saw any of the data. A planned cross-over safety study wasn't due to be published until February 2021 but was never done and as none of the data from volunteers dosed with Process 2 product was available on November 14, 2020, the data cut-off date for the final analysis, it was simply left out. The MHRA made its authorisation decision based on data for a similar product tested in the trial, but had no insight into the actual product which it authorised on a comparability basis, meaning it permitted the use of a product untested in humans in any meaningful way. To produce a million doses a batch, genetically modified E-coli bacteria are used to produce the RNA by fermentation. It introduces another safety problem, a dirty little secret. E-coli also produces endotoxin, which is more dangerous than sarin gas. Itkills around 950,000 people a year globally, often making the news in the United States where there are alarmingly frequent recalls of hamburger meat due to E-coli contamination,including a major one on November 21, 2024. InJuly 2021 the MHRA hired Dr Alison Cave as its Chief Safety Officer. Biochemist Dr Geoff Pain, who is foremost in warning about the endotoxin-linked harms of mRNA vaccines,points out that Dr Cave has significant expertise in endotoxin-induced myocarditis. This is the known 'rare' safety concern the MHRA is managing but it's not the only one. In 2022, possibly prompted by Dr Cave, the MHRA decided that the 549,357 Yellow Card reports on covid vaccines were skewing the 'disproportionality' statistical analysis it uses to detect safety signals.A report was made to the Commission on Human Medicinesabout this decision which retired Ministry of Defence safety expert Nick Huntobtained after a protracted battle with the Information Commissioner's Office. The nine-page report contained three redactions – the name and email address of the assessor and a single digit on a table of outlier safety signals. The redacted number was for 'necrotic lymphadenopathy' reports relating to Tozinameran, which is the name of the mRNA active substance in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It can be caused by endotoxin and is a cancer-linked safety-signal. Endotoxin (also referred to as lipopolysaccharide or LPS) has long been known to act as an adjuvant, leading Dr Pain and others to question whether its presence in both the BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines is intentional. TheJCVI Covid-19 sub-committee minutes for November 30, 2020end with the committee asking the question whether lymphadenopathy is an mRNA-associated event. In December 2020, the World Health Organization Sage committeereporton the Pfizer/BioNTech covid vaccine, listed lymphadenopathy as a potential adverse event of special interest as some clinical trial participants dosed with the Process 1 version had ongoing lymphadenopathy. When the booster trial results were published in 2021 there was a 13-fold increase in lymphadenopathy incidence (0.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent) between the original trial of Process 1 product and the booster trial in which volunteers were dosed with the Process 2 upscale product. The MHRA said it was a cumulative effect caused by the third dose while ignoring the issue of the product switch. It also ignored the real-world evidence in the Yellow Card data base that confirmed the lymphadenopathy problem and which Dr Raine told her Somerville audience was the only way benefit-risk could truly be assessed. In days to come, your name, June Raine, will inextricably be linked with mRNA as Frances Kelsey's is with thalidomide. History records Kelsey as a heroine. It won't be so kind to you. May you live out your days in ignominy.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-06T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/exit-june-raine-pursued-by-bare-faced-lies/
"From 1991, a prescient warning about the globalist agenda","AS A student of International Relations in the early 1970s I had no idea of the depths of my ignorance. The motto of myalma mater, the London School of Economics, is 'rerum cognoscere causas', an abbreviation of Virgil's phrase 'Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas',meaning'Fortunate, who was able to know the causes of things', or as Dryden interpreted it in his study of Virgil, 'Happy the Man who, studying Nature's Laws, Thro' known Effects can trace the secret Cause.' I was ignorant and unhappy because I could not 'trace the secret cause'. Recent events and the ocean of information now freely available have given me a greater understanding of the reasons for the growing dystopia. A significant source has been John Coleman's book,The Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300. Coleman's research, published in November 1991, led him to believe that a small number of powerful individuals are acting through various agencies to implement their goals to consolidate their power and wealth. The culprits he exposed are mostly familiar: the United Nations, the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, the Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tavistock Institute, Starmer's Trilateral Commission, Lammy's Bilderberg Group, Freemasons, Bolsheviks, and other messianic, eugenicist people and organisations to which we can add theKissinger/Schwab atrocity, the World Economic Forum. Coleman included the following amongst the goals of the conspirators. Many of them have been successful whilst others have morphed and been moulded by circumstance. 'A New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their control.' 'The utter destruction of national identity and national pride.' 'The destruction of religion and more, especially the Christian religion.' As promoted by Justin Welby and Jorge Mario Bergoglio. 'The control of every individual through means of mind control.' International media is controlled by only five or six corporations. The CIA and British intelligence agencies have a long history of news manipulation. 'Legalisation of drugs and pornography.' The proliferation of porn sites on the internet has accompanied the legalisation of various dangerous drugs in the US and elsewhere. 'Limited wars in the advanced countries [to cause] the deaths of 3billion people.' Coleman added that 'some of the more important members of the Committee of 300 are also members of Nato'. 'To introduce new cults.' Coleman wrote that the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and others were constructs of the Tavistock Instituteof Human Relations. In his bookWeird Scenes inside the Canyon,David McGowan describes similar initiatives by the US government to manipulate the youth. The latest incarnation of this cultism is Taylor Swift mania. 'The population of the United States to be reduced by 100million by the year 2050.' As abortions are encouraged at increasingly late stages and death pods await the infirm and depressed, theLancetdeclares that'by 2050, over three-quarters (155 of 204) of countries will not have high enough fertility rates to sustain population size over time; this will increase to 97 per cent of countries (198 of 204) by 2100'. 'To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another.' Aids, Financial Crisis, Covid-19, Ukraine, Middle East, Mass Immigration, Disease X . . . 'To give the fullest support to supra-national organisations such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.' The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all UN member states in 2015 provides an excuse for their totalitarian ambitions. 'Penetrate and subvert all governments.' As we wait, more in hope than expectation, that Donald Trump will reveal the full Wexner/Epstein story, it is likely that many have been compromised elsewhere such as at Yale's Skull and Bones Society, the Bohemian Grove meetings, the Sean Combs parties, the Franklin Scandal, etc, etc. 'Take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of completely destroying it.' Donald Trump has promised to dismantle the Department of Education believing that for the past 45 years it has been 'indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial sexual and political material'. Romans 8:25-27 tells us that 'it is plain to anyone with eyes to see that at the present time all created life groans in a sort of universal travail.' In considering Sir Keir Starmer's recent meetings with both BlackRock and Gates it is also plain to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear that the conspirators are emboldened and keen to flaunt their control. While we can hope that the change of the guard in the White House will confound the knavish tricks of the conspirators, Coleman also warns: 'Any strong leader who suddenly appears to rescue the nation must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.'",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/from-1991-a-prescient-warning-about-the-globalist-agenda/
"Beware, Sir Keir, this petition is the tip of the iceberg","TCW readers will be aware of the petition on the UK Government and Parliament website calling for another general election. Some will have been amused and many may have signed it as a protest statement or as therapy. At 6pm last evening, the petition had attracted 2,973,970 signatures and by the time Parliament debates it on January 6 – appropriately enough the Feast of the Epiphany – the odds are that the tally will have exceeded 3million and be heading inexorably towards the next milestone (on which topic more below). It's truly amazing how many horrors the Starmer administration has managed to spawn in less than half a year. One of the earliest was the revival of a high-ranking position which has had no incumbent since the early fourteenth century. After the post had been vacant for hundreds of years it was a surprise to see Lord Alli take up the mantle of Keeper of the Wardrobe. This fount of unsolicited generosity not only ensured that the Prime Minister was bespectacled and bedizened as befits a world leader, but the Keeper's largesse provided bountifully for Lady Starmer and much of the new Front Bench as well. It's not the money involved here that matters so much. It's the sense that for the anointed there can be nothing wrong in accepting free gear costing thousands of pounds that leaves voters with the sense that these people wouldn't recognise their own venality unless it grew horns and stared back at them from their mirror. The objective here is not to draw up a ledger of the missteps and wrongdoings of this ill-starred administration because it has already run out of steam and the chickens will soon come home to roost. For instance, what will Bridget Phillipson's imposition of VAT on private school fees do other than harm children and schools in both state and private education? Even the progressive Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) reckons that the net revenue raised will be trivial when allowing for the extra funding needed in the state sector to accommodate the influx of formerly privately educated children. What's the point of this other than pure spite? What will be the overall devastation wreaked upon the British economy by quondam (until rumbled) economist Rachel Reeves? The wealthy are leaving the country, businesses are battening down the hatches and wages and employment opportunities are contracting sharply. The unspoken guiding principle in both cases is that the public sector should be rewarded with pay rises while the private sector is punished, plucked and bullied. Whenever, as now, Sir Keir Starmer senses that his reputation needs burnishing he issues a fresh set of policy statements, targets and roadmaps designed to give an impression that as he wallows about in a mess of his own creation his focus is firmly fixed on the business of government and the sunny uplands that somehow await. Credit is due to the team atGuido Fawkeswho produced a diagramlast week showing how the wooden slogans of Starmer-speak succeed one another in cascades of vacuity. The mish-mash of three foundations, five missions, six first steps, six milestones and seven pillars were never meant to be taken seriously. Neither are they even aspirational. These are the kinds of things that an idealistic sixth-former might mock up on a whiteboard with no thought to the practicalities of implementation. But one current milestone is interesting and it's not one of Keir Starmer's. It's the one of the 'Call a General Election' petition nearing the three million mark. Clearly the petition could have no practical effect but its message should have given the government pause for thought. Elected with a huge majority not on the basis of a popular prospectus but to punish the Tories for 14 years of stasis and broken promises, Labour might have begun its period in government cautiously and with some humility in order to work towards consent if not consensus. But no: such promises as were made in the run-up to July's election have been trashed and other policies such as the abolition of the winter fuel allowance for many pensioners came out of nowhere. Moreover thegovernment's response to the petitionposted on December 6 is far from conciliatory and more than anything expresses annoyance at the presumption of the troublesome signatories. The language is predictably wooden with three mentions of 'foundations' in the first three paragraphs. The petulant tone is accompanied by clumsy inclusivity language as in 'The Prime Minister can call a general election at a time of their choosing'. The Deputy Prime Minister was interviewed by Trevor Phillips on Sunday television, arguing simultaneously that many more affordable houses were needed for 'working people' but that there was already an abundance of housing available for immigrants. Is Angela Rayner making up policy on the hoof? Airbnb renters beware! There's only so much of this kind of thing that people will take before their dissatisfaction finds forms of expression and at a scale that are less easily ignored than a petition.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:16:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/beware-sir-keir-beware-this-petition-is-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/
The BlackRock connection and a nightmare for farmers,"THE current intriguing question is what could the US multinational investment behemoth BlackRock ('BRK') possibly have in common with a left-wing British elected government? Founded in 1988, BRK, with assets in excess of $11.5trillion, is active in enterprise risk management, a fixed-income institutional asset manager which has frequently been heavily censured for supporting extraction of fossil fuels, the international arms trade and a slew of human rights abuses. According toThe Canary last month:'Just days ago, climate groups Friends of the Earth US and Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) submitted a complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Their complaint alleges that BlackRock have been directly contributing to environmental and human rights abuses around the world through its investments in agribusiness. 'The complaint lays out how BlackRock has invested in companies that are destroying rainforests, and with them eradicating sorely needed biodiversity. The asset management company are also accused of human rights abuses in what Friends of the Earth call ""an epidemic of violence"".' Why, we would have to wonder, should such an amoral capitalist adventurer be welcomed so gushingly into the very heart of Downing Street? 'I'm determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people's pockets,' thePrime Minister wrote on November 21.'This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalise on the UK's position as a world leading hub for investment.' This, apparently, is nothing new. Ethan Stone ofopenDemocracy wrote:'On 21 November in Downing Street, senior executives from BlackRock, one of the world's most controversial companies, sat down opposite Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. The government's laser-focus on private investment as the key means of driving economic growth has inevitably led to a reliance on the world's big money machines, like BlackRock.'What price socialism? St Jeremy the Unlamented of Islington would surely disapprove.This is a relationship that Labour developed in opposition and which has become even cosier since the party entered government, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink making a star turn at Labour's investment summit last month and posing for pictures with the PM when Starmer visited New York in September. Senior BlackRock figures were there, too, when No 10 held a summer reception for business leaders. Should we be worried? Yes. We should be very worried indeed.With their most recent Budget, Labour have raised a chorus of anger and alarm from the farming community. They have proposed that from April 2026, inheritance tax (IHT) relief for business and agricultural assets will be capped at £1million, a new reduced rate of 20 per cent being charged above that (rather than the standard 40 per cent rate). Tax due can be paid by interest-free annual instalments spread over ten years. Now, what might this have to do with BRK? According toDaniel Priestley of Dent Global who tweeted on November 22, possibly quite a lot. Watch out British Farmers, This is how@Keir_Starmer's new best buddies at BlackRock are going to screw you over in 7 steps ...1. They will start buying up small plots of agricultural land at double the normal price. They will issue a directive to all of their energy... While it must be said this is wholly speculative, the idea alone should send shivers not just down farmers' spines but every one of us. At the outset BRK will unobtrusively begin scooping up parcels of farming land but paying way above the odds. In concert, they'll direct all their energy companies to secure land for carbon capture. Their cohorts will appear to bid against each other thus pushing the cost of land up to levels no farmer, needing a return on investment, can hope to compete with. For some sellers this must seem like a welcome boom. It's not.A net effect will be to push agricultural land values to new and wholly false levels. So, when a farmer dies and his estate is assessed for IHT, the asset will suddenly, in HMRC terms, be worth far more than before. The heirs will have no viable means of paying the tax: 'In swoops a BlackRock subsidiary with a ""Agri Debt Finance Tax Relief"" product to lend them 20 per cent of the ""value"" of their farm so they can pay the taxes'.No free lunches here. Any borrowing will come loaded with restrictive terms, say that the farm shall henceforth be run in a particular way, that the new farmer will be tied into BRK products, plant, software etc, a set of conditions that steer the target farm towards an 'interface with the larger conglomerate'. So, tomorrow's UK kulaks will be forcibly collectivised. Not by Uncle Joe and his Chekists but by their capitalist equivalent. Ask any Ukrainian how that process played out.Many farms will fail. No worries, BRK or its stooges will already have a contractual right to buy up the assets that precludes sale by auction. Now this may be tricky as the farmer's clearers probably have first call and the preferred creditors will have to be dealt with. But, hey, even if BRK has to buy at auction, they'll still be getting a bargain. Economies of scale will facilitate increasing profitability. Priestley suggests, perhaps a step too far, that government could arrange with BRK to utilise illegal immigrants as farm labour.Too Orwellian perhaps?

Syria's Islamist coup could destroy one of the world's oldest Christian communities,"ISLAMIST rebels have taken Damascus and the regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen. The world rejoices and there are street celebrations by exiled Syrians in the major cities of the West. Politicians includingSir Keir Starmerwelcome the fall of Assad's 'barbaric regime' as a 'very good thing for the Syrian people'. And the Christians of Syria flee. Since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, 90 per cent of Christians have abandoned Aleppo, the country's second largest city. Will the remaining 10 per cent remain to welcome their jihadi 'liberators'? What centuries of Islamic oppression was unable to do, the civil war managed and the overthrow of the Assad regime will probably complete: the destruction of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. It was on the road to Damascus that Saul, the persecutor of Christians, met the risen Christ and became Paul, the greatest of missionaries and theologians who wrote much of the New Testament. It was in the then Syrian city of Antioch (present day Antakya, in Turkey) that followers of The Way were first called Christians. Syria produced many of the saints and fathers of the early church such as Ephrem the Syrian and Eusebius of Caesarea. Two thousand years of Christianity in Syria may soon be coming to an end. TheCatholic Archbishop of Aleppohas described this as the end of Christianity's presence in the city. 'We are really tired,' he said. 'We are really exhausted, and we are also finished, in every sense.' Speaking of the armed groups who have taken over he said, 'The Christians of Aleppo will be convinced that they cannot stay. That it is over for them. In Aleppo they are trying to bring about the end of the rich, magnificent and unique history of the Christians of Aleppo.' Christians suffered just as much under Assad's rule as the other citizens of Syria and had no affection for the president. They aligned themselves with the regime not through choice but out of necessity, to save themselves from being slaughtered by the radical Muslim jihadis. Now that the jihadis are in control of the country the Christians of Syria are in a perilous situation. Speaking of the 'rebels' who have overthrown Assad, the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II said, 'So, let there be no doubt: they are anti-Christian. They call us infidels. Many believe that it's their duty to slaughter us in order to offer a sacrifice to their god.' As the jihadis advanced through the country, many Christians fled the villages and cities in their path. They sought refuge in the formerly government-controlled 'Valley of Christians' or Wadi al-Nasara. The community in the Valley responded by opening their homes, churches and community halls to offer shelter and support to the displaced. Now that the Valley has fallen under jihadi control following the collapse of the Assad government, the lives of the Christians there are in jeopardy. The mainstream media refers to the jihadis as 'moderate rebels' when they are neither moderate nor rebels. These militants want a theocratic country ruled by sharia law. When the terrorist groupHay'at Tahrir al-Sham(Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant; HTS) launched their attack on the Aleppo Governorate in north-western Syria, theycapturedandkilleddozens of Syrian Army soldiers, and promised mass executions and beheadingsin front of TV cameras.Videosof jihadistsabductingKurdish women have surfaced on social media. While we can be glad that Assad has fallen, we should not forget HTS is a jihadist group with origins in Al Qaeda and ISIS, including the remnants of the group led by the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi, a Palestinian Jordanian known as the 'sheikh of the slaughterers'. These are no democracy-loving liberals: wherever they have had authority, they have inflicted abuse. We should be under no illusion that everything in Syria is going to be transformed for the good, that freedom of speech and action will be established. HTS aim to establish a theocracy. The situation if anything is going to be worse for all of Syria's citizens and especially for the minorities: Alawites, Kurds and Christians. Since the violent Muslim conquest of Syria in AD 634-638, generation after generation of Syria's Christians have been oppressed and despised by the Muslim majority. When Muslims treat Jews and Christians as equals they are being unfaithful to the teachings of their holy book. The Koran clearly teaches that Jews and Christians should have second-class status. A look across to Islamic North Africa and the Middle East would bear this out. It is difficult to find any instances in the Arab Islamic world of Christians living in harmony and peace under Islamic rule. Egypt has a large Christian population which existed long before the creation of Islam, yet the Coptic Christians live as second-class citizens in their own country. Still those who govern us continue to welcome into our countries the kind of people who have destroyed the Christian minorities in their own lands. Islamists can persecute, murder and drive out ancient Christian communities, and you won't hear a word from our tolerant Western governments. We should try to be respectful and compassionate, but not at the cost of naively closing our eyes to the realities faced by Christians in Muslim-dominated countries. It is possible for governments to show concern about the situation facing Christians in Muslim-dominated lands. Hungary has its ownstate secretary to assist persecuted Christians. The much-maligned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recently met Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II and pledged continued support for Christians in need. How will the UK government react to the plight of Syria's Christians? Will there be speeches from the front bench in their defence, will they be welcomed here and given accommodation and support as they try to rebuild their lives: or will they be ignored and left to the mercies of the jihadis? Given the Labour Party's reliance on the Muslim vote there is little doubt which stance the Starmer government will take.

Covid didn’t cause the surge in excess deaths — the 'pandemic' response did,"MOST excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic can be linked to biological stress brought on by coordinated and large-scale mandates and medical assaults — ranging from lockdowns to vaccination to denial of antibiotics and antivirals — according toa paperreleased Monday by excess mortality researcherDenis Rancourt PhD. The theory that the novel virus and its variants spread globally, causing cascading pandemics and massive numbers of related deaths, cannot account for the actual patterns of excess death worldwide during the 2020-2023covidperiod, Rancourt argues. That narrative has been used to justify permanent vaccination campaigns to repeatedly boost national immunity against new variants. However, it can't explain what caused 31millionglobal excess deathsduring the pandemic period according to Rancourt, a lead scientist for 20-plus years at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Instead, he argues excess deaths between 2020-2023 can largely be attributed to illnesses including certain types of bacterial pneumonia, also known asaspirationpneumonia, that were often misdiagnosed on death certificates as covid. He says such illnesses typically occur when biological stress affects the immune system making people more susceptible to infections that come from the microbes and parasites in their own bodies, a phenomenon more common among the elderly and immunocompromised. Rancourt concludes: 'Within the present state of knowledge, it is possible that the declared covid pandemic (2020-2023) was entirely caused by the coordinated and largescalemandates, measures, so-called responses, and medical assaults including testing, diagnostic bias, isolation, denial of treatment (especially antibiotics for pneumonia), mechanical ventilation, sedation, experimental and improper treatments, and vaccination.' If that is the case, Rancourt says, the medical establishment has 'vastly underestimated and largely disregarded' the impact of biological — including psychological — stress on health and mortality. Rancourt also suggests that this theory of stress-induced mortality could account for 'all pandemics within recorded history' because most have occurred amid major societal and environmental crises. The paper builds on extensive research into covidpandemic-related all-cause mortalityby Rancourt and his colleagues at the Canadian nonprofitCorrelation Research in the Public Interestover the last several years. It is published on the organisation's website. Rancourt and his colleagueshave argued that key characteristics of excess mortality during the pandemic period contradict the argument that the covid virus was responsible for that mortality. For example, excess mortality varied significantly from country to country, but didn't cross jurisdictional borders — so there wasn't evidence that a virus with consistent virulence was spreading from one place to another. Rancourt also noted that none of the excess mortality peaks preceded theWorld Health Organization's announcementon March 11, 2020, that covid was a global pandemic. Instead,excess mortality peaksfollowed vaccine and booster rollouts in many countries. Citing US data,Rancourt found strong evidencethat respiratory infections were the primary condition associated with excess all-cause mortality. However those deaths may have been designated on death certificates as covid, when the primary cause of death was actually something else, he wrote. For example, Rancourt and colleagues previously found that more than half of the deaths attributed to covid likely included co-occurring bacterial pneumonia. They concluded thatPCR testing schemesled to many bacterial pneumonia infections being misdiagnosed as covid during a time when key treatments such as antibiotics andivermectinwere withdrawn. Research shows that social and environmental stressors are a major determinant ofhealth, including death, according to Rancourt. Psychological stress and social isolation have particularly strong associations with respiratory infections and their severity, as does age. Rancourt toldThe Defenderthat the massive socio-economic disruptions associated with the pandemic subjected societies worldwide to major stressors. Recent studies on mice showed that even a single episode ofrestraint and immobilisation stresscould lead to severe immunosuppression, leaving them vulnerable to bacterial infections. The study suggested that confinement in humans could produce similar effects, Rancourt wrote. Disruptions included lockdowns, which increased social isolation, and deprived people of incomes and limited mobility. Fear-driven propaganda terrorised people, and those who resisted mainstream narratives about the virus andvaccinesexperienced aggression and marginalisation. Hospitals and medical providers imposed aggressive and experimental medical interventions on some people, including the systematic use ofventilators,experimental treatment protocolsandpalliative carefor those who were severely ill. Others were denied access to medications like ivermectin or antibiotics. Rancourt also pointed to temporal correlations betweenvaccine and booster rolloutsand increases in excess all-cause mortality in every country with sufficient data. It is highly unlikely that the vaccine-mortality associations are coincidental, he wrote. He toldThe Defenderthis spike could be due tovaccine toxicityitself. Or, he said, the vaccine rollouts could have corresponded with other aggressive medical or health interventions. Combining the covid vaccines withother vaccines, and the stress of coercive vaccination, could have weakened people's immune systems. It is also possible that multiple factors were at play, he said. Rancourt believes the most compelling explanation for most excess deaths — namely the surges in respiratory deaths often associated with the excess deaths — is that a combination of different social, political and medically induced stressors led to widespread aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia, which doesn't require person-to-person transmission, is a dominant cause of death among the elderly, particularly in care homes and hospitals. Treatment requires proper diagnosis and the administration of antibiotics. Risk factors include immunosuppression, and several pandemic-related factors, including denial of antibiotics, ventilation, overuse of sedatives and hypnotics, tube feeding, depression, and disruptions to the digestive system caused by interventions. If this is correct, Rancourt said, the primary cause of death contributing to spikes in all-cause mortality was 'covid-period mandates and measures' that made people susceptible to these illnesses.

A book to destroy faith in doctors for ever,"Worth A Shot? Secrets of the Clinical Trial Participant Who Inspired a Global Movement – Brianne Dressen's Storyby Caroline Pover* TALES of abuse are harrowing, but a hundred times worse when the perpetrators are governments. This book is brutally honest about our inadequate and ignorant medical profession, state-sponsored covid vaccine injury, suicide, despair and the fight for justice. Governments, social media and mainstream media committed terrible abuses with monumental efforts to keep those disabled and bereaved by covid vaccines apart. They needed support, and solutions for chronic conditions developed post vaccine such as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), transverse myelitis and post-vaccine neuropathy. Gaslit by the medical profession, victims such as pre-school teacher Brianne Dressen (AstraZeneca), retired gastroenterologist Dr Danice Hertz (Pfizer), dental hygienist Kristi Hobbs (also Pfizer), triathlete Candace Hayden (Moderna) and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Joel Wallskog (also Moderna), describe how they determined to expose those abuses. What they discovered destroyed their faith in doctors and drug regulatory agencies for ever. Without first-hand experience, none would have believed their government could disown them because 'doing the right thing' went wrong. As they unpeeled layers of the onion to work out why no one in authority would help, they found terrible conflicts of interest. For example, Dr Peter Marks, director of the Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for ensuring efficacy and safety of all pharmaceuticals, oversaw covid vaccine development and approval, monitored post-marketing safetyandpromoted the jabs to the public. To counteract vaccine hesitancy to the warp-speed experimental shots, in a Q&A webinar Marks co-opted NFL football stars to persuade fans and other players to get jabbed. Trainee psychotherapist Sheryl Reuttgers, who'd had a severe neurological reaction to the Moderna vaccine, joined the Zoom, typing in: 'What do you think about vaccine injuries?' and 'What about the NIH [US National Institutes of Health] studying vaccine harms?' Her questions were erased while Marks told young, able-bodied athletes that the worst reaction to expect was some mild myocarditis and a trip to the ER. 'But you'd recover with some Tylenol and rest,' he said. Injury affected whole families, not just the injured. Brianne was suicidal for six months post-injury and although she tried to keep a smile on her face, the effect on her children Hannah, six, and Cooper, eight, was clear. Hannah wrote little love notes that she pushed under the door to the bedroom she was supposed to stay out of. They said, 'I love my mommy!' or 'You are the BEST mommy in the whole world!' surrounded by hearts. Cooper became angry and afraid, refusing to go to school. He needed to know where his mother was at all times. Social media, not the medical profession, became a lifeline to the injured, especially those confined to bed and to one room 24/7 looking for support. It was where they shared information about treatments, experimenting with anything that might help. But it became a source of frustration when they were heavily shadow-banned by Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. When Mark Zuckerberg shut down all but one Facebook group sharing vaccine injury stories, there was a new suicide. The woman had been posting cries for help on her private page for months, growing angrier and angrier as algorithms dramatically reduced her visibility. It's no surprise thatWorth a Shotis dedicated to 'all those injured by the Covid vaccine, those we have lost because of it, and all who love them'. Meanwhile, governments still have these injurious jabs in their wellness schedules, and their hands over their ears. *Award-winning British author and entrepreneurCaroline Poveris chair of trustees forUKCVFamily, a charity set up to support the vaccine injured in England and Wales.

Staggering ignorance that scuppered sterling and the stock exchange,"IN THE Chancellor's recent Budget and her speech at the Mansion House she extolled the importance of economic growth. On this we agree. However, in my short time in Parliament I have come to realise that the economic ignorance, lack of suitability or any business experience of anyone in the Labour Party (and indeed most Tories) as well as a failure to grasp the basic demands of economic growth is ubiquitous. The current generation are staggeringly ill-informed. The Blairite years successfully obstructed any economic growth and progress with swathes of unnecessary legislation, sowing all manner of future minefields of obstruction, obfuscation and confusion that we and future generations are now floundering in. Blairite legislation has put the State in charge. No one has had the courage to challenge this self-serving status quo which is so deeply entrenched that it comfortably ignores changing elected governments. The current political incumbents are the children of this former era. They don't question because they don't know how, they don't have any references or experience of sensible economic behaviour. If the readily accepted personal bribes offered to senior party members are a guide, they don't understand right from wrong either, and simply ignore any criticism. If their behaviour is not questioned by the State, it must be acceptable. That other MPs and the electorate can simply be ignored is reminiscent of the relationship between Roman Emperors of the first century AD and the Praetorian Guard with the people. These students of socialism believe that spending money on the state is somehow 'investment'. As Elon Musk recently said, 'All government spending is taxation.' This is not to say that spending on infrastructure and essential services is not important and that local economies will not benefit from projects, but it must be seen for what it is: spending taxpayers' money. National economic growth must be driven by the private sector. GDP includes both the state and private sectors; the shrinking value of the private sector in the UK has not been subject to any real scrutiny for many years. Because the private sector has to contribute so much in taxation, we need metrics to gauge its robustness to do so. We should also be able to compare our private sector internationally. The capitalisation of the stock market is not comprehensive in terms of the value of business activity in the private sector, but major trends are a useful gauge of its health. Our private sector and our currency exchange rates better illustrate the scale of the UK's demise. The UK entry level capital market is the AIM with a capitalisation of roughly $50billion. In the US the NASDAQ is over $20trillion. In 2023 the UK market capitalisation was roughly $2.8trillion, the US market was about $100trillion. These numbers are rough, but they illustrate how far behind the UK private sector lags. Apple's valuation is greater than the entire FTSE 100. This differential was nowhere near as marked in the 1990s as it is now, so why has this gulf opened? State regulation has succeeded in asphyxiating our capital market; it has destroyed confidence with the imposition of ever-evolving obstruction iterations of regulated firms, entrepreneurs and investors with red tape under their wide-ranging and conveniently loose interpretations of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and its EU cousin MIFID I and II before Brexit. EU regulation has persistently endeavoured to obstruct equity markets because capital in Europe is delivered mainly and traditionally by bank lending, not by flotation on stock markets such as the London Stock Exchange. This matters in the UK because firms quoted on the LSE generate wealth and employment, pay pensions and make tax contributions. In short, they grow the economy. Anglo-Saxon markets such as London and New York are traditionally stock markets that provide major capital funding to larger quoted corporate constituents. Our government has utterly destroyed our competitive position partly because we have allowed our main capital market funding tradition to be crippled by FSMA and EU regulation, and no one says a word – perhaps because they don't understand? In 2007 the USD/GBP exchange rate was nearer 2. It reflects what the market thinks of the UK. At the time of the recent election, it was 1.30 and this week it was 1.26. Oil is priced in USD and we have to have it. As debt dramatically increases post Budget and economic mismanagement continues, expect it to fall further to a point where alarm bells ring, No 10 will be on the phone to the independent Bank of England and UK interest rates will have to rise to avoid importing inflation and catastrophe. The new US administration will strengthen the USD further to the point where they will want to weaken their currency to make it competitive so they will cut interest rates which will make the US economy even stronger. Expect USD/GBP parity during this Parliament. You may have noticed that Norwich City, the nearest big football club to my Great Yarmouth constituency, like other clubs is now majority-owned by Americans. In the case of Norwich City they want to get the club back into the Premier League in the next five years. The club is a cheap way to get access to one of our remaining (but increasingly rare) successful global brands, the Premier League. It attracts hundreds of millions of viewers, particularly in Asia, and is a source of immense soft power. Let's hope the Canaries make it before the Government's proposed regulation destroys another British success as it has our financial markets. Be in no doubt we are in serious trouble, so at the Mansion House last month the supposedly independent non-political Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey surprisingly announced that we should build bridges with the EU to promote economic growth, no doubt just before it is hit with US trade tariffs. He also said that the US 'has a better story to tell', almost as though they are out of our league. The Chancellor, who, judging by the Budget, hasn't a clue about the real muddle the country is in, feebly announced changes to the Financial Conduct Authority's senior management regime and an investigation into promoting growth with the regulators in the spring. The FCA will no doubt engage full self-serving mode and run rings round her. The only way that our financial markets can get back on their feet for future generations is the repeal of FSMA 2000 and abolition of the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), neither of which has made any meaningful contribution to the UK economy. Regulation, or more likely just the law, is needed to ensure market participants act as principal or agent, identify clients and counterparties and identify and manage conflicts of interest. If this country does not wake up and start working properly and responsibly, Reform's majority that will take power in 2029 will be dealing with the IMF as well as with the delivery of its Great Repeal Bill.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-04T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/staggering-ignorance-that-scuppered-sterling-and-the-stock-exchange/
Oxbridge and the cancellation of kindness,"A WEEK or so agoI wrote a piece discussing the tragic suicide of Oxford student Alexander Rogers in January. I wrote: 'Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn't happy about. As pertheTimes,""She had expressed 'discomfort' about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the 'allegations'. They told him they believed he had 'messed up', that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later. 'Rogers had appeared ""distraught after this conversation"". He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation . . . 'The coroner looking into Alexander's death explained how the isolation at the college worked. ""The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] 'pile-on' might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual. 'In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a ""pile-on"" and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape.' TheTimeshas done a follow-up andspoken to some students who enjoyed that most coveted experience, an undergraduate degree at Oxbridge. Cambridge graduate Ceci Browning, 23, said, 'It is the paradox of my generation. We are supposedly the most tolerant and liberal, the most concerned with getting it right, and yet when one of our comrades slips up and falls out of step, they become the enemy. We cut friends and acquaintances from our lives on the basis of second-hand information about something deemed morally iffy that they may or may not have done, but we are also all perpetually afraid that precisely the same thing could happen to us.' She also said: 'The other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness. A policy of ""one strike and you're out"". Being a social justice warrior is no longer about being anti-government or anticapitalism, like the heralded student activism of the 20th century. Now, it's anti-exoneration. Prisoners – those committed for more minor crimes, anyway – eventually get released and rehabilitated. But if you're cancelled at university, you're cancelled for ever.' So, this is what middle-class parents bankrupt themselves for by sending their children to independent school (fees now have VAT) in the ultimate hope of getting into Oxbridge. In addition to enduring the inevitable hot-housing, the incredible pressure of navigating the Oxbridge entry system (interview, exam and A-levels) which will take a mental toll even on the best and brightest, your reward is: walking on eggshells for three or four years, living in the fear of being cancelled, or confirmed social ostracism. In fact the risk is so terrifying around sexual intimacy that the young men barely bother. 'We're quite scared of any sexual encounters with girls in case we get something wrong. Being honest, sex is quite hard to get right,' one studying at Glasgow told theTimes. 'And if you don't, it feels like the jeopardy is so high it's almost not worth the risk.' Look, I understand the attraction of an Oxbridge degree (stealth boast incoming). I did a master's at Darwin College, Cambridge, tutored for a term at Worcester College, Oxford, and worked and lived in Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. And sure, the architecture alone means that if you get to study at one of these colleges, you have won the lotto in life. For undergraduates the settings are 2/3 students to one tutor. Even in the best London universities a tutorial is about 10 to 15 students in a class (I did this also at UCL). You don't even get this at the Ivy League universities in the US. Yes, it is an amazing experience to study at Oxbridge. Or at least it should be, but with all this cancel culture you wonder if is it still worthwhile. It is probably true that there are similar brutal cancellations and unkindness at most elite UK universities, a veritable competition in cruelty, all in the name of kindness. Haven't the young people suffered enough? Didn't they have to go through lockdown, and will graduate with huge debts? And what is worse is that at the end of it all, they don't even have a chance to make true friends, to enjoy the loyal understanding of a mate should they make a mistake. I am not saying that a true friend must condone everything a wayward friend does. True charity requires that you tell your friend if they have done wrong, to themselves or to others. But that doesn't mean you just abandon them. That doesn't mean you just toss them aside into a desert of loneliness and encourage others to do the same. I find it truly frightening that young men and women could behave like this. It is far more terrifying than the risk of drink or drugs to your child. Those things can ruin your child's body; being cancelled, being placed firmly outside the circle, will destroy their soul. What I found most depressing in theTimesarticle was the observation by Ms Browning that 'the other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness'. Ah, such is the joy of the post-Christian age. What progress! Not for this generation the idea that 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone'. Sure, these students, the elite, could bang out a 2,000-word essay on the rule of law, but they'd struggle to explain why the father forgave his returning prodigal son. Most of these Oxbridge graduates will survive their university years and go on to become professionally successful. That's what having an Oxbridge degree gives you. We can only hope they learn about the importance of forgiveness, charity, loyalty and simple kindness as they move into public life, shaping policies we ourselves will have to live by.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-03T01:20:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/oxbridge-and-the-cancellation-of-kindness/
MSM silence as health coalition urges governments: Stop the jabs now,"ON MONDAY November 25 an international group of politicians, leading medical and other professionals, supported by Professor Francis Boyle, author of the US 'Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorist Act of 1989', wrote to the heads of state of ten European countries, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, calling for a suspension of modified mRNA vaccines citing serious health concerns. Ireland joined the call later in the week. The indefatigable retired paediatrician Ros Jones once more has been a leading light in organising it. As the newly formed North Group they sent the letter as a 'notice of extreme concern' regarding excessive levels of residual DNA identified in Australian vaccine samples that confirmed similar findings from France, Germany, Canada, and the USA. Their notice warned that the introduction of foreign DNA into cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) may damage human DNA leading to genomic instability, cancer and other extremely serious conditions. It also pointed out that: ● It was a lottery as to which batch a person received and the side effects – including death – they experienced. ● Vaccines were never tested for their ability to block transmission. Medical product regulators, as well as government agencies, misled the public when coercing them into accepting the products. ● Multiple independent analyses show that modified mRNA vaccines contain variable but alarmingly high levels of residual DNA. All these issues, the long list of international signatories agree, are grounds for extreme concern regarding risks to human health and potential for genetic damage that were never accounted for scientifically in the authorisation process of the novel mRNA vaccines. This is why they are calling for: ● An immediate halt to the use of modified mRNA vaccines. ● An independent and transparent investigation into their approval and use. ● Scientific evidence that shows that there is no risk of damage to human DNA. This initiative dovetails with one in Australia led byRussell Broadbent, the Federal Member for Monash, and is thanks to thegroundbreaking workof Dr Kevin McKernan.

UK supermarkets join Lurpak maker's trial of methane-reducing chemical in cows,"LAST WEEK the Danish-based dairy foods giant Arla announced a collaboration with three UK supermarkets, Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, to trial Bovaer, a feed additive, aiming to reduce methane emissions. The following is a transcript of the video commentary on the social media announcement: 'The latest innovation we're looking at is Bovaer. Bovaer is a feed additive developed by Dutch company DSM that allows farmers to reduce enteric methane emissions from our dairy herds. Enteric methane being what the cows produce during their natural digestive process. Today, we've been working with Arla and DSM as part of the Bovaer set-up process, learning about what's involved and how we can make the pilot as successful as possible. 'So the reason we are quite excited about Bovaer, it's not just some fairy dust that somebody thinks might make some improvements but it's been really rigorously and extensively tested. Trials like these are really important to help reduce our carbon footprint.' Arla Foods is a major player in the UK dairy market. It supplies milk to retailers and produces brands such as Lurpak, Anchor, Cravendale, Lactofree and Castello. Bovaer is a product owned by Netherlands-based DSM-Firmenich, a company whose work 'supports the development of a more sustainable global animal production industry' and is part of the fake-food and synthetic biology sector. It has been authorised for use in more than 50 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the US and EU countries. It was authorised in the UK in April this year. DSM'swebsitestates: 'Bovaer® contributes to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of beef and dairy products. Just a quarter teaspoon per cow per day reduces methane emissions from dairy cattle by 30 per cent and up to 45 per cent for beef cattle, on average.' According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock produce12 per centof global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Efforts to combat 'climate change' have long focused on livestock. In January 2023, Bill Gates's investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) led a $12million seed funding round intoRumin8, a rival Australian start-up focused on developing feed supplements to reduce methane emissions from livestock. Arla's announcement caused quite a stir on social media with many accounts calling for a boycott of their products. 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) is the active ingredient in Bovaer. Other ingredients include silicon dioxide and propylene glycol. 3-NOP inhibits the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase in the rumen (the first stomach compartment in ruminant animals), preventing the final step in methane production. It has been claimed that the additive has no side effects. However, while looking through some of the available reports, certain anomalies stand out. A letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter addressed to Elanco US, Inc, (which has an agreement with DSM-Firmenich to market Bovaer), states: 'Bovaer® 10 is an article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal, and thereforeit is a drug.However, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has considered whether it intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to certain requirements applicable to animal drugs for Bovaer® 10 – including requirements regarding new animal drug approval, pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practice, adverse event reporting, labeling, drug establishment registration and drug product listing.CVM has considered whether refraining from enforcement of these requirements at this time would be appropriate based on whether Bovaer® 10 poses a low risk to humans and animals and whether the data show that the product has the intended effect. Based on a review of your data and the characteristics of your product, FDA has no questions at this time regarding whether Bovaer® 10 will achieve its intended effect and is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals under the conditions of its intended use.' The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) seems to be sending mixed messages. Although Bovaer is officially classified as a drug, the CVM appears to have decided not to enforce certain drug regulations, including the obligation for adverse event reporting. This decision is based on the belief that Bovaer 'is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals'. Paradoxically, the letter includes an attachment with the following troubling statements. Turning to thesafety assessment reportfor Bovaer, prepared by the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS), which was reviewed by the Animal Feed and Feed Additives Joint Expert Group (AFFAJEG) and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF). According to ACAF: 'the additive can be considered safe for consumers' yet this conclusion is seemingly contradicted by the statement: 'The additive should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant and potentially harmful by inhalation.' Notably, the assessment states: 'In their first evaluation, members observed thatno analysis was performed on the final product to screen for dioxins and heavy metals.' This was followed by a request made by AFFAJEG for the applicant to provide an analysis of impurities in the final product. In the two tolerance studies presented in DSM's application in relation to safety for the target species: 'Study 1 used only 4 cows per group, which were given 0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg 3-NOP/kg feed DM for 90 days.The highest dose showed a reduced intake of feed and a reduced heart weight.' Study 2 was larger and used 20 cows per group 'which were given doses of 3-NOP of 0, 80, 100, or 200 mg/kg feed DM for 56 days'. At the highest dose (the 200 mg dose group), negative results were identified which included 'decreased ovary size, decreased serum activities of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and reduced feed and water intake.' The report went on: 'The decrease in ovarian size was not accompanied by histopathological change and it was concluded that it should not be considered an adverse effect of the study at the 200 mg/kg dose . . .The Group concluded that the additive could be considered safe at a dose of 200 mg/kg and that a margin of tolerance of 2 could be established.' In relation to safety studies for the consumer, a two-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats showed 'mesenchymal cell tumours were reported in 4 out of 49 femalesat the top dose of 300 mg/kg bw/day of 3-NOP given orally. Based on these results, theoriginal study report concluded there was evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats.' Curiously, this conclusion was changed after an independent group was brought in to 'reanalyse the study's slides'. This group concluded that 'mesenchymal cell tumours were present in 3 out of 49 femalesat the top dose group, which wasno longer statistically significantlydifferent from the control group'. The AFFAJEG concluded that at the higher dose levels (300 mg/kg/day in females), the additive has the potential to cause mesenchymal cell hyperplasia and benign tumours. However, due to the 'absence of malignant tumours and genotoxicity, it was concluded that the additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate and benign tumours occurred only above the NOAEL [the no observed adverse effect level, the greatest concentration or amount of a substance at which no detectable adverse effects occur in an exposed population]'. In the genotoxocity studies testing whether 3-NOP is toxic to genes, it was noted 'that positive results occurred in Chinese hamster V79 cells, with negative results in a study using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an equivocal result in a study using TK6 cells'. Positive results indicate that the substance tested has the potential to cause genetic damage. In a second study, the results were negative except for males dosed at the top dose and sacrificed at 24 hours, in which micronuclei were statistically significantly increasedcompared to the negative control. Alarmingly, the report went on to state: 'Based on the OECD guidance on establishing the biological relevance of a result in this assay, which is neither clearly positive nor clearly negative, AFFAJEG members recognised the requirement for external expert judgement. An external consultant, contracted by the applicant [DSM],concluded that the apparent increase in micronuclei may have been an artifact due to the Giemsa-based stain that was used, to which Group experts agreed. The Group concluded that 3-NOP is non-genotoxic in vivo."" This raises alarm bells considering it was an external consultant paid by the applicant (DSM) who attributed another cause for the increase in micronuclei – the stain used – not 3-NOP, the active ingredient in DSM's product Bovaer.

UPDATE 4.30pm: Marks & Spencer also use Bovaer TCWreader Hermien Dyer who wrote to Marks & Spencer received this reply: Dear Hermien DyerThank you for taking the time to contact Stuart Machin [the firm's CEO]. As a member of the Executive Team, I am responding on his behalf. We'd like to reassure you that health and welfare of our cows is our number one priority, so that we can offer our customers the highest welfare, highest quality milk on the market. The cows in our M&S Select Farm Milk Pool are cared for by farmers we know and trust to meet the highest animal welfare standards. The cows in our milk pool are pasture grazed and, in poor weather, they are fed a forage-based diet designed to meet their nutritional needs. Our British Select Farmers add Bovaer, a feed supplement made from corn fermentation derivatives and mineral salts, which prevents the digestive enzymes from forming methane and is naturally broken down in the cow's stomachs. There is absolutely no harm to the cow and no impact on the milk in any way. Bovaer has been extensively studied around the world and it's been proven that it's safe for cows, farmers and consumers. This initiative is one part of how we are taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions and become a net zero business by 2040. Thank you again for taking the time to write.

Still time to pull back from slippery suicide slope,"MPs have voted forKim Leadbeater's Assisted Dying Billon its second reading. Despite all the warnings from around the world, a majority voted for the Labour MP's private member's Bill to legalise what should more properly be called assisted suicide, but which would most likely have received much less support if it had not relied on cosy euphemisms for what is essentially the State helping dying people to kill themselves. Indeed, such proposals are so shrouded in fluffy phrases that many think 'assisted dying' means merely helping patients to have a more comfortable natural death. Most likely this explains why a majority of the public have appeared to support such a measure – although, tellingly, that majority tends to shrink as the manifold problems are highlighted in detailed discussion. But perhaps for this reason, when opponents raise the practical and ethical problems of this 'compassionate', 'autonomous', 'de-lifing' process – the danger of 'slippery slopes' – they are accused of'scaremongering'. However, that term might be more usefully directed at the practice of scaring vulnerable individuals into believing they will 'die in agony' if they do not have the choice that means the end of all choice. And in all this discussion there has been a strange, one might almost say eerie, silence about'ordinary' suicides, which are known to increase in number in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal. Indeed, despite the well-known fact that suggestion plays a significant role in suicide ideation, the constant talk about deliberate death being an answer to suffering may well move people who are not 'dying anyway', but are suicidally inclined, to take that final, fatal step.But we are meant to believe 'assisted dying' is not suicide, therefore instead of engaging in 'suicide prevention' we must engage in suicide promotion. As for 'slippery slopes',Ms Leadbeater's Bill itself resembles a slope growing more slippery by the day: while stressing its 'strict safeguards', she herself has hinted at its broader application – even acknowledging that being a 'burden' on others could be a legitimate reason for seeking 'assisted dying': 'I know I wouldn't want to be a burden to people, I can say that to you now in the clear light of day. But that's very different to people saying, I'm doing this because I feel like I'm being a burden.' As for 'safeguards',the ban on assisting suicide could be seen as the 'safeguard'that allowed Parliament to decriminalise suicide in 1961. It has taken a while, but finally, in 2024, we have 'come the long way round' to dismantling that particular safeguard – arguably the most important. And among all the reasons why the Leadbeater Bill is so risky is that noted byformer Chief Coroner Thomas Teague.Hesaysthe bill is unsafe for the very fact that it removes the statutory duty to investigate suicides. You do need even have to ponder that for 30 seconds to compute the implications. Unlike in other jurisdictions that legalised 'assisted dying' with out any evidence from other countries and now find themselves a long way down the slippery slope, our politicians have no excuse. Most seem to have decided to ignore the red flags from abroad, voting in favour of the Bill for ideological reasons instead of heeding the evil practical consequences and swerving at the last minute. This puts one in mind of lemmings, but in this case it will likely not be them who end up plunging over the cliff – rather it will be the weakest and most vulnerable in society. With the legal guardrails torn down, there will be no protection – nothing to defend them from the siren call of suicide. As Conservative MP Danny Kruger, previously chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well,concluded in his speech during the debate on the Second Reading: 'I'm talking about the people who lack agency: the people who know what it is to be excluded from power, to have decisions made for them by bigwigs in distant offices speaking a language they don't understand . . . Not the ones who write to us campaigning for a change in the law, but the people who come to our surgeries with their lives in tatters, or who the police and social workers tell us about, the people with complex needs. What are the safeguards for them? I will tell you. We are the safeguards. This place. This Parliament. You and me. We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm, and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.' It is highly appropriate that this Bill should have passed its second reading on 'Black Friday', but there is still time to raise our voices in warning against this disaster waiting to happen, while we still can command our voices – enabling our long island story to have a happy ending, rather than history recording that 'they all died unhappily ever after'.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-01T01:16:00+00:00,Features,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/still-time-to-pull-back-from-slippery-suicide-slope/
This sneaky assisted-suicide Bill strikes against decency and genuine choice,"'The Rubicon is a very small stream, but on the other side of it is a very different world, a worse world, with a very different idea of human value' –Danny Kruger MP. THE BILL to legalise state-assisted suicide has been passed at its second reading in the Commons by 330 votes to 275.The legislative momentum suggests that, subject to further scrutiny and amendment, the Bill will eventually become an Act of law. Parliamentary procedure is always glacial. We should take little comfort in this. The principle that life is sacred was itself euthanised on Friday, and that happened quickly enough. The Establishment patsy Kim Leadbeater introduced her Bill before morning coffee. It was voted through by afternoon tea.From her performance, which included a forced apology for misleading the House, you'd be forgiven for concluding she hadn't had time to read it. And yes, I'm going to call this 'assisted suicide'and not 'assisted dying'because I think it fair that those who are effecting this change should be held to account for it. If the harpy avatars of the latest statist death cult are 'offended' by my choiceof language, that's excellent. It is an obligation arising from charity to give offence to those who are keen to take it. You'd think they'd be careful with the rehearsed pearl-clutching, come to think of it. The sponsors of the Bill insist that the legal 'safeguards' are robust and crystal clear. This is not convincing when at the same time they presume to be able to change the meaning of words by fiat. A quick comment on those safeguards. Their ostensible purpose is to prevent the practical application of a subsequent Act from being expanded in scope beyond the clearly stated provisions of that Act. Their real function, of course, is to act as markers for the future attention of activist lawyers. The 'safeguards' are like a Mafia kiss: intended to hide malicious intent with insincere reassurance. The Bill which was voted through on Friday embeds not immutable protections so much as mechanisms of useful ambiguity. Useful, that is, for those who are greasing the slippery slope. What makes an illness terminal? Why limit the prognosis to six months? Why not eighteen? Who counts as a 'person of good standing'? Will the local traffic warden do? Etc. Parliamentary supporters of this legislation have a stated aim, one which sounds laudable. They wish to give back 'choice' to those people robbed of it by illness and circumstance. A person in great pain, and with no hope of remission from that pain, who has been failed by end-of-life care, or for whom palliative relief is ineffective, is owed by society this much at least: to be able to choose to die instead. That argument has an almost irresistible emotional force, and that is why as anargumentwe must be wary of it. It is so obvious to us that freedom is a good thing that we rarely ask what this axiomatically good thing is. Which is the better view of personal freedom: that it is just the 'right' to do as we wish? Or that it is more than this: that it is the ability to do what weought? It seems to me that those who think the state should have this role in terminating the life of a person need to answer two questions: 'what is the state?' and 'what is a person?' So far, they've failed to address either. We can assess the nature and role of the UK state by looking at how it discharged its duty of care during lockdown, when it showed its commitment to citizen autonomy by cancelling it and by mind-screwing us with prepared strategies of disguised coercion. In addition, it attempted to force us to undergo untested medical interventions which probably killed or maimed a significant number of those whose trust it so casually abused. And the Establishment view of the human person, as assumed by the ghastly midwit metaphysics of Kim Leadbeater, is that we are atomised calculating machines, who navigate the complexities of life in a sort of vacuum, insulated from the wider social consequences of the 'choices' it is our 'right' to make. Suffering is an unwanted but essential ingredient in a life worth living. That statement is obnoxious to the secular mind because that mind makes no room for the possibility of redemption through spiritual and physical pain. Yet it is a trivial truth to a mind which has been gifted the grace of faith. Where Leadbeateret alsee the suffering person as a burden, some of us see him as an opportunity for love. The philosopher Wittgenstein remarked that death is not an event in life, that we do not live to experience it. There are some things, he suggested, that are true but not statable. When we talk about the ethics of end-of-life care, we are operating at the very limits of what can be said. When you bring the state into that discussion you also grant admission to the cost-benefit fetishism that comprises the only language it understands. Its worldview is utilitarian, and utilitarianism is only capable of identifying and amplifying those features of a situation which are morally irrelevant. There used to be a way of doing these things, one which involved the tacit 'nod and a wink'. This was the way of kindness, responsive to the urgencies of the moment and in no need of the crude intrusions of state machinery. It was not perfect but to borrow from Danny Kruger's excellent reply to Leadbeater, it kept us onthisside of the Rubicon. A final point on those speeches. Diane Abbott was superb in articulating the point mentioned above: that not all coercion is obvious, and that state-enabled killing will exploit the unspoken but real anxieties of the most vulnerable. It was a ray of light on a very dark day.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-02T01:22:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-ghastly-assisted-suicide-bill-strikes-against-decency-and-genuine-choice/
COP29 reveals itself as the great fraud it always was,"WHATEVER perceptions have been conjured up in the past by the annual mega-junket that is the UN's Conference Of the Parties on climate change, there can be no doubt this year's COP29 descended into farce and ridicule. The puzzle is why it has taken so long for the vested interests who attend to begin to admit what it is – a massive stunt designed to fool the public into policies they would never otherwise support. The gathering of the world's climate politicians, zealots, hustlers and grifters in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan – of all places – has finally tipped some, like Al Gore, over the edge because it sought to avoid discussing oil and gas production while secretly discussing sponsorship opportunities from oil and gas producers. The cult of Net Zero has its own Wizard of Oz resident in Azerbaijan, and the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the fraud being played on those believing the charade. Prior to its opening, Elnur Soltanov, Azerbaijan's deputy energy minister and chief executive of COP29, was filmed by the campaign group Global Witness agreeing at the climate summit to facilitate oil or gas deals. It had posed undercover as a non-existent Hong Kong-based energy investment company willing to sponsor the event if it helped facilitate investment opportunities with Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar. Mr Soltanov said he was open to discussions, including deals on oil and gas, and a few weeks later he emailed the Hong Kong front offering to help bring together the parties to a potential deal. The latest junket of cant and hypocrisy which generates its own vast emissions had already been off to a bad start when in its planning the Azerbaijan government of President Ilham Aliyev declared the event 'The COP of Peace'. It was not so much a lack of self-awareness from the warmongering hosts as a laughable attempt at Orwellian newspeak, equivalent to framing North Korea as the land of feasting or Cuba as the destination of choice for a Pink Floyd light-show. It had been only a year before, in September 2023, that Azerbaijan military forces invaded the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, displacing 100,000 ethnic Armenians and making many others political prisoners, including several ministers of the former Armenian government of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan is an autocratic petrostate ruled with an iron fist by Ilham Aliyev, who took over from his father as president in 2003, following which he appointed his wife as vice-president. For context, Azerbaijan scored only seven out of 100 in Freedom House's 2024 human-rights index – by comparison North Korea scored 3, Cuba 12, Russia 13 and the UK 91. In contrast Armenia scored 54. After Europe announced it was abandoning Russian gas because of Putin's war in Ukraine, the European Parliament approved sanctions against President Aliyev and other Azeri government officials over their offensive against the Armenians – but the European Commission refused to implement them. Instead, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen flew to Baku, hailing the country as 'a crucial energy partner'. The reason became obvious when the Financial Times and Sunday Times reported Azerbaijan had increased imports of Russian gas specifically to meet commitments made to EU countries looking for 'non-Russian' sources of gas in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. For many the sanctions were a pretence all along. All this bodes ill for mainly Christian Armenia, landlocked and of no strategic significance, sandwiched between Turkey to the west and Azerbaijan to the east – with Iran at the southern end of the Caspian Sea and Russia to the northern shore. Since the end of the Cold War and its escape from Soviet rule Armenia has been on a journey, pivoting toward the West and looking for friends. Unfortunately, so long as politicians in the UK, Europe and the US are happy to cavort with despots throwing their petrodollars around, Armenia will find doors repeatedly closing. If Western leaders had any interest in COP29 becoming a 'COP of Peace' they would have insisted President Aliyev sign a peace deal with Armenia in advance of the summit and release the remaining Armenian prisoners of war and political hostages held in Baku. But our Western leaders would rather posture on peace while closing their own energy-intensive industries and exporting those jobs to China and India while importing competitors' products dependent on new coal-powered power stations – currently opening in China at the rate of two a week. The hour before dawn is always the darkest and coldest, the saying goes, so it is no surprise to find the UK, irrespective of the incumbent Government party, still charging ahead looking for a world leadership role at COP29. With Ed Miliband bringing a fresh dogmatic zeal to UK Net Zero initiatives, the consequent stupendous waste of public funds was highlighted by the Daily Mail revealing the UK had 470 expenses-paid delegates at the Baku beano, compared to 405 from the US, 437 from Italy, 325 from Germany and 115 from France. With sweet irony, COP29 coincided with the stunning victory of the climate realist Donald Trump as 47th President of the United States, giving focus to a crisis of confidence among those in the West driving toward Net Zero. Even before this seismic electoral turning point the number of academics willing to challenge the settled science of anthropogenic global warning has been rising. Hopefully COP29 will be recognised as different from the past summits because its curtain has been pulled back to reveal all the double dealing and empty rhetoric about 'peace' and the climate 'crisis'. If that strengthens the resolve of Donald Trump to admonish Western democracies for killing their own industries to the benefit of autocratic powers we'll have at least something to thank it for. Whatever one thinks about the role of man in creating a climate catastrophe, the West's pursuit of Net Zero economies will achieve no impact against Asia's drive to accelerate its use of carbon-reliant energy and industrial output. COP29 is no festival of peace, but neither will it save the planet from a climate 'crisis' – what it may well do is help reveal what a self-serving circus the Conference of the Parties has always been. Could the return of Trump and the hypocrisy of COP29 make 2024 the year the West finally wakes up to its climate self-delusion? Let us hope it is the beginning of a new dawn.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-23T01:17:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/cop29-reveals-itself-as-the-great-fraud-it-always-was/
David Keighley was right. Everything he warned about hate crime has come to pass,"IT WAS a full seven years ago on October 17, 2017, that David Keighley warned on these pages of the latest of Theresa May's 'victim' obsessions – hate crime. Elevating hate crime was part of her Tory 'detoxifying' programme – aka her full-scale shift of the party (and the then Government) towards progressive left woke thinking and culture, an appeasement that her colleagues shamefully 'sucked up'. Fromrace audits(into 130 aspects of life no less) to transgenderism, whichshe and her Equalities Ministers promoted, to hate crime, May pushed a poisonous rhetoric driven by the ideology of identity politics. Her Government'sNational Hate Crime Awareness Weekthat October, was a full-scale effort, David reported at the time. It involved the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups(many in receipt of government grants). Centre stage in that campaign, of course, was the BBC: 'True to form', David wrote, the BBC 'produced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote, of course – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over on This Week,the BBC then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that ""the white race"" is ""the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth"".' But for an email from David responding to Janice Davis's article, 'What's the real reason they are going after Allison Pearson?' on Wednesday, reminding me of it, I might have forgotten where this all began and who was responsible. Yes, it was a Conservative Government that facilitated the hate crime process as part of its then anti-Brexit propaganda manoeuvres. This was when the selective hate crime culture we are now locked in kicked off. Today, and once more with the full backing of the BBC, he noted, the Labour Government is intensifying its attack on dissenters from its Islamist/communist and DEI missions. In fact not a week passes without theBBC fuelling this dystopian cultureor encouragingso called 'victims' to press their complaintsin what can only be described as a targeted tyranny. As David said to me in his email, almost everything he warned about 'has now come to pass in spades'. How right he is. And it should surely be obvious to all but the dimmest that although, as Suella Braverman says, 'the subjective nature of non-crime hate incidents makes them unworkable', Labour's Politburo simply doesn't care. In fact the subjectivity and irrationality is the point. Hate crime can be targeted politically well suiting a Government determined to 'crack down' on 'Islamophobia'. Any hope for Braverman's attempt to rescind any of the hate crime legislation died with Labour's return to power. Yvette Cooper in true Pol Pot style is only interested in policelogging hate crimes more efficiently, lumping anti-semitism with the artificialIslamophobiaconstruct as though they were morally and ontologically equivalent. They are not. Below is David's spot-on,full original article.It should make salutary reading for former and current Tory voters. *** EYES and ears open, everyone, and anti-prejudice antennae out! It'snational hate crime awareness week. This is a full-scale effort, involving the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups, many of which are taxpayer-funded, to tell us that we are all miserable sinners. 'Hate' in this context covers such crimes generally – against the disabled, religions, different sexual orientations, and race – but the principal focus is on race because the bulk of such crimes (78 per cent, according to latest Home Office data) fall into this category. Centre stage in this campaign, of course, is the BBC. True to form, last week itproduced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over onThis Week, they then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that 'the white race' is 'the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth'. Aiding the Corporation?Step forward Superintendent Paul Giannasi OBE, the National Hate Crimes Coordinator, who runs for the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) the portal for reporting hate crime. No, he is not a secret member of UKIP. Rather,he is part of a Facebook group called 'We Love Europe', and boy, does he. Mr Giannasi believes that the Brexit vote was a change 'unwanted and unexpected', an 'expression of the tyranny of democracy' which was 'caused by political arrogance, thirst for power, idiotic fears, prejudice, bigotry and incredible stupidity'. And let's not forget the special contribution of Hillary Rodham Clinton. On a book-plug visit, she was given oodles of BBC airtime to reject Brexit. Nasty populist Nigel Farage, she claimed,duped the British people with the 'big lie'about topics such as immigration – and then went on to sabotage her own election as US President. In fact the BBC declared war on Brexit, using race hate claims as a main weapon, over a year ago. It was among the most avid in reporting an alleged 'spike' in such offences after June 23 (of which more later) and thenwrongly claimed on August 31that the death of a Polish man in Harlow was a 'frenzied' murder triggered by post-Brexit race hate. The message from all the agencies involved is clear. Bigoted white people are smashing skulls, wreaking havoc, subverting the democratic process, and their populist prejudices against other nationalities and other races are forcing the UK to abandon globalism and leave the EU. But what is the truth about 'race hate'? Everything about the way it is framed and reported should send alarm bells about the veracity of any figures involved. First, it's almost certainly the easiest crime on the statute book to register because, uniquely, alleged incidents are recorded by the police on a self-report basis via their specially-established website,True Vision(run by Supt Giannasi). All a 'victim' has to do is register the 'crime' – and hey presto, it's in the stats. At a time when –as theSunreported this week– police forces are working flat-out to limit 'by hundreds of thousands' the number of recorded burglaries, shop thefts, and even minor assault charges, they are simultaneously transferring their efforts to the 'hate crime' domain.The key supporters of the Stop Hate UK charity, for example, include a clutch of police forces. Second, the definition of a 'hate crime' is unusually loose. Such an offence is deemed to have been committed if the victim, or any witness of the incident, thinks they have been subjected to 'hate'. This ease of reporting has been accompanied by a mushrooming of associated interest groups,spearheaded by the government's primary service provider, Capita, and this has no doubt contributed to the rising volume of 'race hate' claims. This 'increase' was trumpeted yet again this week in theannual hate crime figuresreleased by the Home Office, up to the end of March. True to form, theBBC's report of the statisticsis accompanied by a picture of one of the sinister-looking Pole-hating thugs it had trawled Britain to find for its specialPanoramaedition. These statistics show that there has indeed been a rise in recorded hate crime, from 62,518 in 2015-16 to 80,393 in 2016-17. But in the context of the lax self-report procedures, what does this prove? Does it reflect a rise in actual incidents? Or perhaps far more likely – in tandem with the vast amounts of money being spent in this arena, combined with publicity from the BBC, and the Remain faction generally – simply that there is increased awareness that such 'crimes' can be reported? Whatever the reason, Amber Rudd's Home Office was keen to stress the alleged 'spike' in race attacks and crimes after June 23 last year because of the Brexit vote. But drill down deeper into the report, and it quickly emerges that this, too, must be treated with a great pinch of salt because it is, to quote the report, based only on 'anecdotal evidence'. These figures fail another vital acid test. The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for bringing hate crimes to court andmade clear in its annual report, also published this week, that this is a major priority. What do the stats show? Well, in the last year – despite everything noted above – the number of hate crime prosecutions fell by almost 1,000 over the previous year to 14,480. In other words, the number of so-called hate crimes with sufficient evidence to go to court is in sharp decline, despite all the resources and efforts being expended. On that basis, of the 80,000 race hate 'crimes' reported toTrue Vision, only about 18 per cent will be tested in court. And the reaction?This BBC reportemphasises in great detail the rise in number of recorded 'crimes', does not enumerate the fall in prosecutions, and has a long sequence about a Muslim 'victim' who concludes: 'I really think it's important for us to report, no matter what.' Of course.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-was-right-everything-he-warned-about-hate-crime-has-come-to-pass/
The climate scaremongers: BBC admits it lied about vanishing polar bears ,"IN AUGUST, the BBC published anews itemabout a Canadian worker killed by two polar bears. The article claimed: 'There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government. The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.' No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world's population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973. The BBC have now formally upheld the complaint I submitted at the time, and have posted this on theirComplaints Page: Complaint A reader challenged a statement in this article which claimed that the global population of polar bears was in decline. The ECU [Executive Complaints Unit] considered whether it met the standards of due accuracy set out in the BBC Editorial Guidelines. Outcome The article reported on the death of a worker who was attacked by two polar bears in Canada's northern Nunavut territory. It said such attacks are rare and continued as follows: 'There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government. The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.' Research carried out by the ECU confirmed scientists agree climate change will cause a reduction in sea ice, which is likely to have a long-term detrimental effect on polar bears and overall population numbers. There are also considerable challenges in obtaining reliable data. However evidence from the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Polar Bear specialist group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature appears to suggest numbers are stable overall at present and not in decline as stated. Upheld Further action The finding was reported to the Board of BBC News and discussed with the editorial team concerned. UK climate has changed little in recent years THE Global Warming Policy Foundation has just published my annual review of UK weather trends, based on official data. As in previous years, it finds no evidence that our weather is becoming more extreme, or that, as the Met Office recently claimed, 'the UK's climate continues to change'. The report's findings include: • Following a rise in temperatures in the 1990s and early 2000s, average temperatures have barely increased since 2007. • A Met Office study in 2006 found strong evidence that this earlier rise was linked to increased sunshine, possibly the result of reduced air pollution thanks to the Clean Air Acts of the 1960s and 70s. (The report has since been buried). • The number of days with extreme temperatures has actually fallen since the 1970s, with fewer extreme cold days outnumbering more hot ones. • Average annual rainfall in England and Wales has increased since the 1960s, but is at similar levels to other periods pre-1960. • Summers are not becoming drier, as consistently projected by the Met Office. • Rainfall is not growing more extreme, whether on an annual, monthly or daily basis. • Sea levels around Britain are gradually rising at the same rate they were a century ago. • Wind storms have been declining in both frequency and intensity since the 1990s. Britain's weather is notoriously volatile, and can change dramatically from year to year. Any underlying, long-term changes are dwarfed by natural variability. The full report can bedownloaded here. But it is worth taking a quick look at a few of the charts. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words! First, temperatures. We can see that temperatures have been rising since the 17th Century, long before 'global warming'. It is also worth noting that winter has seen the biggest increase. In contrast summer temperatures have barely risen since the 1700s: Secondly, rainfall. As noted above, we are currently going through a wetter than average period, but no wetter than other periods, such as the 1870s and 1920s. The second chart also dispels the myth that rainfall is becoming more extreme. Finally, sea levels. We are constantly told that sea levels are rising so fast that cities will be under water by the end of the century. The actual data tell a different story. Around Britain's coasts, seas have been rising at less than 2mm a year, just as they have been since the Little Ice Age ended in the late 19th century.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:15:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-bbc-admits-it-lied-about-vanishing-polar-bears/
A vaccine volunteer’s heartrending chronicle of a life destroyed,"A WOMAN who suffered a severe adverse reaction during Oxford- AstraZeneca's covid vaccine trial was so badly injured that it was four months before she could walk again. Within an hour of receiving the jab she developed paraesthesia, an autoimmune condition that attacks the nerves. It left her in excruciating pain, unable to eat, and so sensitive to light and noise that she was confined to a darkened room with sunglasses and earplugs. A mother of two young children, Brianne Dressen, from Utah, USA, considered suicide to stop the pain, a common reaction in the vaccine-injured community. Her husband Dr Brian Dressen, who has a PhD in chemistry, and children Cooper and Hannah kept her going, although at one time even a cuddle from them was too painful. For months, Mrs Dressen, who received the trial vaccine in November 2020, could not bear anything moving near her or touching her body, and the children were instructed to stay out of the spare room where she spent her days and slept. Hannah came in one day, curled around her mother promising, 'Mommy, I won't speak. I'll be less wiggly. Please let me lie here next to you. Just for a bit. I'll be good. I miss you.' Mrs Dressen was 39 then, a preschool teacher who ran her own nursery school. She had no choice but to text her husband to ask him to retrieve their daughter. Despite her best efforts, Hannah was too young to stay still, and her chatter felt like 'a knife cutting through my brain; the feeling of her snuggling up to me was too much,' Mrs Dressen said. Hannah was six when her mother was vaccine-injured, and her brother Cooper was eight. Now ten and 12, they no longer remember a time that their mother was not ill. Mrs Dressen, now 43, who is unable to work and permanently disabled, said: 'This has been incredibly traumatic for them, and they wear my pain in their hearts. You can see it in their faces and hear it in the things they say. They try and be strong and happy for me and I try and be strong and happy for them, but it's not easy. This time of year, they say, ""Mom, I really want you to be better by Christmas."" Or ""I think I'm done with you being sick, I'm ready for you to be better"".' Before Oxford-AstraZeneca destroyed their lives the Dressen family were immersed in their close-knit community. When lockdowns hit, they focused on helping others cope with the grim isolation and fear, and spent hours painting animal faces on small rocks to cheer people up. Mrs Dressen said: 'We would go around the neighbourhood and place the pet rocks somewhere on people's front yards, ring doorbells and run away, smiling at the thought of our friends finding these cute little gifts.' Before she was injured, Mrs Dressen was active and sporty. She hiked, snowboarded, swam, and climbed mountains with her husband, now 47. Her older sister, an obstetrician who was on the front line during covid, recounted a story which made Mrs Dressen determined to do her bit. A woman pregnant with twins was admitted to her hospital. She was miscarrying and haemorrhaging, with clots in her placenta caused by covid. While Mrs Dressen's sister saved the mother, the premature twins were dying with no one to hold them. Most healthcare workers were told to stay home during the pandemic leaving only emergency cover. There was a frantic hunt to find any staff who could cuddle the twins as their lives ebbed away. This tragedy had a profound effect on Mrs Dressen, who had always believed in vaccination. When Facebook published a form asking for volunteers to test AstraZeneca's new covid jab, she immediately applied. The form was simple and asked for her name, profession, location and contact details and she was invited to participate subject to health checks, which she passed. Later, Mrs Dressen joined thousands of the vaccine-injured in one of many Facebook support groups that popped up globally. The groups were lifelines for those struggling with injury and desperately seeking information for any effective treatment. In June 2021, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team deleted all but one of the groups after Senator Ron Johnson hosted a vaccine-injured press conference in Milwaukee, despite the fact Johnson made it clear in his opening remarks that all attendees were pro-vaccine. They had all taken the shots. Mrs Dressen developed more and more symptoms that doctors are unable to explain. Tinnitus accompanied by excruciating loud screeching. Insomnia. Nausea, worse than either of her two pregnancies. She lost control of her bladder and developed constipation. She struggled to eat and lost 20lb while her legs turned to jelly and she could barely walk. Her heart became erratic, alternating between slowing to an alarmingly low rate that made her feel faint, then speeding up in a way that had never happened while she was doing sports. Doctors were 'baffled'. Electric shocks surged through her body causing constant unbearable pain. Most days, she felt she was being electrocuted from head to toe. Only strong painkillers such as benzodiazepines, gabapentin or pregabalins helped. But the medication made her completely incoherent. As a trial participant, Mrs Dressen was reassured that if anything went wrong, AstraZeneca – whose trial was suspended temporarily because of serious side effects – would provide full support and pay for any doctors' bills. This is clearly written in the consent form and a reason she signed, despite misgivings. She was also told if she became ill, the study doctor and AstraZeneca would arrange treatment. AstraZeneca had an insurance policy that would cover all costs. Side effects were mostly referred to as 'mild' or 'moderate', with a few considered 'severe'. Most appeared within 48 hours of the injection but resolved within seven days, she was told. A sore arm, chills, headache, and fatigue were common. Not so common was a decrease in infection-fighting and/or clot-forming blood cells, reactions acknowledged as having occurred. In the consent form Mrs Dressen read that in animal trials, monkeys developed antibody dependent enhancement, meaning that they had a worse covid infection post-vaccine, but the trial investigator who went through the consent form with her told her this had not been verified. Some serious 'rare' reactions were flagged; these included anaphylaxis, which trial staff were trained to handle, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Its symptoms were not listed but include muscle weakness and tingling in the limbs or upper body. GBS could lead to paralysis or death, she discovered. Mrs Dressen had not heard of GBS so assumed it was really rare, but it was something that made her hesitate. She planned to go home and think whether she really wanted to go ahead but at the trial centre in Salt Lake County, after taking her medical history and blood samples, she was told she could receive the experimental vaccination there and then. Despite feeling uneasy, Mrs Dressen thought it would be worth it if she could help prevent more people suffering like the poor mother who lost her twins. The purpose of the trial was never to see if the vaccine would prevent people catching covid, it was to check that they would not become dangerously ill with it. Mrs Dressen received her shot on November 4, 2020. By then, 5,000 people had received at least one dose, and 30 people had received a second. Her severe adverse reaction (SAE) began within the hour. The independent trial centre, 40 minutes from her home, which Mrs Dressen describes as shabby and run-down, acted as middleman between trial participants and AstraZeneca. She called them the morning after she was vaccinated and filled in her symptoms in an app they provided. For 48 hours she heard nothing back. They finally rang and told her a neurologist should check to see if she had any underlying conditions but they did not offer to pay. The neurologist found nothing. The trial centre alerted AstraZeneca who never contacted Mrs Dressen or offered any help, breaking the terms of their contract. The family quickly realised they were on their own and Dr Dressen began researching papers on vaccine injury to find answers and help for his wife. Despite 60 appointments with doctors, four visits to ER, and one hospital admission, all in year one, which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, AstraZeneca offered Mrs Dressen just $590 to cover her expenses, and that was only after her story broke in local media. When a national news story ran, she was offered a $1,250 payment that they said would absolve the company of any future liability. Mrs Dressen refused and, as she faces crippling medical bills for life, had no choice but to sue AstraZeneca for breach of contract. Because of America's National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which indemnifies vaccine manufacturers, she was unable to claim injury compensation despite being diagnosed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with post-vaccine neuropathy. The Department of Health and Human Services run a taxpayer-funded vaccine injury compensation scheme which rejects around 98 per cent of all claims. Mrs Dressen has applied and says the calls she has had with them so far are already preparing her for rejection. In May 2024, she filed a lawsuit against AstraZeneca claiming breach of contract and failure to provide medical care. Mrs Dressen won this month but the company have appealed citing the 1986 Act, claiming no liability. Mrs Dressen has made some recovery but maintaining her health is a daily battle and she says her injury is progressive. 'I taught myself acceptance therapy to deal with that,' she said. Her message to Oxford University's Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert, who co-developed the vaccine with the Oxford Vaccine Group and AstraZeneca, is: 'I wish you could have been there when my life was ripped away from me, and I wish that you were there for the tens of thousands who came after me.' AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment. Worth A Shot?

"Muslim rioters rampage with police blessing: Today Amsterdam, tomorrow Britain?","ISRAEL is on the front line in the fight against the Islamists. But now we share that front line. The Islamists go first for the Saturday people and then the Sunday people. The violent organised mass attack by Muslims –mostly Moroccans with an admixture of assorted non-Moroccan Arabs as well as Turks– against Jewish and Israeli fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv football club in Amsterdam two weeks ago is another expression of the anti-Israel/anti-Semitic sentiment infecting our own country, using the Israel/Palestine issue as the 'acceptable' excuse for anti-Semitic hatred and rage. So too was the weekend's violent Palestinian protest in Montreal. Emboldened by the Canadian Prime Minister's announcement that he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for alleged war crimes (therebysidingwith Iran and opposing the United States), the protesters descended intoviolence and anarchy, chanting for Israel's demise, threatening a new Holocaust of Jews, and throwing Hitler salutes at bystanding Jews. It left Montreal's Jewish community shaken and fearful for their safety; their leaders comparing it to historical anti-Semitic attacks. Amsterdamwas a planned attack, with rioters travelling from outside the city to join in. The full-scale violence began after the match, co-ordinated by Muslim taxi drivers who had mapped out the hotels where the Maccabi supporters were staying, and gave a running commentary on the locations of the Maccabi supporters during the attacks. There arereports of police collusion and participation in the attacks. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is a former Dutch politician, has talked about the takeover of Amsterdam's internal security apparatus: 'Today, a large part of the Amsterdam police force is made up of second-generation migrants from North Africa and the Middle East.' One of the fans who was attacked said: 'The Dutch chief of police says officers are human being[s] and they can enforce the law however they want. He gave a legal right to the police not to protect us.' Regarding the Muslim attackers, he added: 'They want to apply the Sharia law all over Europe.They will kill us, you, everyone. We know this, and Europe needs to as well.' The Israeli government sent planes to the Netherlands to take Israeli citizens home. Local Jews organised transport to the airport as taxis were not deemed safe for Israelis. Around the same time as the Amsterdam attacks, Belgian police arrested six suspects who were allegedly planning an Amsterdam-inspired 'Jew hunt' in Antwerp, andteenagers in a Jewish youth football team were attacked by a knife-wielding pro-Palestine mob in Berlin– 'hunted down' by Arab youths. The Berlin police chief hasadmitted Berlin is not safe for 'openly gay' or Jewish people: 'Unfortunately, there are certain neighbourhoods where the majority of people are of Arab descent, who also have sympathies for terrorist groups.' How many police chiefs in the UK would openly admit to such 'no-go' zones here, or that dozens of Sharia courts are allowed to operate freely and give out 'Islamic' judgments to Muslims living in UK communities? Internationally, inflammatory pronouncements such as that from UNICEF that the Israeli UNRWA ban 'means a new way has been found to kill children', or the announcement thatCanada is reaching out to 'allies' in its quest to recognise a Palestinian state, can only give further encouragement to jihadists.The UN has voted to stop Israel defending certain parts of its own territory,and to force it to withdraw entirely from key areas that serve to make its country defendable against its enemies and direct attack. The thinking appears to be that Israel should not be allowed to fight back. Perversely October 7 was the trigger that released this new anti-Semitic onslaught against all Jewry, and all those who stand in defence of Israel and its legitimate place in history, in what must be one of the most egregious act of victim-blaming in history. In March this year I wrote:'How much longer will it be before I will need to go to Israel to look a Jew in the eye, because there are none left in the UK?'As the year has progressed, I have seen nothing to change that view. Indeed, after the installation of the Labour government of Two-Tier Keir Starmer and election of several independent Muslim Vote MPs, my fear increased. Now, with the Prime Minister Starmer's shocking backing for the International Criminal Court's (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli PM Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, it has doubled. It can but give direct encouragement to Hamas in particular and Islamist ambitions in general. UK politicians have also given credence to the lie that Israel is now the unwarranted aggressor in its conflict with Hamas,recently voting at the UN Security Councilto impose a ceasefire on Israel (vetoed by the US) with no dependent clause for Hamas to release the hostages it kidnapped on October 7. This is despite clear evidence that theformer head of UNRWA repeatedly met and expressed unity with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders and let them influence UNRWA operations; that UNRWA employees took part in the October 7 atrocities; and despite that Hamas-originatedinflated casualty numbers and Israel deliberately starving Gazansare based onon liesand propaganda – in a word, faked. What happened in Amsterdam on November 7 and in Montreal this weekend is a warning of what could come to Britain in the not-too-distant future. Is this what we want in this country? Do we stand aside as Israel-haters continue to pack our streets, populate social media with anti-Semitic and hate-inciting bile, and whose representatives sit in Parliament and local councils and undermine police neutrality? At the start of the Second World War the Dutch Jewish population was around 150,000. Three-quarters of them were murdered in Hitler's extermination programme. The current core Jewish population is 30,000. The new Nazis of fashionable anti-Semitism – the fundamental Islamists in our midst, the woke, the intellectually deceived, and the purely ignorant – act as though they would like to continue the work of 1930s and 1940s Nazis across Europe and in the UK. For UK and European Jews, surely all roads must now lead to Israel. But where do the rest of us go, once the Saturday people have departed, and it's the turn of the Sunday people?",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/muslim-rioters-rampage-with-police-blessing-today-amsterdam-tomorrow-britain/
"A warning shot writ large, but Putin won't attack the West","After a long period of steady grind, the tempo of the war in Ukraine has turned up several notches over the past week. Russian advances have continued in the Donbass, and the salient in the Kursk region (the 250 -square-mile area anchored by the town of Sudzha), as I predicted inmy last article, is being slowly but surely strangled. Ukrainehas lost more than 40 per cent of the territory it seized in Russia's Kursk region, France 24 reported on Saturday. The hot news, however, is the granting of permission by Britain for the use of ATACMS long-range missiles, which itself requires US permission because of access to targeting systems, and by the US for the use ofStorm Shadows. Why has this come about now? I suggest three main reasons. First, the Biden administration is trying its best to queer Donald Trump's pitch by so irritating the Russians that any diplomatic intervention after January will fail. Secondly, and perhaps I am giving more credit than is deserved, there is a desire to shape a future peace deal by halting Ukraine's slow defeat and putting Zelensky in a viable negotiating position. Third, from the point of view of Sir Keir Starmer, he is simply obeying his masters in the EU Commission and the WEF who for years have been desperate for a war with Russia, since the Russians despise them and all their works. Russia's response was the launch of anOreshnik ('Hazel') intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)on the town of Dnipro. (This has been wrongly reported as an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it is not.) The missile has aspeed above Mach 10, making interception difficult, and is capable of carrying a nuclear payload. Because of this, the standard procedures were activated through the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center,by the Russians, 30 minutes before the launch to warn the US and NATO. There must have been something of a frisson for a minute or two when this was received because of its nuclear capability, but this was soon allayed when Dnipro failed to disappear in a mushroom cloud. Instead of a nuke, the missile was armed with multiple conventional warheads – six warheads each with six sub-munitions – capable of causing considerable but not catastrophic damage. It was, therefore, a warning shot writ very large. If the Ukrainians employ long-range weapons, it must expect that the same weapons will be used against them. What was behind this response? Putin knows, of course, that come January and the inauguration of President Trump the scenery will shift but before that, the Democrats and Starmer will do all they can to increase tensions. All he has to do is wait them out. However, there is bound to have been internal pressure on him to remind the West just who they are dealing with. The attack was followed by an announcement thatlarge-scale production of the missile will go ahead. Of course, one might say with some justification that Putin cannot really complain about foreign equipment being used against him by his enemy, when he is using Chinese, Iranian and North Korean equipment – and manpower. For this reason, as well as the need to wait Biden out, it is most unlikely that the Russians would attack US or British units and personnel on the ground – and they are there in Ukraine right now. Nor will any attack be launched against Nato territory unless Nato or one of its members initiated an attack. Nor is a first-use nuclear attack at all likely. Putin does not need to do this and in any case, why raise the stakes that high when you are winning? So, does this mean, as some writers are claiming, that the West is on a path which will inevitably lead to war with Russia? I would suggest not. First, history tells us that there is no such thing as inevitability. Secondly, no direct action can take place without US involvement. This will not happen. Biden does not control Congress, whose support he would need for such a move. More importantly, the Joint Chiefs' principles, laid down at the start of hostilities, remain in place: that the war would be confined to the territory of Ukraine, that Ukraine would be given all material support required to defend itself, that the cohesion of Nato would be maintained and that there would be no direct US or Nato intervention. Added to this is the undoubted fact that public opinion throughout the West has shifted towards the need to end the war, in spite of what warmongers at governmental level may say. This extends to some governments too –in particular Hungary. The final improbability is that, aside from the US, no Nato nation is in a position to take the field against Russia with more than a few battalion-group sized battlegroups. Consider our own country: the Army is down to 85,000 regulars – probably fewer than that – of whom only about one-third are combat troops. The front-line tank fleet is a mere 140, the Warrior upgrade has been abandoned, the field artillery belongs on the Antiques Roadshow and air defence is absent. Logistic stocks have been denuded by supplying Ukraine and not replenished. Collective training standards are low and the vehicle fleet is in bad shape because of the lunatic programme of 'whole fleet management'. The RAF is down to 12 combat squadrons. No doubt many officers and soldiers would do their best, but the remarks byRob Magowan, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, that if the British Army 'was asked to fight tonight, it would fight tonight'are both untrue and disloyal – untrue because thefacts speak against him, and because the Secretary of State for Defence has already made the position clear; and disloyal because if he had the best interests of the country at heart, he would be telling politicians in no uncertain terms that their neglect over decades has brought the defence of our country to its knees.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-warning-shot-writ-large-but-putin-wont-attack-the-west/
My choice as world leader of the century? Netanyahu,"NOW THAT we are nearly a quarter of the way through the 21stcentury, it is interesting to speculate on who is the best world leader so far. With the advantage of hindsight, we can clearly recognise the great world leaders of the last century. In no particular order my list would include Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt, Konrad Adenauer, Yoshida Shigeru, Charles de Gaulle, Lee Kuan Yew, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. These are the figures who put the world together again after the ravages of world war and socialism. Now for the runners and riders for my vote for best world leader of the 21stcentury. But first, a quick comment on the utterly useless. Some heralded Angela Merkel as an 'Iron' lady with a handbag – a woman in the Thatcher mould. There was no handbag. Instead, she carried a stiletto with which to knife her political rivals. An ace at political manoeuvre, Merkel's energy and immigration policies have led to Germany's current economic and social demoralisation. President Barack Obama was the standard-bearer of an evil totalitarian woke cult which has swept the world over the last decade. Instead of using his office to heal racial divisions, he stirred them up by provably false accusations of institutional racism. As a result, the corrupt and divisive Black Lives Matter movement was set in motion. Obama's equally ghastly woke apostles were New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern and Canada's Justin Trudeau. Obama also aligned himself with the globalist interests of corporate America in taking a 'just-get-over-it' attitude to the workers of middle America. His foreign policy failures included a soft, 'kick-the-can-down-the-road' sort of nuclear deal with Iran. In Asia Obama was asleep at the wheel in failing to push back China's military takeover of the South China Sea. All the while Obama and his wife Michelle exuded a repellent, narcissistic moral superiority. Xi Jinping also makes the bad leader list. Having established a personalisation of power not seen since Mao Zedong, Xi's overly aggressive and ham-fisted attempt to bend Southeast Asia to his will in taking over the South China Sea as well as his bullying behaviour towards Taiwan has alienated the world. If Chinese leadership has been downright bad, the leaders of France have simply disappointed. Both Nicolas Sarkozy and Emmanuel Macron rode into office with pledges to reform the bloated state apparatus. They both failed utterly. Between their presidencies, Francois Hollande, the unlikely lothario, proved to be an inept windbag. But neither has British leadership got much to boast about. Prime Minister Tony Blair left a legacy of fake dossiers on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction which he used to justify what turned out to be a disastrous intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. His successor, Gordon Brown, gave every appearance of being a paranoid sociopath, and spent so much government funding in a failed attempt to get himself re-elected that his Chief Secretary to the Treasury left a note for his successor saying, 'I'm afraid there is no money'. David Cameron ran away from his duty to implement the result of the referendum that he called on membership of the European Union. Sadly, thereafter the Conservative Party elected a trio of inept leaders: Theresa May, an overpromoted nonentity, Boris Johnson, a brilliant campaigner who was, as one of his many mistresses said to me recently, 'completely unsuited to be a prime minister', and Liz Truss, an inflexible monomaniac who self-destructed within days of taking office. So, who does that leave to claim the mantle of being the 21stcentury's greatest leader? Narendra Modi would be on my shortlist. He is halfway toward a restructuring of an Indian economy that was built on the socialist legacy of Nehru's Congress Party. Donald Trump's current legacy is similarly half finished. Leaving aside his economic reforms, a highlight was the Abraham Accords, a reconciliation of Israel with the Arab states; it was a diplomatic triumph for which any other president would have won the Nobel Peace Prize. Viktor Orban is another leader of note; he has brilliantly developed his country's economy and refused to kowtow to the socialist euro-elite. Judging by his performance in Davos, where he denounced the globalist elite to its face, Argentine president Javier Milei may well become South America's Orban. Collectively the leaders of Switzerland, largely faceless to the world's media, deserve recognition for running the most democratic and best managed country in Europe. However, my prize for world leader of the 21stcentury must go to Benjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu, Israel's leader for 16 of the last 27 years. This may come as a surprise to some, given the pervasive opprobrium that is heaped upon him by the liberal global media. Donald Trump apart, he is arguably the most reviled leader of his generation. Some of the criticism may be fair. He is arrogant, self-serving and narcissistic – typical political characteristics. Above all he is anti-left and anti-Palestinian, qualities that are inimical to a Western, and indeed Jewish, liberal elite which despises him. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, head of investment bank NM Rothschild, referred to him as 'that appalling man'. Over the last few years Netanyahu has attracted further opprobrium by his government's attempt to bring to heel a Supreme Court which, since the presidency of Aharon Barak in the 1990s, has become increasingly leftist and politicised, granting to itself the power to cancel laws and putting itself above the sovereignty of the elected Knesset. Netanyahu has also been heavily criticised for the failure of Israeli security to prevent Hamas's gruesome attack on October 7. But surely opposition figures such as Benny Gantz or Naftali Bennett would have been similarly blindsided? It should be noted that nobody called for the resignation of F D Roosevelt after the failure of US intelligence in preventing Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Now let's look at Netanyahu's greatest success, one that is almost entirely overlooked by western media. More than anyone Netanyahu is responsible for Israel's economic miracle which has made his country the world's 13thwealthiest: GDP per capita has increased from US$17,000 to $58,200 since 2003. When Netanyahu became prime minister for the first time in 1996, Israel was a sclerotic socialist economy. In 2003 the public sector accounted for half of Israel's GDP. This was anathema to Bibi who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology then worked for Boston Consulting Group. Apart from learning capitalism first-hand in the US, he took on board the libertarian values of Ayn Rand after reading her seminal novelThe Fountainheadon the recommendation of Yoni, his older brother. (Yoni Netanyahu was later killed by Palestinian terrorists while leading Israel's special forces to liberate Jewish hostages at Entebbe Airport.) Taking a leaf out of Margaret Thatcher's book, Netanyahu deregulated Israel's foreign exchange controls which limited citizens to taking just $7,000 out of the country. To the shock of leftist economists, there was no capital flight. Instead, a floating exchange rate brought international funds flooding into Israel. There followed a highly successful privatisation programme, budgetary discipline and tax cuts. The government budget was curtailed, but not at the expense of infrastructure investment. This included a programme to increase the number of science and maths graduates by 50 per cent, laying the foundation for Tel Aviv to become the world's third-most important tech hub. Netanyahu's most important contribution to global leadership has been not in the realm of economics but global security. More than any other world leader he has stood steadfast in refusal to countenance a Palestinian state, whose component parts are currently run by terrorist groups, Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Neither of these groups will ever accept Israel's existence. Netanyahu has always recognised that a two-state solution would exacerbate, not resolve, the region's instability. The October 7 massacre of Jews demonstrated the accuracy of his understanding of the real nature of Hamas – an unreformable Jihadi death cult that is a menace not only to Israel but also the world. We should therefore be grateful for Netanyahu's determination to destroy Hamas. Its demise would be a defeat for global Jihadism as important as the eradication of Al Qaeda and Isis. Failure would simply encourage a global Jihadist movement which is already embedded and emboldened in many Western countries. Netanyahu's steadfast leadership in countering Palestinian terrorism is a beacon of hope in the world's worst neighbourhood. This alone should win him our vote as the greatest world leader of his generation.

"Badenoch should listen to Clarkson, and learn","AT AN awards ceremony in 2004, Jeremy Clarkson decided to punch Piers Morgan in the head. We cannot say that this was Clarkson's finest hour for the simple reason that he went one better and hit him again. As is the way of the English, the two subsequently became good friends. I mention this partly because it's funny, partly in tribute to the recently departed street pugilistJohn Prescott,and partly because, as Mike Graham points out, Clarkson is a man this government really does not want to take on. Clarkson is a man whose talents go beyond the ability to handle himself. One of these is an ability bordering on genius to identify and trigger that class of people we call 'perennially irritating'. He was working that magic again last week when he put in a bravura performance at the farmers' rally. This took place in what used to be London. Clarkson brilliantly gave voice to the anxieties of farmers over the government's announcement that Starmer's commitment to agricultural exceptionalism was just something you say to groups of farmers before a general election. And what he really meant to say was that when in office he would dump on the farming community by scrapping Agricultural Property Relief. The BBC, and other representatives of the rentierlatteclasses were typically (and one suspects synthetically) outraged that a celebrity farmer should use his celebrity to talk about, well, farming. The usual suspects said their usual things and accused Clarkson of being a 'tax dodger' – as if that is a bad thing to be in a country where the government is as obnoxiously rapacious as the current shower. Now, doubtless only the necromancers who practise the dark arts of predictive economics are sufficiently well placed to spreadsheet the consequences of government reform in this area. And like Rachel Reeves, I am no economist. But the issues raised by this latest Treasuryvolte faceare not so much economic as moral,and any discussion of them must therefore range beyond the specific case of farming. A last testament is a bridge which links the dead to the living. It is a codified recognition of intergenerational affections and obligations. It is one of the practical requirements for Edmund Burke's stable social order in which contracts exist not only between people who are here now but extend backwards in time to those who were here once and forward to those who are yet to be. It is improper for Rachel Reeves, or her possibly imminent successor, to act the part of troll on the farther side of that bridge, ready to shake down the beneficiaries of that legally formalised private intention. Inheritance tax is morally obnoxious whenever it is enforced. The government's current embarrassment results from a failure to predict that farmers would be especially sensitive to this injustice. These are creative and intellectually nimble people, remember, and are wise to the hamfisted and ignorant intrusions of the state, irritations invariably effected by politicians who assume that what appears on their dinner plate is createdex nihiloby those wonderful people at Waitrose. Sir Roger Scruton was of less combustible temperament than Jeremy Clarkson, but like him he came to farming relatively late, having bought a smallholding in Wiltshire (not far from where I write this). Scruton was an activist as well as a thinker, and from this rural base he wrote of the need for conservatism, and its representative writers and defenders, to recapture a 'spirit of place'; to affirm (in the language of David Goodhart) that it might be better to be a resident ofsomewherethan a citizen ofanywhere. My friend, the philosopher Ferenc Horcher, writing about Scruton's conservatism remarks that: '[Scruton] claims that politics as we know it depends on settlement, admitting the need of human beings to be connected to a place and an appreciation of the customs of that place and its inhabitants.' * Conservatism speaks to this need for settlement, or at least it ought to. And philosophers of conservatism should be sympathetic to the tradition of farming and reinsert it as an essential reference point in the conservative case. To farm a piece of land is actively to reassert a commitment tothis territory. Farming places value in neighbourliness, valorises family, and encourages an unsentimental and therefore genuine attitude towards domestic, working and other animals. It inculcates a realistic respect for our environment (without resorting to the Gaia idolatry of the net zero fanatics) and acknowledges thatthis placeis a gift which needs stewardship and therefore conservation. The farmer is attuned to seasonality and the cycles of the earth and therefore sees time and its passing through a lens which makes the 'deadlines' of politicians appear ridiculous. Just before she became this year's Leader of the Opposition, Kemi Badenoch wrote the preface to a pamphlet outlining a way forward for her unhappy party. The document is detailed in terms of policy, or as detailed as could be expected following her party's recent reversals. I suggest she ditches it. Her job is not to persuade the electorate with policy proposals. It is to capture its imagination with an idea. That idea should be the prosecution of the environmental case, as exemplified by the plight of our farmers. Conservatives need to reclaim the argument when it comes to conservation, to promote the local over the global, and to revivify Scruton's 'spirit of place'. The case for the environment should be removed from those whom Danny Kruger refers to as 'climate eschatologists', and brought back home to where it belongs: at the centre of conservative philosophy. Such is my unsolicited advice for Mrs Badenoch: political success is usually found in the articulation and repetition of a simple vision, one which enlists the sympathies of the least loud yet most wise. The last week has given her an opportunity to bring back genuine conservatism, because the traditions of the farm are active instantiations of conservative values, properly described. She could even count on the unwitting support of Ed Miliband, whose vindictiveness if fully implemented will see us back in the Dark Ages, but without the good bits. *See Ferenc Horcher's excellentArt and Politics in Roger Scruton's Conservative Philosophy.Scruton's account of setting up his farm is the subject of his intellectual memoirNews from Somewhere.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-25T01:20:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/badenoch-should-listen-to-clarkson-and-learn/
The farm raid that mobilised Amish behind Bad Orange Man,"The catastrophic failure of the Democrats in the recent USA election which resulted in the triumph of the Bad Orange Man has had a fallout of comic proportions. Many conservatives have been metaphorically 'bathing in liberal tears' as the realisation hits the wokerati that what was unimaginable has happened. Social media has been full of progressive women shaving their heads and wearing blue bracelets in order to identify the ideologically pure with whom they can sit and commiserate now that they have entered into the realms of 'The Handmaid's Tale'. Some have gone so far as to swear off sex for the next four years, which at least has the upside that there might be fewer abortions. It is entertaining to speculate on the emotional wellbeing of all the Hollywood celebrities who are waking up to the harsh reality that ordinary Americans don't care about their political opinions and have rejected their electoral advice and instructions, for which it emerges the Harris campaign paid them handsomely. Questions are being asked about when all the celebrities who vowed they were going to leave the USA in the event of a Trump victory are actually going to up sticks. That one has an easy answer. Never. They will still be around in 2028 when it will be J D Vance's turn to usher in the right-wing apocalypse which will destroy democracy, instal a dictatorship and force them to leave the USA. Of more interest are the reasons being given for the Trump victory. Voting patterns are being assessed and fault apportioned. It seems that Black men in large numbers have voted against their own best interests, as have Latinos, Indians and even Native Americans. Minority groups have seen a swing towards Republicans and away from woke. Who would have thought that labelling Republicans as white supremacists, Nazis, fascists and Trump as 'literally Hitler' would have no effect whatsoever? Progressives are scratching their heads and muttering, 'They're not doing what we tell them to do. It's almost as though these people believe they can think for themselves.' Prior to the electionPew Research Centrefound that 82% of white evangelical Protestants, 61% of white Catholics and 58% of white non-evangelical Protestants backed Trump, while Harris was backed by 86% of Black Protestants, 85% of atheists, 78% of agnostics, 65% of Hispanic Catholics and 65% of Jewish voters. Although it is early to say it would appear that this is what happened on 5thNovember. Progressives know why white male evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Trump. It's nothing to do with the economy or the woke insanity distorting American life: it's obviously because they are racist, misogynist white supremacists who could never bring themselves to vote for a woman of colour. If white female evangelicals voted for Trump it indicates they have been conditioned by the patriarchy to vote against their own best interests. In all the hullabaloo over election analysis and attempting to find reasons for defeat other than the fact that Harris and Walz were terrible candidates, there is one group who have slipped below the radar, the Amish. The Amish are a conservative Anabaptist Christian community who have resolutely turned their back on modern technology. They are renowned for their self-sufficiency, the simplicity of their lifestyle, and plain dress. They much prefer face-to-face communication to telephones and don't use television, preferring to spend time together as a family. Fleeing persecution in 18thcentury Europe, they arrived in the New World where William Penn offered them refuge in Pennsylvania. Due to their work ethic and emphasis on family ties the community boomed over the years. It is estimated that of the 400,000 Amish in America 92,000 live in Pennsylvania. The largest of the swing states with 19 votes in the electoral college, after going Democrat in 2020, it swung Trump's way 2024. It was not the Amish vote which pushed Trump over the line, but it exemplifies why many did vote for Trump. The Amish like to keep themselves to themselves and their political involvement is usually minimal. Their stance changed this year largely due to a government raid on the Bird-in-Hand farm of Amish farmer Amos Miller. Pennsylvania's Department of Agriculture found that Miller didn't have a permit to sell milk in the state, despite the fact that he and his family had been selling milk for generations. Agents from the Department of Agriculture raided his farm and seized much of his food and dairy products. In the ensuing case, Miller was banned from selling milk in Pennsylvania, with the case ongoing. The case was seen by the Amish community as government tyranny and helped mobilise them against the party of Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat. The Republicans grasped their opportunity and initiated a serious registration drive, the first in Amish history, and the Amish responded by voting for Trump in'unprecedented numbers'. What was viewed as an overzealous government was rejected by the Amish who responded by voting for Donald Trump, whose Republican party favours less government intervention in the life of the people. 'That was the impetus for them to say, ""We need to participate"",' a source said of Amish voters. 'This is about neighbours helping neighbours.' The Amish are people of high moral principle, who value family life and who view gambling as a sin. Yet they voted for the much-married, casino-owning Donald Trump. They are not hypocrites, they are simply people who want to get on with their own lives without being badgered by an overweening government which thinks it knows best about everything. For the Democrats, as other progressives, it is all about control. From pronouns, DEI, required quotas, to mandatory speech and enforced gender ideology, Democrats demand the right to control what people say and do. Let us hope they and other progressives have learned that ordinary people do not like to be controlled by power hungry ideologues and they will rebel, even Christians.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-17T01:17:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/you-must-be-bad-if-even-the-amish-are-up-in-arms/
Anatomy of Trump’s triumph,"GO on, admit it. Don't be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of November 5-6? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump's 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost thepopular votein 2016 by three million votes (two per cent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four per cent). This time he won the popular vote bythree million(76-73) and two per cent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a 'beautiful,' 'historical realignment' in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In anNBC exit poll, Trump won 57 per cent of white and 55 per cent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In anAP exit poll, he won 20 per cent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris's 80 per cent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden's four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 per cent of Latinos, 39 per cent of Asian-Americans, 54 per cent of 'Other,' 45 per cent of women, and 43 per cent of 18–to-29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump's success in creating a multi-ethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in anAP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases such as the Latino, black or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing inThe Globe and Mailin reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as 'manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself'. His take on the outcome? 'Sometimes the people get it wrong.' He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that 'this election was not an indictment' of Harris but 'an indictment of America.' At least oneGuardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the 'simple, inescapable message' from Trump's victory is that 'many people despise the left' with progressives seen as 'one judgmental, ""woke"" mass.' Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that 'America is the greatest country in the world' where 'most people can make it if they work hard,' again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump's 14-point advantage amongvoters without college degreesflips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 per cent of Americans admitted to havingskipped mealsto keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on November 4. At his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: 'We don't need a star because we have policy.' She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was 'I am not Trump. I am not Biden.' This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. EvenTaylor Swift's hometownof Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in theWall Street Journal, it was 'a landslide against the media' (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the 'quadfecta' of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy inSeinfeld,some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year's Voice referendum in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris's massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they'd become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big 'FU' in return, just like with the Voice down under. There isn't just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn't one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to aForbes analysis, Harris's six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 per cent Latino population which hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and which Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 per cent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, theneedle moved 20 points towards Trumpfrom 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian's off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, whichBidencarried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris's appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN'sexit pollshows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump's new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women's rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. TheCNN exit pollconfirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They also object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are racked with guilt over historical sins such as slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden's cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris's fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they've returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump's victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of 'Fight! Fight! Fight!' He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris's concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world's diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump's efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris' watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showedimmigration and the economyas the voters' top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 per cent support. The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don't subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don't believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don't support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don't obsess over personal pronouns, and don't lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump's disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people's concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump's counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year,69 per centof Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trumpgained three points from both. How could this be: Isn't he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and 'My Body, My Choice' with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck downRoe v Wadein June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 per centjump from 625,978 in 2021before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and thehighest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don't feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn't align with the joy vibe and there's something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don't back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it's a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpetedgender gap worked to Trump's net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn't even excite the young. About 39 per cent of young women and 42 per cent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 per cent and 8 per cent picked abortion. Trump won 40 per cent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden's margin by 19 points. He won amongunder-30men by 14 per cent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent$175million on TV adsacross the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent$123millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: 'Kamala's For They/Them. President Trump is for you' was exceptionally effective. TheNew York Timesreported on November 7 on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by astunning 2.7 per centtowards Trump. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia's eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia's critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups' sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. At a function in Mumbai on November 10, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister SJaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that 'a lot of countries are nervous about the US . . . We are not one of them.' He said that Modi's call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India's global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are5.2million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It's worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 per cent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 per cent for Biden in 2020. Harris's share fell again to 60 per cent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 per cent, up from 22 in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation's elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump's Republican Party offer important clues on Trump's appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

The billions upon billions wasted on useless face masks,"IN A RECENTtweet, Reform MP Rupert Lowe said: 'I've been digging around. How much PPE (personal protective equipment), paid for by the taxpayer, has been destroyed? 1,049,700 pallets, which cost us £8.644billion . . . so grim.' Grim indeed, Mr Lowe. The Labour Party's disastrous recent Budget was predicated on the need to fill a '£22billion black hole'. It's a shame such hard-nosed fiscal prudence was not on display during the covid saga, when the same Labour Party egged on the obscene squandering of resources with all the restraint of a drunken sailor. We know that somewhere in the region of £400billion of UK taxpayer money has been spent on 'combating' Covid-19, a figure that, according to a piece published by the BBC in March 2022, equates to roughly£6,000 per person. We also know that of this eye-watering figure, huge sums have been wasted through incompetence, sharp practice and fraud. Regarding the latter, a year into the 'crisis' theBMJwere reporting that one in five government contracts had signs of possiblecorruptionand Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferies's detailed analysis across all categories of government covid-related spending concluded that about 10 per cent of the total was outrightfraudulent. That's around £40billion, almost double the Chancellor's supposed 'black hole'. But on top of this tale of inefficiency, hasty action, backhanded deals given to politicians' mates and criminal activity, one aspect of the sorry mess has yet to receive sufficient attention. That is the amount of money spent on precautions that were completely unnecessary: on measures that didn't – and don't – work, principal amongst which was the use of face masks as part of personal protection. In early April 2020 the UK Government and devolved administrations were in a tizzy. Previous pandemic planning had been binned and an entirely new strategy was being spun. As a result, politicians, their advisers and civil servants were in the grip of a frenetic process to develop guidelines for PPE. ThesePPE guidelinesfocused on the protection of workers in the health and social care sectors. Given that for other workers and settings there was, according to information in the Government's possession, 'very little scientific evidence of widespread benefit from PPE', this didn't make sense. But when did anything that happened during the time of coronamania add up? So official 'guidance' was that, within health and social care settings, masks and other PPE worked and were necessary; while in all other places 'good hand hygiene and social distancing' was considered sufficient. Illogical and ridiculous or not, politicians were determined to find PPE for so-called 'front-line workers'. Unfortunately, despite being warned in2016of a need for active management, the PPE stockpile set up in 2009 was short of the 'life-saving [sic] FFP3 respirator masks', with more than two-thirds of the 33million stored items beingunaccounted for. By the start of May 2020, scrambling to cover their failures in planning and to neutralise thenegative PRthey were receiving, ministers and health officials and panjandrums had set up a centralised PPE procurementsystemwhich looked like this: The PPE procurementprocess Looking at this diagram, an observer is struck by at least two things: first, the apparent simplicity of the new procurement design; second, the designers' supposed belief that something as sprawling and complex as the entire health and social care organisation supply and fulfilment system in the UK could be boiled down to a schema that fits a single page. One is left asking the obvious question that, if, during a supposed global health crisis of previously unencountered, and deadly, proportions, it would be possible to centralise NHS procurement this easily, and in the shortest of timeframes, why had it never been done before? Of course, the answer is that, as with many plans to change byzantine and deeply engrained systems, it isn't as easy to do in practice as it looks in theory. What seemed smart to politicians, civil servants and their highly paidconsultantswhen viewed on a whiteboard in Downing Street didn't hold as much water when implemented in the real world. While the new system worked, after a fashion, there were numerous examples of where it fell flat on its face, the most obvious strategic flaw in the system being that by acting in a panic and forcing all buying through a single funnel, the cost of PPE wasinflatedhugely. In these circumstances, even the supine state-controlled media have been able to spot the egregious wastage resulting from poor procurement practices, for examplehere,hereandhere. Additionally, the National Audit Office's (NAO) 'Investigation into the management of PPE contracts' report,publishedearlier this year, identified many areas of concern, concluding by quoting the Department of Health and Social Care which had said it 'expects fraud and error to be between 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent of PPE expenditure' and that it continues to manage an estimated contract risk of £2.7billion. And what of face masks specifically? In line with the general theme of bureaucratic fumbling and ineptitude, we've seen exampleshere,hereandhereof masks that, for a variety of reasons, were unusable. Further,knowingthat they do nothing useful to stop transmission and instead introduce additional harms means that we also know that every pound spent on them has been a wasted one, creating misery into the bargain. And a lot of masks were bought. As early as April 2020, when individual NHS Trusts were responsible for their own procurement, staff were getting through'tens of millions'of masks every week. Overall, from the start of the pandemic, we know, courtesy of the NAO's report, that in total 37.2billion masks, gowns, gloves and so forth were purchased at a cost of £14.6billion by government – of which, official sourcesconfirmed, only about half were distributed. It is difficult to specify exactly the proportion of that number which is made up by face coverings. What we do know, from the underlying data to be foundhere, is that the value of contracts awarded by government bodies for masks was at least £5billion in 2020 alone. This money, spent on the useless masks, would have funded the first-year salaries of at least 151,000 additional nurses, or given all existing nurses a 30 per cent bonus payment. Instead, the jump to assume that which was known not to have worked previously had undergone a magical transformation meant that this opportunity to reward those most affected 'on the front lines' went begging. Perhaps the political optics just didn't look good enough? Would it be any different the next time a 'global pandemic' arises? If, when confronted by theevidenceagainst masking, theresponsesupplied by NHS England's then Chief Nurse and national lead for infection control, Dame Ruth May, is anything to go by, probably not. We can expect more of the same. Which, given the spectacular growth of 223 per cent in the protective face maskmarketduring 2020 and the predicted future Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9 per cent over the next seven years, is perhaps not surprising. After all, who could turn down all that easily made 'government' money? Other problems with the system have been highlighted: first by NHS procurement heads who criticised supply-chainperformance; and second in an answer to a written parliamentary question which revealed that storing PPE was costing the taxpayer £770,000 perday! We should also mention Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone and her relationship and connections to a company, 'PPE Medpro', involved in supplying sub-standard PPE to the Government. In particular, interest in the press has focused on Mone's role and rewards as 'middle woman' in the grubby affair. The matter, comprehensively and succinctly documentedhere, which centres on a £200million deal to supply gowns to the Department of Health and Social Care, first saw the light of day in 2020, and through a succession of denials followed by admissions evolved into a scandal which saw the Baroness step away from the House of Lords and given a restraining order freezing assets worth £75million. Now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency, the case shone a harsh light on the matter of the Government's 'VIP lane system' which featured a fast-track email box which allowed MPs to send on offers of PPE from suppliers, but led to the government being criticised for giving preferential treatment to companies with political contacts. Another disgrace dates from June of this year and news that from a deal worth £1.78billion cut in 2020 for face masks, respirators, eye protection and aprons, 1.57billion items valued at £1.4billion will'never be used'. Of these items, around 750million had already been burned, with another 825million likely to face the same fate. Unlike the stock purchased through the PPE Medpro deal, the PPE was considered viable, but simply 'overpurchased' by those tasked with procuring supplies. A former government procurement adviser quoted by the BBC revealingly explained that 'I think the procurement people did what many of us would have done and slightly panicked to get the stuff in, or at least get the contracts in and hope the stuff arrived later', adding in a moment of candour that 'it was almost as though price didn't matter'. So far as it is possible to know, as a result of this waste of money, no one has lost their job. This seems a good place to stop and weigh the two explanations as to how unaccountable civil servants and posturing politicians were able to pour billions of pounds of our cash down the PPE drain. Take your pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence? Or, just maybe, both.r pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence?

No chance for the ‘far right’ in Starmer’s left-wing justice system,"THE Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson gave an interview to theSunday Timeswhich was a very interesting read indeed. It started with his desire to get more rapists convicted. These alleged rapists were playing the system by pleading not guilty, and how very dare they do that. I thought we had a presumption of innocence here in the UK, but that is causing problems for the DPP. According to the article, 'Suspected rapists are seeking to evade justice by deliberately pleading not guilty and waiting for victims to drop out of long-delayed trials, the country's top prosecutor has warned. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said defendants were ""taking advantage"" of delays in the criminal justice system and ""hoping that something will come up"" to cause a case to collapse.' The article continues: 'Ten per cent of victims of rape and other serious sexual offences withdraw their support after charges have been brought, he said. Many more do so while police investigate their complaints. Typically, it can take two years to investigate a rape case and another two years to bring it to trial, Parkinson said. ""I think that's outrageous. We see too many victims — usually women — withdrawing their co-operation because of the delay and also because they don't feel sufficiently supported"".' A few things on this. First, and most obviously, everyone including those accused of rape has a right to plead not guilty and exercise the right to a trial by jury. I think it is bad form for the DPP to be out there implying that defendants who enter a not guilty plea and maintain that plea until trial are somehow trying to 'evade justice'. Surely, it is justice, a trial by jury, that they seek and are entitled to. The DPP is disgracefully casting aspersions on defendants who have entered not guilty pleas to the very serious charge of rape and are awaiting trial as is their legal right. It is hardly the defendant's fault that the criminal justice system has been so trashed, starting with New Labour and continuing with successive Tory administrations, that trials take so long to come to court. Some of these defendants will be remanded in custody until trial, so they suffer as much as the complainant. It is not their responsibility that 'a record backlog of 71,000 cases are awaiting trial in the nation's crown courts, up from 38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic'. Justice denied is another legacy of the ruinous lockdown. Secondly, and this should not need to be said to the DPP, perhaps the reason why complainants withdraw their evidence is because they are lying and they made a false allegation. It is for the jury to determine the truth – not the DPP who feels under pressure to raise the conviction rate for rape. With various improvements to the system, the DPP 'hopes the moves will encourage suspects to plead guilty at their first court hearing, making them eligible for a reduced sentence'. In reality, even for those defendants who are guilty, what person would plead guilty to such a serious offence at the first opportunity even with a reduced sentence? If defendants are 'taking advantage' it is because successive governments have given them the advantage, due to treating barristers like trash, outrageous court delays and systemic underfunding. Such is the DPP's dodgy view on rape trials. I tell you what group of people did plead guilty at the first opportunity, the Far-Right Thugs (herein after referred to as FRT). Stephen Parkinson was asked about this too. TheSunday Timessaid: 'The biggest challenge faced by Parkinson in the past year has been the riots that engulfed Britain after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July.' Parkinson denied that the response from the CPS, which led to more than 740 people being charged, was 'draconian'. This was in some ways a national crisis. It was important to show people that if they committed criminal conduct, they would be dealt with swiftly and effectively, he said, adding that the majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty. How true this was. The majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty at the first opportunity in the magistrates' court. And I have been asking myself just why this was the case. The grandfather Peter Lynch who committed suicide in prison should not have pleaded guilty to violent disorder,in my honest and former defence lawyer opinion. Having read what I could in the reports and accepting I was not in court at the time, I am left wondering just why did he plead to violent disorder, a serious offence, when his part was minimal? His offence really was abusing a police officer, but as it was part of an overall incident of violent disorder, by pleading guilty Mr Lynch was on the hook for the entire incident which turned very serious. Despite having pleaded guilty Mr Lynch was denied a suspended sentence when any reasonable judge could see that he was vulnerable. But Mr Lynch is too dead to object now. They wanted to teach him a lesson, and I'll say they did so. There are other cases out there where the sentence at least looks disproportionate. But what has troubled me in the last few weeks is just what happened on those first appearances in the magistrates' court. Of course, it didn't help that the Prime Minister himself was dragging out the old lectern saying justice would be done, and done swiftly, which intensified an already febrile atmosphere. That was surely the point. And the FRT were given legal advice and ultimately how they plead is entirely their own decision. But all the time people admit offences of which they are not necessarily guilty. Further, even if on the facts the FRT were guilty of the offence I am left thinking that if this was a left-wing cause, many would have entered not guilty pleas. This is because left-wing lawyers are well-organised and the word goes out – don't rush into anything. Wait until we have given you advice and you have considered all your options. This is all perfectly ethical, and indeed effective. It is downright admirable. My only regret is that this is not what happened with the FRT. Things can change in trial by jury, the light that shows that freedom lives. These FRT, having taken advice and decided to plead not guilty are perfectly entitled to tell the jury how they honestly felt on the day, how it came to be that they were suddenly far-right thugs. 'Yes, I was angry. Sure I shouldn't have done what I did but I was furious. I thought of those three girls being stabbed to death and my anger got the better of me. I'm just angry that we have been ignored about immigration for years and years. That my country, my home town, has been changed beyond recognition and no one seems to care. The politicians ignore us time and again – I tried to vote for change but change never comes. So, I got angry. Etc etc.' This goes before the jury. To convict in a jury trial you need ten of the 12 jurors to say yes, he was guilty. They can return a not guilty verdicteven if the defendant admits the offence in court.It happens all the time and is called jury nullification or jury equity depending on your view. Ten from twelve. I'll take those odds and any decent defence lawyer should have been willing to take those odds. Now it may be the case that the FRT are getting some decent legal advice now. But the reason they all pleaded guilty is that there are simply not enough right-wing lawyers out there who are as organised and as motivated as their left-wing colleagues. This is the problem with right-wing people – they are in the City, doing commercial stuff with commercial people or whatever the heck it is they do all day. Where they are not is in the law. But plenty of talented left-wing people are, and they look after their own and play for keeps. The right-wingers are not in the arts, crafting well-told and beautiful stories of the human condition from a conservative point of view. But the lefties are influencing the culture day in and day out. Heck, even in the media there are not enough true conservatives, otherwise this piece would have appeared in theDaily Mailor theTelegraph. They would have been asking, what really happened to the FRT in court? So here I am. There we have it. The suspected rapists know how to play the system and will plead not guilty, and hope the trial never happens. Far-right 'thugs' on violent disorder charges, or tweeting while angry charges, were just falling over themselves to plead guilty, and receive obviously disproportionate sentences. I am not blaming their lawyers who were there at the time at all. But it might be worth asking just why this happened.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-19T01:17:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-the-law-is-stacked-against-right-thinkers/
What’s the real reason they’re going after Allison Pearson?,"EVER since Allison Pearson wrote about her personal experience of the UK's 'two-tier justice system' in herTelegraph article of November 12, the media in Britain and abroad have been deluged with outrage and condemnation. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has had to intervene after warnings that the current Hate Crime laws were being exploited to stifle free speech. Starmer has recommended that the police focus on tackling violent crime and burglaries instead of questioning people over their social media posts.This is in line with public opinion, but appears to be the opposite of what goes on. The Chief Constable of Essex Police, Ben-Julian Harrington, who sent two of his officers to Allison Pearson's house on Remembrance Sunday morning, actively encourages public complaints under the Malicious Communications Act (1988). Not content with making sure people know what a hate crime is, he provides blow-by-blow instructions on how to report them on itswebsite. An accompanying booklet called 'Stop the Hate' all but suggests it is a public duty to be an informer. With such egging on it's not so surprising to find that his force received more than 30,000 such complaints in three years between 2019 (9,203), 2020 (10,163) and 2021 (11,069), or that they chose to investigate 29,109 of them.If this is how the force has been wasting its time and resources, no wonder it can't manage to send an emergency response to all 999 calls about drug dealing, as has been admitted. Neil Gregory, a substitute member of the Essex Police, Fire and Crime Panel, has accused it of 'an obsession with diversity, neglect of crime, and institutional incompetence and dysfunction on an epic scale'. So is the Pearson response sheer incompetence, or quite deliberate and altogether more menacing? Though the police inquiry is already a year long, and has involved the Met, Essex and Sussex police, it was only last week that the Non Crime Hate Incident (NCHI) accusation was made. Later statements suggested actual criminality, under section 17 of the Public Order Act 1986, but were subsequently denied by Essex.No one seems entirely sure, especially at the Home Office. Crime or Non-Crime? This matters.Julie Bindel reported being visited by police over such an incident in 2019. She too was denied any information about the accusation, and so refused point-blank to attend for interview. But a criminal charge is altogether different, removing any voluntary element. Was this why Essex Police set up a 'gold group' to deal with the X post? These are normally set up to deal with major crimes such as terrorist attacks, to 'support the management of an effective response to the identified matter'. But for a post on X? By Friday, things took an interesting turn.Vikram Dodd, police and crime correspondent of the Guardian, claimed they had 'found' details of the incident. A photograph posted several months ago during tensions over policing the Gaza protests showed a group of people of colour with a flag, and three police officers. Pearson's caption read: 'How dare they? Invited to pose with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday, police refused. Look at this lot, smiling with the Jew haters.' It turned out Pearson was wrong when she implied the Muslims in the photograph were Hamas supporters, and quickly deleted the post. But the Guardian endorsed the complainant's view that she had been racist and inflammatory. They also knew the complainant's identity – not a Muslim but a person of colour with training in criminal law. It's the timing of the accusation that stands out, because it followed very closely on the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre. Since 2023, there have been huge demonstrations by pro-Palestinian activists almost weekly in central London, always 'lightly' policed with few arrests, in spite of blatantly anti-Semitic banners and chanting 'From the River to the Sea', leading many to consider the police show a pro-Hamas bias. On October 7 this year, Pearson bravely published a deeply shocking report in the Telegraph. She had interviewed survivors, soldiers, bereaved parents and the mothers of hostages. Its headline, 'Not one girl could be shown to her parents', says it all. She wanted to record the heroism of the victims and the true depravity of the Hamas attack on innocent civilians and stated that she believed the struggle between Israel and Hamas was 'no mere fight over territory, but a struggle between civilisation and barbarism'. With a Labour government now in Westminster, Pearson's words were unlikely to go down well with their supporters, including a significant number of Muslim MPs, mayors, senior officials and academics, and other sympathetic communities throughout the country. Not least readers of the Guardian. So how was it that the Guardian, alone among the MSM, was privy to detailed information about the 'incident', details which Pearson herself was not entitled to know? Could there have been a leak, or even a deliberate tip-off, to strengthen further the government's diversity agenda and appease its pro-Palestine voters? And from how high up might it have come? Was it intended to shift the narrative away from sympathising with the sentiments of Pearson's shocking report, and back to exposing her as a racist Islamophobe? Could it even have been meant to turn the public's attention away from the disastrous October Budget? We have no way of knowing, but it would follow a recognisable pattern of appeasement towards anti-Israel activists, notably from the police, at the same time as anti-Semitism is rising massively, andoffensive anti-Jewish tweets are not considered 'offensive enough' to warrant attention. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is now tasked with reviewing the logging of NCHIs, and wishes to reverse the downgrading recommended by her predecessors. She wants incidents relating to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia to be logged consistently, to avoid any escalation into violence. But her proposals inspire little confidence – the usual 'focusing on vetting procedures' and 'holding forces to account on key metrics', etc. What she needs to do is refocus her police forces on to real crimes, of which there is no shortage – knifings, shootings, drugs gang violence, burglaries, street muggings, even shoplifting, all of which are of great concern to the public. She would also do well to ensure that applying the Equality Act 2010, which affords special protection to minority groups, is managed fairly and proportionately when dealing with hate crimes against Jews and Christians. Any more failure to rebalance what many perceive as preferential treatment for some religions over others, or even for illegal migrants over upstanding citizens, will result in the Starmer government's ratings sinking even lower than they already are.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-20T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/whats-the-real-reason-theyre-going-after-allison-pearson/
Health warrior RFK Jr faces coalition of formidable enemies   ,"ROBERT F Kennedy Junior (RFK Jr) is a popular figure in these pages and deservedly so. He's been a warrior for truth over the excesses of the covid regime in the United States. He committed what the health promotion fanatics would consider the mortal sin of questioning the vaccine strategy. He continues to demand access to data which will show conclusively what every reader of TCW already knows, that the covid vaccines are unsafe. Now, as promised,he has been nominatedby President-elect Donald Trump to the position of Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In that position – provided the Senate do the right thing and not block his nomination – he will have a major influence on US health strategy over the next four years and has already been advising Trump. Despite a Republican majority, RFK Jr, who suspended his campaign to back Trump, is not universally popular. As opponents try to pressure the Senate, he's likely to have opprobrium heaped on him. If recent reports are anything to go by, every opportunity will be taken to portray him as evil, conspiratorial or mad. As the fact sinks in that the prevailing narrative about public health in the USA – a narrative to which the terminally woke and politically deranged adhere – will no longer dominate the agenda, lockdown fanatics, mask maniacs, covid-vaccine enthusiasts and vested Pharma interests, among others, will do their damnedest to block him. Former Vice President, Mike Pence, has started the call,urging Republicans to reject him. To secure confirmation as HHS Secretary, RFK Jr. needs 50 Senate votes, with J.D. Vance casting a tie-breaking vote if necessary. With enemies like Pence the fact of 53 Republicans in the next Senate is far from a shoo-in. The 'Leftstream media', as the editor of TCW recently dubbed them, have for months been laying the groundwork for this eventuality. TheNew York Timesreported that RFK Jr kept ravens as pets, relishing the opportunity to make a play on the otherwise quite respectable collective noun 'conspiracy of ravens'. TheLos Angeles Timesreported on the 'unbearable weirdness' of RFK Jr. Over here theDaily Mailclaims he was a cocaine dealer at university. Speculation about separation from his actress wife (a rubbishy report a month ago in something calledPeople) was taken up by theMail, which reported they 'looked tense' at the recentAl Smith Charity dinner, and that he has had multiple affairs with women in the 'anti-vax' movement. Yesterday following the announcement of his promotion, the papers did not miss a trick in their campaign to discredit and demonise him. First wastheMail'sreport that the news had sent the stock market into meltdown, followed almost immediately by a gleeful list of'the most outrageous health claims peddled by the US' new anti-vaxxer health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr: From 'chemicals could make you trans' to the 'dead worm' in his brain'. The hystericalGuardiancondemned him as 'a clear and present danger' None of these reports look at his evidence based analysis of America's health crisis – the dramatic and alarming rise in chronic disease – that he has beenspeaking and lecturing on. Maybe theDaily Death(sorry,Mail) will find it has overplayed its hand asexcess deathsmount here and as its 'not so woke' readership wake up to the 'health' industry's role in wrecking worldwide economies and lives during the covid regime. No wonder that its most powerful cabals are sweating under their collars right now. RJK Jr has advised he would aim to sack around 600 workers in the National Institute of Health (NIH) and replace them with 600 new workers. Recommending swift action before Trump is inaugurated, he said 'we want to have those people in place on January 20 so that, on January 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH, and 600 people are going to leave'. He also said 'entire departments' of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 'have to go'. Many were behind or part of the global agenda of fear regarding health, perpetuated for their own gain in terms of power and profit. A prime example is our favourite source of poor information on health, the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, who are clearly concerned at the prospect of RFK Jr with his hands on the health portfolio. Their daily newsletter (Global Health Now) of November 7 carried a 'gift article' from theNew York Timeswhich, in tone meant to be gobsmacking, was designed to put the boot in. Not only, it claimed, had RFK Jr peddled all sorts of 'misinformation about vaccines' but also he was a lawyer with 'no medical or public-health degrees'. Indeed, he has neither medical nor public-health degrees, but he is a well-educated and effective lawyer who has been studying, and successfully suing large corporations for the addition of, harmful food additives. For example, he successfully sued the agricultural giant Monsanto for the use of a carcinogenic herbicide which found its way into the food chain. In a recent video he explains the provenance and dangers of the common food dye tartrazine, already banned in some countries but still found in sweets designed for consumption by children. This is a man who clearly cares about the health of individuals and the nation, in contrast to recent incumbents, in particular Anthony Fauci, who served the needs of Big Pharma from which many suspect he, in turn, profited. Regarding the covid years, RFK Jr's 'expertise' is not insignificant. He researched and wrote a book onAnthony Fauci, formerly Chief Medical Advisor to the President of United States and long term Director of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and his links with Bill Gates and Big Pharma. He also exposed, in aNew York Timesbestseller, the cover-up of the development of bioweapons in Wuhan. RFK Jr does his homework and is unafraid to ask inconvenient questions the likes of Fauci, Gates, the NIH and the FDA do not want asked. And, unlike them, he seems to care about the health of the American people. Is expertise, of the professional qualifications sort, specific to a political portfolio an absolute requirement? In fact a case could be made that they are a hindrance, especially for a health portfolio, since health professionals are educated and trained to think in particular ways, akin to brainwashing. They adhere with religious fervour to well-established tropes, especially regarding public health. Few will speak out when they see something wrong, and the hell of cancellation, professional investigation and possible loss of career and income awaits those who do. We have the covid years to prove the point. The medical and nursing professions largely sang from the same hymn sheet. Inculcated with vaccine ideology, almost to a man and woman, they jumped on the bandwagon in the face of evidence from the outset the vaccines were ineffective and in the face of subsequent evidence they were clearly dangerous. So dangerous, in fact, that the US state of Idaho banned them. A fresh, albeit 'unqualified', pair of eyes with a perspective uncluttered by prior assumptions is exactly what is required to steer health policy. After all, whether experts on health or not, the non-medically qualified majority of the population are consumers of what Big Pharma inflicts on them. Are our interests best served, therefore, by qualified and probably brainwashed health professionals or by well-educated and influential figures like RFK Jr, unafraid to speak their minds and ask the awkward questions? Of course, now RFK Jr has been nominated for the health portfolio he will, if the appointment stands, be judged by his actions. For example, he has promised to stop the fluoridation of tap water across the US; it will be interesting to see if he can achieve that. He has long referred to this additive, purportedly used to promote dental health, as toxic, and there is research on the lowering of IQ in children to support this. In contrast to the opprobrium heaped on RFK Jr and the likelihood of more now he is appointed, take the case of Gates. The UK Prime Minister, barely in office, has already met the man and described as 'great' their time together. The PM's immediate predecessor exuded enthusiasm about meeting Gates during his unmemorable time at Number 10. Everyone, it seems, wants to meet Gates to seek his advice on all manner of things such as poverty (what would he know about that?), climate change and, indeed, vaccines. If his lack of qualifications (of which he has none) are ever referred to it is with awe that someone who dropped out of university could achieve so much. The fact there is such opposition to RFK Jr being involved in decisions about health has nothing to do with his lack of qualifications. That is the reddest of herrings. It is simply down to the fact he is not 'on message' with any of the left-leaning liberal agenda and opposes intrusive public-health interventions. Gates, on the other hand, is 'on message' – the global vaccine message he has so assiduously pushed, promoted and profited by – and that makes a world of difference for him. Unfortunately, it makes the world a worse place for us.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:19:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/health-warrior-rfk-jr-faces-coalition-of-formidable-enemies/
"So cruel, so vulnerable – the Daycare Generation","THE LAST few days in the life of Alexander Rogers must have been consumed by darkness and loneliness. On the outside he was privileged: he was one of those white, heterosexual males we hear so much about, a good-looking third-year materials science student at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Unfortunately for Alexander, he lived in 2024. Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn't happy about. As pertheTimes,'She had expressed ""discomfort"" about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the ""allegations"". They told him they believed he had ""messed up"", that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later.' Rogers had appeared 'distraught after this conversation'. He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation. Emergency services retrieved his body from the water and found he had suffered a head trauma. You can only imagine what his parents went through when they picked up the phone. What they felt when they had to identify his body. The ostracism inflicted on Alexander was certainly effective. It was swift but not justice. At the inquest, coroner Nicholas Graham found that on the balance of probabilities this culture of exclusion did not contribute to Alexander's decision to take his own life. But he added: 'It is certainly possible that such a culture influenced the actions of Alexander's peers in forming the judgments that they did; it is also possible that Alexander felt that – because of this culture – there was no way of getting back into the social group that obviously meant so much to him once he had been excluded. What I cannot say is that this was probable.' In fact, this culture of exclusion and isolation was found by the coroner to be widespread and so dangerous that he has spoken out against it. Graham, the area coroner for Oxfordshire, has written to the Department for Education with concerns that 'exclusionary behaviour' is becoming commonplace on campuses. He called on ministers to take action, warning that future deaths could result if the issue was not addressed. 'There is concern that social ostracism has become normalised within student communities, with individuals viewing it as an expected and accepted response to certain allegations or behaviours,' Graham wrote. 'This normalisation hinders the development of healthy and supportive social environments.' Why would these students, the younger brothers and sisters of the Millennials, who pride themselves so much on being kind, on being 'awake to social injustices', who will have grown up with circle time, star of the week, and buddy systems engage in such a brutal culture of isolation? The fact that young men are engaging in behaviour that was once considered mostly female behaviour – the bitching, the exclusion, the social isolation in sum, mean girls behaviour – is frightening and telling. Previously, disputes like this might have been settled with a fist fight. Instead of settling these issues like men, the coroner explained how the isolation works: He wrote: 'The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] ""pile-on"" might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual.' In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a ""pile-on"" and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape. The fact that Alexander took his life a mere two days after his friends told him he was now firmly on the outside and that they 'would check up on him a couple of weeks later' is evidence of how devastating this behaviour is. They didn't give him a badge to wear – perhaps a scarlet letter – but they didn't have to. The word will have gone out. Alexander Rogers was persona non grata. A modern leper. I wonder how many of these Oxford friends took up the chance to check up on him at his funeral? Why did his friends engage in this behaviour, so clearly unethical, so obviously cruel? Why did no one speak up on his behalf? Did not a single friend say, this seems a bit harsh, or let's refer it to the college authorities? I suspect they were all too terrified of each other, that they would be next, they would be the one on the outside. Again, it demonstrates how brutal and effective woke social exclusion is. It is also worth asking why Alexander was so sensitive to this exclusion. This woke generation, who pride themselves on kindness while cutting their friends off at the legs, and those who suffer at their hands, are unique in their actions and responses. They are uniquely vulnerable and insecure. They are too peer-oriented because they have been denied a secure attachment when they were young. And they have been denied that attachment because this is the daycare generation grown up. We are seeing the results of this daycare experiment now, 20 years on. I say this not to add to the devastating loss of Alexander's family. But it is worth thinking about. I have reason to believe one of my own children is insecurely attached, although I tried my best, so I am not judging. But as we seem so firmly on this path, with the government funding institutional care of very young babies to the tune of millions, it is worth asking what you are going to get at the end of it. I believe we are ending up with insecure young adults too attached to peer groups that will turn on each other on a dime, with terrible results. This isn't pure speculation; it is a conclusion I have come to after reading two books by Dr Gabor Maté,Scattered MindsandThe Myth of Normal. Maté says that one of his sons, now an adult, said 'as a teenager I was consumed by what my friends thought of me, how much they liked me, what it took to fit in with their expectation'. Maté concludes: 'Of course, his peer orientation was not about his peers per se; it was a natural outcome of his parents' lack of availability as emotionally attuned adults in his early years.' Maté makes clear in this book and another,Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers, is that this is not about teenagers moving away from their parents to form an independent and authentic self. That is natural. Instead, with this generation the move away from the parents towards peers is a false independence. They do not have a chance to develop their own identity. They are crippled by what their peers think of them. And if they think badly, if they put you in the colony marked 'you messed up and took advantage of a woman', you can only imagine the damage, the shattering of the internal self to a young man. It's the kind of thing that makes you jump into the river to end it all. A total rejection by those whose opinion you care about the most: your friends. As Maté states, 'As a rule, immature peers are constitutionally incapable of accepting each other ""as is""; or holding space for the vulnerable experience of emotion, let alone its open expression; or relieving one another's stressed states; or celebrating or even tolerating temperamental differences. Left to its own callow devices, the peer group can offer only acceptance that is highly conditional and thus insecure, often demanding self-suppression and conformity in place of true individuality.' The Tories decided on a massive expansion of childcare for babies as young as nine months. We atTCWhave always objected to this government policy and on further reflection I believe things will only get worse unless we understand the damage we are inflicting on our children in their hundreds of thousands. There are the rare cases where children are subject to serious abuse in crèches, and then there are all the other toddlers left bewildered and unable to find comfort and love as they compete for attention with other confused toddlers. Friends from home, those who grew up with Alex in Salisbury, said he 'was undeniably caring. He would fill up a room with his laughs and smiles and brought so much joy to us all. A man that lived life to the full, who gave us our favourite stories and memories and whom we miss deeply'.Another friend, Olivia O'Donnell, who completed the Salisbury Plain Half Marathon in his memory, said: 'To this day, I cannot fathom this loss, and I will forever love him with all my heart. Alex spread joy and held the brightest smile in the room. The laughter he spread will never leave us, but at 20 years old, he was taken from us far before his time.' We can only hope that Alexander Rogers finds the peace and love in death that he was unable to find in his young adult life.

Killing freedom under the banner of public health,"WEIGHT loss injections were recently proposed by the Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting as an incentive to get unemployed people suffering from weight-related health issues back into work. Fat chance that Streeting's drug ordinance will solve social ills. (It is more likely to createnew medical ones.) Streeting's comments (downplayed of course as with all the other lies of the last four years) have further highlighted the clear political motivations behind the ominous direction of the UK healthcare system. From 2020, we have seen an implosion of citizen rights and responsibilities, from enforced lockdowns, social distancing and covid wardens on the street, right up to 'jabs for jobs'. All this has been justified under the banner of public health. During the 1950s, the American sociologistTalcott Parsonswas the first to explore the relationship between citizenship and health, coining the phrase 'the sick role'. Revisiting Emile Durkheim's earlier sociological theory ofstructural functionalismand the idea that all elements of society ultimately contribute to social order, Parsons aimed to demonstrate this in a unique way. He argued that ill-health highlights what happens when societal roles are suspended and people withdraw from their everyday duties. Parsons suggested that the sick role is as much about the resulting social and cultural responses which occur as it is about the incapacitating conditions themselves. Whenever we opt out of our designated responsibilities and citizen duties through adverse health, he observed, the sick role serves to bring two rights and two responsibilities into focus that ordinarily uphold and contribute to social order. As Paul Taylor explains in his book'Sociology in Focus', 'Illness is not a not simply a state of fact or condition but a specifically patterned social role.' So what are the rights and obligations Parsons speaks of and how do they relate to health and wellbeing in modern society? Rights • Firstly, Parsons argued that a sick person is generally regarded as being temporarily exempt from their normal societal role and accompanying duties. The more severe the condition, the greater the justification for exemption. A sick person, he reasoned, holds a democratic right to withdraw from their societal role for the duration of a health condition. Thus, a person may take time off work or withdraw from family duties when they are ill. Parsons argued that it is important to understand that this exemption status is dependent on the severity and type of affliction. • Secondly, a person is not generally held to be responsible for an illness or health condition. Being ill is generally considered to be out of a person's control, so it is accepted that they have a right to be taken care of and to receive the necessary treatment. This status might be different if a person is suffering from a self-inflicted health condition, such as alcoholism, drug addiction or obesity – as we shall see, health conditions where personal responsibility might be attributed have conditions attached to these rights. Obligations • A sick person is expected to hold the view that their condition is undesirable and that their exemption from society is only temporary. Parsons argues that those who occupy the sick role are under an obligation to get well again and return to their societal duties as soon as they are able. • A person occupying the sick role is expected to go along with the advice of experts in the medical profession, or to liaise with knowledgeable professionals to give themselves the best chance of getting well again. The sick role is rubber-stamped by medical professionals – either directly or via generally held perspectives on the latest scientific evidence – where this expertise can either justify or discredit leave of absence from a person's normal social role. This second obligation is fundamental to Parsons's argument, where he reasons that the sick role demonstrates the power of the medical establishment in our society. Not only is the bio-medical model of health the recognised authority on the classification and the identification of illness, but the dominant healthcare model holds the principal monopoly on the legitimate practices on prognosis, healing and cure. All four of the rights and obligations outlined by Parsons are ultimately dependent on procedures and practices which have been established by the dominant agencies of medical healthcare. Re-emphasising the philosophy of functionalism as a theory of social order, Parsons proposed that the sick role is a unique combination of value themes, juxtaposed around vulnerability and deviancy. While a person suffering from an illness might be characterised on the one hand as being vulnerable and in need of care and treatment, the sick role is also deviant in the sense that the suspension of citizen duties and obligations may become attractive for all the wrong reasons. Parsons argues that this role must be managed by the state to prevent a breakdown in social order. The idea that illness can be understood by observing citizen rights and responsibilities is particularly relevant to covid-era healthcare. The medical pharmaceutical complex has assumed unprecedented influence over our lives since 2020 and the wholesale transformation in our rights and responsibilities became dependent upon following the advice of medical professionals. A 'good citizen' followed the guidelines that were rolled out. Many actually called for citizen rights to be taken away from people who were labelled 'free-riders'. COVID: unvaccinated people may be seen as 'free riders' and face discrimination People were refused medical treatment if they were unvaccinated, and many lost jobs for questioning or refusing to follow their new obligations as citizens. The nature of Parsons's concept of the sick role changed during this time. There was an implicit understanding that people suffering from covid held priority over those waiting for treatment from other medical conditions. These people now became peripheralised by the medical establishment, with many dying because the healthcare system was 'overwhelmed' by the pandemic. The shadow of compulsory vaccination hung has over this period, a situation where all human rights would have been suspended. Among the endless range of magic bullets now being promised for a widening range of previously intractable health conditions, Streeting's comments highlight the dangerous repositioning of our healthcare systems around the increasingly nefarious intentions of the state. Our citizenship status is now more and more based upon the power of politicians and their allies to define health and wellbeing, and our willingness to go along with their increasingly dubious solutions.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/killing-freedom-under-the-banner-of-public-health/
The climate scaremongers – energy operator tells Miliband: Your plans cannot work,"LABOUR'S manifesto promised we would have a zero carbon electricity system by 2030. It is a pledge that Ed Miliband has been making for years, not least in his party conference speech last year, and it was also one of Labour's 'Five Missions for a Better Britain' policy pledge launched last year. It would therefore be reasonable to presume that Miliband had a detailed plan of how he would achieve this and in particular how much it might all cost. So it came as a surprise when shortly after taking office in July he asked the National Energy System Operator, NESO, to provide practical advice on achieving the target. NESO have now responded with some bad news! Many energy experts have long argued that a zero carbon grid simply is not possible at these timescales, because you cannot run a grid predominantly on intermittent renewable energy. It turns out that NESO, whose job is to make sure that Britain has the electricity has it needs every second of the day, agree. Their reportsent to Ed Miliband emphasises that we will need to retain a full fleet of gas power plants to fire up when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine: This really is a damning indictment not only of Labour's energy policy, but also of the whole Net Zero agenda and its reliance on intermittent renewable energy. Even though NESO say that gas power will supply only 5 per cent of our electricity, they admit there will be many days when we will need it for half our power or more, just as we do now. And keeping a fleet of gas plants on standby creates problems of its own. They will need to be fully manned all year, fully maintained, and ready to fire up when needed, all of which will cost a lot of money. With these plants standing idle most of the time, operators will demand billions in standby payments, all of which will end up on our energy bills. We will have to pay for two electricity systems – one for when the wind blows, and the other for when it does not! The NESO report also confirms that the increase in wind and solar power demanded by Miliband will drastically increase bills, not lower them as we were promised. Not only is renewable energy more expensive to produce than gas generation, there are indirect costs to consider, such as the standby capacity mentioned above, storage, curtailment payments when we have too much wind, and grid upgrades. Analysis of NESO data suggests that annual costs could be £20billion higher by 2030 if Miliband's plans are carried through. NESO also say that annual investment of £48billion will be needed for grid upgrades between now and 2030 to achieve targets. All this expenditure will merely end up duplicating what we already have. If this was not all bad enough, over-reliance on intermittent renewables will mean that we will end up having energy rationing. According to NESO, households will have to switch off appliances at times of peak demand. Currently, of course, gas generation is turned up and down to match demand. They hope the public will do it voluntarily! Good luck with that. The reality is that there will be brownouts and punitive pricing to discourage electricity consumption at peak times. Unsurprisingly, Ed Miliband has already been bragging that this new report proves that his clean power plan is both achievable and will lead to cheaper electricity. Both are outright lies. But it looks as if we will have to prove this the hard way! Bragging in Baku SIR Keir Starmer flew out to Azerbaijan to make a speech at COP29 on Tuesday. He is obviously deluded enough to think that the rest of the world would pay the slightest attention to the platitudes and lies he delivered in his usual monotone. It was almost as if his speech had been written by ChatBot. He talked of a climate crisis, opportunities for Britain, 1.5C warming and technologies of the future. He lied that Net Zero would bring energy independence, by which he meant reliance on the EU for electricity imports, and boosting living standards, when his plans will push up energy prices and destroy jobs. He bragged about stopping new North Sea oil and gas licences, while spending billions on inefficient technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. And he claimed the UK was a 'climate leader', committing to an 81 per cent cut in emissions by 2035 (meaning a cut of 65 per cent from today's emissions). He does not seem to realise that nobody else is in this race. Meanwhile Azerbaijan's President revealed the same day that his country would continue to exploit its God-given reserves of oil and gas. As ever with COPs, this one is all about the money. COP29's President, the Azerbaijani Minister for Ecology, demanded $8trillion to 'fight climate change', claiming that we had 'marshalled' the same amount to fight Covid-19. Will Starmer and Lammy have the backbone to stand up to this blackmail? I doubt it. Over 66,000 are attending the jamboree, including 470 ministers and officials from the UK. Yet curiously only 3,975 have registered for 'virtual online' participation. So much for saving the planet! Why, for instance, did Starmer fly out to make a speech that nobody took any notice of? Could he not have done a video presentation instead? As for the other 469 bureaucrats and ministers, why are we even employing them? Nothing they do will alter the weather.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-15T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-energy-operator-tells-miliband-your-plans-cannot-work/
"Here is the long-term weather report: same old, same old","I HAVE been living for over 77 years, and for half of that time I have apparently been living through a time of increasing climate risk, now escalated to a climate emergency. Perhaps I was sleeping, but I hadn't really noticed. What I have noticed over the years has been the occurrence of a wide variety of different and severe weather events, something which I learnt early on in developing my interest in weather was a salient feature of life in the British Isles with its frequent changes of dominant air masses. I was born in February 1947, in bitter, winter weather, not alleviated by the immediate post-war austerity. My father then decided we should move from Surrey to Dovercourt, once popular as a bracing East Coast resort adjacent to Harwich. Being taken there at six months old has always seemed to me a sort of survival ritual, akin to the custom of the Spartans, leaving their newborns out on the mountains. The first major weather event the I experienced at first hand was the East Coast storm of January 3/February 1, 1953. This really was a major event, and huge areas of eastern England were flooded by the North Sea. By then we had moved to Ipswich, which was fortunate, as there were a number of fatalities in Harwich and at many locations in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. The day prior to those floods, the same weather system brought severe gales across Scotland and Northern Ireland and caused the sinking of a rail ferry between Stranraer and Larne with the loss of over 100 lives. There was no debate, however, about climate change or zero carbon; rather it was about how to improve defences, flood warnings and responses. It was obvious from historical records that such events were far from unprecedented. Coronation Day, June 2, 1953, was much anticipated, but it turned out wet, cold and miserable. My parents were never great on 'big occasions', so we went, as I remember, out for a bicycle ride in the country around Ipswich. Many people have childhood memories bathed in warmth and sunshine, but most of my early memories conjure up more of wet and cold. I remember the contrasting summers of 1958 and 1959. Rain seemed to dominate August 1958, at least so it appeared on the days when we attempted trips to the seaside or during a memorable thunderstorm as we walked back to Liverpool Street station from the Tower of London. I was beginning to take a keen interest in cricket and would listen toTest Match Specialon the radio, but that summer's test series against New Zealand was constantly interrupted by rain. 1959 was the opposite: the sun shone well into the autumn, it hardly rained through September and into October, and so we were restricted to playing touch rugby until the October half-term. Following the long drought of 1959, I identified that for many parts of Southeast England, the 14-month period from December 1959 to January 1961 produced two years' worth of average rainfall. I recall frequent extensive floods on Suffolk rivers and many soil slumps on the banks of deep lanes. 1960 produced widespread flooding around Exeter, which nine years later gave me early work experience of historic flood analysis for the Devon River Authority. Winter 1962/63 was extreme by anybody's reckoning. I had by then become so interested in weather that I was taking daily temperature readings on a maximum-minimum thermometer mounted on a north-facing wall. From the day when the snow arrived in a blizzard on December 27 until March 3, the minimum temperature did not rise above 0°C. A warm front from the Atlantic tried to make inroads on the blocking high toward the end of January, and two drizzly days did push temperature up to 1°C, so there were 62 consecutive days with frost. The weather was dominated by dry easterly winds, and I was able to watch the process of ablation gradually reduce the depth of lying snow. I also carried out an experiment where I placed a pebble on the solid ice that filled an old roasting tin in the garden: I noted over a period of a few days how the pebble gradually sank into the ice as a result of its weight (pressure), melting a thin layer of ice beneath it, just as described in the Physical Geography textbooks. By now climatologists were concentrating on possibilities of the return of at least a mini-ice-age, exacerbated by fears of attempted climate manipulation by Russian nuclear testing in northern Siberia. I shall not prolong this catalogue of events, but suffice it to say that these weather extremes were experienced by many people in the UK. Why have these been ignored by today's media when it comes to reporting severe events? What is behind the collective amnesia, or in more modern parlance, 'denial'? And of course regular severe events continued. These included violent thunderstorms in East Anglia in July 1968 (coinciding with my graduation) and a few weeks later, to disrupt my journey to Belfast to take up my first postgraduate appointment. I missed the flooding events that affected Sussex, Kent and Essex on September 14/1, 1968. There was a major storm and flood over Hampstead Heath in August 1975, which I witnessed from Wimbledon; I was also involved in the immediate post-event analysis. I left the UK just as the prolonged summer heatwave of 1976 began and spent most of the next 22 years working abroad, mostly in monsoon and tropical climates. At least I had plenty of experience of tropical downpours, monsoon deluges and long, hot droughts – enough to realise that the weather-related adjectives now used by the media in this country are somewhat exaggerated! During my absence from the UK between 1976 and 1998, a revolution in the TV presentation of weather forecasting took place. Francis Wilson was one of the first to use graphics to depict the movement of weather systems, a process that had already been started by several commercial TV weather channels in the USA. Michael Fish of course became famous overnight with his 'no hurricane' statement during the devastating 1987 storm. In the UK, TV weather forecast became media- and personality-orientated and no longer the preserve of a formalised statement pattern issued from the Met Office. I was present when 'climate change' perhaps went public, at the Lacey Memorial Lecture 1991 to the Institution of Civil Engineers by Sir John Mason, Director General of the Met Office. He introduced the topic as a focus of research by the Met Office that could be of interest to civil engineers. In an unbiased, non-committal summary, he gave his opinion that the world was under greatest threat from population growth, which for two decades became a central theme of David Attenborough! Climate-change theory became focussed in the 1990s on large-scale droughts, especially inthe Sahel. This was a well documented situation, and indeed serious, but it was not unprecedented, though the populations involved were. The drought eventually eased and by the early 2000s the greening of the Sahara became evident from satellite imagery. In the UK the 1990s were also marked by droughts, and widespread concern over drying up of major reservoirs, groundwater sources, river headwaters, etc – which eventually of course recovered. In 1998 it started raining with a vengeance. Widespread flooding in April prompted the government to take a concerted look at all aspects of flooding, culminating in the production ofthe Bye Report. Mr Bye was a prominent civil servant, not an engineer, hydrologist or meteorologist. No sooner had the industry started to respond to the Bye Report than a series of major floods occurred from October 2000 to October 2002, and this concentrated the mind wonderfully. I was seconded from HR Wallingford to a National Flood Warning Centre (England and Wales), a joint operation between the Environment Agency and the Met Office. This secondment lasted nearly two years and was very interesting. Our first 'active' flood found two or three of us working late, desperately trying to locate flooded sites on an AA Road Atlas! The operation and organisation would become much slicker and more thorough, developing websites that provided near-real-time updated data on river levels, rainfall, and weather radar, and also flood forecasts and warnings. There were people in the group from media and political backgrounds and 'blue sky' thinkers who began to provide the impetus for thoughts on climate change. One interesting thing to emerge in examining the locations of major floods in winter 2000/01 was the amazing similarity they bore to the flooding of 1851. This information was readily available in theBritishHydrochronology(Frank Law-British Hydrological Society), which catalogues all major floods from written sources. The first entry was from the 13th century, so information existed on the severity of past floods to which today's 'unprecedented' events can be compared. Various groups with political agendas, and especially the television and press media, began to raise the question of climate change influencing individual weather events. These influences were denied by professional engineers, meteorologists and hydrologists, but eventually the pressure told, and in 2010/11 the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology made a statement conceding that a single event could be influenced by recent global warming. This has since opened the floodgates for a range of half-baked opinions and wild speculations. The flights of fancy have lately produced such irrelevant ideas as 'named storms' and the shifting of climate change to far more exaggerated and emotive terms like 'climate catastrophe' or 'climate emergency'; even 'global burning'. I hope I have made clear a few climate vicissitudes during the first 30 years of my life. I had become professionally involved in hydrometeorology over that period, and do not recall any great concern over climate changeper se. There had certainly been a lot of interest in catchment studies and severe rainfall events. The publication of the NERC Flood Studies Report in 1975 was a major achievement in objective analysis for dam and river flood design. Only in the period since 2010 has the fixation on climate change ballooned. To my mind this has been the result of political pressure, whatever the reasons. The make-up and variety of weather across the British Isles has remained unchanged; thus the climate is about the same as before.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/here-is-the-long-term-weather-report-same-old-same-old/
Revealed: Pfizer’s hidden vaccine injuries ,"MAINSTREAM media has extensively reported on the catastrophic injuries caused byAstraZeneca'scovid vaccination but has yet to detail the truth about Pfizer-BioNTech's covid jab. Hidden in America's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), there is a significant number of detailed, serious, adverse events from the UK, all relating to Pfizer's injection and submitted by Pfizer. VAERS collects post-vaccine injury data from other countries, not just the US, and by November 11 2022, two years into the covid vaccination drive, it had published 103,000 British reports. UK citizens suffered multiple serious symptoms including debilitating headache, chest pain and heart abnormalities, anaphylaxis, clots, vision problems, serious autoimmune conditions and tinnitus. Many patients described a metallic taste in the mouth which can be a sign of poisoning, or neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a paralysing, potentially fatal autoimmune condition known to be linked to the Pfizer jab. By December 8, 2021, the UK's Yellow Card Scheme had received69 reports of GBSlinked with Pfizer jabs but did not consider this statistically significant compared with incidence in the wider population. The cause of GBS is 'unknown' or to use a more recent word, 'baffling', meaning it is not possible to rule out vaccination as a cause. According to the respected journalNature,GBS is a known reaction to many vaccines, including covid mRNA. Disturbingly, 13 per cent of the 103,000 VAERS British reports related to the under-25 age group, which according to pathologist Clare Craig dispels the myth that vaccine reactions occur only in the elderly. She said: 'This statistic suggests that young people are not immune to experiencing adverse reactions, challenging the notion that vaccine side effects are coincidences that occur predominantly in older, sicker populations. The median age of individuals reporting adverse events was 41, indicating that middle-aged adults represent a substantial portion of the reports.' The MHRA Yellow Card Scheme recorded 2,240 suspected deaths. AstraZeneca vaccines are associated with most deaths. Pfizer comes a close second. The reports detail cases of death, life-threatening conditions and hospitalisation all linked to the Pfizer jab. Most patients, 83 per cent, were available for follow-up consultations which added credibility, but few were contacted according to the data. Pro-vaxers dismiss the Yellow Card Scheme, collated by our drugs watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), saying that anyone can add them, but most, if not all, events found in VAERS have detailed descriptions probably submitted by clinicians and pharmacists. Distressing examples include a 30-year-old woman with no co-morbidities, who suffered life-threatening anaphylaxis after receiving Pfizer batch number EJ0553 on December 18, 2020. Her throat swelled and her condition was assessed as being 'medically significant and life-threatening'. She was patient report number GB-MHRA-ADR 24545042. One man, age unknown, was admitted to hospital on December 17, 2020, spitting blood, vomiting blood, bleeding from his nose, with headache and dizziness. He suffered a horrible death three days later. His report number is GB-MHRA-ADR 24545199, batch number unknown, and his death was considered 'unexplained'. The batch numbers are significant. The US chart below shows that some batches caused 100 times more adverse events than others. Was this because the public were part of the trial with some vials having more active ingredient than others? A Danish studypublished in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation in July, 2023 suggests this is the case. The population of Denmark is 5.8million and received 52 batches that had three different adverse event outcomes. Researchers examined suspected adverse events (SAEs) for the Pfizer vaccine and produced the graph below. The blue line clearly shows thousands more reactions than the green line, while the yellow line could have been placebo as not a single SAE was reported. The following table relates to the ten worst Pfizer batches used in the UK and was obtained under freedom of information from the MHRA in September 2024. At some stage, probably after 2021, the publicly available reports suddenly disappeared. VAERS published a disclaimer stating that the data had been deleted at the request of the European regulators. Thankfully, Marek Pawlewski, a data scientist who worked in the hi-tech industry for over 30 years, had the foresight to download it. His subsequent analysis (below) highlights important symptoms taken from a list of over 5,000. Neither the MHRA nor any other drug regulatory agency have explained why they failed to pull the covid vaccines. In 2009, the vaccine Pandemrix was introduced during the swine flu pandemic. It was discontinued after34 deaths.Covid vaccines caused 273 per cent more deaths per 1,000 doses compared with Pandemrix but are still available with the MHRA stating 'they are the best defence against covid'. Pawlewski also calculated the harms caused by the flu jab between January 1, 2020 and December 13, 2020, compared with the covid jab a year later from December 14, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Both periods are around 11.5 months. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 50 per cent of the US population were vaccinated with the flu vaccine, and approximately 70 per cent of the US population were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 over the same time frame. The final comparison was adjusted to account for the difference between the uptake of the two jabs. Like the MHRA, VAERS is a victim of under-reporting, receiving around ten per cent of reactions. Some say it could be as low as one per cent. Nevertheless, the calculation shows that a person is 91 times more likely to die after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; that someone is 80 times more likely to be hospitalised after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; a person is 81 times more likely to develop a life-threatening event after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine and someone is 82 times more likely to experience a serious adverse event after a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine. Even with reports that were less serious, someone was 42 times more likely to report a less serious event if they had the covid jab compared with the flu jab. This data was submitted to the Metropolitan Police at Hammersmith Police station in December 2021 by former GP partner Dr Sam White, solicitors Philip Hyland and Lois Bayliss and retired police officer Mark Sexton, as evidence of malfeasance. The team were issued a crime number, 6029679/21, and subsequently sent the police hundreds of official documents provided by scientists including retired Pharma executive Sasha Latypova and former Pfizer Vice President Mike Yeadon. Inexplicably, the police took no further action. Pawlewski said: 'Before all this I was minding my own business and didn't question vaccines. I had one AstraZeneca and had flu symptoms for over a week, my wife had the same and we decided to get no more. Then a friend sent me a video produced by [researcher and computer programmer] Craig Paardekooper who was also tracking data that showed some batches were worse than others. [Paardekooper then started his websiteHow Bad Is My Batch.] I watched it and thought there's no way, then I downloaded the data myself, checked it, and he was right. I then asked my colleague Jason Morphett, an experienced data scientist, to independently review the data. He reached the same conclusion. 'I was shocked and worried for friends and family which is why I shared the information with the police. I thought once they had it, they would stop the vaccine rollout in its tracks, but nothing happened. That woke me up big time.' The MHRA said: 'The MHRA does not directly report suspected adverse drug reaction reports to the US VAERS system. However, vaccine manufacturers are required by US law to submit certain foreign (non-US) source adverse event reports to VAERS. 'We continue to review reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome received following vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines. 'Every medicine or vaccine is assessed by the MHRA independently based on its own benefits and risks. For the Covid-19 vaccines, the benefits continue to outweigh any known side effects.' VAERS state: 'Under US regulations, vaccine manufacturers must report to VAERS each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected, whether foreign or domestic, as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the applicant.' NOTE: By November 11 2021, 701million doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine had been administered, with nearly 800,000 reports of suspected adverse events made to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-11T01:19:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/revealed-pfizers-hidden-vaccine-injuries/
Leicester university hunger strikers for Palestine reach two-week mark,"Hunger strikers at Leicester university have reached the two-week mark in their protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike ""over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide"". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed ""severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower"". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to ""cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS"". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent ""lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be"", but has nonetheless ""chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week"". This means ""forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily"". The students are ""risking their health and education"" in order to push the university to ""sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East"". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a ""facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing"". If you want to support the students, you can share their story and their demands below. You can also sign their open letter in solidarity, and email the university registrar at [email protected].",Canary,2025-01-29T16:18:12+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/29/leicester-university-students-hunger-strike/
"Palestine Action hit FIFTEEN (yes, 15) offices of Allianz in one night","In a coordinated wave of actions across Europe, Palestine Action struck at 15 premises of the 'Allianz' company, investors in and insurers of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company. Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as – without insurance – Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' – despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's ""principle institutional shareholder"", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.",Canary,2025-01-29T16:50:37+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/29/palestine-action-allianz-israel/
Met Police already threatening peaceful protesters at the 'Lord Walney' 16 appeal hearing,"16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the ""soup throwers"" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people – if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were ""the highest of their kind in modern British history"". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a ""paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing"". The court was told the protesters ""acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted"", but ""none of the applicants acted out of self-interest"". Mr Friedman said: ""What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations."" ""They did what they did out of sacrifice,"" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.",Canary,2025-01-29T15:55:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/29/just-stop-oil-lord-walney-16-appeal/
A scathing new report on child poverty just shamed the Labour Party,"The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament – even with high economic growth – if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living – social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change – meaningful change to people's lives – is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net. This needs to be alongside sustainable long-term funding for vital local services provided by councils, such as advice services, local welfare assistance, housing and employment support. We are engaging with the Government on its proposed strategy and working with them to ensure that every child has the best possible start in life.",Canary,2025-01-29T10:29:02+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/jrf-child-poverty/
DWP benefits like PIP are officially GOOD for the economy - despite Labour's propaganda,"Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety​. The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at £12,300. This translates to an estimated £42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the £28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every £1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains £1.48 in wellbeing benefits​. Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him ""a new life"". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence​. Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety​. In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need​. The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms​. As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining—and even expanding—current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.",Canary,2025-01-29T12:24:35+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/dwp-pip-health-benefits/
U-turn from Assisted Dying Bill Committee is barely a win,"In (another) last-minute U-turn, sponsor Kim Leadbeater has finally agreed to hear from a representative of a Deaf and Disabled People's Organisation (DDPO) during an oral evidence session for her controversial Assisted Dying Bill, currently making its way through Parliament. However, DDPO's feel this fig leaf at the final hour is too little, too late in a parliamentary process that has consistently excluded them – and still is. In November, parliament passed Kim Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life Bill) at second reading. MPs voted 330 to 275 – giving it a firm majority of 55. This was despite the fact that every single DPPO – all 350 – has opposed it from the start, and urged MPs to listen to them. Currently, the bill is at the committee stage, and is in the process of gathering evidence. From the start however, Leadbeater had skewed the committee membership in favour of assisted dying. As the Canary pointed out, the majority are also supporters of Leadbeater's bill in its current form, or have made indications they'd want to expand it. Most notably though, Leadbeater had included just one disabled MP in the committee – who happens to be pro-assisted dying. Then, during the first session, Leadbeater and her supporters in the committee voted to exclude disabled activist Ellen Clifford from the upcoming evidence sessions. Clifford is co-ordinator for the UK Deaf and Disabled People's Monitoring Coalition. Specifically, Labour MP Naz Shah had brought a series of amendments to the witness list. One of these was to add Clifford to the line-up. Unsurprisingly, the committee quickly shot this down. Now however, Leadbeater seems to have changed her mind about excluding DDPOs from the sessions – in a probable backhanded way. On Tuesday 28 January, the committee began taking oral evidence from a number of witnesses. Crucially, freshly updated and published amendments showed that Leadbeater had added Disability Rights UK (DR UK) to an upcoming oral evidence session. But here's the catch: Leadbeater has shoehorned DR UK in during an hour-long slot alongside four other witnesses. That the Canary can tell, there are no other slots split between so many witnesses at once. Disability Rights UK is a DDPO that represents 350 organisations. It's also an active member of the UK Deaf and Disabled People's Monitoring Coalition that Clifford co-ordinates. The Coalition welcomed the decision to include DR UK. However, it believes the move has come too late in a process that has been inaccessible and dismissive of deaf and disabled people's concerns. Clifford said that: It's good news that the Committee will be able to hear the perspective from organisations run and controlled by Deaf and Disabled people. Our organisations have expertise in a number of the very complex and difficult issues at the heart of this bill. These are key issues that MPs need to understand before they can be expected to vote in an informed way, for example the lack of any clear line between terminal illness and disability, the difficulties that even very experienced professionals have in detecting coercion, issues about capacity and so on. It is vital that the Committee does not look at legalisation of assisted dying as an abstract question but fully considers the range of evidence that could be at their disposal about the workability of the bill and its implications. Chief Executive of DR UK Kamran Mallick said: It's welcome that the Committee has revised its decision and now included DDPOs within the list of witnesses giving oral evidence over the next few days. Disability Rights UK represents 350 different organisations and are also part of a wider collaborative network of organisations that includes grassroots disabled people led campaign groups and trade union disability committees. No DDPO in the UK is in favour of Assisted Suicide. That isn't some dogmatic, entrenched position. Disability Rights UK only recently changed our position from neutral to against. This is on the basis of Deaf and Disabled people's lived experiences backed up by robust evidence and expertise in disability issues."" Leadbeater and supporters of the Bill have tried to argue that since it's scope is limited to terminally ill patients, it won't impact chronically ill, deaf, and disabled people. However, in an unequal society that disproportionately marginalises disabled people, this is also very clearly not the case. From a higher likelihood of living in poverty, to restricted access to social care support, mental health services, and timely medical care, there are enormous inequities disadvantaging disabled communities. These limited options and support for them to live their lives well mean that they do not have equal chances if they become terminally ill either. Therefore, the suggestion that the Bill is not about chronically ill, deaf and disabled people shows an alarming lack of understanding from MPs. One such example is that of Kevin Caulfield. In his early thirties, he was diagnosed with a 'terminal' HIV-related neurological condition with a prognosis of less than six months to live. He was in a desperate situation both physically and mentally. Caulfield has freely admitted he was so desperate he may well have ""jumped at"" the opportunity of 'assisted dying'. And significantly, he would meet all the criteria of the proposed Bill. However, 27 years later, he is still here. Sharing his story, Caulfield said: At the time I was desperate and may well have jumped at the chance of the choice of ""assisted suicide"". But it would have been a very loaded choice, not a choice at all in my opinion. Why? Because I was scared, I felt I had no control, losing functions by the day or enough relevant support. Assisted dying would have given me a focus when what I needed was more time with loved ones and frank conversations about how to deal better with multiple symptoms. That's why it's so critical to listen to and take seriously Disabled people with relevant experience. Morally that is the right thing to but that takes time and resources to really involve us in accessible ways. Anyone with a terminal diagnosis is a Disabled person in law and yet we are not as Disabled people being treated with equity in this rapid process. It's so important that Parliament does really engage with Disabled Peoples Organisations otherwise they risk getting this very wrong. Of course, if the Bill passes, what Caulfield described would become a very real danger for many disabled people. Spokesperson for Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC) Paula Peters therefore underscored that: We need our voices to be heard about what life is like for disabled people, especially after a decade and a half of austerity. Anyone who is disabled who becomes terminally ill or those with progressive conditions are experiencing that within a context of cuts to all the vital services we rely on to survive. In 2016 the United Nations found the UK government guilty of grave and systematic violations of disabled people's rights. Since then, things have got much worse. According to the new government's plans things are set to get much worse still. You can't give disabled people an equal choice to die until you give us more of an equal choice to live. There are more than 16.1 million of us across the UK so the equalities impacts on should not be an insignificant consideration. Yet, hearing disabled people's voices has been precisely what MPs and the entire process have been failing to do. For one, because Leadbeater introduced this as a private bill, it isn't subject to the Equality Act 2010 in the same way a public bill from the government would be. It is therefore exempt from duties to make sure disabled people have the same opportunities to engage with it as non-disabled people. And it shows. At the start of January, the call for written evidence submissions went out. However, this did not provide information in accessible formats. Moreover, there was no clear information about the deadlines for submitting evidence to the Committee in time for amendments to be made. On top of this, the Telegraph has noted that there are just five weeks to submit evidence: before MPs begin scrutinising the Bill on Feb 11. Paraphrasing, the outlet highlighted Clifford's separate and vital point that: Government-led public consultations on disability issues must last for a minimum of 12 weeks. In short, the pace of the bill process is hugely inaccessible to many chronically ill and disabled people. The lack of targeted outreach and resistance to including a DDPO representative has made it unjustifiably difficult for disabled people to inform the Committee of their concerns and fears about the Bill. Therefore, CEO of Inclusion London Tracey Lazard said on this: We are relieved that a DDPO will now be heard from by MPs on the Committee. However, our concerns about lack of engagement are much wider than just oral evidence. The bill is travelling through Parliament at a speed that is completely inaccessible to Deaf and Disabled people. The cards are powerfully stacked against Deaf and Disabled people to be able to share our expertise with MPs as they scrutinise such an important bill.",Canary,2025-01-29T09:48:03+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/assisted-dying-bill-committee-druk/
Water companies are spreading disinformation to 'manufacture doubt' about sewage spilling,"Privatised water companies are under investigation by environmental regulators for discharging sewage for 3.6 million hours in 2023 into rivers and the sea. Environmental scientists have found that these companies are using disinformation tactics, similar to those tobacco and fossil fuel companies use, to control perceptions about the harm they are doing. The researchers compared the tried and tested tactics with the communications of the nine largest water and sewages companies in England. They found that the water companies have used 22 of 28 tactics from the corporate propaganda playbook to downplay environmental damage, delay action and bring scientific findings into question. Lead author of the research, Professor Alex Ford, of the University of Portsmouth's school of the environment and life sciences and institute of marine sciences, told the Guardian: Water and sewage companies have prolonged environmental injustice by using a playbook of tactics other large polluters have relied upon in the past to mislead the public and influence government agencies or laws. The paper calls for greater regulation of the communications of companies, at a time when the Labour Party government is presenting regulation as 'anti-growth'. This example shows that, actually, regulation is often about the standards we introduce in society. But Labour seems more concerned with putting profit first. One way the water companies deflected blame away from under-investment in infrastructure was to hold the public as mainly responsible for sewage spills. The paper explores a campaign across water companies blaming wet wipe flushing: ""'The Unflushables' (Southern Water), 'Unblocktober' (Thames Water), 'Waging War on Flushable Wipes' (Severn Trent Water), 'Stop the Block' (South West Water) and 'Wipe out Wipes' (Wessex Water)"". The environmental scientists note that this is only a minor issue and confuses the greater picture of a lack of investment causing sewage spills. Water companies also suggested that the only other option instead of sewage spills in rivers was discharging into hospitals and schools, as if the infrastructure couldn't be improved. Further, the report found companies have sanitised language around raw sewage spills through rebranding sewage centres as for ""water recycling"". Since privatisation, water companies have paid out £78bn in dividends – money that could've been invested in infrastructure to improve the sewage system. There is a correlation between public ownership of the water system and a cleaner environment. Countries with water in 100% public ownership like Cyprus, Austria, and Malta have above 95% excellent water in bathing sites. By contrast, the UK has an average of 66.3% excellent water, putting us near the bottom of our European counterparts.",Canary,2025-01-29T09:41:30+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/water-companies-disinformation/
Majority of UK believe the super rich have too much influence over politics,"Two of thirds of Britons hold the opinion that the super rich have too much influence over UK politics, according to polling from Opinium for the Fairness Foundation. The charity's new report details that 25 senior figures from politics, business, and academia hold a consensus that growing inequality risks societal collapse. Supporting that idea, the polling found 63% of Britons believe the super rich hold too much power in UK politics, 40% think the same about business and religion and 38% for international bodies like the EU. The report builds on previous research from the Fairness Foundation that found a dramatic increase in the absolute wealth gap over a recent decade. The gap between the poorest 10% and richest 10% of people in the UK increased by 48% between 2011 and 2019. For the actual amounts: in 2011, the richest 10% held £7.5 trillion in wealth and by 2019 that had increased to £11 trillion. (And the wealthiest 1% owns not far off half of this, in both cases). By contrast, the poorest 10% went from £12bn in debt to £11bn in debt during that time. There's also been a relative decline of the middle class. The wealth gap between the middle 10% and the richest 10% rose by 49% over the same period. Between the group of 25 figures from society, ""there was agreement with the suggestion that we are currently on a trajectory of decline, with wealth inequality undermining social cohesion and a risk of further deterioration without intervention"". They argued that ""wealthy interests have effectively captured media and political narratives, using their dominance of the national conversation to argue that the status quo is the only way"". Indeed, only 7% of UK people attend private school. Yet research from the Sutton Trust found that 43% of the UK's top journalists went to a fee paying school. Another way to see how the very rich dominate politics is through the education of politicians themselves. Boris Johnson was the 20th prime minister (out of 58) to have attended Eton. More broadly, only 11 prime ministers were educated at non-fee paying schools and many of those at grammar schools. We know a super rich minority funds the Conservative party. But even Labour under Keir Starmer's stewardship has super rich people bankrolling it. Since he became leader in April 2020, the party has accepted 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping £23.6m from just a handful of people. The report recommends ""reforming our political system, for example by strengthening our inadequate lobbying regulations."" The Labour Party government is so far doing worse than the previous Conservatives on corporate lobbying, Spotlight on Corruption warned in a December briefing. Of 12 recommendations for government transparency and the lobbying register on Spotlight on Corruption's 'scorecard', the Tories fully met three, while Labour has fully met just one proposal. Neither party has committed to including so-called 'informal' lobbying arrangements in the transparency releases, meaning friendly influence remains off the books. And consultant lobbyists do not even have to declare the subject matter of their lobbying at present. The report notes there are precedents to significant reforms: ""The most obvious recent example is the 1945 creation of the welfare state, but... Britain in the 19th century avoided the revolutions that swept continental Europe through a series of enlightened economic and political reforms, such as the Great Reform Act and the repeal of the Corn Laws"".",Canary,2025-01-28T18:58:38+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/fairness-foundation-report/
"Instead of tracking UK flights supporting genocide, the Telegraph is tracking refugee boats","RAF Akrotiri has been participating in Israel's genocide in Gaza for over a year. But the Telegraph is one of many mainstream media outlets in the UK which have failed to report on that. Instead, the Telegraph thinks its big and clever to publish a ""small boats tracker"" focusing on the people who have been escaping war, poverty, and repression to seek a better life in the UK. We absolutely should talk about immigration, of course. Because Britain is ageing, and we have big skills shortages. Many employers, especially in key areas like health and care, can't fill their vacancies. Successive governments, meanwhile, refuse to invest appropriately in the education and healthcare sectors to improve the situation. And although people from other countries have a great track record of stepping in to help while contributing more to public finances than average Brits, governments routinely place obstacles to them doing so. This situation needs to change. Because British citizens aren't going to magically have more kids overnight. Childcare and housing costs keep rising, incomes and job stability are a big concern, and the future isn't looking particularly bright, so it's no wonder that people who can make an informed choice either choose not to have kids or to delay doing so. The Telegraph points out that ""smugglers have ferried more than 150,000 migrants across the English Channel since government records began in 2018 – most often in inflatable small boats"". That's in six years, and 93% of those people claimed asylum (authorities usually accept only around half of these claims). To put this into perspective, the UK allowed around 213,000 people from Ukraine in less than two years between 2022 and 2024. As the government's own statistics clarify: The number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in the UK in 2022 was equivalent to the number of people granted refuge in the UK from all origins, in total, between 2014 and 2021. Nonetheless, the Telegraph doesn't appear to have had a 'Ukrainian refugee tracker'. Ukrainians didn't really need to arrive in boats. People from countries the UK and its allies have invaded or interfered with in the past, however, do. As the Telegraph says, the most common countries people on the small refugee boats came from last year were Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Iran. The real crisis surrounding immigration is that British governments don't take responsibility for their actions or address the true causes of immigration. Britain is a junior partner to the destructive US imperialist project, furthering conflicts abroad for its economic benefit. The right thing to do would be to welcome in civilians who suffer as a result. But because racism and xenophobia are effective tools for distracting people from the super-rich individuals and their lackeys who are truly responsible for Britain's problems, the country only opens its arms wide when the victims are white Christians. Economic demand pulls people to the UK. And what pushes people from their own countries is the urge to seek a better life by escaping from death, destruction, repression, and poverty resulting from the global economic system which US imperialism champions. There are solutions out there, but none are likely to happen any time soon: We desperately need to find a sustainable global way of living, without exploitation. But propagandists like the Telegraph prefer to keep people in rich nations distracted by scaremongering about people from poor nations. To challenge that, every time we speak about immigration we need to centre the conversation on the small number of obscenely wealthy people who accumulate extreme levels of money as a direct or indirect result of the poverty or suffering of others. That is the system responsible for everything, and that needs to be our focus.",Canary,2025-01-28T16:29:20+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/telegraph-asylum-seekers-tracker/
The repression of the pro-Palestine movement at Birmingham University should be a national scandal,"Expressing ourselves freely is a basic human right, and freedom of speech is an important part of this expression. Nowhere is it more important than in universities, where ideas need to be challenged, new perspectives developed, and independent thinking among students and staff should be the norm. Although the Equality Act is already in place on campuses, to make sure students are protected from harassment and unlawful discrimination, censorship has become a real issue in recent years, and there are growing concerns that not enough is being done to uphold free speech in colleges and universities. Students, staff, and union members, in campuses across Britain, are facing growing repression and intimidation tactics, because of their actions, words and beliefs, and the University of Birmingham (UoB) is no exception. Peaceful protest over Israel's genocide in Gaza has resulted in UoB students facing disciplinary procedures, which may even result in expulsion and prevent them from graduating. This attempt to clampdown on dissent comes at a time when the university has also revised its Code of Practice on Freedom of Speech, carried out without consultation with the staff unions, or any explanation as to how the changes were linked to new aspects of the law. The University of Birmingham branch of the University and College Union (BUCU) believes there are several issues with its effectiveness, so have submitted a set of changes to the Code, which it says make it workable, and addresses legitimate safety concerns, but does not inhibit free speech. Andrew Olson is Vice President of BUCU, and Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Birmingham. He told the Canary: What we found, examining the code, were many problems. It is very broad – seemingly covering all activities of teaching and research, so that it's not clear what you don't have to ask permission for. There is also no obligation on the University to have an open and transparent process for making decisions. Every event must have a named organiser, and they need to ask for authorization 14 days before any event, otherwise they could be refused. This could frequently be reasonable but won't be if activities are responding to changing events. The University has also asked for 'measures to ensure opposing views can be put forward lawfully'. But, in many contexts, whether university seminars or demonstrations and protests, people are advocating for a particular view. That cannot be prohibited if there is to be free and open discussion, debate and protest. According to Olson, it is now unclear to some staff members whether they will get into trouble for discussing something, so they start to think 'That's a controversial topic, I'd better not include that'. This includes not just those working in areas such as the Middle East, but also those talking about topics such as gender, race and class. But, he says, if these staff knew they were protected, they would not think like this. ""I think its important to have that space in a university, where these types of conversations are allowed, even encouraged, and where the university supports that. The university is unlikely to care about, or want to control all these different areas but, if someone else suddenly becomes interested in them, they then have the tools to do that,"" Olson explains. Back in December 2023, the UoB prevented the go ahead of an event discussing law in Palestine, because of the inclusion on the flyer, of watermelons, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity. The discussion was cancelled at the last minute, with no explanation given at the time, although UoB eventually claimed the event was only postponed and would take place at a later date, but this has never happened. Olson said: In my mind, indefinite postponement is the same thing as cancelling. But normally they don't do that. The main way we see this code operating to keep debate invisible, or make sure it doesn't happen, or keep it away from the rest of the university community, is not through explicit forbidding of things. Instead, they operate through active intimidation, and making people view lots of things to get activities approved. They delay things and set vague conditions that mean activities are either difficult to do, or are less effective. Students, staff and UCU members say the university not only uses tactics of intimidation against them, but also accuses them of acts of intimidation. Olson noted: They have done this to me. I went with the students to the Vice Chancellor's office, to deliver a letter about the situation in Gaza and University involvement in related activities. It was from the students and also signed by both unions – UCU and UNISON. Afterwards, I was accused of intimidating staff from the VC's office. I was there as a member of staff to support students, as a member of the UCU, representing the local branch as an officer, and as an open member of the group who could be a point of reference for both staff and students. The students were fearful because they felt threatened by the university. I felt that I could provide a supportive presence, and act as a potential mediator if the situation required that. The students were insistent, but not threatening, about wanting to see the VC, but he was not in. We delivered the letter and that was it. So I was surprised to be contacted by the Director of Human Resources afterwards. One student, who wants to remain anonymous, was part of the committee of UoB Friends of Palestine, and therefore had to attend many meetings with the Vice Chancellor and other university staff. This meant he was known to the university. He told the Canary: I received an unexpected email from the uni, saying I was being investigated, but I had no idea what it was about. At their meeting, I was blamed for being at a protest, although I was not even on campus. I was shown a video of an 'unauthorized' protest, and a student who was obviously not me. They knew it wasn't me but wanted to pin the blame on someone. They asked me if I had organized the protest, knew who had organized it, or knew who had taken part in it. But I knew nothing, as I was not there, and the university had to admit it was wrong. But the false accusations are nothing new. Back in 2014, UoB student Simon Furse accused the university of using legal action to deter dissent on campus, as he was cleared of assaulting a security guard during a protest about tuition fees. The case against him collapsed although not before Furse and other students were arrested, disciplined, and suspended from the university when a video emerged showing the story had been fabricated. The University of Birmingham is also currently taking disciplinary action against two of its students. Antonia Listrat, a final year International Law and Globalization student, started her disciplinary process last October, and her hearing is today (28 January). She is accused of participating in 'unauthorised' protests, for being part of the pop up encampment on campus during welcome week, and protesting outside the university Investment Subcommittee meeting last May. Listrat argues that: Senior management were at the Welcome Week event, taking photos and intimidating us. We were told they were going to find out who we were and expel all of us. It was never just me, it was a group effort, and I was never an organiser. It's not feasible to have organisers. We do not want anyone to have a target on their back, and be named. The university's said we've been threatening and intimidating, and using inappropriate language or behaviour, but these claims are part of a larger pattern of criminalizing students. It's rooted in anti-Palestinian racism. We wear Palestinian Keffiyehs to cover our faces, but during the student encampment court case last year, someone from the university gave evidence against us, saying students were wearing balaclavas to intimidate people. We weren't wearing balaclavas. No one has ever worn a balaclava, and we are not intimidating! They also said we were threatening to Jewish students, but this isn't the case. There are Jewish students who are pro-Palestinian and protest with us. Although the International Court of Justice has ruled Israel's occupation of Palestine to be illegal, Amnesty International has concluded Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, governments are still not acting. Listrat says: It's up to the people to uphold the law, if the governments don't do it. But this disciplinary has made me feel like my right to protest has been violated and denied. So many people are scared right now, and feel desperate they can't take any action because of potential consequences. It's horrible. Protesting has been a way of doing something and it's been great for my mental health, but now that's been suppressed and I've been silenced, it feels like I've been disempowered. Mariyah Ali, a final year English and Creative Writing student at the UoB, wanted to take a PGCE and become a teacher, but now has no idea if she will even graduate this summer. Disciplinary action is also being taken against Ali, after she attended the protest outside the Investments Committee meeting last year. She told the Canary: As students, we're taught you get educated to get a good job, have critical thinking, and also to make the world a better place. How am I going to make the world a better place, when the university I learn and study at is involved in a genocide? I feel the university is a complicit institution, because it has research partnerships, working with arms companies that fund and give weapons to Israel. I didn't sign up to be involved in that when I came to the University of Birmingham. If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come, but now that I do have that information, I feel that we, as students, have a moral responsibility to fight that. After 15 minutes of chanting, being told to leave, and photographed by a staff member, Ali says the meeting stopped and staff left through a back door. Shortly afterwards, the students decided it was now not worth continuing, so they stopped the protest and left. Two weeks went by, before Ali received a disciplinary letter from the university, the only member of the protest to get one. This was followed, in June, by an interview in which Ali was accused of being intimidating, using offensive language and disrupting the university's business. ""The point of a protest is to be disruptive. However, I did deny the fact that I was intimidating or threatening in any way, as protesting against genocide definitely isn't intimidating, and it's my right! It feels like the university is trying to target specific individuals and use us as examples to scare the rest of the student movement on campus,"" she says. Ali claims she then emailed the university, asking for timelines and evidence, but received no reply. In September, after hearing nothing, and not even knowing if she could go into her final year with a disciplinary, Ali again messaged the university. This time they responded, saying she could go into her final year and keep studying, while they investigate. Back in summer, UoB took its students to court, in an effort to shut down their pro-Palestine encampment on its grounds – a move which Ali described at the time as a 'censoring tactic'. The university won, so Ali, who was the only named defendant, was required to pay the legal fees – which amounted to £60,000. She instead signed a contract with the university, in which she forfeited her rights to protest on campus. If there is a breach of contract, not only will Ali have to pay the £60K fine but she will also get a criminal conviction. Ali told the Canary: They say I can't be involved in any 'unauthorised' protest – but they haven't highlighted what an unauthorised protest actually is. I have only been participating in the student-staff ones, as these have been organised by the unions and so there is a level of safety involved here. It's been hard because security know who I am, and I know they are watching me. These things are all happening at the same time to me, and I'm in my final year. It's affected me mentally, and very much academically. Unlike other universities, the University of Birmingham has no timeframe for disciplinary processes, and it's not possible to graduate with an ongoing disciplinary. I don't feel the uni is following the procedures. This has been ongoing since my second year but, during the whole process, they're not giving me any evidence for what I've been accused of. The only thing they mentioned in the interview is that they have eyewitness statements from Student Affairs. Earlier this month, she was told her disciplinary had been escalated, and she had been found guilty of breaking the rules. The news came as Ali and Listrat are increasing their efforts to get justice. They have not only launched a petition – which they hope everyone will sign – calling on the UoB to drop the disciplinary action against then, uphold free speech, and end the repression of pro-Palestine student activism on campus, but have also set up the UoB 2 Campaign. Their campaigns have gained the support of many people, including Jeremy Corbyn MP, the musician Brian Eno, and UN Special Rapporteur, Gina Romero: As UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association, Romero is committed to promoting and protecting these rights worldwide. According to her, the response of universities to pro-Palestine solidarity protests has 'exposed a hostile environment for the exercise of fundamental rights, including freedom of peaceful assembly and association'. Romero told the Canary: Reports of violence, harassment, and academic reprisals against students and faculty—particularly Palestinian and Arab individuals—severely undermine freedom of expression and discourage public participation. This risks alienating a generation and eroding trust in democratic processes. I have specifically raised concerns with the University of Birmingham about allegations of harassment and disciplinary actions tied to its protest authorization system, which appears to conflict with international standards on the right to peaceful protest. To date, I have not received a response. Universities must recognize that their responsibility extends beyond campus borders – their actions have the potential to shape political discourse, culture, civic education, and ultimately, the future sustainability of democracy, freedoms and human rights. The University of Birmingham was contacted for comment on the above points, and also asked why they have, so far, failed to respond to respond to the letter from Gina Romero, UN Special Rapporteur. A University of Birmingham spokesperson came back to us with this expected reply: The University of Birmingham has a very strong and longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom – supported by our Code of Practice. In the last term alone, supported by our Freedom of Speech process, several activities, events, and protests organised by those wishing to express their support of Palestine, as well as a range of other issues of concern to members of the University community, have taken place on campus. We are unable to comment on active case matters involving individual students. According to Dr Lucie Ryzova, Senior Lecturer in Middle East History at UoB, and a BUCU Committee Member, the failure to think critically – and push back against censorship and self-censorship alike – is what enables the banality of evil. Ryzova says her colleagues' apparent indifference to the genocide in Gaza – either through fear of being accused of antisemitism, or the misguided perception that they have a duty to support their Jewish friends and colleagues – have left her feeling angry, deeply disenchanted, and increasingly alienated from her white British academic colleagues. She told the Canary: At this point, this is either due to ignorance or covert racism. The inability to distinguish between Jewishness and Zionism is as prevalent among my supposedly intellectual colleagues as it is inexcusable. These university professors are supposed to be the intelligentsia. No, they are not! They are either cowards, ignoramuses or racists. It is blatantly obvious that Israel is a fascist regime, bent on realizing the 'final solution' for the Palestinians. Support for it among many white Western audiences is really about maintaining white supremacy. University management has attempted to intimidate and silence Ryzova several times. In one instance, she was called to the office of her 'line manager' to talk about a 'matter of concern'. It turned out that she made a Zionist student feel 'uncomfortable', while teaching her specialist topic, modern Egypt: My line manager said I needed to make sure all my students feel 'comfortable', but I said nope. We teach slavery, which makes some white people feel uncomfortable; does that mean we are not supposed to teach it? Or suppose a colleague teaches about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are we supposed to take the Russian perspective into account and care about the feelings of Russian people in the room? But Ryzova says there was another incident, this time a 'painful and revengeful' one, 'which had been prepared a long time ago, and came out of nowhere'. As part of an informal departmental seminar, which did not need permission as it was behind closed doors and had no outside guests, they had a debate on Gaza. But it did not go well. Ryzova, says she was yelled at by a Zionist colleague, who said Gaza should not be discussed. The incident faded away but, nine months later, in October 2024, when she organized and chaired the seminar as usual, there was a misunderstanding between two of her colleagues, which had nothing to do with politics: My line manager sent me a message saying I wasn't doing my job properly, and we needed to rethink the seminar because of past complaints against my organizing and chairing of it. They said I was creating an 'insufficiently inclusive environment'. I fought back, and brought testimonies by many colleagues saying the opposite, but to no avail. So, they've closed down the whole seminar, because in January 2024 I spoke about Gaza. It's like they'd been waiting all that time for the right opportunity to shut me down. Although the academic futures of Ali and Listrat futures are uncertain, they hope a public outcry may lead to the disciplinary actions being dropped, as has recently happened at the London School of Economics (LSE). Disciplinary action it took against seven of its students has ended, after a powerful campaign and huge public outcry. LSE had banned the students from campus, and given them disciplinary action after a protest over LSE's investments in companies complicit in the Gaza genocide.

Now British Palestinians have weighed in over the Met Police/Palestine march scandal,"A letter organised by the British Palestinian Committee, the largest umbrella organisation of Palestinian groups in this country, has expressed grave concern at Met policing of a pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January, which resulted in 77 arrests and charges under the Public Order being brought against organisers. The letter to the home secretary Yvette Cooper joins calls for an independent inquiry and the dropping of charges against those arrested. It adds to the demands from civil society organisations such as such as Liberty and Amnesty International UK for the repealing of repressive Public Order legislation. The letter says the issue has ""profound implications for the British Palestinian community and its ongoing struggle for justice"". Events on Saturday at the national Palestine protest have drawn a wave of criticism from across the political and social spectrum towards the Met Police. The Met reneged on a previous agreement to allow a march from BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, a route taken several times before. It then sought to impose a route the pro-Israel Board of Deputies publicly claimed that it had proposed to the police. This was rejected by the Palestine Coalition organising group. Finally, the Met banned any alternative march route allowing only a rally in Whitehall. On the day there was a massive police presence, with police obstructing the gathering for the rally in many respects. There was an unusually high number of arrests of protestors. The chief steward who organises the demonstrations for the Palestine Coalition in discussion with police was violently arrested on the day, and with the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign subsequently charged with offences under the Public Order Act. Two MPs – Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell – who attended the protest have also been interviewed under caution by the police. BPC said that the British Palestinian community is disproportionately affected by restrictions on rights to protest, and ""the curtailment of these rights, combined with the policing of protests in a manner that appears politically motivated, not only undermines democratic freedoms but also silences voices advocating for justice and human rights"". Dr Sara Husseini, director of the BPC, said: The policing crackdown seen on 18th January sits in a wider context of criminalisation and repression of our community and those advocating for Palestinian rights in Britain. Palestinians in Britain have seen repeated and intensifying attacks on our ability to express ourselves, describe our history and experiences, and advocate for our inalienable rights. This is particularly egregious at a time when we have watched 15 months of Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza, for which our own government in Britain has provided continual, near unchecked, military, diplomatic and political support.",Canary,2025-01-28T11:36:21+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/british-palestinian-committee/
25 charities call on Labour to free Gaie Delap just as she's given 20 more days in prison,"Climate protester Gaie Delap has been told that she must serve a further 20 days in prison for being ""unlawfully at large"" – just as 25 leading charities call on the Labour government to release her. Gaie's additional 20 days is accounted for by the days that followed Serco/EMS's report of 28 November on their failure to fit an appropriate tag on her wrist, and her eventual return to prison just before Christmas. During this time, waiting to be arrested, she was fully compliant with her curfew and did nothing wrong. As has been previously disclosed, Serco/EMS reported they were unable to fit a tag because their smallest straps were too big for her wrists, despite them being within the usual range for UK females. EMS also reported the reason for breach as ""refusal for install [sic]"", saying Gaie ""would not let us install Electronic Equipment during our visits"". This was a lie. She has never refused a tag or any other EMS Electronic Equipment. Instead of being released on the expected date of 17 March as stated in her recall papers, Gaie has now been informed by prison authorities that she will be kept in prison until 7 April. Her recall will have cost the public purse £20,000. Family and friends, in parallel with legal approaches, have appealed to Labour Party minister Shabana Mahmood, secretary of state for justice who made the decision to recall, to use her discretionary powers to rescind this decision. This latest news coincides with the release of an open letter from twenty-five charities calling on Shabana Mahmood to revoke Gaie's recall to prison to ensure her re-release on Home Detention Curfew under conditions that respect her health and dignity. You can read the open letter here. Part of it says that ""this situation is not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern of failures associated with private contractors managing electronic monitoring services. Notably, Serco has previously been implicated in overcharging the UK government for electronic tagging, including billing for individuals who were deceased, incarcerated, or had left the country"": These historical and ongoing issues underscore the systemic problems inherent in outsourcing critical public services to private entities without adequate oversight. Mick Delap, Gaie's brother said: How come that it has proved so impossible to fit this normal-sized woman, who desperately wants to have electronic monitoring, with any one of the many different forms of monitoring available to the authorities? That was true of the time she was waiting at home, and has continued to be true in the month since she has been back in prison. How come that there has been a deafening silence from the Ministry of Justice since Gaie's return to prison despite numerous appeals from her family, friends and her MP? And, perhaps most crucially, how come those with ultimate responsibility for the proper functioning of Serco/EMS – the MoJ and Parliament – are so blatantly failing to hold them to account? Family friend Mike Campbell added: A flawed process led to Gaie's recall. This will cost the taxpayer up to £20,000. Her re-incarceration represents a clear miscarriage of justice. She now faces double jeopardy, two punitive measures resulting solely from the unavailability of suitable electronic monitoring equipment. This is a cruel decision. Our criminal justice and penal system has failed, in Gaie's case, to meet the standards of proportionality, fairness, and respect for human dignity that should be the cornerstone of justice in the UK. Immediate action is required to correct this systemic failing not just for the sake of Gaie, but of hundreds of women being failed by the system. The Ministry of Justice will know how to access a number of electronic monitoring devices suitable for use by Gaie. There is no possible reason for one of these not to be fitted while she is in prison and then released.",Canary,2025-01-28T11:25:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/gaie-delap-recalled/
What better way to end the month than to watch Wes Streeting being heckled?,"The Fabian Society's New Year Conference hosting Wes Streeting as the keynote speaker was disrupted by an activist calling on the Labour Party to end tree-burning subsidies for Drax Power Station. Yet days before, left-wing Labour MP Barry Gardiner came out fighting over the company – calling it ""not fit and proper"". The Fabian conference on Saturday 25 January together key government ministers, journalists, and organisations, this year around the theme 'Britain 2030'. An activist interrupted health secretary Wes Streeting's speech to draw attention to the 'devastating' health impacts of biomass production: They accused the government of funding toxic air pollution in the UK and abroad by subsidising Drax and the biomass industry using a levy off UK energy bills. Another protester spoke out as well: Labour is currently considering whether to grant further subsidies to Drax, the UK's single largest carbon emitter which also makes considerable donations to the Labour Party, when its current subsidies run out in 2027. More than 40 environmental NGOs are calling on the government to reject this proposal. Drax has repeatedly been accused of 'driving environmental racism' through their woody biomass pellet production process, with high levels of toxic pollutants emitted on production sites predominantly located in low-income communities of colour: Around midday on 25 January, partway through the keynote speech, an activist disrupted the event – challenging Wes Streeting over his party's refusal to rule out renewing subsidies for Drax. Standing up in the hall to address him directly, the activist highlighted the inherent health risks of climate inaction. 'We cannot heal the NHS on a sick planet!' the protestor told Streeting. Members of the audience could be heard cheering for the activist. She was taken out of the room by security: Rosie Gloster, spokesperson for Axe Drax, said: The Government has the opportunity to end years of suffering inflicted on communities abroad by ending subsidies for Drax. There are whole communities struggling to breathe in the US due to Drax's operations. Drax is destroying vital forests, poisoning communities and polluting our planet. As Secretary of State for Health Wes Streeting must listen to the communities abroad suffering the devastating health impacts of Drax's dirty pollution and put an end to subsidies for Drax. By contract, Labour Party MP Barry Gardiner accused Drax of 'not being fit and proper'. It was during the Climate and Nature Bill debate last week – the Bill that Labour torpedoed. Gardiner said: We cannot allow the damage to old growth and to virgin forests that we know is happening in Canada... The people concerned in Drax are not fit and proper to run the company, and we should not be paying them. Sam Simmons, spokesperson for Climate Resistance, said: It's never been more obvious that the climate crisis is a health crisis. In the space of three months we've seen thousands lose their homes to the LA wildfires, mass power outages in Scotland and Ireland from storm Éowyn, and hundreds of deaths in the Valencia floods. It is an outrage in the wake of all these catastrophes that our energy bills are still being used to fund environmentally destructive projects like Drax Power Station. If the Labour government wants to protect the health of UK citizens it must end tree-burning subsidies now.

Palestine Action SMASH a van into an arms factory to STOP it killing Palestinians,"At around 5am on Tuesday 28 January, Palestine Action crashed a van into front of Teledyne Defence and Space in Shipley – yet another arms manufacturer complicit in Israel's ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The van hit the main perimeter: Activists then attached themselves to the vehicle in order to disrupt the factory's shipments of weapons parts to be used against the people of Palestine and Lebanon. The site was previously targeted twice by Palestine Action with rooftop occupations involving dismantling the factory. Before then, Palestine Action dismantled its 'Teledyne Labtech' factory at Presteigne, Wales, in 2022 where it caused £1m in losses. The site, between 2009 and 2014, was granted at least 86 licenses for the export of weapons to Israel – mostly for 'ML11'-category military electronics equipment and 'ML4' category explosive weapons, munitions, or parts therefor. After 2014, the company's sales and licensing were handled by the parent company 'Teledyne UK', which continued to export vast quantities of ML4 and ML11 weapons to Israel as part of its 48 export licenses granted between 2014 and 2020. The American company Teledyne has a $5.6bn yearly turnover and is, along with its subsidiary ev2, the largest exporter (by volume of licenses granted) of weaponry from Britain to Israel. A significant proportion of the company's almost 200 export licenses for weapons and weapons parts to the US, 2009-2020, will also form into finished products ultimately exported to Israel. Teledyne Defence and Space, Shipley, manufactures critical components for missile systems – specifically missile filters – which will comprise the ML4 exports made yearly from the site. Teledyne Defence and Space boasts of its involvement with missile products procured by Israel, including the AGM-Harpoon, AIM-120 AMRAAM, and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles deployed by Israel against Gaza – the latter reportedly being used to strike Al-Shifa hospital. Teledyne Defence and Space also produces components for the American's Tomahawk and Patriot missiles, deployed by US forces against Yemen. The company also produces parts, including filters and multi-function assemblies, for UAVs (drones), aircraft, and radar systems, including the AN/APG-81 (AESA) type fitted in Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighter jets. Teledyne Defence and Space, solely based in Shipley, has sales representatives in Tel Aviv. Shipley-made products can be seen advertised by Ormic Components, the sales company for the Israeli military market. Teledyne, the parent company, also produces image sensors for military applications and radar technologies around the borders of the occupied West Bank and Gaza while also providing armed UAVs to Israel as far back as 1973. A recent investigation by Declassified also uncovered two shipments from the Teledyne Shipley site which were addressed ""to a location near the Israeli air force's (IAF) Hatzerim air base in the Negev desert, which houses fighter jets as well as the IAF Flight Academy"". A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We are more committed than ever before to disrupting the production of weapons used to massacre our brothers and sisters in Palestine. Whilst our government remains an active participant in Israeli war crimes, it's the duty of ordinary people to take direct action to shut down the merchants of death.""",Canary,2025-01-28T10:59:15+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/palestine-action-teledyne-van-shipley/
A 'life-changing' new research centre for deafblind people is opening,"A new deafblind UK centre for education and research based at Birmingham City University (BCU) has been hailed as ""life-changing"" and a ""game changer"" in the fight to address the ""frustrating and overwhelming isolation"" felt by many deafblind people. The centre, which is the first of its kind, will connect researchers, practitioners, and people living with deafblindness to increase knowledge and raise awareness It will also equip junior researchers and the workforce with the knowledge and skills to become future leaders in deafblindness research and practice. British Labour Party politician Lord Blunkett, who is himself blind, said ""A great deal is known about sensory challenges for blind people and those with profound deafness, but much less about the dual challenges that deafblind people encounter on a daily basis"": This Centre will make an important contribution – both to greater understanding and public awareness to the ways in which social and technological innovation can assist in the future. Deafblind UK CEO Nikki Morris added: There's an urgent need to better understand the impact of deafblindness on people and their loved ones. This new Centre will help to fill that gap. David Childs, associate professor, head of College of Education and Social Work at BCU, said ""This Centre will be a game changer in how we understand more about deafblindness and what we can do to make the lives of all those affected better: The research undertaken in this area is shockingly low. The new Centre won't just meet the knowledge gap, it will be an important beacon of hope to those affected by dual sensory loss. Deafblindness affects everyone in different ways. Some people might have mild sight and hearing loss whereas others can't see or hear anything. It can be isolating and lonely and can lead to mental health issues – but it's far more common than many people realise. Around 450,000 people are affected by sight and hearing loss in the UK. ""The spectrum of deafblindness is unique,"" said Deafblind UK member Ricky Blair: Certain situations are isolating and overwhelming, like knowing when it's your place to speak. Frustratingly, there are often adjustments in place for those who are deaf or blind. People often forget that many people have to grapple with both disabilities simultaneously. Deafblind UK partnered with BCU in 2019. The University went on to launch the Certificate and Diploma in Professional Studies (Deafblind Studies) in collaboration with Deafblind UK and a consortium of charities in 2021, welcoming its first cohort of students in March 2022. The only one its kind in the UK, the course is run by BCU's Dr Peter Simcock, who is internationally renowned for his work and will lead the new Centre. ""Helen Keller, author, disability rights advocate, political activist and perhaps one of the world's most well-known deafblind people, described life as either a daring adventure or nothing at all,"" said Dr Simcock, an Associate Professor of Social Work and a Deafblind UK ambassador: Our Deafblind UK Centre will play a vital role in responding to the urgent need for more research, supporting deafblind people to enjoy this daring adventure to the full.",Canary,2025-01-28T10:04:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/deadblind-birmingham-centre/
DWP admits cost of living payments failed to properly support disabled people,"Chronically ill and disabled Universal Credit claimants saw their health deteriorate across the course of 2023 – despite receiving the former Conservative government's flagship cost of living payments. In other words, the extra payment failed to enable recipients to maintain their health amidst the spiralling rise in living expenses. Crucially, the Department for Work and Pension's (DWP) own report has confirmed what we already knew – that the additional payments didn't ""scratch the surface"" of chronically ill and disabled claimants' financial struggles. Between 2022 and 2024, the Conservative government awarded two rounds of cost of living payments to some benefits claimants. However, the Canary's Steve Topple calculated at the time that the DWP was denying these to around 1.6 million people. Notably, this included many chronically ill and disabled people. This is because the DWP didn't include certain benefits in its eligibility criteria for them. Among those it excluded were disability benefits such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA). The government made it so contributory or new-style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) also didn't qualify for the payment. Instead, the government made a one-off £150 lump sum to people claiming disability benefits such as PIP and DLA. It paid this out in April 2023. At the time, many were raising the alarm bells over this woefully insufficient offering. Now, the DWP's own report confirms what the Canary and others had been saying all along. That is, that the paltry payment didn't make a dent in chronically ill and disabled people's expenses under the soaring cost of utilities and essentials. The Conservative government originally launched a review into the cost of living payments in late 2023. The DWP has now published this. And the results are about what you might expect. The evaluation surveyed claimants receiving the most recent round of payments. This covered the department giving people £900, split into three payments across 2023, and early 2024. It paid the first one in April 2023, the second payment of £300 in October/November that year, and the third payment of £299 in February 2024. For this cohort, it attained 2,608 survey responses in total. On top of this, it evaluated the impacts of the pensioner cost of living payment. In particular, it gave this to pensioners that received the Winter Fuel Payment (WFP). It increased £200/300 payments to £500 for households with a resident of State Pension age. For households with a resident over 80, it went up to £600. In this instance, 1,022 pensioners responded to the survey. It also reviewed the so-called disability cost of living payment. There were 881 responses for this group. Needless to say, this one-off payment was a drop in the ocean to chronically ill and disabled claimants. Recipients of the 'disability' cost of living payment described its impact: as minimal. They felt that £150 was not enough to make a difference to the cost of living pressures they were facing Of course, this is likely because the small one-off lump sum paled in comparison to the soaring cost of living. That's not even to mention that majority of disabled claimant recipients had significant additional health-related expenses. The review found this to be the case in 68% of the people it surveyed over the payment. So it's little wonder that one recipient summed up the situation saying: It didn't really scratch the surface of what we have to pay. It just kind of disappeared in the bank account, really. However, as it turns out, the cost of living payment didn't do a lot of good for those that got it either. Even for chronically ill and disabled people the DWP did give the main cost of living payment to, it was little more than a short-lived stopgap measure. Notably, disabled claimants comprised 63% of the survey's main cost of living payment recipients. So to start, the report identified how these disabled recipients had additional health-related expenses for things like medical costs, transport, and aids. Then, it noted how disabled recipients had: increasingly struggled to meet those expenses. For the core cost of living payment recipients, 43% had expressed how the rising prices of living essentials had meant their extra health-related costs: had become a lot harder to afford over the last year. In other words, spiralling prices of goods and services was eating up money that chronically ill and disabled people might have directed towards managing and living with their conditions. Only just over half (54%) of disabled cost of living recipients were able to spend any of their payment on their health needs. To make matters worse, chronically ill and disabled recipients already had higher costs to contend with in the first place. Predictably then, the report said that recipients: who had additional health-related expenses were more likely to feel that energy bills, food, and other bills had become more difficult to afford over the last year, compared to those without additional health-related expenses. Obviously, the increased costs of living essentials had therefore hit chronically ill and disabled people harder. The report acknowledged this further, stating that: Qualitative interviews revealed that health needs could also lead to higher costs. For example, recipients noticed a significant increase in energy and utility bills driven by using more electricity for medical equipment like mobility scooters and oxygen containers. Participants also needed to keep the heating on for longer to manage conditions like arthritis, as colder temperatures would aggravate the pain. This was also true for older participants who kept their heating on to support their mobility. Crucially though, the survey followed up with recipients after the cost of living payments. This revealed that the DWP's three the cost of living payments had made no difference to them being able to cover their health-related expenses. Instead, it found that: a large proportion of recipients continued to find health-related expenses difficult to afford. Most significantly however, the follow-up highlighted how: participants experienced a deterioration in their physical health over the course of the study. To sum up: the health of chronically ill and disabled recipients of the £900 cost of living payment had actually got worse during the period the DWP had paid this out. Of course, this also impacted family members acting as carers for their chronically ill and disabled loved ones. Specifically, it detailed that it had exacerbated their mental health due to the: compounding pressure of additional caring duties and the need to work more hours to meet rising costs. This on top of the fact that people claiming Carer's Allowance were also ineligible for the payment only makes that all the worse too. The report skirted around offering an explanation for this, noting only that: This decline was attributed to either worsening pre-existing health conditions or diagnoses of new conditions. Participants noted that their declining health led to additional expenses, such as the cost of taxis to attend frequent hospital appointments. However, it's not hard to put two and two together. It should be obvious that not being able to afford a) essentials, and b) extra health costs (arguably also essentials) would cause people's health to decline. Other parts of the report underscored this too, if not directly drawing the explicit connection. For instance, the evaluation categorised cost of living recipients into one of three groups according to their financial circumstances. Predictably then, group C – the one least able to afford everyday essentials – were the cost of living recipients more likely to have additional expenses. It made up the bulk, at 46% of survey respondents. These included extra costs for things like rent, debt, childcare, and school expenses. And naturally, healthcare costs came into this too. Specifically, 59% of this group had added healthcare-related spending. This compared to 45% for group A – comprising 22% of recipients – who were those that could most afford the increased cost of living. It tracks too then that proportionally, more in group C actually reported that their financial situation had gotten worse. This was at more than four times the rate – 42% – to 10% of group A respondents. Given there were significantly more people in group C, that also means many more people who'd already been struggling to make ends meet, now found themselves worse off despite the cost of living payments. In other words, the cost of living payments were worth a lot less in practical terms, and had a much smaller impact for the poorest, most marginalised claimants. Largely though, it showed that chronically ill and disabled claimants were also more likely to have multiple expense pressures at once. This would have compounded the impact of rising bills and costs for these recipients, ultimately further eroding the payment's impact in alleviating them. But perhaps most significantly, nearly three-quarters of the survey respondents were living in absolute poverty. For the analysis, this equated to a dual household (minus children) with a weekly pre-tax income below £368. Of course, this rate varied according to the composition of the household. The evaluation didn't identify the number of disabled recipients living in absolute poverty. However, given the fact that 63% of respondents were disabled, it means that disabled recipients would have made up a significant proportion of the near three-quarters in absolute poverty. With substantial numbers of recipients starting out in absolute poverty – it's little wonder the cost of living payment hardly made a dent. In other words, claimants were already living on paltry, inadequate incomes. And the fact that the majority of cost of living recipients were poor, is even less surprising when you factor in rates of employment in the survey pool. This was just 26% of claimants getting the cost of living payment in the survey. Plus, group C respondents were more likely to be employed. In short then, this means that for most recipients, Universal Credit would have been a major source of their income. Yet, successive governments have ensured that benefits are not enough for people to live on. In part, this is because they've repeatedly failed to raise benefits in line with inflation. As Topple has also pointed out, the Universal Credit 'increases' in 2023 were in fact real-terms cuts. It meant that claimants were in fact worse off than before the Coronavirus pandemic. Unsurprisingly, those losing out from the flat-rate payment as opposed to the DWP actually uprating Universal Credit in line with inflation included families with three or more children, and some households with disabled residents. Low and behold then that the evaluation also identified that recipients of households with three or more children were both: Notably, this also meant that single mothers were particularly underserved by the cost of living payments. This is because they made up 94% of the single parents in the survey. In short then, the soaring costs of bills and essentials were still a disaster for women, children, and disabled Universal Credit claimants. This was the case even with the extra £900 cost of living payments. Overall, the report found that the cost of living payments' impact was temporary for all recipients. It drove home that while they initially helped: recipients to avoid taking on additional debt and had a notable short-term impact, these positive financial effects were typically temporary. By the end of the next month, recipients were facing the same financial challenges again Ultimately then, the fact is, the cost of living payments were merely a sticking plaster. Crucially, they didn't even take claimants back to the starting line in terms of meeting the soaring costs of everyday living necessities. So not only did the DWP leave vast numbers of chronically ill and disabled people without this support, the ones it did provide it to, it utterly failed anyway. Of course, the former Conservative government stopped this payment in February 2024. It's extremely unlikely the new Labour government will now look to reinstate this in any form. In short: the DWP hasn't published this now with any intention to build an improved and more inclusive scheme. Quite the opposite in fact. On Wednesday 29 January, chancellor Rachel Reeves will instead set out the government's new plans to cut people's benefits. Not to mention that this will finally reveal what Labour intends to do with disability benefits specifically. It's looking likely this will involve denying these benefits to many people needing them going forward. So there's fat chance the Labour-led DWP is going to heed the evaluation's findings and make welfare genuinely meet chronically ill and disabled people's needs. Because, why on Earth would it want to do that? Not when it can scapegoat them for the problems of its own design instead.",Canary,2025-01-28T10:00:15+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/cost-of-living-payments-dwp-analysis/
"Another year, another arms dealers' dinner is facing disruption by protesters","Protesters vow that arms dealers and politicians will not dine in peace at their £265-£540-a-head annual dinner – as they prepare another year of disruption to the event. The Aerospace, Defence & Security (ADS) Group is an arms-industry trade body that represents most of the world's biggest arms firms. And according to Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), every year it holds a dinner to ""bring politicians together with reps from [the] world's biggest arms companies"". The dinner is a prestigious lobbying and networking event for many of the companies complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Event sponsors include companies directly complicit in Israel's genocide including BAE Systems and Babcock. BAE Systems is the lead partner in the F-35 combat aircraft programme. The UK makes 15% of every F-35 Israel used to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza. The F-35 license was exempted from Labour's partial arms suspension despite evidence that Israel used F-35s to commit war crimes. In 2024, the ADS dinner was attended by over 1200 people, including 40+ members of parliament, eight government ministers, opposition front benchers, and international delegations. Also in attendance was arms trade lobbyist and so-called 'independent' government advisor on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney aka John Woodcock. Walney complained to GB News in 2024 that attendees had to ""run the gauntlet"" of protesters to attend the event. Emily Apple, CAAT's media coordinator, said: The people attending this dinner are dining on the profits of genocide. This disgusting event is nothing more than a lobbying opportunity for war criminals. These arms dealers are merchants of death, fuelling conflict worldwide, in order to line their pockets. The contacts and conversations that happen at events like this lead to deadly consequences and our protest will ensure that those attending have to confront the reality of these murderous deals. In 2024, CAAT disrupted the event as well: The sycophants at Marriot told the Canary last year: We are a hospitality company that provides public accommodations and function space. Acceptance of business does not indicate support, or endorsement of any group or individual. In line with our guest privacy policies, we do not discuss details of our guests or the groups with whom we do business. Clearly, Marriot hasn't heard of BDS.

Now the UN has directly intervened in the Palestine Action 'Filton 18' case,"The United Nations (UN) has formally intervened in the case of the Palestine Action 'Filton 18' – currently on remand over their action at a UK-based Israel-supplying arms factory owned by Elbit Systems. The UN letter, while polite, does not pull any punches – and exposes the misuse of counter-terror laws and blatant state-sanctioned mistreatment of the activists. However, the UK government has responded – and it hides behind bureaucracy while bordering on contemptuous. In August 2024 Palestine Action activists disrupted Israeli weapons production at the Filton, Bristol research hub of Elbit Systems – Israel's largest arms firm. This brand new £35m research and development hub of Israel's biggest weapons firm opened in June 2023, and was attended by the UK-Israeli Ambassador Hotevely, and Elbit's CEO Bezhalel Machlis – who has frequently boasted of the company's central role in Israel's military, during the ongoing Gaza genocide. An initial seven people were detained under police abuse of 'Counter Terror' powers. More police raids and arrests followed in the months since, most recently in November. A total of 18 people now arrested, detained, and held under 'Counter Terror' powers – despite being charged with criminal charges – before a trial in November 2025. Many had their homes and property damaged and some of their families and loved ones were also subjected to police violence, while conditions for those inside prison include arbitrary and repressive restrictions. Though initially charged under terrorism statutes, the activists were later prosecuted for standard criminal offenses like criminal damage and aggravated burglary. However, it is the state's initial use of counter-terror laws, and its treatment of the Filton 18, that the UN is concerned about. You can read the full letter here. It is from: The UN panel has identified several key areas of concern: Misapplication of Counter-Terrorism Laws: Arrests and pre-trial detentions under counter-terrorism legislation lacked credible links to terrorism, raising concerns about overbroad definitions in UK law. Actions involving property damage, while unlawful, do not meet the international threshold for terrorism, which includes intent to cause serious harm or compel governments through intimidation. On this, the UN letter specifically states: The information received suggests that the UK police have exercised significant powers under counter-terrorism legislation despite the absence of a credible connection between the activists' conduct to terrorism as properly defined, and in circumstances where provisions of the ordinary criminal law would strike a more appropriate balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of national security. In this respect, it is welcome that the accused are not to be prosecuted for any terrorism offences, properly reflecting the character of their acts as ordinary criminal offences. However, we are concerned that the activists were arrested on terrorism charges at an earlier stage and that counter-terrorism detention extended detention powers were used in that connection. Detention Conditions: Activists faced restricted communication with family and legal counsel. High-security designations due to alleged ""terrorist connections"" limited their access to cultural and religious practices, exacerbating psychological and physical challenges during remand. Procedural Violations: Prolonged incommunicado detention and delayed access to legal representation contravened international human rights standards, including Articles 9 and 19 of the ICCPR Impact on Freedom of Expression: Using counter-terrorism laws against political dissent could deter legitimate protest activities in a democratic society, infringing on freedoms of expression and assembly. The UN panel then goes onto to demand answers from the UK government. Specifically it has asked it to: Provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations Explain the factual and legal grounds justifying the alleged arrest and detention of the activists under counter-terrorism laws. Please explain the reason why, and at what period of the activists' detention, the CPS decided to downgrade the charges to ordinary offences. Please also detail the basis for the CPS' submission that the offences have a ""terrorist connection"". Explain whether the definition of terrorism in UK law will be amended to exclude acts of advocacy, dissent, protest, or industrial action in a democratic society where they are no intended to cause death or serious injury with a terrorist purpose. Outline the measures taken to safeguard the activists' procedural rights in detention and their right to a fair trial, including their right to access legal representation immediately after their arrest and to ensure that their families are promptly notified of their detention, including any transfers between detention facilities. Explain the measures taken to ensure the activists' access to family visits, medication and health care in detention, and to protect their cultural and religious rights, and detail how these measures are compatible with international human rights standards. Please indicate whether their restrictive high security conditions in detention will be lifted. Now, the UK government has responded. You can read the full response here. It has addressed each of the UN's questions. However, the response demonstrates several shortcomings in transparency and accountability. Firstly, the repeated emphasis on the inability to comment due to ongoing legal proceedings, while procedurally valid, limits meaningful engagement with the substantive allegations. This reliance on legal constraints to withhold information appears to prioritise procedural safety over addressing international concerns regarding human rights practices. For example, the UK government specifically states: Beyond this publicly available information, it would not be appropriate for the UK Government to comment further, particularly when criminal proceedings are ongoing. This principle applies to all criminal investigations and trials and helps ensure the integrity of those processes. However, the Filton 18 have not been charged under counter-terror laws. Therefore, it seems obtuse at best to argue that this element of the situation cannot be discussed. Additionally, the document extensively defends the use of counter-terrorism laws, arguing they are applied judiciously and independently of government influence. However, it fails to sufficiently address criticisms about the broad and potentially ambiguous definition of terrorism under UK law, particularly its application to acts of advocacy, dissent, or protest. The response leans heavily on previous affirmations of the law's robustness by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, but it does not adequately explain how these laws are regularly reviewed to prevent misuse against activists. The government's explanation regarding procedural safeguards, such as the provision of legal representation, family notifications, and access to healthcare and religious rights, is thorough but overly reliant on citing existing frameworks rather than presenting evidence of their effective implementation. This approach gives the impression of a defensive rather than proactive stance on addressing potential rights violations in detention. Furthermore, the document highlights the UK Government's insistence on the independence of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, and judiciary. While this independence is critical, the failure to engage substantively with the activists' specific allegations raises concerns about the adequacy of procedural protections, particularly for politically sensitive cases. Of course, what we do know is that former Labour Party MP, John Woodcock (Lord Walney) has heavily influenced the state in terms of applying counter-terror laws to legitimate activism. As the Canary previously wrote, Just Stop Oil activists all received shocking prison sentences only months after the disgraced John 'Lord Walney' Woodcock, paid oil and arms industry lobbyist, called for groups who oppose his clients' interests, to be silenced and jailed. He also floated the idea that groups like Palestine Action should be labelled as terrorists. Prior to Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain remained extremely unusual. In 2020, Boris Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords, and gave him the role of 'Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption'. He used that role to obtain the following paid positions: The terms of his engagement required him to disclose any conflicts of interest directly to the Home Office, but it is unclear whether he did so. In May he published a report, falsely presented to the public and to parliament as 'independent'. This called for groups such as Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil to be treated as organised criminals. He also suggested that jury acquittals in the trials of such cases were a 'problem' that needed to be addressed. The surprise is not that Walney acts in his clients' interests, but rather that the Labour government continues to present him to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. He remains in post, despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024. The thin end of this wedge is the UN's intervention over the Filton 18. This is because their situation is a microcosm of what is happening in both the UK, but also around the Global North in terms of increasingly authoritarian, right-wing governments cracking down on people that are disrupting the quickly-faltering corporate capitalist system. Back in the UK, though, Palestine Action, its activists, and their supporters, must now wait for the UN to consider and then respond to the UK government's response. The UN's intervention is welcome – but it remains to be seen whether or not the UK government will listen or even respond appropriately, and review the Filton 18's cases.",Canary,2025-01-27T19:42:59+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/27/palestine-action-filton-un-intervenes/
The swans are back at Sadler's Wells - but they're not Tchaikovsky's,"Fossil Free London activists disrupted the closing performance of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake at Sadler's Wells on Sunday 26 January, to urge the theatre to cut ties with Barclays over the bank's funding of fossil fuels and arms. The demonstration began with 10 protesters dressed in Swan Lake costumes staging a ""die-in"" outside the theatre, accompanied by a cellist: The protesters fell to the ground next to a banner that read, ""Barclays Funds Bombs and Big Oil"". Meanwhile, leaflets explaining the protest were distributed to theatregoers. Just before the show began; a large banner was unfurled from a second-floor balcony inside the building, reading ""Drop Barclays"": Security escorted the campaigners out of the building: Barclays is a major sponsor of Sadler's Wells. The chair of the Sadler's Wells board of trustees, Nigel Higgins, also serves as the chairman of Barclays. Since the 2016 Paris Agreement, Barclays has been Europe's biggest financier of fossil fuels. They channel vast sums of money to oil giants like Shell and BP, whose continued expansion of fossil fuel production drives us ever closer to climate collapse. Furthermore, a 2024 investigation revealed Barclays invests over £2 billion in shares, and provides loans and underwriting worth £6.1 billion, to companies whose weapons, components and military technology have been used in Israel's attacks on Palestinians. Fossil Free London performed a similar stunt at Sadler's Wells in December 2024. Joanna Warrington, a Fossil Free London spokesperson said: It's time for Sadler's Wells to stop dancing around this issue, and stop partnering with Barclays. A bank that fuels genocide and climate breakdown. For as long as they do so, they're complicit in the devastating extreme weather events and untold violence we're seeing strewn across the news daily. Because, thanks to Sadler's Wells' cultural power, this sponsorship enables Barclays to hide behind a façade of corporate responsibility. All whilst they continue to bankroll industries that kill. It's time Sadler's Wells took a stand against the oily financiers set on destroying everything we love, all to line their pockets.",Canary,2025-01-27T14:32:05+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/swan-lake-sadlers-wells-protest/
Palestine Action political prisoner FREE - but just as THREE others are arrested,"On Friday 24 January, a Palestine Action political prisoner was released from HMP Dovegate after spending almost a month on remand. It was over a Christmas Day action at UAV Engines – a company directly complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Bryn Higgs, from Ullapool, was arrested on 25 December 2024 alongside four others following an action which destroyed the walls at the premises of UAV Engines Ltd – Shenstone's Israeli drone factory: In a hearing at Stafford Crown Court, Bryn was granted bail – ahead of a trial set for January 2026. At the time of his arrest, Higgs was awaiting charges for a previous action targeting the same factory in July. He was charged on Boxing Day and remanded to prison on 27 December: UAV Engines is operated by Elbit Systems, Israel's biggest weapons manufacturer, and produces engines for Elbit's killer drones. In addition to making engines for Elbit's Hermes 450 drone, which has been deployed as a mass-murder device throughout the Gaza genocide, the UEL AR731 Wankel-type rotary engine, produced at the Staffordshire factory, is being used in Israeli Harop Kamikaze drones, which are currently being upgraded to kill autonomously. Elbit have dishonestly claimed that they do not export to Israel, but this is disproven by export license data for military end use: Every day UAV Engines factory loses production, Palestinian lives are saved, and Palestine Action have been targeting the plant since the start of our four-year long direct action campaign. Blockades, occupations, vehicular lock-ons, and now another assault on the factory roof, have shut the plant down repeatedly. UAV Engines most recent accounts show that the company is now losing money – nearly half a million by the end of 2023. Speaking before his arrest, Higgs said: The spotlight should always be on be on Palestine and the Palestinians' struggle for equal human rights under international law, and against Israel's apartheid, ethnic cleansing, occupation and genocide. Meanwhile, on Monday 27 January three other Palestine Action actionists were nicked by cops. It was over a previous action at Elbit's Kent factory:",Canary,2025-01-27T11:58:31+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/palestine-action-bryn-higgs/
An outrage: private rents have risen by as much as 72% in just TEN years,"The latest research by Tlyfe, the UK's housing tenant lifecycle app launched by OpenBrix, has revealed that, over the last decade, Salford tops the table when it comes to the highest rate of rental growth, with the average rent in the area having increased by 72.4%. Tlyfe analysed the latest rental market figures from Gov UK, released this month, looking at which areas of the rental market have seen the sharpest increase in the cost of renting over the last decade. The research shows that, across England, the average cost of renting has increased by 44.4% over the last 10 years, now averaging £1,369 per month. Wales has seen a similar rate of growth at 43.9%, although the monthly cost does remain significantly cheaper at £777 per month. Regionally across England, it's not London (40.9%) but the East Midlands that has seen the highest increase in the cost of renting, up 51.8% in the last 10 years. The East of England has also seen one of the highest increases (50.4%), whilst the lowest rate of growth has been across the North East (33%). However, further analysis by Tlyfe shows that when it comes to local rental market growth, it's Salford that tops the table, with the average cost of renting in the area increasing by a huge 72.4% in the last decade. Leicester ranks second with an increase of 70.7%, with Folkestone and Hythe (69.1%), South Gloucestershire (69%) and Thanet (67.4%) also making the top five, whilst Bristol (66.1%), Manchester (64.9%), Ipswich (64.5%), Tameside (64.5%) and Stevenage (64.1%) rank within the top 10. The London Borough of Brent has seen the largest increase of all London boroughs at 58.4%, although it sits at number 25 in the table overall. In fact, rents have climbed across every single area of the market in England and Wales, with Hartlepool seeing the smallest increase, up by just 14.3% in the last 10 years. See how rents have changed in your local area here. The news comes after the Canary previously reported that people under the age of 45 pay 66% of all rent in the UK. This amounted to a record £56.2bn for 2024, according to research from housing agents Hamptons. The total amount of rent paid by under 45s has increased by a startling 59% over the past decade, reflecting eye-watering price increases as much as additional renters. CEO of OpenBrix Adam Pigott commented: The cost of renting has only gone one way over the last decade – and that's up. Such is the consistent and overwhelming demand for rental properties that we find ourselves facing a severe crisis across the sector and one of the key factors causing this crisis is a lack of available homes to meet demand. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though this market imbalance is set to be addressed anytime soon and, if anything, we've seen more landlords exit the sector due to consistent legislative changes implemented by the government. It's the nation's renters who are left to face the consequences and, for many, the cost of residing within the private rental sector is simply too high, whilst those who are able to stomach it are severely hindered from saving and making the jump to homeownership.",Canary,2025-01-27T11:21:37+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/rent-increases-uk/
Why Starmer's Labour is rapidly losing Britain's support,"Most people in Britain are not happy with Keir Starmer's Labour Party government. And that's not only because of the prime minister's despicable support for Israel's genocide in Gaza. A new YouGov poll shows that the main reasons Labour is haemorrhaging support right now, making it the third party in British politics just months after the brutal collapse of the Tories handed it an easy election victory. If neoliberals hadn't retaken Labour and put it back in the hands of corporate lobbyists, the party may have actually used its electoral supermajority to really help Britain at a time when the rich seemed to be getting richer and the poor poorer. But because Labour is currently a hollow shell of its former self, it has chosen to let ordinary people down instead. According to the poll, people who voted Labour in 2024 but are no longer planning to vote for them in the future said the main reasons the government's: Nothing forced Starmer to push voters away. In fact, you would expect most of these issues to be no-brainers for a socialist policy-maker. But Starmer is not a socialist, and nor is his government. And that's why, in spite of the facts above, he's trying to suck up to the right and attack the left rather than placing blame for Britain's problems where it lies – on the privatising policies of previous governments and the massive levels of inequality they have caused. https://twitter.com/SteveAkehurst/status/1882379502711632194/photo/1 But why aren't the government's participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza and its failure to tackle the climate crisis more of a problem for voters? The simple answer is propaganda. Many traditional Labour voters clearly care about solidarity, understanding the link between the wellbeing of other people and their own. But the billionaire-owned mainstream media has been fully committed to covering for Israel's genocidal war criminals and hiding the British government's support for them. They've helped the state to smear anti-genocide protesters and confuse the issues for people who are not actively following the news. And that's hardly surprising, because billionaires tend to support Israel. It's the same situation with the environment. The ""CO2 emissions from just 50 billionaires exceed those of world's poorest 155 million people"", producing ""on average more carbon through their investments, private jets and superyachts in under three hours than the average Brit does in their entire lifetime"". This disinterest in the destruction of the planet and the climate crisis pushes them to ""fund a network of organisations that seek to prevent effective environmental action"". And at the same time, some will even cynically exploit opportunities to make money from the opposite side, even if they don't really care. There's a reason why escaping into space is so popular among billionaires. Starmer's corporate cronies refuse to challenge the rich and powerful because they're in bed with them. That's why they prefer to attack environmentalists and anti-genocide protesters who don't have immense resources, and it's why they prefer to focus on right-wing talking points rather than addressing the issues most important to the people who voted for them. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn completely understood the danger of billionaire control of the media, and it's why he believed in wholescale media reform. Starmer, on the other hand, has submitted to the corporate media overlords. That's why the country doesn't like him. It's why he's haemorrhaging votes. And it's why he's empowering the far right with his privatisation of the Labour Party's soul.",Canary,2025-01-27T10:38:59+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/27/starmer-labour-polling/
Starmer torpedoes legislation that would force him to deliver on his own promises,"Keir Starmer has ordered Labour Party MPs to drop their commitment to the Climate and Nature Bill. The landmark legislation would make the UK's targets to tackle the climate crisis emergency legally binding. The Labour leadership had insisted that clauses in the bill that make agreements at international climate summits like those at the UN and in Paris binding must be removed. The bill would place legal responsibility on the government to either mobilise the private sector or introduce a public Green New Deal, as the only ways to ensure the UK meets its climate targets. That's through mandating a government strategy within 18 months of the bill passing. One climate target announced in November is for the UK to reduce its emissions by 81% as of 2035. With the threat of losing the whip, Labour sponsors of the bill agreed that a vote wouldn't go ahead in exchange for more input from the backbenchers into environment legislation. Issues other than Starmer blocking this bill is that the government has only pledged a measly £8bn for Great British Energy as a vehicle for private sector investment in renewable energy. At the same time, Starmer has issued £22bn on carbon capture projects that don't work and merely prop up the fossil fuel industry. In fact, the entire framing of 'net zero' functions to greenwash fossil fuels – it's as if we don't really need to transition to renewables (which are cheaper and without air pollution anyway). It places failed carbon capture projects front and centre. In parliament, co-sponsor of the bill Clive Lewis challenged chancellor Rachel Reeves' comments at Davos that growth comes before the climate: I don't want to see growth that comes at the cost of my daughter and her generation's future... I'm afraid to say that you cannot have growth on a dead planet. Politicians need to understand that... You cannot pick growth out of the air and say biodiversity will come in second place, climate will come after. They are all interlinked. And Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said: Frankly it's nothing short of a national embarrassment for the government to struggle so hard to avoid legally committing to the promises they've already made on the international stage. In the Commons, Labour MP Nadia Whittome added: There is no more important choice than our very future. We have to choose to serve the interests of people here in the UK and right across the globe. And stand up to the wealthy and powerful determined to enrich themselves at the expense of people and our planet. Unfortunately, the Starmer leadership has shown once again that it's not committed to solving the climate emergency through torpedoing the bill.",Canary,2025-01-26T12:21:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/26/starmer-climate-nature-bill/
Vile Reeves seethes and LIES when questioned on tax bung to the rich,"If you ignore their words and observe their actions, Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer have been clear on what they intend for Britain. Their mission is to dismantle the welfare state, privatise what's left of the public good, and direct more money to the rich. This is why this week the Labour Party simultaneously promised to attack poor, sick, and disabled people via the DWP at the same time that they 'softened' tax changes for non-doms. In other words, these Labour folk are nasty pieces of work; something which was obvious to everyone when chancellor Rachel Reeves did the interview circuit on 26 January: On 16 January, Canary writer Rachel Charlton-Dailey reported that: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. Labour have all sorts of excuses for why they're doing this, including: Addressing these one by one, disability benefits fraud is close to 0% – i.e. it basically doesn't exist. We also doubt Labour is serious about wanting to get people into work when it's now talking about taking away benefit claimants' driving licenses. We further doubt they want to save the country money when they've announced plans to go soft on taxing wealthy non-doms. Interviewing chancellor Reeves on Sunday 26 January, Trevor Phillips asked: The point I'm really driving at here is that for some some people, this concession, let's call it that, to non doms, contrasts with what you're doing to other people. And this morning, you've now written that you're going to tackle... the spiralling benefits bill by taking away people's driving licenses, getting people off the sick. Now this may be justified, but many working people will think that non doms get sympathy and people on welfare get 'tough love'. An angry Reeves responded: If people aren't entitled to benefits, they shouldn't be getting them. We've got good news for Reeves here; this is already what's happening (bar the 0.1% engaged in Disability Living Allowance fraud, accounting for less than £1m in total). She continued: And at the moment, we waste billions of pounds as a country every year in giving money to people who aren't entitled to it. No, we don't actually, as noted above. We spend money trying to give sick and disabled people some level of support and dignity, and we spend far less on that than we should. Reeves continued again: And what we're saying is if you're ripping off the state and ripping off other taxpayers, we will take money directly out of your bank account, and you risk losing your driving license. So proper penalties for people who, frankly, are getting money that they are not entitled to, and we'll crack down on that. By the end of the forecast period, we're gonna be raising more than £4bn a year by cracking down on fraud and error. Again, no you're not, you're going to 'raise' extra money by making sick and disabled people destitute, as a recent court hearing demonstrated (reported by John Pring of Disability News Service): Finding DWP's actions unlawful, Mr Justice Calver said in his 42-page judgment that the eight-week consultation – issued by Stride in September 2023 – had failed to explain that planned reforms to the work capability assessment (WCA) would cut the benefits of 424,000 disabled people, with many worse off by at least £416 a month. If the reforms became law, those 424,000 disabled people would also have to comply with work-related requirements and face the possibility of sanctions, while another 33,000 disabled claimants who were already in the limited capability for work group would now have to comply with even tougher work-related requirements and potential sanctions. The same article clarified that the move wasn't about helping sick and disabled people; it was about making their lives worse for the purpose of penny pinching: Stride had failed to make it clear that one of the key motives for his reforms was to cut spending by about £3 billion over four years. He and his ministers had claimed that the reforms were intended to support more disabled people into work, yet only 15,000 of the 457,000 affected were expected by DWP to enter employment. Internal DWP documents, revealed during the legal case, showed that nearly 100,000 more disabled people could be forced into poverty. Many responded to negatively to the loathsome Reeves and her appearance: Others are criticising Reeves writing in the Scum 'newspaper': People are also increasingly commenting on what an incompetent, robotic weirdo Reeves is: Some are pointing out that the state of affairs under Starmer and Reeves was all so very predictable: To be clear, Labour would need to do far more than just increase non dom taxes if they were serious about spiralling wealth inequality. As Tax Justice UK note, fairer taxation would include: New taxes on wealth We're campaigning for a new wealth tax: a 2% levy on individuals who own assets worth more than £10 million – it would affect 0.04% of the UK population and would raise £24 billion a year. We're also campaigning to apply national insurance to investment income, raising up to £10.2 billion a year. Reform existing taxes on wealth Those who get their income from stocks, shares and other assets often pay far less tax than those who work. We campaign for the tax rates on these forms of income to be equalised with income tax. So we all pay the same rates. It could raise £16.7 billion a year. Clamp down on tax havens Hundreds of billions of pounds are lost every single year to tax avoidance via tax havens. We campaign for global action against tax havens. We're demanding more transparency – and global minimum rates of tax, so countries aren't undercutting each other. Figures such as Gary Stevenson of Gary's Economics are also highlighting the issue spiralling wealth inequality: You don't hear Labour talking about this because they don't want to make things better for everyone; they simply want to keep the scam going for the benefit of their wealthy donors. Let's not mince words – Labour and Reeves are reprehensible and incompetent politicians who are repeating the privatisation and austerity failures of the past few decades. Surprise, surprise; repeating the same mistakes isn't going to lead to prosperity, and targeting impoverished sick and disabled people over billionaire layabouts isn't going to fix the economy.",Canary,2025-01-26T11:45:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/26/rachel-reeves-non-doms-welfare-interview/
OFFICIAL: the top 10% richest have more wealth than the REST OF US COMBINED,"New analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) published on Friday 24 January reveals that the top 10% of households have more financial wealth than the other 90% combined: While the top 10% have average financial wealth greater than the rest combined, many households struggle to save anything at all. One in five have negative net financial wealth, which means their debts exceed any financial wealth they have. The TUC says this shows the urgent need for an economic reset, which the Employment Rights Bill will help to deliver by tackling the scourge of insecure work and making work pay. Under the Conservative Party, real wages grew by just 0.3% a year – compared to 1.5% from 1997 to 2010. The TUC estimates that the average worker would be £117 a week better off had pay increased since 2010 at the same pace as between 1997 and 2010. Pay growth during Conservative-led government from 2010-2024 was worse than for any other period of government since the 1920s. The same government also has the worst record on living standards since records began in 1955. At the same time, the number of people in insecure work soared by one million between 2011 and 2023 to 4.1 million. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: We need an economy that delivers better living standards and security for all – not just those at the top. Under the Conservatives, the wealthiest feathered their nests while working people suffered an epidemic of insecure work and the worst pay crisis in two centuries. And many households have struggled to save anything at all. That's not right. It's time to move away from the broken economic model which saw insecure work explode and living standards squeezed. That's why the Government's Employment Rights Bill is so important – it will help deliver the economic reset working people desperately need.",Canary,2025-01-24T19:35:53+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/24/official-the-top-10-richest-have-more-wealth-than-the-rest-of-us-combined/
Activists left a message for an Israel-supplying company in Glasgow,"On January 23rd, activists targeted Kelvinside Electronics in Glasgow, spraying the interior with red paint and leaving signs that read: ""Drop Leonardo Contract"" and ""Don't Profit from Genocide"": Kelvinside Electronics has supplied services for both Leonardo and Thales. Leonardo, one of the worlds largest arms manufacturers, has close ties to the Israeli state and to the Israeli based Elbit Systems, a major supplier of the Israeli army. The Edinburgh site manufactures the laser-targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, the model used by Israel to bomb Gaza. Thales UK is also closely linked to Elbit Systems, with whom it produces the Watchkeeper drone. In July the International Court of Justice (ICJ) set out clear obligations for UN states. This includes; not supporting Israel's unlawful acts and the unlawful situation it has created in the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and ensuring Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. A spokesperson for the activists said ""Leonardo and Thales do not supply weapons systems to Israel in isolation – they require a network of inter-company contracts to function. By targeting Kelvinside Electronics we are directly responding to calls from Palestine to disrupt the supply chain of arms from Scotland to Israel"": It is unconscionable to profit from genocide and human suffering. Boycott Thales and Leonardo. Don't make Scotland a hospitable place for the business of war and colonialism. Although a fragile ceasefire has taken effect in Gaza, Israeli aggression has intensified in the Occupied West Bank. While 90 Palestinian captives were released on the first day of the ceasefire, just as many were arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank in the following 24 hours. As one of his first acts in office, Donald Trump has dropped sanctions on extremist settler organisations and individuals, giving tacit support to further illegal land grabs. And on Tuesday the 21st January the Israeli military launched a large scale attack on the city of Jenin. A spokesperson for the activists said: After a 15 month war of extermination on the people of Gaza, we welcome the news of a ceasefire with cautious hope, but not complacency. Israel has repeatedly violated the terms of the ceasefire, it continues to bomb Lebanon, Syria and Yemen and only days after the agreement has killed at least 10 and injured 70 in airstrikes on Jenin in the Occupied West Bank. Extremist settler organisations are planning land grabs in North Gaza and South Lebanon; we fear we are witnessing the next phase of a genocidal logic. Just as Israeli oppression is not going to end with this ceasefire, we will not stop taking action to disrupt Scottish complicity in the war machine.

Have you seen 'Labour's' new ad on the London Underground?,"Unofficial adverts criticising Labour Party chancellor Rachel Reeves for accepting money from climate crisis-sceptic lobbyists appeared on several London Underground lines on Friday 24 January. The satirical posters say Your Chancellor, Sponsored by Climate Deniers: Rachel Reeves took £10,000 from them (so far). A modified party logo reads: Labour: still backing oil: Last year, Reeves scrapped Labour's proposed £28 billion green investment fund, shortly after accepting a £10,000 donation from Lord Donoghue, a prominent climate sceptic and former chairman of the climate-denying Global Warming Policy Foundation. The chancellor has come under further pressure in recent weeks as the economic outlook has worsened. Sam Simons from Climate Resistance, the group behind the stunt, said: To avoid dangerous climate change, our government must get the country off dirty oil and gas and onto clean, home-grown wind and solar power. But big oil companies are hijacking our politics in a desperate bid to protect their profits and slow down action on climate change. It's outrageous that our Chancellor is accepting five figure sums from notorious climate deniers, while slashing funding for tackling the climate crisis.

MSM ignores UK government hosting ANOTHER Israeli army general,"Despite the war-crime arrest warrants for Israeli government figures over the atrocities of the Gaza genocide, Keir Starmer's Labour Party government has once again hosted high-profile military figures from Israel in the UK, as if nothing has happened in the last 15 months. This is a grave insult to the memories of the 18,000 children Israel has murdered in Gaza. Nonetheless, the mainstream media has remained silent about the latest visit of likely war criminals to Britain. As Declassified UK reported, the Israeli military delegation visiting the Ministry of Defence included Major General Oded Basyuk, who is the head of the Israeli occupation forces' Operations Directorate. As Declassified explained: Basyuk was on the ground in Gaza during Israel's most recent onslaught and presided over decision-making on last year's offensive in southern Lebanon. Despite the international arrest warrants for top-level Israeli politicians, and the British government's participation in their genocide, the mainstream media appears to have no interest in the UK allowing probable war criminals to walk its shores. Nor was it interested when Israel's army chief visited in 2024, or when foreign secretary David Lammy went to schmooze with controversial political figures in Jerusalem. With the billionaire-owned media covering for Israel's genocidal war criminals, independent media like Declassified has stepped in to provide essential information about Britain's involvement in the atrocities. Just recently, for example, it revealed the BBC's absolute failure to inform the public about this. And the public broadcaster hasn't only failed to counter the propaganda of the corporate media. Because it has also exhibited clear pro-Israel bias itself in its reporting during the genocide in Gaza, particularly online. And the police have had to prevent protests outside the BBC's headquarters in London, facing a significant backlash for doing so. In the absence of a challenge from the mainstream media, Declassified did the job journalists should be doing. It questioned Basyuk about the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants, asking: Are you worried about the ICC investigating you for war crimes? Are you a war criminal? As journalist Richard Sanders said: This is absolutely standard, obvious journalism to be doing in the face of war crimes and accusations of genocide. Palestine Action has long sought to shut down UK operations that have links to Israel and its crimes. And there are currently numerous political prisoners in jail as a result of their resistance to British complicity in human rights violations. But as Declassified's John McEvoy has revealed, the action protesters have taken has been completely justifiable and necessary. Because the arms factories they've been targeting ""have been sending supplies to Israel throughout the Gaza genocide"". Keir Starmer's government has absolutely followed his Conservative predecessors' shameless support for Israeli crimes. Starmer is a national embarrassment, and has become an overtly racist spokesperson for genocidal war criminals. The RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, meanwhile, has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. As Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of ""a country which is participating"" in Israel's genocide – ""a direct participant"". Declassified has been doing its part in challenging this despicable situation, as have the Canary and other independent outlets. But the mainstream media has exposed itself as the immoral cesspit of corporate propaganda that it is. Resisting its stranglehold over Britain is an absolute moral imperative.",Canary,2025-01-24T16:05:30+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/24/oded-basyuk-israel-uk-visit/
Labour woos big business in Davos but the rip off was on full display,"Davos refers to the World Economic Forum, which meets annually in January. Multinational corporations, usually with a turnover of at least five billion dollars, fund it as members at a fee of £52,000. So of course the Labour Party government was there this year. Unless your a member, costs of attendance for those invited can exceed £250,000 with items like a hot dog costing $43. Is this the place that's going to solve key global issues such as spiralling inequality? Not long before Davos, Oxfam released figures on the scale of billionaire riches as of 2024. It found that last year global billionaire wealth increased by $2 trillion. Oxfam argues that ""extreme billionaire wealth is largely unmerited"" partly because 60% of their wealth is either inherited, from monopolies or from crony connections. Rather than tackling this, Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is at Davos making yet more concessions to big business. She said: We have been listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community. As such, she has relaxed some rules of the transitionary period for ending non-dom super rich tax breaks in the UK. That's after the corporate media made noise about the super rich planning to leave the country. But Tax Justice Network has documented that just 0.01% of super rich households relocated after Norway, Sweden, and Denmark introduced increased wealth tax reforms. And Reeves hasn't introduced any, but is continuing the Tories' plan of ending non dom status. Another issue Davos seems unlikely to solve is the climate crisis. At the event, Reeves and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds met leaders of banks such as Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and Barclays. It's seven years since the Paris climate agreement was adopted. Yet the world's 60 largest private banks have invested $6.9 trillion in fossil fuels since then. And Lloyds, Barclays, and HSBC have all maintained large investments in planet-destroying carbon energy. On top of that, Reeves said at Davos that her plan for growth supersedes the climate emergency. That's shocking, but unfortunately unsurprising. In a further attempt to woo big business, Starmer has announced he will block legal challenges to infrastructure projects (that should be publicly-owned rather than for-profit, anyway). Niall Toru, senior lawyer at Friends of the Earth, rubbished Starmer's right-wing chest beating: No one is above the law, not even the government. Friends of the Earth only brings cases we think are strong and necessary to protect people and nature from unlawful harm – and considering our string of recent legal wins, so do the courts. It is deeply concerning that Labour is attempting to scapegoat claimants. If ministers don't want to be challenged in the courts, they should act within the law, because already cases aren't allowed to proceed unless they have merit. It was two years ago when Starmer made his position clear that he opts for the super rich over representative democracy. In January 2023, Emily Maitlis asked Labour Party leader Keir Starmer: You have to choose now between Davos or Westminster? Starmer replied: Davos What more is there to say?",Canary,2025-01-24T15:33:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/24/labour-davos/
£18m in compensation to rape survivors in ONE YEAR - yet charging rates still at 5%,"The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has paid out more than £18m in compensation to survivors in the last year. Yet of the hundreds and thousands of rape and sexual offences reported to UK police forces in the last year, an average of 5% resulted in a charge, a new investigation has revealed. This is no improvement on previous figures. It comes as minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls Jess Phillips says survivors are being ""let down time and time again"". New data obtained by Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice (SACA) has revealed that between September 2023 and 2024, a total of 189,774 offences were reported to police forces across the UK but just 9,093 resulted in a charge – averaging around 5%. While there will be cases that may be still under investigation or where some other resolution has been reached, Sexual Abuse Claims Specialist, Ellie Lamey says it is ""staggeringly low"" and ""it is important survivors know that support is available"". 31 out of 43 UK police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request in full within the deadline. The highest number of rape or sexual offences by far were reported to Greater Manchester Police, of which there were 56,428 in the year up to September 2024. Of those, 3,723 resulted in a charge or summons, according to the force's figures. London's Met Police recorded the second-highest number of offences, standing at 27,213 with 1,415 resulting in a charge or summons. Out of 31 forces across England and Wales, 97% revealed that the most common age group for rape and sexual offence survivors and victims in the last year was under 18 years: The latest figures from the Home Office show nearly 1.9m violent or sexual crimes in England and Wales were closed without a suspect being caught or charged in the year to June 2024 – about 89% of all offences given an outcome. Minister Jess Phillips said: It is completely unacceptable that fewer and fewer violent and sexual crimes are being solved, with more victims being let down time and time again. The severity of these numbers prove why violence against women and girls is a national emergency and that is why we have set out our unprecedented mission to halve it in a decade. Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice also obtained new data from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) – which is a government-backed organisation that can offer compensation to survivors of sexual abuse. In the last year, the CICA received 13,313 applications from victims and survivors of sexual assault or abuse. Of those, 1,763 received compensation – that's just 13%. CICA Specialist at SACA, Ellie Lamey said: The number of sexual assault/abuse victims who have applied for CIC is staggeringly low compared to the number of offences being reported to police forces across the UK. This, along with mammoth delays in the court system and the early release of prisoners is, of course, hugely concerning for survivors: SACA's investigation also uncovered the main reasons why survivors are rejected by the CICA. It is obvious the blame is put onto victims and survivors. The main reasons were: In the last year, the organisation paid out compensation totalling £18,463,509.85 to victims and survivors of sexual abuse – that's an average payout of £10,472.77 per claimant. Lamey added: It is so important that victims know there is support available for them and not to be deterred or fearful of rejection. Victims should be aware that they can report historical periods of abuse/assaults to the police, regardless of the amount of time that has passed. Victims can avoid rejections by ensuring they fully cooperate with the police in bringing the assailant to justice as well as seeking appropriate medical attention regarding any physical or psychological injuries sustained from the assault they are a victim of. CICA data from 2020-2022 shows that 18 per cent of applications are submitted outside of the two-year time limit, and of these 61% went on to receive an award. With relevant evidence, we can provide exceptional circumstances that have contributed to the delay in a victim submitting an application. Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice (SACA) offers a specialist service for anyone looking for support and advice after being affected by rape or sexual assault. They operate a 24-hour helpline and live chat service which you can access on their website.",Canary,2025-01-23T15:01:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694203
Labour just gave crumbs to desperate leaseholders: a 'drop in the ocean',"In November 2024 Labour Party housing minister Matthew Pennycook made the promise to leaseholders. It was that he would put into force a part of the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 by the end of this month. On Wednesday 22 January he finally fulfilled this – posting on X (formerly Twitter) that he has signed a regulation removing the requirement for a flat owner to have owned a flat for two years before they can extend their lease. However, one expert has described his actions as a 'drop in the ocean' over what's actually needed. The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 was the last bill to be passed before the general election, having received support from both parties. Over six months have passed. While the provisions relating to lease extensions being enabled is welcome, those around freehold purchases and other measures are still not in force. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders are waiting for this legislation to be fully turned on and make good on its promise to make it ""cheaper and easier"" for them to extend their lease. In the meantime, many of these homeowners will be stuck in properties that they cannot sell or remortgage. The government has now said that they will launch yet another consultation, on how to set the valuation rates which will define whether lease extensions become cheaper or more expensive. Frustratingly, they are delaying this consultation until ""next summer"", and then have conceded that further legislation will have to be passed to put it into effect. Linz Darlington, MD of lease extension specialists Homehold, said of Pennycook's announcement: The Housing Minister has today signed the regulations implementing the first part of the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 that affects lease extensions and freehold purchases. According to the Housing Minister's post on X (formerly Twitter), from the end of this month a leaseholder will no longer have had to own their property for two years before they can extend the lease of their flat or purchase the freehold to their house. While this is a welcome development, removing the ownership condition is a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed from leasehold reform. It is a small change which will benefit a small proportion of leaseholders. We estimate that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders are waiting for the more significant changes to the lease extension regime which have been promised to make it ""cheaper and easier"" for them to extend their leases. The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 has already set out these changes but they are not yet in force. Despite this legislation receiving Royal Assent in May 2024 – now eight months ago – the government intends to run a further consultation on some of the important provisions. They don't intend to run this consultation until the Summer, and this creates a further delay which is unwarranted and unwelcome. Darlington summed up: For leaseholders waiting for leasehold reform, they have now had successive governments promise reforms which always seem tantalisingly close, but never actually seem to arrive. We need the Labour Government to bring forward the consultation, and commit to swiftly implementing the legislation.",Canary,2025-01-23T14:21:41+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694312
The #Hastings3 are free - and already planning another pro-Palestine protest,"Three men prosecuted for taking part in a peaceful protest at arms manufacturer General Dynamics were found not guilty of all charges at Brighton Law Courts on Wednesday 22 January. Laurie Holden, 72, Clem McCulloch, 33, and Thomas Delves, 25 – collectively known as the #Hastings3 – were arrested for aggravated trespass on 29 February 2024 during an early morning protest at one of the firm's two sites in Hastings, East Sussex. The three told the court that they were at General Dynamics on that day to disrupt the business of the weapons manufacturers and to slow production down. Illustrator Thomas Delves, 25, said: I believed it was the right thing to do to stop the weapons factory in any way I could because it was supplying weapons to a genocide in Gaza. I thought my actions would have a somewhat immediate impact as the promise of the weapons gave confidence to the Israeli government to continue. He said he had decided to sit in front of one of their entrances as it was both ""peaceful but still effective"". Retired train driver Laurie Holden said: There was a genocide going on, the ultimate crime against humanity and General Dynamics was playing a major role in that crime, making a lot of weapons, like 2,000 lb bombs. I know people in Gaza who were being affected by it. The two were arrested for aggravated trespass but as they were being forcibly removed from the protest, McCulloch said he got upset and decided to stand in their place: I believed it was the right thing to do. I knew General Dynamics manufactured arms and related equipment which were used not just during the genocide but in the years previously, providing ordinance and equipment to the IDF to be used in Palestine. All three were physically dragged from the protest and held in a cell for 13 hours before being charged under a Section 69 order of failing to comply with an order from the police to move off land when directed to do so. The court heard evidence for the prosecution from the two arresting officers PC's Freeman and Johnson as well as General Dynamics' UK Head of Security Mr Hoffman, who gave his evidence behind a screen claiming he feared repercussions if the defendants saw his face. Protest police liaison officer PC Freeman said he had worked alongside the protest organisers for a number of months and confirmed that all the actions were peaceful. He added that on the day ""it was a very peaceful protest and my only concern was the fire exit"". In court, body cam footage worn by PC Freeman showed him asking Delves and Holden to move out of the way of the door, to which Holden replied: We're more concerned with the weapons that are being made in this building. Stopping a genocide is far more important. We want to stop genocide, that's why we're here. Later in court, when asked if he would have got out of the way if there was a fire in the building, Mr Delves said: Of course. The idea was to get people out of the building! The court heard on PC Freeman's body cam footage that when a female protestor asked if she could stay on site, PC Freeman confirmed that she could and they were only interested in clearing the fire exits. Defence counsel moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds of no case to answer since the three men were simply instructed to move away from an exit they were blocking and not given clear direction to 'leave the land'. ""There must be some degree of formality other than just 'get out of the way'"" argued Sergent. After hearing all the evidence in the case, district judge Amanda Kelly concluded: It seems to be agreed that there was no clear order given to the men of what they were being told to do or where to go. She found all three not guilty. ""This is a total vindication of the #Hastings3"" said Katy Colley, chair of the Hastings and District Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest: It was outrageous that our friends were put through this ordeal for nearly a year, dragged through a criminal court case at a huge cost to the taxpayer. And for what? To protect Genocide Dynamics, which has been supplying weapons to a state which is in the dock for genocide. Our friends our heroes. They put their bodies on the line to try to stop a genocide. They did what they could to prevent the senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent Palestinians. General Dynamics are the criminals. It was telling that while our friends held their heads high and spoke openly of their motives, the head of security was hiding behind a screen. Perhaps he is ashamed of defending merchants of death. This whole case should never have happened. The justice system is being abused to criminalise peaceful protest, wasting precious court time and taxpayer money to defend a company that makes billions in profits every year from death and destruction. General Dynamics is the world's fifth largest arms company. It made all the MK80 bombs that were dropped on Gaza over 15 months, resulting in over 47,000 confirmed deaths and massive destruction to homes and civilian infrastructure. The company, which has two sites in Hastings, has been the target of 14 local protests since Israel's assault on the besieged enclave began which, in a statement submitted to court in June, General Dynamics admitted had ""significantly disrupted operations"" onsite. It read: The frequency and presence of unauthorized individuals on our sites, in combination with flags/placards referencing 'Genocide Dynamics' as opposed to 'General Dynamics' has likely damaged our business's reputation. If this negative perception continues this could result in a decline in patronage and a loss of trust within the community. The statement went on: These ongoing incidents of trespassing have significantly disrupted our operations and had a detrimental impact on our business, employees and third parties in a number of ways. Trespassers have frequently interrupted our business operations. This includes interference with daily activities, delays in service delivery, and the necessity to temporarily close sections of our premises for security reasons. Such disruptions are likely to have led to a decrease in productivity as staff have had to adjust their locations and hours of work in response. Speaking outside court after the verdict Laurie Holden pledged to continue the campaign to stop General Dynamics supplying military equipment to Israel and appealed for people to join him at the next protest at the General Dynamics site at 10am on Friday 24 January, followed by a protest rally against General Dynamics in Hastings Town Centre on Saturday 1 February at 12pm.",Canary,2025-01-23T14:00:06+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/23/hastings-3-trial/
The Lord Walney 16's appeal is a battle for justice - for all of us,"Over two days on 29 and 30 January, the Court of Appeal will review the jail sentences imposed on 16 supporters of Just Stop Oil between July and September 2024: the Lord Walney 16. The sentences include the five-year prison sentence imposed on Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, for taking part in a Zoom call to plan a protest against new oil and gas licences, and the two-year sentence passed on Phoebe Plummer after she threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Known collectively as the 'Lord' Walney 16, all received shocking prison sentences only months after the disgraced John 'Lord Walney' Woodcock, paid oil and arms industry lobbyist, called for groups who oppose his clients' interests, to be silenced and jailed. Prior to Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain remained extremely unusual. The UN has previously described the sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. The rationale given for these sentences is 'deterrence', i.e. to prevent further nonviolent direct action, such as sitting in the road. But the sentences have in fact sparked a new wave of direct action under the banner, Free Political Prisoners, which unites diverse movements such as Palestine Action, Animal Rising, and Just Stop Oil. The campaign has called for a meeting with Richard Hermer KC, the government's Attorney General, to discuss political interference in the justice process by oil and arms industry lobbyists and the silencing and jailing of people for shining a light on corporate crimes. In September and October 2024, more than 300 people occupied the roads outside Southwark Crown Court and the Ministry of Justice respectively. It is expected that more than 1,000 will occupy the Strand, blocking it to traffic, on 30 January between 12.30pm and 2pm. Backers of the 16 planning to attend outside court include TV personalities Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, comedians. Mark Thomas and Robin Ince, artist Gavin Turk, politicians Caroline Lucas, Norman Baker and baroness Jenny Jones, and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg. Solidarity actions are expected outside British embassies in a number of countries, from the Netherlands to Guyana. The concealment of evidence that threatens corporate profits is a recurring theme in the British political and legal systems. The Post Office scandal arose from Fujitsu concealing the flaws in its Horizon programme. 72 people lost their lives in Grenfell Tower after Arconic suppressed evidence of the dangers of its cladding. For decades Big Oil has waged campaigns of public misinformation over the known impacts of burning its products, using the same PR firms as the tobacco industry. Now its lobbyists are driving the silencing and repression of those exposing the industry's lies. The disgraced 'Lord' Walney resigned from the Labour Party in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct which have still not been investigated. In 2020, Boris Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords, and gave him the role of 'Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption'. He used that role to obtain the following paid positions: The terms of his engagement required him to disclose any conflicts of interest directly to the Home Office, but it is unclear whether he did so. In May he published a report, falsely presented to the public and to parliament as 'independent'. This called for groups such as Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil to be treated as organised criminals. He also suggested that jury acquittals in the trials of such cases were a 'problem' that needed to be addressed. The surprise is not that Walney acts in his clients' interests, but rather that the Labour government continues to present him to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. He remains in post, despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024. A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: The real question for the Court of Appeal is whether corruption of the legal process, by oil and arms industry lobbyists, is acceptable in a democracy Lex Korte, Free Political Prisoners spokesperson, comments: Oil barons and arms dealers are the worst amongst us. They kill and maim, poison and pollute for profit. They have bought our governments, legal systems and media outlets. They own the newspaper in your hand. They use it to tell you that the people standing up to them are the bad guys and deserve to be put in prison, for blocking a road or protecting a forest. They write our laws and tell our judges how to sentence their opponents. They threaten our democracy and our survival. They must be stopped. Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Zoe Cohen said: Every citizen should have the right to effective protest. It's a crucial part of democracy. These excessive sentences are designed to put people off protesting. But the laws that enable these sentences were written by think tanks that are funded by the corporations, oil money and the obscenely rich – the same actors who are responsible for brutal inequality and driving us to extinction. Who gave them the power to write our laws? It is shameful that the new government has not yet repealed these laws and restored the right of ordinary people to effective protest. We can push back against this repression when we come together to peacefully resist.",Canary,2025-01-23T10:49:40+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694215
New: PFI for schools has made OFFSHORE companies £1 BILLION profit,"Private Finance Initiative (PFI) continues to have a legacy in the education sector, with repayment costs being 3.3 times larger on average than the value of the infrastructure they built, according to new research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The news comes just as the Labour Party government has been eyeing yet more PFI-style deals – and therefore, the report should ring alarms bells. The report explores the use and impact of PFI, finding that £13.5 billion is spent by local authorities every two-to-five years on PFI repayments. Between 2018 and 2023, £4.2 billion (31%) of all PFI spending by local authorities was on interest rates alone. Despite delivering over £80 billion worth of public assets over the years, the PFI model was retired in 2018 after becoming synonymous with high costs and inflexible contracts and due to the 'fiscal risks' it posed to the public sector. 845 schools have been built and/or are maintained by a PFI contract, covering nearly half a million pupils. This new analysis finds that PFI schools are financially worse off than non-PFI schools, after controlling for key characteristics. In particular: However, there is, no significant evidence that PFI schools are more likely to be failing than non-PFI schools. The study also looks at the financial accounts of PFI providers, finding that: Of these eight companies, five are registered in offshore tax havens. While many consider the PFI experiment to be a failure, the current government may look to reintroduce a new version to finance its 'decade of national renewal', given the updated spending rules still do not leave sufficient headroom to finance all this expansion through conventional fiscal policy. However, to do so it will need to learn from the lessons of the past, which will remain challenging given the lack of institutional knowledge over the use and impact of PFI. Author of the report and NIESR senior economist Max Mosley, said: The core question that remains for the government to answer when considering a reintroduced PFI model is whether these risks are worth it. It is argued that removing the limits from infrastructure projects can be achieved with simple adjustments to fiscal rules or by simply removing investment from fiscal rules altogether. The judgment the government must make is a simple risk and reward one: whether the risks of introducing the Public Private Partnership model outlined in this work are better or worse than the risks to further changes in spending rules. It is the view of this report that it would be difficult not to side with the latter.",Canary,2025-01-23T09:38:13+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/23/pfi-schools/
Badenoch's 'pupil improvements' claim at PMQs was actually from fiddled figures,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said: The OECD found children in England rose up global league tables in maths, reading and science. Conservative government action means English schools now top the Western world But a University College London (UCL) study found ""serious flaws"" in the government's education statistics. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data compares attainment by 15 year old pupils across developed countries. UCL found that in the UK for 2018 about 40% of students were not included in the statistics. This could result in those with lower attainment being excluded from the data, given freedom of information requests by UCL showed schools with lower grades were less likely to participate in the study. Badenoch and Starmer both argued at PMQs that vast academisation has improved standards. Starmer said: Mr Speaker, it was Labour that introduced academies in the first place to drive up standards In 2010, around 6% of secondary schools were academies. Now 81.9% of secondaries are academies, along with 42.7% of primary schools. But, in another study, UCL found no educational improvement as a result of children attending multi-academy chains. And an Education Policy Institute (EPI) report found that academy chains are ""over-represented in the lowest performing groups"" for primary schools. It's no wonder the National Education Union (NEU) are against academisation. When it comes to GCSEs, the results have slumped to 2010 levels, underscoring the idea that academisation has driven up standards is misplaced. One issue with academies is the 'top slicing' of excessive executive pay, funded by the public purse. 44 academy trust CEOs now earn more than £200,000 per year in what resembles the corporate sector. That's wage rises of up to 50% in five years. Whereas, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. From 2010 to 2016, schools could become academies if they 'voluntarily chose to'. But this choice is not as voluntary as was made out. From 2010, the Tory government cut the education budget by 25% over four years. At the same time, they told schools that they will award them £25,000 and increase their budget by up to 10% if they become academies. Thus, schools do not choose to become academies because they believe they are better, but to survive arbitrary austerity conditions imposed by the government. The Tories then mandated the transition to academies in 2016. There's no evidence it has improved anything (and some to the contrary).",Canary,2025-01-22T20:43:56+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/pmqs-22-january/
Now the US wants to fly its drones out of the UK - despite widespread outrage,"Protestors led by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and Drone Wars will gather outside the main gates of RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire at 1pm on Saturday 25 January to oppose plans to fly US Global Hawk drones from the base. The protest comes as the newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump once again repeated his plan to 'Make America Great' articulating a 'peace through strength' foreign policy. The US plan to operate the huge RQ-4 Global Hawk drones from RAF Fairford as part of NATO's 'Agile Combat Employment' (ACE) concept which argues that key military aircraft should be able to operate from different bases in order to make it harder for adversaries to conduct pre-emptive strikes. As the Telegraph reported, ""introducing the long-range RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones to the Gloucestershire base means severing a vital flight path used by airlines serving the West Midlands airport several times a week"": Now airport managers have written to the CAA warning that flights could be extended by hundreds of extra miles and delayed by up to 20 minutes while the Global Hawks are flying to and from Fairford. According to documents submitted to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the ""working assumption"" is that when the drones are at the base they will fly 2-3 times per week. However, a trial flight of the giant drone into the base in August 2024 seriously disrupted UK passenger flights arriving into Birmingham airport. CND general secretary Sophie Bolt said: The Global Hawk is part of the US spying apparatus and has been for decades, from the devastating invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan to supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza. Whether it's US nuclear weapons stationed at RAF Lakenheath or drone flights from RAF Fairford, these British bases are critical hubs for the US war-fighting machine. With Donald Trump back in power this is even more alarming. Instead of hiding behind bogus arguments of national security, the British government should be held accountable for the war crimes being perpetrated from these bases. Director of Drone Wars Chris Cole said: While in theory the UK has to give approval for any military operations carried out from its territory, given that the UK government is so determined to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Washington, there must be serious questions as to whether the Government would ever refuse permission for flights, no matter what the purpose of the operation. Allowing US drones to fly from Fairford is effectively handing Washington a blank cheque for its drone operations and must be challenged.",Canary,2025-01-22T17:53:05+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/22/now-the-us-wants-to-fly-its-drones-out-of-the-uk-despite-widespread-outrage/
The Assisted Dying Bill Committee just voted to EXCLUDE key people who don't agree with it,"The first committee meeting of Kim Leadbeater's assisted dying bill confirmed what many disabled people already knew – and have been highlighting from the beginning. Specifically, that the bill and its proponents have disgracefully dismissed and sidelined disabled voices at every turn. This was once again painfully evident when members overwhelmingly voted to exclude a leading disabled activist as a witness in its upcoming sessions. In particular, among other amendments, they shot down one which sought to include Ellen Clifford, who this January momentously took on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in the High Court over its dangerous plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment – and won. On 21 January, the Public Bill Committee for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life Bill) sat for the first time. Including herself, Leadbeater has appointed 14 supporters of the bill to this committee responsible for scrutinising it. These include health minister Stephen Kinnock and justice minister Sarah Sackman. Six other Labour MPs who supported the bill will join them. There's also two Conservative MPs, two Liberal Democrats, and one Plaid Cymru MP that backed it as well. The remaining nine – six Labour, two Conservative, and one Liberal Democrat – opposed the bill at second reading. Immediately, it's clear the weighting of the committee is heavily pro-assisted dying from the get-go. Now, it's also already apparent that this is biasing the evidence-gathering process. During this first session, it was quickly obvious that Leadbeater was moving to mothball scrutiny and genuine challenges to her bill. She started by bringing a motion to make discussions on the proposed witness list private. In other words, she wanted to conceal this part of the meeting from the public. Naturally, the pro-assisted dying stacked members passed this through. It means that all matters pertaining to why Leadbeater selected the witnesses she has, happened behind closed doors. To start, the committee will take oral evidence from around 42 witnesses during three upcoming sessions this January. At the time of writing, the committee has not yet published the witness list on the bills page – so we don't currently know who this will include. However, we do know who this won't include already – and that's legendary Ellen Clifford: Specifically, Labour MP Naz Shah brought a series of amendments to the witness list. One of these was to remove Irwin Mitchell partner and solicitor Yogi Amin from the line-up and replace him with Clifford. Predictably, the committee shot the amendment down with a resounding clamour of ""no's"". Evidently, fresh from her High Court win for disabled people's rights, Clifford's tenacity against the DWP has the pro-assisted dying proponents anxious to avoid her holding their feet to the fire in an evidence session on parliamentary record for all to see. Of course, it's also hardly surprising from a committee make-up that already failed to include a single disabled MP that voted against the bill. Moreso when you take into account that many of its members support the bill as is. And add to that, that some want to water down its so-called safeguards even further, and you have the recipe for more disastrous sidelining of disabled voices. Effectively, like Leadbeater, they see little wrong in a bill with a swelling litany of issues. This is despite the fact that every single DPPOs – all 350 – has opposed it from the start. That mere fact alone should be telling enough. Moreover, it's obvious that Leadbeater and the largely pro-assisted dying panel would be reticent to remove Amin. The solicitor has supported a number of high profile court cases seeking to legalise assisted dying – most recently in 2018. There were other witnesses the committee snubbed in Shah's amendments as well. This included the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP). This was because the committee considered that the General Medical Council (GMC) and the British Medical Association (BMA) covered its remit. As the Canary's Rachel Charlton-Dailey pointed out, that wouldn't have anything to do with psychiatrists majority concerned existing 'safeguards' on consent are woefully inadequate where coercion comes in: Arguably though, it'd be better to include mental health advocates with lived experience over the RCP. Certainly, it'd be a shameful oversight if the committee leaves out people living with mental health conditions who can directly speak to issues around coercion firsthand. Leadbeater has since walked back on this decision to leave the RCP out. She has now added the RCP to the witness list. Naturally though, not without making a dig at people who oppose the bill: The committee will still have to agree to this at a future session. It also looks to be the case that Leadbeater hasn't included any experts from Canada either. However, aside from spurning Clifford's inclusion, the other most alarming revelation was that the witness list won't be remotely balanced. Conservative MP Danny Kruger drew attention to this. He highlighted that there were 38 witnesses he considered supporters of the bill, and only 20 opposed. He also noted that of the eight witnesses from ""foreign jurisdictions"", all support assisted dying within their own countries. Multiple members weighed in here to defend the decision. They opined that it apparently only made sense to have people involved in the 'successful' operation of assisted dying bills elsewhere to make Leadbeater's legislation ""workable"". That is, they had no interest taking evidence from people and communities assisted dying laws have harmed and put at risk elsewhere. Ultimately, Leadbeater and the committee's choice to leave Clifford out speaks volumes. Despite the spiteful quip in her post about the RCP U-turn, Leadbeater is right about one thing – her list isn't enough. Not when it's looking likely that she has deliberately chosen not to include even a single representative from a DDPO on it. Contrary to Leadbeater and her supporters repeated boasts to inclusivity, the committee proceedings are already shaping up to be anything but.

Media democracy has persistently failed - as the Sun and prince Harry case shows,"Almost exactly 24 hours after the trial was due to begin, the Sun has reached a settlement agreement with lord Watson and prince Harry to avoid trial over allegations of phone hacking, illegal activity and a cover up at the Sun and the News of the World. As part of the agreement, and after many years of denial, the Sun has finally admitted that it was indeed engaged in unlawful activity. However, the case also points to a wider, systemic problem in the corporate media. It's one of concentrated ownership and lack of accountability. Speaking from court, Hacked Off Board Director Emma Jones said, It is a humiliating day for The Sun and the senior executives at News Group Newspapers, who have finally admitted that allegations of illegality made against the publisher are true. News Group has now spent over a billion pounds – funds which could have been put to much better use supporting journalism – fighting allegations which they have now largely admitted were accurate. The Sun has spent years denigrating the individuals and campaigners – including Hacked Off – who have alleged illegal activity at the newspaper and forced 1300 people through legal action to uphold their rights. Today, The Sun's targets have been vindicated. It is now clear that the public and Parliament were lied to by the newspaper and its publisher, as part of the most extraordinary corporate cover up in living memory. The Sun's claims of innocence formed part of the broader press campaign against independent regulation and Leveson Part Two. Now we have confirmation – from the publisher itself – that this was fabrication, the Prime Minister must get on with robust policy on press accountability without further delay. Yet somehow, independent media like the Canary is the villain – even thought many of us are the ones who are independently regulated by the government-approved IMPRESS. It said of the Sun case: How can the public trust an industry where invasions of privacy and coverups remain commonplace? Having previously attempted to deny and deflect any wrongdoing, News Group Newspapers have now admitted to serious intrusion, phone hacking, misuse of private information and unlawful activities carried out by private investigators for the Sun and the News of the World against Prince Harry. It is incredibly disheartening that, during a period when the Sun and NGN could have carried out in-depth reviews and implemented changes to ethical practices of their journalists, they chose to litigate instead. Prince Harry is in the privileged position of being able to afford to take a media giant like NGN to court and get an apology. The vast majority of the public, however, in a similar position would have been financially ruined by taking a similar course of action. This can no longer be dismissed as being the case of a few bad apples; self-regulation of the press has failed. Effective and truly independent regulation is the only way to stop these unethical practises which have been commonplace across the industry. Impress holds its publishers to the highest standards in journalism and provides accessible avenues to justice for all. Without rigorous and transparent accountability, the world of journalism risks surrendering public trust forever. So, why are we in this mess? The UK corporate media landscape is dominated by a shrinking number of powerful conglomerates, leaving little room for diversity, independence, or public interest. However, one group has been consistently advocating for change. Now, it is set to host its yearly Media Democracy Festival. The latest Media Reform Coalition report paints a troubling picture of concentrated ownership across newspapers, broadcasting, and online platforms—posing serious questions about the independence and plurality of media in a democratic society. Three companies – DMG Media, News UK, and Reach – control 90% of the national newspaper market. DMG Media alone dominates 40% of the market through titles like the Daily Mail and Metro, while News UK (publisher of the Sun and the Times) commands 33%. Smaller groups like the Guardian are little better content-wise, pushing a narrative that maintains the failing status quo. Local journalism fares no better: six publishers own 71% of local newspapers, with Newsquest, Reach, and National World holding larger market shares than the combined total of 157 smaller publishers. This concentration has created ""news deserts,"" with 2.5 million people living in areas without a local newspaper. Even digital shifts haven't democratised media, as corporate publishers pivot to generic regional ""hub"" websites, replacing local reporting with cookie-cutter content. Online news consumption has risen to 68% of the UK population, but this hasn't diluted corporate influence. Meta and Google dominate the ecosystem, controlling 80% of online advertising revenue. Of the top 15 online news platforms, 10 are owned by Meta, Alphabet, or X Corp. Combined, Meta's services (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) reach 72% of online news consumers, reinforcing their gatekeeping role in public discourse. The BBC, a supposed bastion of public service broadcasting, faces political and financial pressures, losing audience share to platforms like Netflix and YouTube. It has bene heavily criticised for its coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza – adding to a rap sheet that critics argue shows it is little more than a mouthpiece for the Western establishment. In the local radio sector, Bauer and Global own 65% of analogue stations and over three-quarters of the national digital radio market. Cuts to regional programming further erode localized news coverage. The impacts of such concentrated ownership are stark. The pursuit of profits has led to newsroom closures, job cuts, and a reliance on clickbait content. Dominant platforms and media channels often amplify sensationalism, conspiracy theories, and divisive narratives. Moreover, with a handful of owners dictating the news agenda, diverse voices struggle to be heard. Despite these issues, regulatory bodies like Ofcom remain passive and ineffective, and government promises of reform have yielded little. This lack of action perpetuates an imbalance that prioritizes shareholder and corporate interests over public accountability. So, the Media Reform Coalition is once again hosting a 'democracy' festival to highlight how this can be changed. As it said in a statement: Every year, the Media Democracy Festival brings together activists, independent media outlets, journalists, researchers and policymakers to debate how we can transform the media into a more independent, accountable and democratic system that serves the public interest. With keynote speeches from leading public figures, panel discussions and interactive workshops covering debates on Big Tech, media moguls, the future of the BBC and how to create more ethical, community-based journalism. Whether you're a hardened media reform advocate, a disillusioned media worker looking for change, or a curious media consumer, join us and help to reshape the media so that it works for people, not profit. The group advocates for ""progressive reform"" to counterbalance the influence of powerful media and tech conglomerates. Proposals include stricter regulation of ownership limits, better funding for independent journalism, and more public accountability for tech platforms. For younger audiences, who overwhelmingly consume news online, the stakes are particularly high. The Media Reform Coalition report emphasises the need for a media ecosystem that reflects the full diversity of society, rather than one shaped by a few powerful actors. As the Sun/prince Harry case shows, corporate media is not to be trusted. If you want to get involved with shaping media that can be, you can register for the Media Democracy Festival here.",Canary,2025-01-22T15:21:51+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/media-democracy-has-persistently-failed-as-the-sun-and-prince-harry-case-shows/
Palestine Action are occupying the offices of Aviva - complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"From 7.30am on Wednesday 22 January, Palestine Action begun occupying 'The Aviva Centre' in Bristol over its ongoing complicity with Israel's genocide in Gaza. One activist is on top of the overhang of the 'UK's largest insurer': Another spray painted the front glass of the building. Messages painted on the building include 'Pal Action' and 'Elbit Out': Aviva provides the mandatory employers liability insurance for UAV Engines in Staffordshire, a drone engine factory owned by Israel's biggest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems. Recent disclosures show the company no longer holds direct shares in Elbit Systems. However, as well as insuring an Israeli weapons factory, Allianz also continue to hold investments in funds which hold Elbit shares. By insuring UAV Engines, Aviva is facilitating the design and production of drone engines used to power Israel's killer drone fleet, including the Hermes 450 drones and IAI's Harop and Harpy attack drones. Such drones are used to surveil, massacre and terrorise Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank. In direct contradiction with facilitating Elbit weapons production, 'The Aviva Business Ethic Code' states: ""Respecting our customers, colleagues, communities, partners and the environment is part of our approach to human rights. As a company, we have an obligation to ensure our business activities do not cause or contribute to violations of human rights of others"". Elbit Systems provides over 85% of Israel's military drone fleet and land-based equipment, as well as munitions, missiles and electronic warfare. According to Elbit's CEO Bezhalel Machlis, the company ""ramped up production"" to arm the Israeli military to commit what the International Court of Justice ruled as a 'plausible genocide' in Gaza. The company routinely uses assaults on Palestinians as a means to market new weaponry as ""battle-tested"". Despite a ceasefire being implemented in Gaza, the Israeli military begun ""Operation Iron Wall"" in Jenin, West Bank. In the last 24 hours, they've killed 9 Palestinians and injured 70 in the region. Many of those killings were conducted using air strikes and drones. Palestine Action's direct action campaign has also consistently target Allianz offices, as they provide insurance for the other Elbit British subsidiaries. Actions against Allianz included operations against 10 of their British and Irish offices overnight, as well as sustained actions against the insurers premises. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: Israel's biggest weapons firm could not work in Britain in isolation. Aviva is providing the mandatory insurance Elbit needs in order to build Israeli weapons on our doorstep. Without insurance, the Israeli arms maker would not be able to operate in Britain. Palestine Action will continue to take direct action against companies such as Aviva as long as they facilitate the destruction of Palestine and massacres of the indigenous population of the land.",Canary,2025-01-22T10:40:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/22/aviva-palestine-action/
Landlords banked £56.2bn in rent from young people in ONE year. We need to end the scam immediately.,"People under 45 are paying 66% of all rent in Britain. This amounted to a record £56.2bn for 2024, according to research from housing agents Hamptons. The total amount of rent paid by under 45s has increased by a startling 59% over the past decade, reflecting eye-watering price increases as much as additional renters. The thing is, landlords do not provide housing. They simply set up an extortionate toll gate between people and shelter. They middle-man between us and builders in an atmosphere of artificial scarcity. Instead, the state should provide housing at cost price for people, paid back in affordably monthly sums. This would pop the housing bubble, bringing down the price of housing across the board. From 1995 to 2020, the 'value' of UK housing wealth increased from £1 trillion to £5.7 trillion. What's ridiculous is that banks create new money to fund large mortgages that, in turn, inflate the price of housing. According to the Office of National Statistics, average UK private rents increased by 9.1% in the year up until November 2024. The Bank of England raised interest rates in response to the inflation crisis, which is partly caused by our lack of a Green New Deal for energy and lack of price controls or public ownership for essentials. Higher mortgage rates mean even less people can afford to buy a home a home, contributing to the number of under 45s renting rising by 149,000 to 3,4 million last year. Indeed, prices are so expensive that as of 2022, homes cost as much – relative to average earnings – as they did in 1876. So we have a situation where under 45s are wasting £56.2bn in passive income for landlords in a single year. That's income that could be invested into home and land ownership for citizens under a state issued plan. The huge private landlord robbery also leads to a high benefits bill. The British state pays 88% (or £26.8bn) of the housing budget on subsidising landlords with either legacy housing benefit or the housing element of universal credit. The Labour government has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes during this parliament. But chancellor Rachel Reeves has also said that they aren't going to spend any public money doing this. So it remains to be seen how many will be affordable, social housing. Another issue is worker shortages in the construction industry. For one, the Home Builders Federation (HBF) has said that the UK ""does not have a sufficient talent pipeline"" of builders to meet the goal. Therefore, it is likely the problem of private landlords extorting their tenants is not going anywhere anytime soon.",Canary,2025-01-22T10:17:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/landlords-banked-56-2bn-in-rent-from-young-people-in-one-year-we-need-to-end-the-scam-immediately/
Matt Wrack demands 'more investment' as attacks on firefighters hit 15-year high,"Data collected by Legal Expert has cast light on the threat faced by firefighters around the UK and led to Matt Wrack, then-general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, calling for urgent change. The information, which was gathered through Freedom of Information requests sent to nearly 40 fire services around the UK, shows that members of the public attacked crew members on thousands of occasions. Firefighters were subjected to physical attacks, verbal assault and threats of violence, with numerous missiles thrown at them and their appliances during operations. Statistics published by the Home Office indicate that there were 96 injuries suffered from attacks during England-based operational incidents in 2023/24. Not only was this a rise of more than 25% on the year before, but it was the highest figure recorded in any of the past 15 years, and a 284% increase on the 25 cases noted in 2014/15. Firefighters suffered 82 slight injuries and 14 serious injuries, according to the data. Before leaving his role in January, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) general secretary Matt Wrack called for greater trust and protection for firefighters when responding to the data collected by Legal Expert. Wrack said: Firefighters must be able to respond to emergencies everywhere without fear of abuse or injury from attacks. It is vital that fire and rescue services retain and build trust with local communities, but community engagement projects have been cut while firefighters are sent out with fewer resources and smaller crews. Some services are now overseen by police commissioners, which jeopardises public perception of the service as independent and humanitarian. We need investment in the fire and rescue service to reduce the risks firefighters face while they are protecting others. West Midlands Fire Service took in 666 reports of violent activity between April 2020 and November 2024–with the data covering a period more than a year shorter than that of most other services. There were 449 cases of verbal abuse, at a rate above one every four days. Only three other services across the UK reported more instances of physical or verbal attacks in six years than the 180 seen in the West Midlands in 2023 alone. Also returning a significant number of cases was Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. The North West's largest service had 372 separate incidents between November 2019 and October 2024. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service flagged 327 incidents across 2019-2023 and most of 2024. This includes 140 in the Newcastle area, with the Tyneside city having more assault reports than all but three regions, excluding Tyne and Wear, in the entire country. Kent (190), South Wales (139), and London (104) were also host to more than 100 incidents. It was not the same story everywhere. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service claimed to have had no incidents whatsoever, while other populous areas like Merseyside (five), West Yorkshire (seven) and Lancashire (12) returned relatively small figures. Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service confirmed only ten cases to Legal Expert, stating that it was sharing details only of incidents which led to crew members suffering injuries. Fire service staff have felt the strain in recent years, with one report showing a 40% rise in mental health-related absences. Multiple services also saw staff miss significant amounts of time because of attacks by members of the public. The London Fire Brigade lost 372 working days due to assault-related absence, 259 of which involved staff in Barnet. Northern Irish staff were also significantly affected, with three injured crew members missing 103 days between them. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, which noted 56 incidents including 17 physical assaults, provided summaries of its reports. They paint a picture of firefighters facing needless violence in many scenarios. An April 2022 case noted how the family member of a person who died in an incident attacked one firefighter, scratching their face, then ""tried to run down"" two more. In another incident, Tamworth Fire Station was informed that a first responder was struck on the ankle when a member of the public threw tiles from the roof of a building. Rugeley Fire Station received a report in 2020 of one shovel-wielding occupier refusing to let staff enter the property to tackle a fire. Even training was not without risk, as one station reported two young people, including one carrying a knife, confronted staff during a course. Another report noted that while staff were filming for Safe + Sound, a programme aiming to ""educate children about safety in a fun and interactive way"", they were verbally abused and threatened by a member of the public. On 39 occasions, staff experienced a noteworthy amount of verbal abuse while carrying out tasks. This included two incidents where protestors at an NHS vaccination clinic for children hurled abuse at staff while blocking access routes. Fire services across the UK shared reports of missiles being thrown, with objects including bricks, stones, eggs and fireworks all aimed at staff. Hospitalisation was not an uncommon factor of assaults, as numerous services shared reports of at least one staff member needing medical attention because of an assault suffered on the job. Legal Expert offers free advice to emergency service workers considering civil action for injuries suffered in an assault at work. Those interested in learning their legal options can call 0800 073 8804 or contact Legal Expert online.",Canary,2025-01-21T20:43:12+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/matt-wrack-firefighters/
Chris Nineham to speak publicly on Wednesday over his arrest at pro-Palestine march,"Chris Nineham, co-founder of the Stop The War Coalition, will speak publicly for the first time tomorrow (Wednesday 22 January). It is following his arrest at Saturday's Palestine March in London. Chris Nineham, who was the chief steward of the demo, was one of 77 arrests made by police in what has been widely viewed as a major crackdown on the pro-Palestine protest movement. He will speak at the premiere screening of a new film about the censorship of coverage of events in Gaza in a London cinema on 22 January. Also at the screening will be author and comedian Alexei Sayle and the mothers of three young female activists, who, it's claimed, have been unjustly imprisoned for taking direct action in support of Palestine. The producer of the film Censoring Palestine Norman Thomas said: The police crackdown on pro-Palestine protesters on Saturday marks a new phase in escalating state censorship. This, combined with the outrageous use of counter terrorism laws to arrest journalists and activists, means we are seeing the biggest attack on the freedom of speech in living memory. The police claimed this was to do with protecting a synagogue, but their real intentions were obvious — to deter any challenge to the state broadcaster, the BBC, and to do this in as harsh a way as possible designed to intimidate people from doing it again. Thomas believes the police are acting on direction from the government. He said: Keir Starmer is really showing his true authoritarian colours. He is criminalising dissent and using the police to enforce state censorship. The BBC does not show us the truth about what's happening in Gaza and now we're not allowed to protest against the distorted version they're handing us. Censoring Palestine explores the way the media has covered events in Gaza since October 2023 and documents what it claims are systematic efforts to suppress the ""genocidal truth"" of the conflict. It includes interviews with film director Ken Loach talking about his own experiences of censorship and the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Ben Jamal who was also interviewed under caution for his part in Saturday's protest. Censoring Palestine is the latest production from Platform Films makers of Oh Jeremy Corbyn – The Big Lie which was controversially axed by Glastonbury Festival in 2023 after an online campaign by pro-Israel lobby groups. The film will be screened in the Genesis Cinema in London on Wednesday 22 January at 6.40pm. The screening will be followed by an open discussion with Chris Nineham, Alexei Sayle, journalist Sarah Wilkinson, the mothers of three imprisoned pro-Palestine activists, Stop The War Convenor Lindsey German, and the filmmakers. Tickets are available here.",Canary,2025-01-21T19:39:45+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/chris-nineham/
Over 40 legal experts call for inquiry into Met handling of Palestine March - as its boss gets caught out,"Over 40 prominent UK legal scholars have condemned the actions of the Met Police in relation to Saturday 18 January's Palestine March in London in a letter to the home secretary. They have called the Met's approach to policing ""an abuse of police powers"" and called on the government repeal repressive legislation and defend the right to protest as a cornerstone of democracy. It comes as news has broken of the Met Police boss schmoozing with the pro-Zionist organisation the British Board of Deputies AFTER Saturday's march Events on Saturday at the national Palestine protest have drawn a wave of criticism from across the political and social spectrum towards the Metropolitan Police. The Met reneged on a previous agreement to allow a march from BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, a route taken several times before. It then sought to impose a route the pro-Israel Board of Deputies publicly claimed that it had proposed to the police. This was rejected by the Palestine Coalition organising group. Finally, the Met banned any alternative march route allowing only a rally in Whitehall. On the day there was a massive police presence, with police obstructing the gathering for the rally in many respects. There was an unusually high number of arrests of protestors. The chief steward who organises the demonstrations for the Palestine Coalition in discussion with police was violently arrested on the day, and with the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, subsequently charged with offences under the Public Order Act. It has emerged that the day after the protest the Met Police chief Mark Rowley addressed a meeting of the Board of Deputies in which he boasted he had ""used conditions on the protests more than we ever have done before"", and that his team imposed ""sharper and stronger conditions"" on the organisers of the demonstration. As Middle East Eye reported; The day after the rally, on Sunday, Rowley gave a speech at an event held by the pro-Israel Board of Deputies of British Jews, where he said that ""the powers to condition protests are quite limited – we've used conditions on the protests more than we ever have done before in terms of times, constraints, routes"". ""We have to take into account the Human Rights Act, that's what the law says, and of course the rights of all communities, the rights of protesters and freedom of speech, etc,"" Rowley said. The Board of Deputies supported Israel's war on Gaza and slammed the Labour government for imposing a partial arms embargo on Israel in September. It was also one of the groups that reportedly urged the Met to ban the pro-Palestine march's original route. Dr. Paul O'Connell, Reader in Law, SOAS University of London said: This letter is signed by over 40 leading lawyers and academics. People who, in one capacity or another, have worked on issues related to human rights and the rule of law for decades. It shows, in no uncertain terms, that these experts have the gravest of concerns about the policing of the PSC demonstration on 18 January 2025, and more generally about the assault on the right to protest in Britain. Freedom to assemble and protest is the very lifeblood of a democratic society. If people protesting the commission of a genocide in Gaza are not safe to do so, then it bodes ill for individual freedom and democratic life in Britain in the twenty-first century. The Home Secretary, and anyone else in a position of authority, has an obligation to act now, to make sure that the law and police tactics in Britain protect and facilitate the right to protest, as required by regional and international human rights treaties that Britain is a party to.",Canary,2025-01-21T16:55:41+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/met-police-palestine-march-inquiry/
Green Party politicians rally behind people arrested at Saturday's pro-Palestine march,"Two Green Party politicians have hit back at the Met Police over the arrests of peaceful protesters on Saturday 18 January at the Palestine March in London. Following this weekend's disgraceful policing tactics from the Met Police against protestors organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) to urge the British government to stop arming Israel, Green Party London Assembly Member Zoë Garbett issued the following statement: ""I'm outraged at the way the Met handled this weekend's protest. Policing is about choices, and it was the Met's choice to arrest peaceful protestors at such unnecessarily high rates. ""The Met cannot have it both ways: repeatedly changing where and how protests can occur, arresting people for breaching overly complex protest restrictions, and posting misleading public statements after the fact is not the way to facilitate protest. ""The Met complains when protest groups don't engage with them, yet when groups like Palestine Solidarity Campaign do work with them in good faith, it seems the Met can't do the same. ""I plan to confront the Met Commissioner directly over this weekend's events the next time he sits before the Assembly. Londoners deserve to know exactly who their police officers are protecting and serving."" Meanwhile, deputy Green Party leader and AM Zack Polanski wrote to home secretary Yvette Cooper. He said the following: ""I am a London Assembly member who attended and spoke at the peaceful Palestine Solidarity rally this weekend. ""The police were informed of our intention to protest against the decision to ban the march to the BBC. It was announced that a small delegation would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC and lay flowers to commemorate the deceased if and when we were stopped by the police. Among our group were parliamentarians Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, along with many community organisations. ""As shown in many videos, police had agreed through negotiation that the delegation could pass through and lay flowers. However, they subsequently allowed a much larger group into Trafalgar Square. It is concerning to see Metropolitan Police tweets falsely stating that people were ""forcing through."" ""Such language feeds false and often racist narratives about the Palestine Solidarity Campaign's protests that have been peaceful. ""I'm also disturbed by your own communications suggesting there was an intention to disrupt a synagogue. Many Jewish participants, including myself, find this accusation offensive. The goal was to protest the BBC's failure to report the genocide accurately, and this was planned quite some distance from the synagogue and way after services had ended. ""Public trust in our institutions is already fragile. Politicising the police and smearing innocent people only worsens this. I urge you to review the evidence including footage from body worn cameras from the event, retract your comments and clarify the situation with the Metropolitan Police.",Canary,2025-01-21T13:45:35+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/met-police-palestine-march/
Capital Radio North Wales is being abolished - but people are fighting back,"Cymdeithas yr Iaith has called on officers of the commercial radio company Global Radio to reverse its decision to abolish Welsh language provision of Capital Radio North Wales, and has asked the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Ofcom, about its part in the decision. Global seems to have made the decision following the introduction of the Media Act (2024) by the parliament in Westminster last year. The new law abolishes any regulations on the content and formatting of commercial radio stations. According to the organisation, this confirms the need to devolve powers over broadcasting from Westminster to Wales. In the letter to Ofcom over Capital Radio North Wales, Carl Morris, Chair of Cymdeithas yr Iaith's Media Group, wrote: As you are aware, the proper coverage of the nations and regions in the UK by broadcasting and media organisations is a key part of government policy, and a particular responsibility of Ofcom. So too is government support for the Welsh language across radio and other forms of communications. We were therefore dismayed and deeply concerned to learn of Global's plans. The letter calls on Global not to continue with its intention and on Ofcom to stop such a decision because of its impact on the Welsh language and communities: Capital provides Welsh-language provision and music to an audience that would not necessarily choose to listen to the BBC's Welsh-language provision. Bringing it to an end would undermine the ideal of plurality in the Welsh medium broadcasting. In addition it will be a blow to local communities in north Wales, and lead to the loss of jobs and other opportunities. Your decision would therefore be extremely damaging, linguistically, on a community level and economically Carl Morris added: It is clear that neither politicians in Westminster or Ofcom are interested in the benefits of the Welsh language and our communities, and that the Welsh Government needs to get on with the plans to establish a Broadcasting and Communications Advisory Body for Wales as a first step towards the devolution of broadcasting. Mae Cymdeithas yr Iaith wedi galw ar swyddogion cwmni radio masnachol Global Radio i wrthdroi ei benderfyniad i ddiddymu darpariaeth Gymraeg Capital North Wales, ac wedi gofyn i'r awdurdod rheoleiddio ar gyfer telethrebu, Ofcom, am ei ran yn y penderfyniad.

Yn ôl y mudiad, mae hyn yn cadarnhau'r angen i ddatganoli grymoedd dros ddarlledu o San Steffan i Gymru. Yn y llythyr at Ofcom, ysgrifennodd Carl Morris, Cadeirydd Grŵp Digidol Cymdeithas yr Iaith: Byddwch yn ymwybodol bod darpariaeth briodol ar draws cenhedloedd a rhanbarthau y Derynas Gyfunol yn rhan allweddol o bolisi llywodraethol, ac yn gyfrifoldeb penodol i Ofcom. Felly hefyd mae cefnogaeth lywodraethol i ddarpariaeth Gymraeg ar y radio a'r cyfryngau yn ehangach Rydym felly yn hynod siomedig a phryderus o glywed am gynlluniau Global. Mae'r llythyr yn galw ar Global i beidio parhau â'i fwriad ac ar Ofcom i atal penderfyniad o'r math oherwydd ei effaith ar y Gymraeg a chymunedau: Mae Capital yn dod â darpariaeth a cherddoriaeth Gymraeg at gynulleidfa na fyddai o reidrwydd yn dewis gwrando ar ddarpariaeth Gymraeg y BBC. Bydd yn tanseilio'r delfryd o blwraliaeth darlledu yn y Gymraeg. Yn ogystal bydd yn ergyd i gymunedau lleol yn ngogledd Cymru, ac yn arwain at golli swyddi a chyfleoedd eraill. Byddai'r penderfyniad yn hynod niweidiol yn ieithyddol, yn gymunedol ac yn economaidd. Ychwanegodd Carl Morris: Mae'n amlwg nad oes gan wleidyddion yn San Steffan nac Ofcom ddiddordeb ym muddiannau'r Gymraeg a'n cymunedau, a bod angen i Lywodraeth Cymru symud ymlaen â'r cynlluniau i sefydlu Corff Cynghori ar Ddarlledu a Chyfathrebu i Gymru fel cam cyntaf tuag at ddatganoli darlledu.",Canary,2025-01-21T12:51:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/capital-radio-north-wales/
Nine climate-wrecking insurance giants just got their Wi-Fi CUT OFF by activists,"Activists from Shut The System have cut fiber optic cables to offices of hundreds of insurance companies, in a new form of non-violent direct action. They call on insurance companies to immediately end all underwriting for fossil fuel expansion and demand robust transition plans from fossil fuel clients. The action has caused huge levels of disruption with hours of work lost for insurance providers. These include three of the world's largest fossil fuel insurers, AXA, W.R. Berkely, AIG and more than 400 agents at Lloyd's of London and London's iconic Walkie Talkie tower: The group shut the following insurers down: Birmingham: Sheffield: Leeds: Shut The System took action against these companies due to their critical role underpinning the fossil fuel economy through underwriting contracts and investments. The sector is simultaneously withdrawing coverage from climate-affected regions and raising premiums for households due to extreme-weather related events. A Shut The System activist said: If these powerful companies don't make public statements that they will stop driving fossil fuel expansion and destroying life on Earth, then we have no choice but to stop them ourselves. We will not give up until insurance companies take responsible action. In recent years, the insurance sector has felt escalating pressure from environmental campaigners resulting in a string of breakthroughs. The insurer, Probitas, ruled out insuring West Cumbria Coal Mine and East African Crude Oil Pipeline after activists sprayed paint over their offices; and Zurich introduced new fossil fuel exclusion policies following negotiations with protesters. The group took action on the day that climate science-denier Donald Trump is inaugurated into the White House for a second term, following his scathing remarks about the UK's energy policies, saying the UK should 'get rid of windmills'. The growing urgency for the insurance industry to take the lead in addressing the climate crisis comes as we exceed the 1.5C critical threshold for global warming faster than many climate scientists predicted. This comes amidst of some of the worst wildfires ever seen in Los Angeles and severe flooding in the UK forcing thousands to evacuate their homes.",Canary,2025-01-20T17:24:25+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/insurance-companies-wi-fi-shut-the-system/
The Trump baby blimp could make a comeback - as protesters gear up in the UK,"The UK's Stop Trump Coalition has released a statement on the day of Donald Trump's second inauguration – 20 January – pledging to ""mobilise in our thousands and our millions"". It has been signed by more than a thousand grassroots campaigners, trade unionists, climate activists and others. Unfortunately, the original Trump baby blimp – whose images were shared around the world – may not feature. It currently resides in the Museum of London The Coalition organised some of the biggest protests in British history in response to the president's state visits in 2017 and 2018. Back in July 2018, more than 250,000 people turned out in London for a Stop Trump protest: As BBC News reported at the time: Rather than a red carpet, there was a sea of people, as two large marches took place – one led by Women's March London and another by the Stop Trump Coalition. The crowds had strong messages for the president – from their problems with his policies to hair styling tips. They were determined to make their voices heard, or at least create a lot of noise to make their point – that they did not want President Trump in the country. Now, the Stop Trump coalition is re-grouping – and protests are expected in London and across the world today as Trump is sworn in. Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: In the coming weeks, we are likely to witness appalling attacks on migrants and minorities in America – just as we saw with the racist 'Muslim ban' in the opening days of the first Trump administration in 2017. It is essential that there is a broad, democratic coalition which can bring together the opposition to Trumpism – and to the new far right here in the UK. That means mobilising in big numbers, but it also means working to network and strengthen movements on climate, anti-racism, migrants' rights, feminism, LGBT rights and other touchstone issues, alongside the trade union movement and the left. We will look to respond to the Trump administration's first policies and to bring together the resistance to the politics of bigotry and division in the US and around the world. The statement, which has been signed by more than a thousand people, reads: ""The second inauguration is a dark moment. The far right is on the march, with a common agenda of right-wing nationalism, racism, sexism, LGBT-phobia, climate denialism, union-busting, authoritarianism, and elite impunity. They represent the interests of a wealthy elite who use bigotry and dishonesty to divide us against each other. No matter Trump's claims, illegal occupations and crimes against humanity continue – whether perpetrated by Israel in Palestine or by Russia in Ukraine. ""We are not shocked by this situation. Trump and Musk – and Farage and Badenoch – are symptoms of the failure of our political and economic system. Free market economics and austerity laid the ground. By failing to challenge the far right on immigration and other key issues, and instead mirroring their rhetoric and narratives, Starmer – like Macron, Harris and Scholz – is handing victory to the far right. ""During Trump's first presidency, the Stop Trump Coalition helped organise some of the biggest demonstrations in British history against his state visits. There are millions of people in the UK who want to fight back against the far right, stop runaway climate change, and stand for just peace across the world. There will be mass opposition to political cooperation with the Trump administration, and to any trade deal that threatens our NHS or food standards. ""Fighting back means mobilising in our thousands and in our millions – but it must also mean a more fundamental effort to unite and strengthen movements dedicated to social and environmental justice, working class organisation, and universal human and civil rights. We pledge ourselves to that work, and to building a resistance to Trump and the politics he represents.""",Canary,2025-01-20T13:01:21+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/stop-trump-uk/
There' no 'ceasefire' in the corporate media's pro-Israel bias. Just look at the BBC.,"The producer of a shocking new film – Censoring Palestine – about the coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza in the corporate media claims state censorship of the coverage is intensifying despite the ceasefire. Norman Thomas, producer of Censoring Palestine said: Since October 2023, mainstream media outlets like the BBC have concentrated on trying to play down what most people consider an Israeli genocide going in Palestine. But now, since the ceasefire, they have what's even a bigger problem — which is playing down the part Britain has played in the genocide. Censoring Palestine will be premiered in London on Wednesday 22 January. It's the latest production from Platform Films who in 2023 made the controversial Oh Jeremy Corbyn – The Big Lie telling the rise and fall of the former Labour Party leader. Thomas said: Our previous film showed how the media helped bring down Jeremy Corbyn with smears and lies. Our new film shows the media committing an even worse crime — trying to hide a genocide. He argues that the need to censor coverage has been made much more urgent since it's emerged that Britain made a much bigger contribution to the Israeli war effort than simply supplying military equipment, but was involved in spying, reconnaissance, and other operations. Thomas said: It's clear now the British government hasn't just been complicit in genocide, it has taken part in it. And the British prime minister and other ministers may well find themselves charged with war crimes. This is sensational news but our mainstream media is giving it no coverage whatsoever. Moreover, he argues that the BBC, as the state broadcaster, is playing a lead role in the censorship. It's NO accident that the police, on the pretext of protecting a synagogue, are trying to stop pro-Palestine protesters demonstrating near the BBC offices in London. This is a case of the state trying to shore up censorship in the most blatant and disgraceful way. The film also shows the way that counter-terrorism laws are being used to silence voices of protest and dissent. Thomas said: Dawn raids on journalists, an academic being arrested for making a speech, protesters being jailed without bail for long periods of time – and all using what appear to be totally false and ridiculous accusations of terrorism. Our film paints a picture of a British establishment desperate to conceal the part it's played in the horrific crimes against humanity in Palestine. The film features interviews with Alexei Sayle, Roger Waters, and veteran film director Ken Loach – who speaks revealingly of his own experience with censorship in the past. In the film he totally condemns the role of the BBC in coverage of Gaza. ""The BBC is acting as an arm of the state,"" he says. Especially powerful in the film, Thomas said, are the contributions of the mothers of two young activists imprisoned for taking action to stop the manufacture of drones in Britain for use in Palestine. He said: Protest is being equated with dissent in an outrageous and unjust way Platform Films has made films for the BBC and Channel Four. Its film Oh Jeremy Corbyn – The Big Lie hit the UK headlines when it was axed from Glastonbury Festival in 2023 following an online campaign led by pro-Israel bodies. Censoring Palestine will get its first London screening in the Genesis Cinema, 93-95 Mile End Road E14UJ, at 6.40pm Wednesday 22 January, before going on general release. The screening will be followed by an open discussion with Alexei Sayle, journalist Sarah Wilkinson, the mothers of three imprisoned pro-Palestine activists, Stop The War Convenor Lindsey German, and the filmmakers.

Keir Starmer's OWN council is under pressure over its FINANCIAL ties to Israel,"On Monday 20 January, Keir Starmer's own council is set to decide whether to divest from companies complicit in Israel's genocide and the illegal occupation of Palestine, after thousands of residents demand action. Over 4,000 locals in prime minister Starmer's own constituency have signed a petition demanding Camden Council divest from companies complicit in human rights abuses and the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Led by Camden Friends of Palestine, the petition calls for transparency and divestment from companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and RTX: arms manufacturers that supply weapons to Israel. A series of shocking Freedom of Information (FOI) requests exposed that Camden Pension Fund is currently investing millions of pounds in funds connected to these companies. Despite repeated attempts by the council to avoid scrutiny – canceling meetings, closing the public gallery, refusing deputations, and even involving police – this petition has forced Camden Council to hold a crucial debate and vote on divestment on Monday 20 January. A Camden resident and spokesperson for Camden Friends of Palestine said: Camden council has repeatedly ignored the wishes of its communities, actively sidestepping demands for ethical investment. This petition will make Starmer's own council confront the question of divestment face on, for the whole of Camden to see. There is clearly a huge groundswell of support for divestment from these companies that are currently supplying weapons to Israel. The council must end its complicity now. Any other option but divestment would mean councillors prioritising a career in Starmer's Labour party over the communities they represent, opposition to genocide and international law. Presenting the petition to the councillors will be two Camden residents: Lubaba Khalid, a Palestinian resident, and Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos. Both are vocal in their stance against the British government's complicity in genocide and will be representing the 4,000 local residents who signed the petition calling for divestment. It is widely considered that Camden Council is dominated by Starmer's wing of the Labour Party. In the 2024 summer election, several councillors from Camden Council were rewarded with MP seats by the Labour Party. These include former council leader Georgia Gould, who became an MP, along with Danny Beales and Lloyd Hatton, both of whom also transitioned from local politics to parliament. This demonstrates Camden's importance as a key political power base for Starmer's Labour. Camden is represented by two MPs, one of whom is the PM who's constituency covers more 60% of the wards in the Camden Council. Starmer's majority was significantly reduced in the 2024 summer election – down from 22,766 in 2019 to just 11,572. This sharp decline highlights growing discontent in the constituency, in large part due to his position on Palestine and his support for the apartheid state of Israel. The decision the council faces follows the likes of Waltham Forest who committed to arms trade divestment amid pressure from Palestine activists. Local residents and activists will gather outside Camden Town Hall on Monday 20 January to show their support for divestment and urge councillors to vote in favour of the community led presentation:",Canary,2025-01-20T12:12:08+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/camden-council-bds-starmer/
Youth Demand made it to the BBC at Saturday's Palestine March - and were promptly nicked,"Three Youth Demand supporters defied Met Police restrictions on the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) demonstration on Saturday 18 January by standing outside the BBC with signs. Youth Demand are calling for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the new UK government to halt all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021. At around 4:00pm, the three were arrested under Section 14 of the Public Order Act after marching to the BBC and standing on the pavement with signs, defying the conditions imposed on the protest by the Met. One Youth Demand supporter was holding a sign saying ""Can I protest here?"", another held a completely blank sign: A Youth Demand spokesperson said: The BBC heralds itself as an institution built on truth, but it has treated genocide like a matter of opinion. We see the BBCs previous and ongoing complicity in the destruction of Palestine, and we recognise that when our institutions fail us it is down to the people to tell the truth We will not comply with the repressive conditions imposed by the Met police in order to silence dissent and protect the interests of a genocidal state. Our government is complicit in the genocide of the Palestinian people and we refuse to stand by and watch it happen. On February 1st, we will announce our plan to take resistance to a whole new level. Our spineless politicians have armed Israel for 15 months and now want us to go home and forget about Gaza, but we will not forget their crimes. It's time for all of us to escalate our resistance and to fight for nothing less than full liberation. On Wednesday 15 January the genocidal Israeli regime finally submitted to international pressure and agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza. On the same day, the PSC called for ""defiance"" of the Met Police ban on their demo at the BBC and said they would not go back on their commitment to hold march in support of the Palestinian people, and against Israel's genocide. After negotiations with the police, the PSC finally agreed to the demand of a static assembly at Whitehall, not the BBC. Meanwhile, since agreeing to a ceasefire Israeli Defense Forces have continued to drop bombs, killing over 100 Palestinians. Youth Demand summed up by saying: A ceasefire agreement is nowhere near Palestinian liberation. This ludicrous display of repression proves that the government believes we are a threat. So in 2025, we go big. On Saturday 1 February, the group is holding a launch event for 2025's actions. All the details are here.

Corbyn and McDonnell leave police station after being INTERVIEWED UNDER CAUTION by Met,"Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have been interviewed under caution by the Met Police. It was over the force's alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met – accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media – 'doorstopping' the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn's response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police's actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours' notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day – notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children's marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers – including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures – would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines – the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, 'please filter through.' When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation – a maximum of 25 people – be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to 'pass this up the line for a decision.' While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police's actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.",Canary,2025-01-19T17:21:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-mcdonnell-met-police/
People rally at the Old Bailey in support of the Palestine Action Filton 18,"Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them – and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the 'Filton 18' political prisoners have entered 'not guilty' pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel's largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including 'quadcopter' drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a 'terrorism connection'. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel's largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK's complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a ""terror connection"" in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates ""terrorism powers being misused"" to ""circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention"". The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.",Canary,2025-01-19T15:02:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/filton-18-trial/
Jeremy Corbyn slams Met Police's wilful 'inaccuracies' following mass-arrests at Palestine march,"On Saturday 18 January, Britons once again took to the streets to show their support for the people of Palestine. As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as ""fascist"" police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn's response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn's former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers' body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel's genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included ""domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide."" The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel's wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel's genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn't turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned 'second phase' of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn't mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It's alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it's not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions ""go away"" and that they'll be ""locked up"". On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn't come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn't be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It's all the same system; it's all the same violence; we're just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won't hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.",Canary,2025-01-19T14:01:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-met-police-palestine-march/
The blame game: the rise in false allegations of maternal abuse in long Covid and disability,"With Donald Trump's election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women's rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right – just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there's always someone else to blame – not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations – almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It's one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It's another to be blamed for your child's disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. ""Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called ""Functional Somatic Syndromes"" (FSS) and ""Medically Unexplained Syndromes"" (MUS) umbrellas"". DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there's a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument – with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It's such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there's no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke's Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It's more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope – one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' changed the phrase 'deliberately missing' education to 'unexplainable and/or persistent absence' in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it's easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem – all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism. It supplies simple answers, shifts the blame game on to the individual – all to avoid institutional due diligence. It is no wonder that women have been caught in the crosshairs. We have become an easy target for complex problems.",Canary,2025-01-19T12:51:45+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/fii-long-covid/
Starmer ends a disastrous week with his most ridiculous pledge yet,"Prime minister Keir Starmer has had another bad week. While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven't all ended with a punchline. That's because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn't finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn't: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the ""stomach or the balls"" to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: ""Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election."" Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a 'fighter': While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun – a newspaper which has been in decline for years – he's not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he's also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer's war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain's disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: ""We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,"" Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. ""I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he's going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off."" We're sure he does remind himself of that; we're sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can't keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they're just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn't understand that while you can get away with telling people 'I will deliver'; you can't get away with delivering people shit once you're in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet – the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is 'yes'; the long answer is 'ha ha ha ha ha, yes'. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced – a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don't know how long he'll last as prime minister, but we do know there'll be serious talk of him going if this year's local elections go as badly as people are predicting.",Canary,2025-01-19T11:34:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/starmer-new-policy/
It didn't take long. The British public now believe Keir Starmer should resign as prime minister.,"It's little over five months since the Labour Party won the election. Yet a majority of the UK public are now opting for Keir Starmer to resign as prime minister, according to YouGov. 40% of respondents think he should resign, while 36% think he should remain and 24% don't know. Further, Starmer has a net favourability rating of -38. But many who are sick of the two party status quo see Nigel Farage's Reform as a viable alternative, partly through years of corporate media boosting his profile. In a recent poll for YouGov on voting intention, Farage's Reform was just one point behind Labour. It had Starmer's Labour on 26%, Reform on 25% and the Conservatives trailing on 22%. The surge of Reform underscores the need for the progressive left to unite, potentially under an umbrella group to defeat the far right. In France, the New Popular Front – a broad alliance of the left, centre left, communists and Greens – received the most votes in the 2024 parliamentary election. Starmer indicated what he would prefer in the general election, where he gifted Farage his seat on a platter through essentially withdrawing the Labour candidate for Clacton. Starmer abandoned every pledge he made to become Labour leader and through that dropped many policies that are immensely popular with the people. These include public ownership of water, energy and healthcare. 2024 polling shows that 82% want water in public ownership, 71% for energy and 87% for the NHS. Yet Starmer lied about carrying out water nationalisation even as monopoly firms have paid out £72.8bn in dividends over the years, along with eye watering salaries and bonuses for corporate bosses. He lied about nationalising energy and what's particularly embarrassing is that Britons don't even own the national grid itself, which alone has paid out £28bn in dividends since privatisation. And instead of 'ending outsourcing' in the NHS as promised, Starmer is expanding private provision of NHS services by 20%, instead of properly investing in healthcare. On foreign policy, Starmer has failed to stand up to Israel with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn showing what leadership on the issue looks like. 56% want the government to ban arms sales to Israel, compared to 17% who don't. Yet Starmer has only blocked a woeful 8.5% of licenses. As well as these policies, Starmer has raised bus fares by 50%, cut the winter fuel payment for some of the least well off pensioners and announced cuts of 5% to each government department. Starmer's mantra of positive 'change' looks like anything but. Hence, the Tory/ Labour double act continues and provides ample fuel for an alternative.",Canary,2025-01-17T20:32:49+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/starmer-resignation-polling/
The March for Palestine is STILL ON - despite the Met Police's attempt to disrupt it,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators will gather in London on Saturday as they have done throughout the 15 months of Israel's genocide in Gaza. This will be the eve of the ceasefire that Palestinians and their supporters around the world have desperately sought as Israel carried out a barbaric assault on Gaza with catastrophic results. Ending the bombing is only the start. Israel's siege on Gaza must be lifted immediately to enable the flow of vital humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. The ceasefire must be permanent. The genocidal onslaught in Gaza is rooted in decades of oppression – ethnic cleansing, settler-colonisation, military occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. It has been enabled by decades of support for Israel from UK governments, corporations and institutions. For all these reasons and more, we will continue our campaigns and demonstrations such as that tomorrow in London. Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and its Coalition partners have organised 22 major demonstrations since October 2023, working with the police authorities. The marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful and well-ordered as the police themselves have accepted. However, this protest has suffered from heavy handed police obstruction using powers under the Public Order Act that erode our democratic rights. The Met Police originally agreed the route of the march, BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, in November 2024, but have this month reneged on their undertaking on the grounds that it would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel's actions – including MPs, trade unions leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 900 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of a march. Over the past week the Met Police have imposed a series of repressive conditions to prevent us marching and have even attempted to impose a route that the Board of Deputies announced they had suggested to the police. This has been firmly rejected by the Palestine Coalition – it is an affront that pro-Israel groups can attempt to decide where we can or cannot march. Despite intensive efforts to reach a compromise with the Met, it has so far refused to accept or offer a reasonable solution. However, we will assemble on Whitehall on Saturday at noon. We reiterate our call on the police to lift their repressive conditions and allow us to march. If they continue to refuse to do so and prevent us from marching, we will be rallying in Whitehall to protest. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said : Israel's genocide has not ended. Even now, while we await a ceasefire, Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are dying from bombardment, and suffering from lack of medical care, food and shelter. We demand a permanent ceasefire, an end to the siege of Gaza and the immediate provision of massive humanitarian aid. It is absolutely legitimate and necessary for us in the UK to be holding our government to account for it's military, diplomatic and economic support of Israel, which continues to be investigated by the world courts for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But this protest has been marred by political policing which is an attack on our fundamental democratic rights. The Met has seemingly accepted and acted upon the arguments of pro-Israel groups that seek to delegitimise our protest as antisemitic or a threat to Jewish people. This is a gross distortion of the truth. There is not a single instance of our marches posing any threat to synagogues or Jewish individuals. Indeed, we count a large, self-organised Jewish bloc as some of our most indefatigable supporters. The Met's approach has been confrontational, heavy-handed and intransigent. Their use of powers under the Public Order Act has been based on flimsy grounds and arbitrarily applied, which erodes the right of peaceful protest that is fundamental in a democracy. Despite this, our protest tomorrow will go ahead – we call on all those who seek justice for Palestine to stand with us.",Canary,2025-01-17T16:58:23+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/march-for-palestine-route/
The 'Hastings Three' are in court next week for protesting outside an arms supplier to Israel,"Huge crowds are expected next week at the trial of the ""Hastings Three"", who were charged nearly a year ago for their part in protesting Israel's genocide in Gaza. NHS worker Clem McCulloch, 33, artist Thomas Delves, 25, and retired train driver Laurie Holden, 72, were arrested at General Dynamics arms factory on February 29 last year during a peaceful protest organized by the Hastings & District Palestine Solidarity Campaign (HDPSC) and supported by a coalition of community groups including Jewish groups, social justice and climate justice groups, parent groups, and political parties. All three will plead not guilty to charges of aggravated trespass when they come before a district judge at Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 22 January. The charge carries a maximum tariff of a three-month jail term and £2,500 fine. They are expected to be joined by a large number of supporters as local groups across the county – including Brighton Stop the War, University of Sussex Friends of Palestine and Brighton and Hove Palestine Solidarity Campaign (BHPSC) – have called a 'solidarity rally' in support of the three men. Ahead of the trial, BHPSC's executive committee released a statement: BHPSC is a sister PSC branch to Hastings & District PSC, and have followed the case of the #Hastings3 with great interest – not least because we in Brighton know too well the indignation caused locally by having an arms factory based in our city – an arms factory (like General Dynamics in Hastings) that is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide being perpetrated by Israel upon the people of Gaza. The statement went on: The executive committee of BHPSC sends our solidarity to the three defendants whose case will be heard here in Brighton on the 22nd of January. Our many local members and supporters will be outside the court in large numbers on the 22nd to voice our support for our Hastings comrades, who are on trial for doing nothing more than exercising their right to peaceful non-violent protest. Compared with the appalling crimes against humanity being facilitated by the General Dynamics factory in Hastings and other weapons manufacturers in the UK, the actions of the #Hastings3 register as expressions of conscience rather than crimes. General Dynamics is the fifth largest global arms manufacturer and is responsible for all the MK80 bombs being dropped on Gaza. Laurie Holden, from Burwash, said: It is appalling that ordinary people like myself are in the dock instead of General Dynamics, which is making a killing from genocide. This will be the sixth time our case has come before the court, representing a disgusting waste of taxpayer's money. Meanwhile, General Dynamics made $3.3 billion profit in 2023. ""The Hastings Three are not guilty"" said Grace Lally, twinning officer for the Hastings & District PSC: General Dynamics is guilty of profiting from war crimes and genocide. Two thousand pound bombs made by General Dynamics have been dropped on families sheltering in tents in the so-called safe zone of Al Mawasi, where our friends live and our community has deep connections. Nothing can justify this. General Dynamics has come under sustained pressure from concerned locals for its part in Israel's 15-month campaign in Gaza. Hastings & District PSC has led more than a dozen actions to the two arms factory sites in Hastings since November 2023, including die-ins, marches, pickets and a 48-hour peace camp and the sites have also been subject to regular and spontaneous 'pop up' protests. Mum-of-one Olivia Cavanagh said: We don't want this weapons manufacturer here in our town, making money from slaughtering innocent Palestinians, making us complicit in war crimes. A legal fighting fund for the three men has raised nearly £5,000 but still has some way to go to cover all their legal costs. ""The outrageous and expensive pursuit of the #Hastings3 does not stand in isolation but forms part of a nationwide clamp down on peaceful protest"" said Katy Colley, HDPSC Chair: Our friends are good men of conscience who, like the rest of us, cannot bear to see the wholesale destruction and annihilation we are witnessing in Gaza. The majority in this country stand against genocide, ethnic cleansing and apartheid. For fifteen months, people up and down the country have protested the UK's complicity in the worst crime of our time, demanding that the UK stops arming Israel. Yet our government refuses to listen and those who speak out are smeared, defamed and persecuted. There are now over 46,000 confirmed dead in Gaza – mostly women and children – though a report this month in the Lancet estimated the real death toll to be at least 40% higher with the number of deaths in the first nine months alone estimated to be over 64,000. A year ago, the International Court of Justice put Israel in the dock for acts of genocide and last month, reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Medecins Sans Frontieres all concluded that Israel is guilty of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza. The rally at Brighton Magistrates Court begins at 9.30pm and donations to the legal fighting fund can be made here.",Canary,2025-01-17T15:43:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/hastings-general-dynamics-protest/
Government BURIED damning report in DWP PIP failings to try and push through reforms,"It's been revealed by a leading disability news outlet that the previous Conservative government tried to bury a damning report into the DWP PIP system and its failings. We only know this thanks to the tenacity of one journalist. However, the issue raises further questions about the approach of the now-Labour Party government. In January 2024, Conservative ministers chose to withhold a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) report that highlighted significant issues within the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) system. This decision occurred just days before the release of a green paper proposing substantial changes to it. We only know this information thanks to John Pring at Disability News Service (DNS). As Pring wrote: DNS has obtained copies of emails exchanged last year between ministers and advisers, which show how the minister for disabled people, Mims Davies (pictured above, left), was asked to approve the publication of four Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research reports in January 2024. The unreleased report contained testimonies from disabled individuals who had undergone PIP assessments and received zero points, rendering them ineligible for support. One participant, diagnosed with ME and confined to bed for all but half an hour daily, described the assessment process as dismissive, noting that attempts to elaborate on his condition were abruptly halted. Such experiences left claimants feeling ""broken,"" ""numb,"" and ""fuming."" Internal emails obtained through Pring's freedom of information request revealed that on 29 January 2024, minister for disabled people Mims Davies was asked to approve the publication of four DWP research reports. This included the critical PIP study. A response on 8 February suggested delaying its release due to ongoing policy development. It cautioned that publication could ""set hares running."" The final decision to withhold the report was made on 24 April, just five days before the green paper's publication. On 29 April 2024, work and pensions secretary Mel Stride introduced the ""Modernising Support for Independent Living"" green paper. In this, the government expressed concerns over rising PIP expenditures. It also questioned the benefit's value. The paper proposed making it more challenging to claim PIP and suggested replacing cash payments with vouchers or one-off grants, a move described by campaigners as a ""brutal, ideological attack"" on disabled people's support. The timing of these events indicates a deliberate effort by ministers to suppress evidence of the PIP system's deficiencies. It would have laid cover for advancing policies that could further restrict support for chronically ill and disabled people. The news comes as the DWP lost a court case over ex-Tory ministers' reforms to the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Concerningly, the Labour government has already indicated it may go ahead with the changes, regardless.",Canary,2025-01-17T12:13:36+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/government-buried-dwp-pip-report/
"5,000 nurses come forward to expose the dire state of the NHS. It's a ""wake up call"" to Labour.","Over 5,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), a large UK and international union, have presented evidence showing the dire state of our NHS. Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN general secretary, said the findings are a ""wake-up call"" to Labour. The report, entitled On the frontline of the UK's corridor care crisis, details testimony from nurses who observed patients dying in corridors, on trolleys and in chairs in waiting rooms. The crisis is also defined by nurses treating patients not only in corridors but in storerooms, carparks, offices and even toilets. There, patients have no access to critical equipment like oxygen or vital signs monitoring systems. There were also multiple testimonies of healthcare staff feeling that the scandal of corridor care has or can delay emergency procedures such as CPR. Further, nurses said corridor care was ""routine"" at their hospital or even happening ""permanently"". Generally, the sheer volume of NHS nurses who have significant experience with corridor care is shocking. One pointed out that one nurse and a healthcare assistant were looking after 20-30 patients in a corridor. The report notes that selected testimonies already reflect the experience of many nurses. One said: I was redeployed from my shift in critical care to the emergency department – where I had never worked before. All bays were full and I also had 4 male patients on trolleys in the corridor who had been there since the previous night awaiting a hospital bed as all were admitted. This made for a concerning and difficult time since the patients were confused, there was no name allocated to a bed area as they were in corridors – staff knew these as 'spaces' as they were regularly used. Another said: Utilising corridors on daily basis now with patients staying up to 24 hours in these locations. Also seeing patient in the back of ambulances due to lack of flow through the system. Patients constantly receive poor dignity, are frustrated, in some cases refuse treatment and self discharge against advice due to situation placing them at risk of significant adverse event that would likely not have happened had the system been functioning as intended. This is demoralising for staff who wish to provide exceptional care, in some cases has led to long term sickness through depression and burn out, and has significantly increased staff turnover as it is no longer viewed as a sustainable career option for nurses and has diluted the overall knowledge and subsequent safety of the department. I have worked in Emergency care for nearly 20 years and have never seen it as bad as it is today, frankly it is embarrassing. Labour aren't providing enough capital funding to fix the healthcare infrastructure we already have, let alone expanding buildings and technology to meet demand. So how will the corridor crisis end under their administration? Healthcare leaders have previously said hospitals are ""outright dangerous"" due to years of underfunding. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS needs an extra £6.7bn per year to maintain its estate. Labour has claimed it's providing an ""additional"" £13.6bn in capital funding, but that's actually a £3.1bn increase on the 2023-24 capital budget. The party is reportedly considering fresh private finance initiative (PFI) scams. That's instead of the government providing sufficient public funding, the private sector loans the money off the books. Through PFI, the public purse is hugely overcharged for infrastructure in a heist of billions of pounds. Former Blairite advisor and now UK ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson is one of the figures behind the push for Labour to adopt PFI. Reeves has also walked back the headline figure in Labour's budget of a £22.6bn increase in NHS day-to-day spending, through announcing a 5% cut to each governmental department. That leaves the spending increase at £7.6bn. This is far short of what's required for the Long-term Workforce Plan. Rather than investing in the NHS, Keir Starmer's Labour seems to be using the crisis as an opportunity for the private healthcare sector (which donates to Labour) to make cash from the struggling service. On 6 January, Starmer announced that the private sector will deliver an additional million appointments, scans, and operations a year. This is a 20% increase on the current private provision of five million operations, appointments and tests annually. This is not the answer – as anyone working in the NHS will tell you.",Canary,2025-01-16T19:50:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/nhs-rcn-report/
"DWP WCA consultation broke the law - yet Labour planning on making the Tories' changes, anyway","On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The DWP misrepresented the reforms as a way to give more disabled people support into work, citing figures that said 20% of people in the LCWRA group had said ""would like to work at some point in the future"". Of course, they conveniently ignore the 80% who disagreed with this and that just 4% said they would be able to start work now if the right job and support were available. The consultation received a massive pushback from disabled people, who could see it for what it was: a cost-cutting measure designed to force people back into work and score points in the next election. Clifford and Aoife O'Reilly from the Public Law Project, who was acting as her representation, argued that the consultation was unlawful on many grounds. Firstly, the consultation did not explain that many disabled claimants impacted by the reforms would receive significantly less money and in some cases, be required to meet stringent conditions or be at risk of sanctions if they did not meet them. O'Reilly also argued that the primary motive for the reforms – to reduce DWP spending – had not been disclosed. She argued that the consultation had led people to believe the aim was to help people into work, without actually providing any evidence as to how they planned to do so. Lastly, the team crucially argued that the consultation had been unlawful as it ran for just under 8 weeks, which didn't give DDPOs adequate time to respond. Government consultations typically run for six-to-twelve weeks. Over the course of the judicial review, internal DWP documents revealed several damning things. Firstly, the DWP had not actually done any sort of impact assessment on the WCA proposals, prior to the consultation being launched. This is despite the fact that civil servants had, based on internal estimates, identified that almost 100,000 people would be pushed into poverty if they went ahead. There was an equality impact assessment that was done after the launch of the consultation, but that has never been published. Civil servants were also aware that the proposals would have a particularly strong effect on people with preexisting mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. Proposals made by civil servants on what changes to consult on were instead based on the financial benefits. Internal documents reveal that ""the Prime Minister [at the time Rishi Sunak] indicated that the DWP should consult on reforms to the WCA gateway in time to score them for the Autumn Statement..."" The narrative around how easy home working was for disabled people seemingly came out of the DWP and realised that the WCA proposals would be ""perceived as purely cost-saving measures by influential disability rights groups"" this led to recommendations that ""a wider narrative based on modern and home working"" was also developed. Internal documents demonstrate that DWP boss at the time Mel Stride had considered including particular proposals as part of the consultation, because it could be ""useful"" to play into the idea that the motivation for consultation was the importance of getting more people into work and not saving money. Mr Justice Calver ruled that the consultation was ""rushed"", ""misleading"" and ""so unfair as to be unlawful"". He described the DWP a relying upon a ""false rationale"", in the consultation. It also did not inform people about the ""substantial"" financial loss claimants would face. He said that the evidence which had been presented before him: Strongly supported the conclusion that costs savings was at least one of the two bases, if not the central basis, on which decisions would be taken on which policies would be taken forward by the Government. The judge also said considered that the DWP should have made this fact clear and that ""disclosure of this highly relevant fact, was required"". Calver ruled that the consultation time was ""unlawfully short"" given not only the importance of the subject but based on the fact that the DWP was also at the time running a significant consultation on the Disability Action Plan. This was particularly unexpected as the DWP had only just published the Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper. Mr Justice Calver observed: The unfair burden upon vulnerable people of having to deal with a yet further consultation process at this time at such short notice cannot be overstated. In setting the consultation period, the Defendant ought to have had more regard to the attributes of those people who would be affected by these proposals. These were proposals which, in particular, could potentially drive vulnerable people into poverty as well as adversely affecting disabled people and substantial risk claimants who have mental health conditions and suicide ideation. Disabled activist Paula Peters, who was outside the court for the ruling, said: It's been a rollercoaster of emotions today, bittersweet sadness as we remember all disabled people we've lost to the WCA process. Relief that justice was served and that the judge overseeing this judicial review said the WCA Consultation was radically wrong and didn't take into account the impact on disabled people's lives. In her statement outside court, Ellen said she was ""overjoyed and very emotional"" about the judgement: When I heard the judgement, I was reminded of all of those who we gave lost and all of those who we don't know who have died – countless people who've died as a result to cuts and changes to their benefits and other austerity measures. But today Mr Justice Calver has recognised the unfair of a government consultation that deliberately set out to mislead and to disguise the potentially devastating impacts that these particular changes would have on disabled people. Well, despite the ruling the government wouldn't legally be required to completely get rid of the DWP plans to make the lives of those subject to the WCA hell. That's probably why the DWP has confirmed today they will be redoing the consultation. In a statement a spokesperson for the DWP told the Canary (and the rest of the media): The judge has found the previous government failed to adequately explain their proposals. As part of wider reforms that help people into work and ensure fiscal sustainability, the government will re-consult on the WCA descriptor changes, addressing the shortcomings in the previous consultation, in light of the judgment. The government intends to deliver the full level of savings in the public finance's forecasts. This is interesting. Although they're being upfront about it being ""savings"" motivated, they're still not being transparent about how the cuts would affect people. A big takeaway is also that they're still seemingly intent on changing the goalposts of what the descriptors will mean and who will qualify to be unfit for work. Just as many disabled activists worried, a Labour-led DWP is no better than a Conservative one. But disabled people are prepared to fight them on this too. Clifford said in her statement: We know the government is hellbent on attacking disabled people and essential incomes we need to survive, in order to manage the economy better than they are at the moment. As Peters said: We hope this legal victory gives disabled people across the UK hope that disabled campaigners are fighting back, prepared to take government on and bring change about"" Speaking of the fears of disabled people facing both cuts and the Assisted Suicide Bill, Clifford said: This is not how any democracy should treat its most disadvantaged members; we fight on together.",Canary,2025-01-16T16:45:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/dwp-wca-court-verdict/
A hung jury in the latest Just Stop Oil trial shows the nonsense of these prosecutions,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who sprayed Heathrow departure boards with orange paint during the Oil Kills, international uprising to end fossil fuels last July have won a temporary reprieve as their jury failed to reach a majority decision. Phoebe Plummer and Jane Touil were appearing before judge Duncan at Isleworth Crown Court accused of criminal damage over £5,000 for their action on 30 July 2024 to demand a fossil fuel treaty to end oil and gas by 2030. The trial, which lasted nine days, ended when the jury failed to reach a majority decision. The judge has scheduled a retrial for May 2026. Phoebe was remanded for 58 days and Jane for 14 days following the action in which the pair used fire extinguishers to spray water-based paint at the departure boards in the terminal. The Crown alleged that the Just Stop Oil action caused £8,000 worth of damages. Phoebe is currently serving a two year prison sentence for criminal damage for throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting in October 2022. They were sentenced by Judge Hehir at South Crown Court on 27 September 2024, a sentence that is now being challenged in an appeal scheduled for 29-30 January 2025. During the trial, Judge Duncan ruled out the defence of necessity, saying this did not extend to civil disobedience and what she called the Just Stop Oil defendants' ""honestly held opinions"" about climate change. Jane Touil responded that: It is not accurate to say that I am acting on my beliefs. It [the climate crisis] is not 'a cause'. This is physics, an objective reality. I can see that everything is at risk. We only do the right thing if we know what's going on. Phoebe was not allowed to be present in court to make their closing speech as during the course of the trial, the heating system in the holding cells at Isleworth Crown court, contracted to the private company Serco broke down and no one currently in custody could be produced in court. A Just Stop Oil supporter who was present throughout the trial said that: Phoebe and Jane had all their substantial defences removed, a severely mismanaged prosecution, logistical nightmares and a jury that was told to completely disregard their motivations. This is absolutely huge! In her closing speech Phoebe Plummer said: I have struggled with not being able to talk about the climate crisis – hearing it being called irrelevant feels inhumane and dishonest. The prosecution says I'm 'committed to breaking the law'; my only commitment is to act in line with my conscience. They say 'I do what I like without thinking about the law'. I don't think following the law and doing the right thing are always the same thing. I cannot be a bystander to suffering where I see it. Nonviolence means being honest and living in line with the truth. I need to tell the truth about what I see. I act in a way that I think will be effective in saving life. When a doctor breaks a rib while doing CPR the doctor's intent is still obviously saving life not causing grievous bodily harm, the context always matters.",Canary,2025-01-16T15:12:04+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/16/just-stop-oil-hung-jury/
London mayor refuses to act to block Heathrow expansion,"Despite running on a platform to halt any further expansion of Heathrow Airport, on Thursday 16 January during Mayor's Question Time, Sadiq Khan dismissed multiple invitations from Green Party AM Zack Polanski to work together in pursuit of that shared goal. At the core of Heathrow's expansion plans is the construction of a third runway. Initially proposed over two decades ago, the plan seeks to increase Heathrow's capacity by accommodating up to 700,000 flights annually, compared to its current cap of 480,000. This expansion would allow Heathrow to handle an estimated additional 50 million passengers per year. Of course, one of the most contentious aspects of the Heathrow expansion has been its environmental impact. Critics have long argued that adding a third runway would significantly increase carbon emissions at a time when the UK has set legally binding commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The additional flights, coupled with construction emissions, pose a substantial challenge to these climate goals and would exacerbate the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Heathrow expansion has faced numerous legal battles and political hurdles over the years. In 2020, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that the government's approval of the third runway was unlawful because it failed to account for the country's climate obligations under the Paris Agreement. However, this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court later that year, allowing the project to proceed. As of early 2025, the Labour Party government has expressed conditional support for the expansion, contingent on meeting stringent environmental standards and securing broader public backing. Proponents of the expansion argue that it is vital for the UK's economic future. Heathrow's role as a global hub supports thousands of jobs directly and indirectly, and the additional capacity could generate billions of pounds in economic benefits. Increased connectivity is seen as crucial for trade, tourism, and maintaining London's status as a leading financial center. However, opponents highlight the significant costs associated with the project, estimated to exceed £14 billion. They also point to potential disruptions for local communities, including increased noise pollution and the need to relocate homes and businesses. Local communities near Heathrow have expressed mixed reactions to the expansion plans. While some see the potential for job creation and economic revitalization, others are concerned about noise pollution, air quality, and the loss of green spaces. The proposed expansion would require the demolition of parts of several villages, including Harmondsworth, raising questions about fair compensation and community well-being. Currently, as the Financial Times reported Keir Starmer's cabinet are split over whether to approve the Heathrow expansion: Bosses at Heathrow, which handles more than 80mn passengers a year, are putting the final touches to their first expansion plan since the pandemic, but will not include a third runway at this stage, said people familiar with the matter. Downing Street and the Department for Transport said they were ""open-minded"" about a third runway, but only if it satisfied four tests: delivering growth across the country, meeting climate obligations and complying with air pollution and noise considerations. But one political aide said the cabinet was divided. ""It's no secret that there isn't universal backing for the third runway, it's just not a priority right now. [Energy secretary] Ed [Miliband] is the most obvious example of someone who is anti, but there are others who are uncomfortable about expanding Britain's biggest airport,"" the person said. So, on that Polanski pushed Khan on 16 January over the Heathrow expansion. Yet when prompted to join forces in lobbying government against any approval of the Airport National Policy Statement (ANPS), the Mayor repeatedly dismissed, and even mocked, Zack's outstretched hand: Reflecting after the exchange, Green Party London Assembly Member Zack Polanski said: Expanding Heathrow Airport would be dangerous, even deadly, for every Londoner interested in breathing clean air or swimming in the Thames anytime in the next century. The Mayor ran on a campaign promising to oppose Heathrow expansion, yet when I present him with opportunity after opportunity to take action, he refuses to engage with me. Why won't the Mayor work across party lines to stop Heathrow expansion in its tracks?",Canary,2025-01-16T14:47:12+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/heathrow-expansion/
Palestine Action's #Filton18 are in court TOMORROW - and need YOUR support,"On Friday 17 January, the Palestine Action #Filton18 political prisoners will appear at the Old Bailey, London, to enter their pleas for the first time since their arrest. They are expected to plead 'not guilty' to charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and, for some, violent disorder, after an August action against Israel's Elbit Systems research hub in Filton, Bristol. The action saw activists enter the site, operated by Israel's largest weapons company, and dismantle the weapons of war inside – including the Elbit 'quadcopter' models used for targeted killings of children in Gaza. Ten of the #Filton18 have been imprisoned since their arrest in August 2024, with a further eight arrested and imprisoned since November, all of them subjected to abuse of 'Counter Terror' powers by the British State. The Crown Prosecution Service are alleging that the charges faced have a 'terrorism connection'. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton case demonstrates ""terrorism powers being misused"" to ""circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention"". The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy. Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company, is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza – providing over 85% of Israel's armed drones, along with a wide range of munitions, armaments, and military equipment, all of which it markets internationally as having been ""battle-tested"" on Palestinians. From Britain, the subsidiary 'Elbit Systems UK' is a major exporter to Israel of military drone components, along with arms including weapons sights. The Filton weapons hub was opened in July 2023, with Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotevely in attendance praising the site for the ""very best of Israeli technology"", alongside Elbit's CEO Bezalel Machlis. If you want to show support for the #Filton18, be at the Old Bailey, City of London, EC4M 7EH on Friday 17 January at 9:30am.

Andy McDonald champions Labour's shoddy workers' rights bill at PMQs. Here's the facts.,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Andy McDonald MP said on 15 January: The employment rights bill is urgently needed especially given the exploitation of gig workers like those retail assistants employed throughout with vital rights denied and staff being charged a premium should they want to be paid on time. Insecure work denies workers their rights but the TUC also says it costs the UK economy around £10bn a year. So will the prime minister agree with me that having a single status of worker will help end such abusive practices, give workers security and significantly benefit the economy? UK high street retailers have been employing young assistants through gig acts that lack basic employment rights. Labour's employment rights bill doesn't include a single status of worker, which aims to guarantee rights across the economy. Keir Starmer responded: I believe everyone is entitled to fair, flexible and secure working. And that's why we introduced our employment rights bill, which is the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation. It includes measures that will end the scandal of fire and rehire, preventing exploitative zero hour contracts and introducing basic rights for workers from day one. The Labour Party's move to strengthen workers' rights is only significant because the benchmark is so low. That's partly because of anti-trade union legislation that the Tories introduced including in 2016. A report from academics for the Trade Union Congress (TUC) found that the UK presently lags behind other developed OECD countries when it comes to workers' rights. The bill is a step forward in a shoddy context. Professor Deakin, director of the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge University, said: The UK is an international outlier when it comes to worker protections. Our labour laws are significantly less protective of workers' rights than the average in the developed countries which make up the OECD. The gap is particularly marked with respect to laws on working time, employee representation, and the right to strike. The report shows that UK labor laws have been less protective of workers' rights than other developed countries since Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, the Tories, propped up by the Lib Dems, increased the period before workers are protected from unfair dismissal to two years of employment. Labour's bill remedies the unfair practice altogether through introducing protections from unfair dismissal from the beginning of employment. The bill also included piecemeal steps forward in the right to sick pay. Further, it will guarantee hours for those on zero hour contracts, if the employee wants them. The act will repeal the restrictive trade union ballot threshold for strike action that the Tories introduced in 2016. In October, Zarah Sultana MP said in parliament: We must go further and repeal every single anti-trade union bill since Thatcher It seems Labour won't be doing this – and so, everything else is piecemeal, as PMQs exposed.",Canary,2025-01-15T18:57:18+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/pmqs-15-january/
"Patients are dying because of profit-driven political decisions - so in 2025, EveryDoctor is stepping things up","In 2025, campaign group EveryDoctor is stepping up its work to save the NHS from privatisation, and build a functioning, flourishing healthcare system for patients and staff alike. However, there's work to do. The group wants to grow its following from thousands, to a vibrant patient and staff community of millions. It feels it will take nothing short of this to turn things around because: millions of people are currently being profoundly failed by politicians In short, the group aims to transform its campaign community into something more: a movement. Its ambitious goal comes amidst another spate of alarming news stories over the appalling state of things in the NHS. What's more, EveryDoctor founder (and Canary columnist) Julia Grace Patterson has crunched the numbers on patient deaths – and the situation is actually worse than the headlines suggest. By the close of 2024, and into the New Year already, the media has been awash with dire developments in the NHS. A 'quad-demic' storm of influenza, Covid, norovirus, and RSV has been overwhelming NHS hospitals across the country. More than a dozen hospitals have now declared ""critical incidents"" as hospitalisations mount up, and services are swamped. Meanwhile, headlines abound about intractable wait times, and lack of available beds. Patients entering NHS hospitals face a disgraceful situation – first a major problem during the Covid pandemic – but now tragically commonplace. The phrase ""corridor care"" has firmly cemented itself into the British vernacular. In December, 54,000 patients waited on trolleys longer than 12 hours for hospitals to admit them to wards. EveryDoctor's Patterson has laid out the devastating cost of all this in a Tiktok video. Specifically, she analysed the Royal College of General Medicine (RCEM)'s statistics showing the toll long wait times have been having. Horrifyingly, she highlighted that almost 300 patient deaths a week can be linked to long waits. In short, this atrocious state of affairs is putting patients' lives at risk. So, as all these crises in the NHS unfold, the Labour government has answered with yet more plans for privatising the public healthcare system. EveryDoctor wrote to its supporters on the situation that: This government released big plans for the NHS last week, and those plans involved further privatisation. This government has failed to invest properly in emergency services, and patients in A and E departments are receiving urgent treatment in corridors. Its latest foray into opening the NHS up to further backdoor privatisation comes in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the Canary's James Wright highlighted, AI companies likely had a little help from science and technology secretary Peter Kyle. Also an acting vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Kyle has repeatedly rubbed shoulders with a who's who of AI's most prolific lobbyists. Given this, Wright pointed out that Kyle likely had a hand in this latest NHS AI privatisation manoeuvre. Of course, all this is barely the tip of the iceberg of privatisation's manifold fallouts for the NHS. Therefore, turning things around in the NHS will take a momentous groundswell of action. And it's why Patterson and the EveryDoctor team have declared their intention to build a bold movement to ""fearlessly"" fight back. Since 2019, EveryDoctor has been campaigning against this unrelenting tide of private profiteering in the UK's health service. The group has put out critical research on NHS privatisation. It has met with MPs, and created far-reaching public awareness campaigns. Most recently, it ran a powerful campaign to engage MPs with a doctor-led manifesto for fixing the NHS. Alongside volunteers and the public, the group brought these ideas to 117 MPs and their teams. However, Patterson lamented how to date, none of it has yet been enough. So she spelled out that: we need to think a lot bigger now. Much, much bigger. We need millions of people to know what we're doing and to stand together with us to fight for the NHS. In just the first two weeks of 2025, EveryDoctor has already set a number of things in motion. The group has called on the Liberal Democrats to collaborate in holding the Labour government to account for the emergency situation in A&E departments. It is also organising urgent meetings with MPs about this too. And EveryDoctor has started the year off with a social media bang too. The Tiktok video Patterson posted on the RCEM statistics went viral. Off the back of this, NHS staff, film-makers, and members of the public have been flooding the group's inbox with offers of support. Of course, this is only the start. EveryDoctor has many more plans in the works for the year ahead. Patterson set out to supporters that: There is only a point to our campaigning if we do it fearlessly, relentlessly, boldly, and loudly. I can only lead EveryDoctor if I will do it fearlessly. So that's what I am going to do – that's what we are going to do. I went back to TikTok this morning and continued making videos. We're starting daily YouTube videos this week. We're hiring into our team. We're completing our research into the financial links between MPs and the private healthcare sector. And we have so much more to do... Going forward, she hopes that many more people will join EveryDoctor's community to work together in saving the NHS for the millions that depend on it. You can keep up with EveryDoctor's vital work by joining its WhatsApp community. The group is also fundraising to ramp up the reach and impact of all its upcoming plans. If you're in a position to donate, you can do so here.",Canary,2025-01-15T16:09:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/everydoctor-campaign/
SEND system in England falling apart at the seams - thanks to the Tories,"The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee's report Support for children and young people with special educational needs published on 15 January highlights significant challenges within England's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system. Notably, it outlines how funding over the past ten years has not matched demand – as the previous Conservative Party governments let the SEND system fall into a state of disrepair. As BBC News reported: In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system ""in disarray"", ""mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money"". An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England. The Department for Education (DfE) said the government was ""making progress"" on the issue with a £1bn investment in Send. Despite a 58% increase in high needs funding over the past decade, the number of children with Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plans has surged by 140%, leading to funding not keeping pace with demand. This disparity has resulted in stagnant outcomes for children, eroding parental confidence in the system. The Public Accounts Committee summed up by saying: The Department of Education will be unable to make the fundamental reforms needed without a clear, costed plan to measure progress, which it is lacking. To do this it needs a clear vision of what an inclusive education would look like, better data to target funding, and to deliver a system where all those with critical roles work together. This includes the Department for Health and Social Care, who must play their part in reducing long waits for support. With more than 40,000 children waiting over 12 weeks for speech and language therapy alone as at June 2024, timely access to health expertise constitutes a significant barrier in a struggling system. Recommendations: The Local Government Association was particularly concerned by the report. Councillor Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: The Committee is right to describe the failing SEND system as an emergency, and its report reflects councils' long-standing concerns over the need for more inclusive provision and the immense financial pressures on councils to be adequately addressed. It is vital the Government urgently sets out a comprehensive reform plan that ensures children and their families get the support they need and deserve. This must include ensuring councils on a financially stable footing, with high needs deficits written off. Otherwise, many councils will face a financial cliff-edge, and be faced with having to cut other services to balance budgets through no fault of their own, or their residents. Without urgent action, the report warns of a ""lost generation"" of children who may leave school without receiving the necessary support, emphasising the critical need for systemic reform to meet the growing demands and complexities of SEND provision in England.",Canary,2025-01-15T13:52:46+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/send-england/
Campaigners have 'discovered' ANOTHER company exporting arms to Israel,"Local campaigners have uncovered a previously-missed company that is actually now one of the biggest UK arms exporters to Israel – therefore, complicit in its genocide. Meet G&H Artemis. On Monday 13 January, campaigners across the south west stopped business at Gooch and Housego's (G&H) Artemis site in Plymouth: The action marks the start of a new campaign – Shut Down G&H – committed to shutting down a company that's deeply complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza: According to research by Campaign Against Arms Trade, G&H, with the acquisition of Phoenix Optical Technologies last year, is now the largest recipient of single issue arms export licenses to Israel between October 2021 and May 2023. G&H Artemis export a range of military equipment to Israel, including components for head up/down displays for military aircraft. G&H Artemis provide optical and laser technology for head up displays. On the ground, activists reported that many of the workers couldn't gain entry to the factory due to the disruption. A spokesperson for Shut Down G&H said ""this act of resistance was inspired by the growing awareness that G&H is directly implicated in the murder of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is unconscionable. As the local community, we are taking action to reject our city's complicity in Israel's genocide and display our unequivocal solidarity with the struggle for Palestinian life, freedom, and self-determination"": Today's action is only the start. G&H have offices across the South West. We can and we must shut them down! The Canary asked G&H Artemis for comment – but the company declined to provide us with one. Campaign Against Arms Trade's media coordinator, Emily Apple, said: It's great to see this campaign being launched today. For too long G&H has got away with slipping under the radar. It should be a household name. Everyone should know this company is complicit in and profiting from Israel's genocide. In only imposing a partial arms suspension, this government has made it clear that it will continue to prioritise arms dealers' profits over Palestinian lives and international law. It's therefore down to ordinary people across the country to take action and say no to the genocide profiteers on their doorsteps.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:57:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/gh-artemis/
Shell was given a stark reminder of its role in events like the LA wildfires,"Fossil Free London staged a protest outside Shell's global HQ, the Shell Centre, on Southbank on Wednesday 15 January, in protest over the role fossil fuel corporations like Shell's have in exacerbating the climate crisis. Dressed in red and orange, signs read ""It's not a tragedy, it's a crime"", chanting ""Shell did this"": A London firefighter joined the crowd, holding a placard saying ""Big oil makes our job harder"": Shell continues to drill for new fossil fuels, making fires like the ones we are seeing in LA much more likely. In March 2024, Shell defied climate experts and rolled back their green targets, pledging to keep oil production steady until 2030. Wildfires across Los Angeles have now killed at least 24 people, and burned down more than 12,000 homes and businesses. Scientists warn these fires are driven in intensity by heat and drought; both conditions are directly linked to and made increasingly common by the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that emissions from fossil fuels are the biggest cause of climate change. Fossil fuel corporations have been aware of climate change and its effects as early as 1977, but continued to expand oil and gas production. Joanna Warrington, who attended the protest with Fossil Free London, said: LA is on fire, and it's big oil that sparked the match and fanned the flames. Corporations like Shell have known for decades the disasters their fossil fuels would cause, but spent billions delaying climate action and funding misinformation to protect their business interests. As devastating events like these become more commonplace, its vital blame is put on the oily bosses who profit whilst our homes burn. Andy Warren, a London firefighter, said: Firefighters know that the increasingly frequent and destructive wildfires we face are the responsibility of the fossil fuel industry and its disregard for human life. These companies have known about the effects of their profiteering for decades and it is high time they were taken into public ownership and their profits used to fund a just green transition. No fire service in the world will be a match for the disasters that come if we carry on as we are.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:35:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/shell-protest-wildfires/
Keir Starmer's AI plan misses the central point of the fourth industrial revolution,"Keir Starmer's plan for artificial intelligence (AI) falls well short of the main point of the fourth industrial revolution. That is to liberate people from labouring work they don't want to do, providing more time for social, creative, and intellectual endeavours. Instead, Starmer is largely pursuing private sector for-profit ownership of AI that threatens to rob people of their work without fairly sharing the fruits that robots have created. In his speech on AI, the prime minister paid some lip service to the issue, without saying how for-profit, private ownership of AI will facilitate it: Who gets the benefits? Just those at the top – or working people everywhere? The thing is, there will be a point where capital increasingly becomes labour: where the money for resources equates to labour. That's because in the long term the economy will be mainly automated rather than consisting of people providing the labour. Without public ownership of that automation or some kind of citizens dividend, the opportunity for the utopia explored in Aaron Bastani's Fully Automated Luxury Communism will be replaced by the opposite: AI-controlling overlords and a poverty stricken public. Yet the public research and development funding for AI Starmer has issued is a drop in the ocean compared to the private investment we are seeing. The government's AI plan also mentions the environmental factor in this, given AI generation is an energy intensive process. But corporate lobbyists and fossil fuel donations have played a role in reducing the government's green energy strategy to near zero, compared to what's necessary. In Labour's first budget, the government issued just £100m to Great British Energy (GBE) for two years. That's despite its already low pledge of £8bn by 2029. GBE aims to crowd in private investment in renewables. It falls far short of what we need. And it squanders the opportunity for a publicly funded Green New Deal. Starmer's plan further proposes a national data library to power for-profit AI. That includes data from publicly funded institutions such as the British Library, the NHS, the BBC (through TV license), the Natural History Museum and the National Archives. It also includes reworking copyright law so AI can use people's work, whether academic or creative. All of this is essential for the development of AI. But why should people's work and public funding fuel AI if the outcomes are going to be privately-owned profit generation? It only makes sense for public ownership of the outcomes: AI machines that could be liberating. At present, the British people are already paying twice for education and information. Once, to create research (for example, through Research Council funding).

Just Stop Oil trio who targeted ex-Tory MP Mark Jenkinson NOT GUILTY - and rightly so,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters who fly posted the offices of a former Conservative MP to draw attention to his lies about a proposed Cumbrian coal mine have been acquitted of criminal damage by a magistrate in Carlisle. The trio took action in April 2024 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Catherine Rennie Nash, 74, Fiona Atkinson, 68, and Margaret Reid, 54 all from Kendal were part of a group of four arrested on 24 April 2024 after posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"" were plastered on the Maryport offices of the former Conservative MP for Workington, Mark Jenkinson: The three have been acquitted of criminal damage under £5,000 at Carlisle Magistrates today, after the magistrate ruled that the three could not have known that the window was covered with a specialist film that the prosecution alleged had been damaged and led to repair costs of £3,392.21. Margaret Reid has been on remand at HMP Styal for the past five months after being arrested by Great Manchester Police on August 5 2024 during the Oil Kills international uprising at airports around the world. She is charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and is due to stand trial on 3 February. Catherine Rennie Nash said: Mark Jenkinson promised his constituents a carbon neutral coal mine that would deliver hundreds of jobs for West Cumbria. However the High Court ruled that this was legally flawed and the mine will not go ahead. Mark Jenkinson also claimed that in our efforts to draw attention to this misinformation we had caused thousands of pounds' worth of damage to his office. Today we have been found not guilty and we question why the police and courts wasted so much time in pursuing this. Fiona Atkinson said: We call on Cumbria's new MPs to tell the truth about fossil fuels and support, rather than criminalize, people who are drawing attention to the climate crisis. We welcome Markus Campbell-Savours' and Josh McAllisters' efforts to bring investment in new green jobs for Cumbria but this needs to happen much more quickly. Also arrested on 24 April 2024, but subsequently released without charge was Alison Parker who said: I was shocked that I was arrested, as I only filmed what was happening. I was recognised outside the office by Mark Jenkinson, and then pursued by the police and courts for 8 months until finally my case was dropped. A solicitor is taking on my case for wrongful arrest so I can find out why so much taxpayer's money was wasted. Mark Jenkinson has been a strong advocate for the proposed new Whitehaven coal mine, which was granted planning permission by the former Conservative Government in 2021, before it was subject to legal challenges by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Climate Action last year. The High Court ruled in September 2024 that the former secretary of state for levelling up Michael Gove had acted unlawfully in granting the coal mine proposal planning permission. In doing so the High Court upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas should have been taken into account when deciding whether to approve the project.",Canary,2025-01-14T19:45:32+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/just-stop-oil-mark-jenkinson/
Beating benefit reforms starts with tackling the MSM’s eugenicist anti-fatness stigma,"We're now a quarter of the way through the 21st century. But from one look at the corporate media benefit claimant-bashing bile over the last year, you wouldn't know it. The date marches on, some of the hacks trade places with electoral washouts – and vice versa – but the vile bigotry never ceases. If anything has changed in the past 25 years of hate-rag vitriol, it's only that they've increased the ever-flowing pool of marginalised community scapegoats. Not that any oppressed group ever graduates from the right-wing press's punch down portfolio. The Canary reviewed the past five years of Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail coverage on disability benefits – and the data can attest to this. However, perhaps most notably of all, what became abundantly clear was quite how much the corporate media had refused to let some abhorrently ableist and grossly bigoted narratives lie. And amidst a torrent of this, the corporate press's particularly nasty and appalling anti-fatness stigma stood out tall. The benefits are a ""life-style choice"" purveyors, arbiters of the 'grift' and 'graft' ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" sanctimony, ""workshy"", ""idlers"", ""shirkers"" – it was all there. Across the dataset – with its 1130% rise in 2024 – the words themselves weren't particularly prolific. We found the facetious idea that it's a ""lifestyle choice"" in five articles. Grifter and grafter guff came up in four. That old (rotten) ""workshy"" chestnut cropped up across no fewer than ten pieces. Invocations of ""idleness"" and ""shirkers"", just three and one pieces over our time period and search terms respectively. That these outlets used these terms in any articles at all is appalling enough. Yet, most also didn't have to say it in as many explicit words. The implication was often plain and terrible to see in many articles regardless. Among the most infamous of infamous smears, there were two that really encapsulated an especially disgusting discourse that the corporate media refuses to put to bed. Just when you think it can't get any worse, the right-wing regurgitators raise you: its ""lazy scrounger"" rhetoric. Again, they didn't often voice it in quite so florid adjectives. Four counts of ""scrounger"" – all courtesy of the Daily Mail, naturally. Meanwhile, the Telegraph spewed out five out six of the pieces peddling ""laziness"" as synonymous with benefit claimants. Once more, there were plenty of articles where it didn't need to say these outright for readers to know that's what it was implying. Crucially, the corporate media often wrapped this up in a vastly more reprehensible narrative (hard to believe, we know). It's one that has long been rife in the right-wing press. In tandem with these disgusting terms, the mainstream media's output was also bristling in anti-fatness bigotry. That is, amidst the vicious crusade against benefit claimants, the fascistic foghorns whipped up a furore over fat people. And often, they did this in the most paternalistic, and putridly body-shaming ways. In October, Telegraph troll Allison Pearson penned one notable disgusting anti-fat diatribe. Hers specifically extolled the economic advantages of mass-prescribing weight-loss drugs. In it, she unironically advised we ""as a society"" should stop fat-shaming people. So herself and her hate-mongering employer especially then? Rich too when she packed the very same Ozempic – likely quid-pro-quo – promo-piece with every single hate-riddled insult and stereotype under the sun (or in the Sun for that matter). The oxymoronic lack of self-awareness was therefore truly off-the-charts scale staggering throughout. She literally labelled benefit claimants ""useless lumps"" and suggested they would ""flog their free drugs on the black market"". To the likes of Pearson, people not cranking out capital are burdens to society, or criminal fraudsters – a rhetoric that has reared its head repeatedly in recent months. And why not divvy out a dose of anti-fat discrimination while she was at it – ""lumps"" – a deliberate double entendre that should not go unnoticed. We won't reel off a list of her numerous other incorrigible insults and give them any oxygen. Safe to say that she made every attempt to punch down on fat folks, poor people, really any marginalised demographic she could swing her arm at. And the grand crescendo of it all leads exactly where you might expect. Make people fit for work – then ramp up punitive benefit conditionality. Every other sentence seems an ode to framing fatness as something to revile – about yourself, and in others. Similarly, a supposedly 'satirical' soapbox from Telegraph columnist Michael Deacon in December had an equally vile message. Deacon pitched ""high-altitude fat camps"" to fix the UK's so-called 'obesity crisis'. Of course, his bigoted banter fits right in with the worst kinds of weight loss porn we see plastered across every nook and cranny of the media. From late-stage capitalist entertainment media's fetishization of fat-shaming to the clickbait press' capitalisation of it. The point is that it's within this context that Deacon was emboldened to say this – and vice-versa legitimise it in a vicious mutually-sustaining circle. And significantly, what these articles have in common is the way in which they pitch fatness as some form of personal failing. Ostensibly, they're suggesting that people are undeserving of health-related benefits by reason of their fatness. So there's the implication too that people claiming disability benefits for conditions linked to their weight, shouldn't be. If the corporate media can foist the blame for people's poor health on individuals, then they can preserve the capitalist status quo. Simply put, it shifts the onus away from tackling the structural factors of our inequitable classist, ableist, racist, and misogynistic society. One particularly revolting headline from the Daily Mail said it all: Listen love, I can't be applying for jobs day in and day out. You've got to have some 'me time': The brazen words of Jimmy, 40, to SABRINA MILLER in this shocking dispatch from the 'disability benefits capital of the UK' where 75 per cent are overweight Needless to say, it's the 'lazy scrounger' narrative all over. However, the blatantly bigoted tirades from corporate media's resident click-hate merchants wasn't the only way these outlets farmed outrage and stirred up contempt either. They also churned out a steady stream of analysis articles pointing out the so-called ""sickness benefits bill"". Crucially, these made the connection with 'obesity' as a driver of increasing rates of ill health and unemployment. Some directly honed in on this, while others merely mused on it in passing. But all were part of building a despicable discourse over fatness. Let's talk cause and effect here. What do you get when you have a band of right-wing media anti-fat bigots bashing the costs of ""obesity-linked benefits""? A government in bed with Big Pharma readying to pimp claimants out for profits. Specifically, this would be the DWP doing a deal with the pharmaceutical corporate devil Eli Lilly for a weight loss drug trial. Essentially, it's the department testing whether so-called weight-loss jabs could get unemployed claimants back into work. Slow-clap for Labour then. The dust barely settles before Starmer's government seems to jump jovially aboard another astonishingly atrocious back-to-work bandwagon. In fact, the Times piece was quite literally crooning over a report from healthcare analytics consultancy LCP reifying the welfare savings these drugs could foment. What the Times didn't mention? That Novo Nordisk A/S has previously paid an author of the report – Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard – for studies into the healthcare costs of 'obesity-related' conditions. That would of course be the same Novo Nordisk that manufactures two of the major weight loss drugs in question – Wegovy and Ozempic. Additionally, Pearson-Stuttard also took fees from Pfizer outside the study. The company produces weight loss drugs too. Go figure. So perhaps it's no surprise Pearson-Stuttard was plugging the ""cashable savings for the welfare system"" of Novo Nordisk's drugs to the Times. Honourable mention too to former DWP coalition government Liberal Democrat minister-turned-lobbyist Steve Webb for jumping on the Wegovy-train as another author on the report. The so-called ""worklessness crisis"" narrative and weight loss jabs have been banging around together at least since Sunak launched Wegovy NHS trials in June 2023. Then health secretary Steve Barclay boasted the boon they could be for the economy by getting people back to work. Predictably, this – at least in part – revolved around building: evidence that the drugs can reduce the benefits bill And since then, the right-wing press and politicians have been increasingly trading on this anti-fat benefit claimant propaganda. Yet, that has hardly been the end of it. Because, if that all weren't insulting enough, in December, the Telegraph reported that: Obese people are to be given gastric band surgery on the NHS in a drive to reduce worklessness. So, we have both pharmaceutically suppressing appetites and surgically shrinking people's stomachs. That's the new Labour government's grand plan for getting claimants back to work? There's a stupefying scale of anti-fat bigotry on display in all this. And as the Canary's Steve Topple has noted, it all comes down to the matter of coercion. He tempered that it doesn't mean that ""Labour is that dystopian – yet"" that it's going to condition benefits on their take-up. After all, it's early trial days for now on both counts. At minimum though, the rancid rhetoric the press is spouting could pave the way for the DWP withdrawing disability benefits from people with conditions it links to obesity. And that's a form of coercion too. Namely that by rendering people without support, it could leave them with little choice but to turn to these drastic – and sometimes dangerous – health interventions. Not that there's actually any guarantee that either will actually improve people's health, or help them find work with a livable wage. There aren't even enough jobs going for the number of job seekers, let alone sick and disabled people that the government seems hell-bent on shunting into work. Plus, vacancy numbers say nothing of whether the work is appropriate, accessible, and accommodating of people's health conditions. Not to mention the companies too numerous to count who's bosses are parasitic pricks profiting off the backs of low-waged workforces. Every article we found bandied about the concept of 'obesity'. This pertains to the medical measurement of body mass index (BMI). That might seem innocuous enough at first glance. However, it's premised on a medical model that disparages fat bodies as automatic indicators of unhealthiness. Essentially, it promotes fatness as something that needs to be fixed. Of course, this atrociously ableist thinking tracks, given its roots in eugenics. It was 19th century Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet who invented the model that later formed the basis of BMI. Notably though, he did so on a study he conducted with only white French and Scottish men. In other words, by its very origins it centred whiteness and patriarchy. Moreover, he pursued this to identify the ""ideal"" weight and size for an ""average man"" – by which he quite clearly meant white Western European males. A telling passage in his book laid bare the ableism at the heart of it: Everything differing from his proportion or condition would constitute deformity or disease. Fatness above his metrics constituted a deviation from his ""ideal"" and inherently signalled sickness. Invariably, it fed into the dominant ideology of the day to devalue chronically ill and disabled lives. Because from there, a who's who of 19th and 20th century eugenicists took up the concept. Predictably, vulture capitalists of the 20th century also sniffed out the profits potential of this junk science-turned medical model. Life and health insurance companies adopted it as a predictor of health conditions. So let me be clear: the implicit assumption that there's anything wrong with fatness in the first place is utter bullshit. The medical mainstreaming of BMI is about one thing, and one thing only. That is, the capitalist urge for policing poor, racialised, and disabled bodies. In short, insurance companies hijacked BMI to deny claims. Now, the media-political corporate establishment is making mutterings over removing disability benefits linked to 'obesity'. These things aren't unrelated. In a nutshell, it's the very same eugenicist medical science that threads through both repressive weaponisations of anti-fat stigma and bias. However, the history of the terminology the corporate media has been using is just the start of all that's wrong with the coverage. Another is that the term 'obesity' has a linguistic origin that's hardly less problematic. The Latin etymology 'obesus' translates as ""having eaten oneself fat"". Additionally then, there's in-built oppression and othering from a term that literally blames people for their body weight. And this is also largely the underlying intimation of the articles too. Outlets largely made the suggestion – though not always explicitly – that fatness equates to laziness. In other words, fat bodies are that way because of people's personal choices in relation to diet and exercise. Obviously, there's so much wrong with this too. Topple has also previously underscored how this hugely misses the point that, in multiple ways, it isn't a choice. He highlighted a number of examples: Moreover, inequitable access to healthy food is also not only down to poverty, but also due food deserts too. Specifically, where you live can determine the cost and availability of food as well. Then there's dietary requirements that can limit the types of food people can eat safely, or that their body needs. These include things like allergies, autoimmune conditions, diabetes, conditions causing digestive dysfunction like gastroparesis, or eating difficulties like dysphagia. Many neurodivergent people also have personal 'safe foods'. Moreover, plenty of these and other health conditions therefore affect people's weight gain or loss. So ultimately, it's massively ableist to make out a person's body weight is down to their own personal dietary failings. And talking of time poverty for overworked and exhausted households – we'll say it again: disability benefits are also not out-of-work benefits. Many people claiming them actually work, so this extends to them as well. Some people – like those with ME – also can't and shouldn't exercise, or risk a permanent worsening of their health. The point is, framing exercise and diet as a choice vastly oversimplifies something with multiply-marginalising factors at play. Of course, the right-wing press knows all this, but has put out this constant drip of discriminatory drivel regardless. At the end of the day, hawking hate pays. Bedding down with Big Pharma pays. Celebrating body diversity, tackling structural health inequalities, and buttressing society with a functioning, fair welfare system? Not so much – and the political establishment media lapdogs know this too.",Canary,2025-01-14T18:44:57+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/anti-fatness-media-headlines/
Leicester and Birmingham students keep resisting university complicity in Gaza genocide,"Students remain on the frontline of resistance against institutional complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza. In Leicester, five students are set to go on hunger strike following their university's harsh repression of anti-genocide protests. In Birmingham, meanwhile, students and others are calling for their university to protect the right to protest amid controversial disciplinary proceedings. According to a press release from Leicester Action for Palestine, five University of Leicester students will start a hunger strike on Wednesday 15 January ""over the university's complicity in genocide"". The statement says: This act of protest follows severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower, and is inspired by the thousands of Palestinian political prisoners who have hunger struck in the past, as well as our comrades at the Swansea encampment who went on strike for over a week, securing £5 million of divestment from Barclays bank in the process. They want the university to ""stop banking with Barclays bank"", ""disclose and divest"" from companies complicit in the Gaza genocide, and to ""demilitarise"" the campus by cutting ""ties with arms companies currently aiding and profiting off of the genocide"". Regarding the latter, the statement explains that: this includes the 7 and a half million pound research deal with Rolls Royce and Siemens through the school of engineering. Rolls Royce help to produce the F-35's Israel is using to drop bombs on children and Siemens provided key infrastructure to illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Updates on the hunger strike will appear on @leicsaction4pal on Instagram. Student-staff coalition BhamLiberatedZone, meanwhile, released a press release explaining how the University of Birmingham is: under fire for disciplining two students involved in protests against the university's financial ties to companies allegedly complicit in human rights violations in Palestine. The ""coalition of students, staff, alumni, and public supporters"" wants the university to drop disciplinary investigations and ""to protect students' rights to protest"". The coalition calls Antonia Listrat and Mariyah Ali's treatment ""a deeply prejudiced, management-driven disciplinary process"". It asserts: The university has accused them of intimidation and participating in unauthorized protests, but activists argue these allegations are exaggerated, rooted in anti-Palestinian racism, and part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on campus. Their protest demanded the university's: divestment from over £76 million in investments and partnerships with companies allegedly tied to the genocide of Palestinian people. But as the statement says: The students have highlighted a pattern of alleged Islamophobia and racial prejudice, including the labelling of Palestinian flags as ""threatening"" and the removal of such flags from campus, as well as harassment of students wearing Palestine badges. They argue such actions demonstrate systemic repression of pro-Palestinian activism under the guise of maintaining campus safety. The ""prolonged process"", meanwhile, ""has caused significant stress and harm to the students' wellbeing, reflecting a punitive approach to silencing dissent"". Campaigners want the university: to drop the disciplinary actions, respect free speech, and address growing calls for divestment and ethical investment practices.",Canary,2025-01-14T16:34:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/leicester-birmingham-students/
Cops try to disrupt a Palestine Action meeting - just as the group target Elbit director's business,"Palestine Action targeted the new London premises of an Elbit Director's consultancy firm, Eagle Strategic Consulting Limited, on Tuesday 14 January. However, at the same time in Bristol cops were 'visiting' the venue where a group meeting is being held in Bristol. Coincidence? Palestine Action activists shattered the windows and sprayed the company's new London address in red paint to symbolise the company's continued complicity in Palestinian bloodshed: Eagle Strategic acts as a consultancy firm for weapons manufacturers and is wholly owned by Richard Applegate, the former Chairman and current 'head of strategy and new business' for Israeli weapons firm Elbit Systems UK. This is the second time his lobbying company have been targeted by the direct action network, with Palestine Action shattering windows and spray painting the building of the Dorset premises in March 2024. Applegate has a long history of lobbying for the Israeli arms company, previously boasting about pulling off a covert political lobbying campaign which secured a £500m from the MOD, by ensuring his ""fingerprints weren't over any of it"". He was caught by journalists admitting that he had applied pressure by ""infecting"" the system at ""every level"". According to Israeli media, Elbit provides up to 80% of the Israeli military's land based military equipment and 85% of its military drones. It supplies vast numbers of munitions and missiles – including the 'Iron Sting' recently developed and deployed for the first time in the 2023-2024 Genocide in Gaza, along with wide categories of surveillance technologies, targeting systems, and innumerate other armaments. Meanwhile, as Palestine Action posted, cops visited the People's Republic of Stokes Croft; a venue that is hosting a meeting of the group: Called ""Smashing the genocide-industrial complex"", the meeting will look at what activists can learn ""about effective direct action from the courageous efforts of Palestine Action?"". No wonder the cops weren't happy. The venue and the group refused to be intimidated, however, and the meeting is due to go ahead as planned. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We remain committed to targeting all firms and associations which enable Israel's weapons trade to continue fuelling genocide. There is no space for war criminals on our streets and those responsible for mass murder must be held accountable. Applegate can't hide behind his consulting firm and changing its premise doesn't change a thing. We've hit Eagle Strategic before, we'll hit them again and we'll keep taking action until we've shut down Elbit Systems for good.",Canary,2025-01-14T15:34:58+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/palestine-action-eagle-strategic/
The Renters' Rights Bill is a victory says ACORN - but there's still a huge flaw,"As it enters its final stage in the House of Commons, community union ACORN has heralded the Renters' Rights Bill ""a huge victory for the organised renter's movement"". However, the proposed legislation is still not without its pitfalls. The Renters' Rights Bill is on the way to delivering improved security and standards for renters, including: A new addition, debated at the 'report stage' in parliament on Tuesday 14 January, would see an end to landlords being able to charge rent in advance of a tenancy starting. This is a key issue that ACORN has been campaigning on, and is welcome news for the many renters struggling to secure a place to call home. Low income people, young families and those on benefits are more likely to be asked for several months, or even longer, of rent up front, something that is simply not possible for many. More widely however, the Bill fails to seriously address the issue of unaffordable housing. This is why ACORN has been working alongside partners in the Renters Reform Coalition and MPs to support amendments in this area. One of these amendments, expected to be debated this afternoon, proposes a cap on in tenancy rent rises, to prevent landlords from hiking rents and evicting tenants through the back door. But if we are truly to tackle the burning issue of unaffordable homes, the government needs to introduce controls to stop spiralling rental costs. That's why ACORN is supporting amendments such as the one put forward by Carla Denyer MP, calling for a national 'living rent' commission to set rent levels between tenancies, taking into account factors such as the home's condition, size and local incomes. Martin Mawdsley, a renter in Liverpool and ACORN representative said: The changes promised in the Renters' Rights Bill can't come soon enough for the millions of renters living in poor conditions, extortionately priced homes and with the threat of eviction through no fault of their own hanging over their heads. We're pleased to see the hard work of our members over the last decade paying off, and we're glad that the Government has listened to us and will ban bidding wars and landlords being able to change many months worth of rent up front, two areas that ACORN has been campaigning on across the country. But as most renters are spending way more than 30% of their income on rent, and prices just keep rising, we still need more action to make rented homes more affordable. That's why we're calling for in-tenancy rent rises to be capped and rent controls to be brought in.",Canary,2025-01-14T13:48:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/renters-rights-bill-acorn/
"For the first time since records began, fewer poor students are going to university","For the first time since records began, there has been a decline in the number of the poorest students who end up going to university. Young people from free school meals (FSM) backgrounds fell further behind their peers in England in progressing to higher education from 2021/2022 to 2022/23, with the gap in terms of numbers progressing increasing to over 210,000. The areas with less than one in five FSM learners go onto higher education are drawn mainly from rural and coastal communities. The Access to Higher Education and Regional Inequality: who is missing out? report looks in-depth at progression to higher education for young people from FSM backgrounds across regions and local areas in England from 2005/06 to 2022/23. Key findings in the report include: The report argues that the government needs to build on the success of national collaborative university outreach initiatives that support those from low-income backgrounds, which were first launched 21 years ago with the Aimhigher programme. A new programme should be launched where universities combine their resources working with those 16 and under alongside local targets for FSM learners progressing to higher education. The report is produced by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON), which is the national organisation for supporting access to higher education for those from under-represented groups in the United Kingdom based at the University of West London. As Professor Graeme Atherton, Director of NEON and author of the report states: This year's data shows a worrying slowdown in progress in terms of widening access to higher education and shows again clearly the huge differences in future opportunities that young people from low-income backgrounds face across the country. As the government looks to break down regional inequalities post levelling up, higher education progression has to be a central concern.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:44:15+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/university-admissions-poorest-students/
"AI seeks to profit from NHS data, with a little help from a 'Labour Friend of Israel'","Artificial intelligence (AI) profit-makers look set to get their hands on NHS data. And lobbying Labour Friends of Israel vice chair Peter Kyle probably played a role. Backdoor privatisation of the NHS is nothing new. Thatcherism paved the way, 2010s austerity made things worse, and then the Covid-19 pandemic helped to push things further. Now, with the economy predictably struggling under Keir Starmer's Tory continuity government, his neoliberal crack team have suggested that handing NHS and other data to AI companies could help to turn things around. In reality, however, it looks very much like corporate money and influence have triumphed again. Media outlets are currently asking questions like ""Has Rachel Reeves crashed the economy?"" and ""Why has Labour Failed So Badly on the Economy?"" The answer, says economist Richard Murphy, is that Reeves has made a conscious ideological choice to avoid the steps necessary to improve the economy. He is also doubtful that artificial intelligence is able to make a big difference without a fundamental shift in the government's positions. Nonetheless, the Times reported on 12 January that: the health service is set to make its archives of scans, biodata and anonymised patients records available for the first time to train the latest AI models. Ministers think their plans will ""attract billions of pounds of investment from American tech firms"". And the awful Peter Kyle, now secretary of state for Science, Innovation and Technology, compared AI development to ""the nuclear race"" of the 1940s and 50s. A lovely, hopeful image to place into our minds. Importantly, however, WeOwnIt founder Cat Hobbs asked: When did the British public give our permission or mandate to use OUR health data to make a profit for private companies? As the Guardian wrote, meanwhile, Starmer ""put concerns over privacy, disinformation and discrimination to one side"" when announcing the AI push. ""I don't think that we should have a defensive stance here"", he said. He would say that though, as a corporate crony who happily welcomed a dodgy donation of ""£4m from [a] tax haven-based hedge fund with shares in oil and arms"", which also ""stood to profit"" from Israel's genocide in Gaza. The fund had invested, for example, in billionaire Israel and Trump fanboy Peter Thiel's spy tech company Palantir. You know, the pro-Israel company with ""deep ties to British and American security agencies"", access to our NHS data, and experience helping to smear progressives, back right-wing causes, and mistreat vulnerable people. Kate Brimsted from law firm Shoosmiths warned about ""the substantial data privacy, confidentiality and security challenges that accompany this initiative"". The Guardian has already reported on serious flaws with previous government uses of AI. But officials claim they'll ""take into account national security and ethical concerns"", just like they've 'taken into account' concerns about the genocide in Gaza while still participating in and legitimising it. AI companies' mission to profit from NHS and other data, however, needs government insiders. And while massive corporate donations from dodgy hedge funds helps, constant lobbying is key. And Peter Kyle is no stranger to lobbyists' hospitality. In 2024, openDemocracy reported on how: Hakluyt is a globally operating corporate strategy firm that advises some of the largest companies in the world across all sectors. It spun out of MI6 and despite attempts to shake off its reputation for remaining relatively 'close' to the intelligence services in the years since, it is still widely regarded as a retirement home for spies. It added that Hakluyt: forked out several thousand pounds to ferry... Kyle around San Francisco earlier this year. We know that Kyle sat down with senior figures at all the big silicon valley firms while he was there: Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, Open AI et al. On top of that, the firm ""arranged a secretive dinner for Kyle to meet with more influential people"". openDemocracy also called Kyle's role ""one of the most lobbyable briefs in government"". And in the run-up to the 2024 election (in which he lost thousands of votes partly over his support for Israel amid its genocide), he ""benefited from external support in his office... with the consultancy Public Digital providing a member of staff four days per week to support on policy"" and him benefiting ""one day per week from the expertise of a member of staff from Faculty AI"". The latter firm: co-authored a substantial policy report titled 'Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State'. The report was published with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change... The lobbying apparently worked. Because Kyle and his colleagues are now opening the door for AI profit-making in the NHS and beyond. Starmer's Labour is a disgrace.

Met Police under pressure as outcry increases over Palestine BBC protest ban,"Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and Coalition partners are today issuing a statement that reaffirms their determination to lead a protest at BBC headquarters in central London despite the efforts of the Met Police to prevent a March for Palestine which it previously agreed to in November 2024. Over the weekend a flurry of public figures have criticised the decision by the Met to use conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the protest at the BBC on Portland Place, on the grounds that this would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months of the Gaza genocide. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel's actions – including MPs, trade union leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 800 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of the march. PSC are calling on all those who support an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel's genocide in Gaza, as well as everyone who believes in the democratic right to protest, to join them in London at 12 noon on Saturday 18 January for the March for Palestine. The March for Palestine will assemble in Whitehall, which will allow people to form up in massive numbers in an orderly fashion, and then they will march towards the BBC. Organisers have written today to the Met Police seeking a meeting and asking them to work with them to ensure the march can proceed peacefully and finish with a protest outside the BBC. The groups call upon the Met to drop any restrictions which would prevent this. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said: Hundreds of thousands of people wish to continue to protest at our Government's ongoing complicity with Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people, which reports this week suggested may have killed tens of thousands more than the suggested figure of 46,000. They also wish to protest at the complicity of the BBC which has failed to report the facts of this genocide, as revealed in recent investigations. There are no legitimate grounds for the Police to impede our proposal to march from Whitehall to the BBC, finishing with a rally outside its HQ. We call upon the Met Police to make clear they will drop any conditions which will deny the right to protest as planned.",Canary,2025-01-13T21:04:11+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-march-18-january-bbc/
One in six UK workers skipping meals as cost of living crisis deepens under Labour,"A survey from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has found that more than one in six UK adults working full time or part time have had to skip meals to make ends meet. The figures come as workers have undergone the largest squeeze in real term pay since Napoleonic times. Real wage growth fell from between 2007-2019 by 0.2%. And it has only improved slightly since, with workers still worse off than they were from before the financial crash and the cost of living crisis continuing. The Labour Party's first budget failed to address the crisis through measures such as public ownership of essentials (including renewable energy), price controls on essentials and significant rebalancing wealth taxes. Switzerland has kept inflation much lower through its energy security and price controls. The country's electricity production is 60% from hydropower and 29% from nuclear. On top of that, the Swiss government has issued price controls on 30% of goods and services in the country. This shields its citizens from profiteering price hikes (greedflation) and international gas markets (fossilflation). In the budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves did increase capital gains tax. But she also boasted that we have still have the lowest rate of the G7. Proponents of an increased rate argue that people living off investments shouldn't pay less tax than those working. Equalising capital gains with income tax rates would rebalance the economy by a further £12.7bn on top of the £2.5bn from Labour's increase in the budget. The budget's improvements were piecemeal: Reeves also increased the minimum wage from £11.44 to £12.21 (a 6.7% rise) from April 2025. Workers have undergone the biggest hit to living standards since the 1950s. Food prices generally rose by 19% from March 2022 until March 2023. But some key foods such as pasta and vegetable oil are up by at least 60%. Indeed, in 2023, 61% of the poorest fifth of households reported cutting back on food. And the findings from the TUC umbrella group chime with this. While 17% of worker respondents (more than one in six) said they had skipped meals in the past three months, 8% said they skipped meals most days to make ends meet. Further, 24% said they made large or significant cut backs in food spending over the past year. And 31% of working adults said they never or only occasionally put the heating on. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak had positive things to say about Labour's Employee Rights Bill, currently at committee stage in parliament. The bill would ban zero hours contracts, among other measures. Nowak also said: After 14 years of Tory chaos and stagnation, we urgently need to boost living standards and to get more money into people's pockets. This is vital for workers and for local economies too",Canary,2025-01-13T20:30:31+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/cost-of-living-skipping-meals/
The Scottish government has 'abjectly failed' over ordinary people's access to justice,"Environmental charities including the RSPB and the Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS) have called out the Scottish government's 'abject failure' to meet the access to justice requirements of the UN Aarhus Convention. In 2021, the Convention's compliance committee gave Scotland six recommendations to remove barriers that are preventing people from taking environmental cases to court. The UK's final progress report confirms none of the recommendations have been met and it remains 'prohibitively expensive' to access justice. Scotland, as part of the UK, is a signatory to the Aarhus Convention, a UN treaty that guarantees people's rights to access information, participate in decision-making and access justice in environmental matters. Following the most recent ruling of non-compliance by the Convention's governing bodies in 2021, the Scottish government was required to make access to justice affordable, reform time limits for judicial review and reform planning permissions by the deadline of 1 October 2024. Yet the UK's Final Progress Report to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC) confirmed that Scotland has made only minor modifications to legal expenses and no concrete commitments for future reform. Comments on the UK report, submitted jointly by the RSPB, ERCS and Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, have been scathing in their assessment of government action to date, with signatories remarking that they are 'deeply concerned and frustrated that, as a whole, the UK has failed to make any tangible progress'. For the past two years, Scottish legal experts have been raising concerns about the Scottish government's lack of progress in removing barriers to environmental justice. Campaigners held a rally outside the Court of Session to mark the 1 October deadline, with speakers urging the Scottish government to ensure citizens can hold public bodies and polluters to account for environmental harm. Access to justice remains unaffordable for two main reasons. First, it is incredibly difficult to access legal aid for environmental cases. Second, the 'loser pays' rule means that litigants are liable to pay their opponents fees if they lose their case which can cost tens of thousands of pounds. The ACCC has clearly stated that this causes a 'chilling effect' – deterring individuals and organisations taking legal action, even if they have a strong case to do so. Shivali Fifield, Chief Officer at ERCS, said: Upholding our environmental rights in court is the ultimate guarantee of the rule of law. Without this credible threat, polluters can act with impunity. Scotland, as part of the UK, has been a signatory to the Aarhus Convention for nearly two decades, but despite repeated warnings from legal experts and campaigners, it has a record of abject failure when it comes to delivering the reforms needed to guarantee access to justice for environmental cases. After years of broken promises, it would be easy to think that the government is threatened by adhering to international law and making access to justice affordable. If they truly believe in community empowerment and a just transition to net zero, they must make our legal system work for people and planet. Aedán Smith, Head of Policy & Advocacy at RSPB Scotland, said: Scotland is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world and we are continuing to lose nature, with 1 in 9 species at risk of national extinction. Yet, despite welcome progress to improve some legal protections for nature over recent years, it remains extremely difficult for individuals and community groups to challenge poor decisions. The Scottish Government must urgently address this to ensure the laws it has introduced can be implemented effectively and as intended.",Canary,2025-01-13T17:07:17+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/scotland-access-to-justice/
Palestine Action has a new company in its sights over Israel's genocide in Gaza,"Palestine Action Scotland targeted the offices of military parts manufacturer Parker Hannifin at its Glasgow production facility overnight on Monday 13 January, damaging the building and covering it in red paint, which it said was 'symbolic of the Palestinian blood on the hands of the company'. The building on Seaford Road South, which Parker Hannifin describes as a 'state-of-the-art production facility' for its Parker Prädifa technology division, had multiple windows smashed during the nighttime action. Its walls and signage, as well as the interior of the building, were sprayed with red paint: A Palestine Action Scotland spokesperson said the activists who carried out the direct action did so because Parker Hannifin is a supplier to Leonardo and other major weapons companies that make military products used by Israel's forces in its attacks on Gaza. Leonardo has extensive ties to the Israeli state and makes parts for Apache helicopters and targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, which have been used by Israel to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza, destroying homes and civilian infrastructure, and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Leonardo's site in Edinburgh has been targeted and shut down by activists multiple times since Israel's ongoing destruction of Gaza intensified in October 2023. Parker Hannifin itself has been involved in the design, development, testing and production of the F-35. Its fuel systems and components are used for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It provides systems for military helicopters and drones to companies including Leonardo Helicopters. Its products are designed to meet specialist military-ready specifications for use in missiles, ordnance and aircraft, as well as use in flight control systems, jet engines and landing gear. The action was the first time that activists in Scotland have targeted Parker Hannifin for its links to the destruction of Gaza, which is described as genocide in a case brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa and 11 other countries. An investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Palestine Action Scotland's spokesperson said: We are sickened that the continuing genocide is made possible by companies based in Scotland that are happy to profit by designing, making and selling products that result in the mass murder of Palestinian people in Gaza. Every company that chooses to be part of the supply chain to Israel's military, including Parker Hannifin, shares responsibility for and profits from the shredding of children's bodies in Gaza, and we will not rest until they cut all their connections to that chain of brutality. By carrying out this action, we intervened directly to disrupt the flow of technology that enables the ongoing genocide. Parker Hannifin has blood on its hands and will remain a target until it cuts its ties to complicit companies including Leonardo and stops supplying essential parts and materials without which apartheid Israel's weapons could not cause the horrors being committed every day against the Palestinian people. In taking this action, we have been inspired by and acted in solidarity with our friends and comrades in Gaza and throughout all of Palestine, from river to sea. We look forward to celebrating the liberation of Palestine with you in the near future.",Canary,2025-01-13T15:46:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-action-parker-hannifin/
13 Holocaust survivors and descendants slam Met Police over Palestine demo ban at BBC,"Thirteen Holocaust survivors and survivor descendants have just signed a joint letter protesting against the Met Police's plans to prevent the next Palestine march from gathering outside the BBC headquarters on 18 January. As survivors of the Jewish genocide, or descendants of such survivors, the 13 say they are in despair at the UK government's complicity in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. This is especially the case when this same government intends to commemorate other genocides – including that of the group's Jewish relatives – on Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. How any politician can commemorate past genocides while openly supporting an ongoing genocide is something future historians will study with horror and disbelief. But this just makes it all the more important for those of us who oppose all genocides to continue to protest. Naturally, the government and other supporters of Israeli crimes want to discredit and suppress our protests. Having run out of other arguments, they can only resort to claims that people's demonstrations are somehow antisemitic. As survivors and survivor descendants, the 13 individuals say they take antisemitism extremely seriously. Consequently, they would always make sure of their facts before accusing anyone of antisemitism. Unfortunately, many supporters of Israel are rarely so careful and they routinely accuse anyone they disagree with of antisemitism without any evidence. Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos spoke at a Palestine rally in Hyde Park in April: Note the respect with which the crowd listens to Stephen. This is not the sort of crowd that would ever chant the horrible phrase 'genocide of Jews' – yet this is the sort of completely unsubstantiated claim that the right-wing press are resorting too in order to have Palestine demos banned. The 13 also took part in a previous Palestine demo near the BBC headquarters on 18 May: The BBC also broadcast interviews with them there on that day and their journalists will have witnessed the overwhelmingly warm reception from the crowd. The letter from the 13 reads in full as follows: The Metropolitan police intend to ban the 18 January Palestine march from the area around the BBC headquarters in Portland Place in London. Their excuse is that Jewish attendees at a synagogue that is well away from the march route will suffer 'disruption' of their religious worship. We are writing as Jewish Holocaust survivors, and descendants of survivors, to protest against this clear attempt to dissuade people from opposing the Gaza genocide. Along with thousands of other openly Jewish protesters, we have attended numerous Palestine demos in London and have received nothing but support and warmth from our fellow demonstrators. To suggest that the 18 January march is a threat to Jews, or is in any way antisemitic, is simply a fabrication in order to restrict everyone's right to protest.

Just Stop Oil take bold action - because Darwin would be turning in his grave,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted Charles Darwin's grave to demand that the UK government works with others to phase out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. At around 9:30am on Monday 13 January, two Just Stop Oil supporters entered Westminster Abbey and proceeded to use spray chalk to write '1.5 Is Dead' on Charles Darwin's grave: This was referencing the news that the world has exceeded the 'safe' 1.5 degree warming limit agreed by world leaders in Paris in 2015. The supporters could be heard saying ""2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. Millions are being displaced, California is on fire and we have lost three quarters of all wildlife since the 1970's. Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The government's plans will take us to over 3 degrees of warming. This will destroy everything we love. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030"": One of those taking action was Alyson Lee who said: Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we have already exceeded the so-called safe temperature rise of 1.5 degrees, and are heading for over 3 degrees of warming. This rapidly accelerating crisis means huge parts of the world will become unable to support life, resulting in millions of refugees, social collapse and extinction for countless species."" Despite lots of fine words from international leaders, emissions are still rising. Without real action, words are useless, you cannot negotiate with the laws of physics. We need mass civil disobedience now, join us on the streets and help us reclaim parliament this April. Also taking action was Di Bligh who stated: Darwin once said- 'It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works cooperatively against common threats. Last year was the hottest since modern humans evolved. If we do not work together to reign in the corporations and billionaires driving us beyond our means, humanity will not be able to adapt to what is coming. We are on course to lose everything, and politicians are doing nowhere near enough to prevent it. How many will we have to bury as a result of climate breakdown and who will be left to mourn them? Just Stop Oil's action came as the death toll rises to 24 in California, as fires continue to rip across the state. The fires have been driven by climate breakdown after decades of drought, followed by rapid swings between extreme wet and dry conditions in the past two years. This has created large areas of 'tinder dry' vegetation, creating the perfect conditions for uncontrollable wildfires. Meanwhile, the Copernicus Climate Change Service has confirmed that 2024 was the first year on record with a global average temperature exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. All continents except Australasia and Antarctica experienced their hottest year on record, with 11 months of the year exceeding the 1.5°C level. All ten of the hottest years on record have fallen within the last decade. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again this April.

REVEALED: MSM disproportionately targets mental health-related DWP claimants in attack articles,"Disabled people living with mental health conditions came on the receiving end of an exponential surge in corporate media attacks against benefit claimants in 2024. Across the year, the right-wing press cranked up its concerted campaign to vilify chronically ill and disabled claimants more than eleven-fold. But significantly, over half of this coverage featured references to mental health as a leading factor in the recent post-pandemic-height rise in claims. Of course, the substantial uptick in attention on claimants with mental health conditions could have devastating ramifications in the real world. The Canary's analysis comes amidst ""senior government"" sources tipping off the Telegraph that Labour Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ministers plan to proceed with some iteration of the former Conservative government's brutal Personal Independence Payment (PIP) reforms. Already then, this media-manufactured outrage is serving as a convenient pretext for the Labour government to unleash an ideological swathe of new austerity assaults to the welfare system. It's all a crucial reminder of how the right-wing manoeuvres to single out disabled demographics as undeserving of social security support. The Canary unveiled that in 2024, the corporate media enormously ramped up its scapegoating of disability benefit claimants. Specifically, coverage of disability benefits in the Telegraph, the Times, and the Daily Mail together sky-rocketed more than 1130% from 2023's output. But notably, the Canary's research also found that the three outlets had certain marginalised demographics in their sights in particular. The outlets honed in on mental health within the context of disability benefits and unemployment specifically in at least 23 articles (7.7%). In total, the three outlets put out 147 articles either focusing on mental health and disability benefits, or mentioning the two. Notably, the Canary only included articles that did so in a way that made a connection between the two, or at minimum implied it. It meant that nearly half the articles in the Canary's data drew attention to mental health in the context of disability benefit claims and unemployment. They published the majority of these – 135 – in 2024 alone. What's more, they weren't the only marginalised group the mainstream hate-merchants put in the firing line for benefit clampdowns either. Neurodivergent stigma featured heavily across the corporate outlets' output too – again showing a marked increase in 2024. Articles attributed the rise in disability benefit claims to the increase in claims from autistic people, and people with ADHD. There were 19 pieces (6.4%) that specifically focused on these in the three outlets' coverage. All but one of these they wrote in 2024. Neurodivergence and the connection to disability benefits cropped up across 39 articles within our analysis time-frame all told (13.1%). The Telegraph published just two of these in 2023, while neither the Times nor the Daily Mail linked these in articles before 2024. The results offer more proof – if we needed it – that the right-wing press and government have a blatant joined-up agenda to strip disabled people of their benefits wherever they can whip up politically-motivated moral panic. Where mental health was concerned, a clear narrative emerged. Specifically, the outlets visibly capitalised on the Covid pandemic's psychological fallout. In particular, they visibly did so to prey on claimants with mental health conditions. Articles frequently posited pandemic lockdowns and school closures as a key factor in the surge of mental health problems among young people. Naturally, the right-wing press has been quick to condemn Covid protection measures that helped to shield more clinically vulnerable populations at the height of the pandemic. A Times article in January 2024 proclaimed that: The effect of lockdown and school closures on the mental health of young people has also meant more need help with everyday life, officials believe By contrast, as for the trauma of living through a global deadly and disabling pandemic, it was tumbleweed from the trio. So between them, outlets simultaneously blamed protections that were vital for keeping chronically ill and disabled people safe, while at the same time managing to punch down on people psychologically disabled by the pandemic. Of course, leave it to the right-wing foghorns to deal a double-blow of ableism in one. However, more than this, it's patently clear that the aim was to invalidate new cases of mental health diagnoses. The Canary's data uncovered a chicken-and-egg style dance between the corporate media and halls of power. We identified how conversations on mental health and disability benefits first appeared noticeably in January 2023. Then, in September 2023, then DWP boss Mel Stride announced proposals for a dangerous tightening of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Notably, this included honing in on mental health claimants. Significantly, the Tories' response to the consultation stated how the government would: specify the circumstances, and physical and mental health conditions, for which LCWRA [limited capability for work-related activity] Substantial Risk should apply. In other words, the DWP will decide who this descriptor will apply to going forward. Or, in short, it will obviously move the goalposts to exclude many people living with mental health conditions. Up to that point in September, we had found at least seven articles that disparaged the rise in mental health-related claims. Of course, we can't say for certain that these shaped the government's thinking. However, it seems no coincidence that right-wing talking heads had been harping on about it not long before it took root in the establishment echo-chambers of Westminster. Arguably, timing is everything where the corporate press treads. So, it was also no mistake that it started stepping up its vitriol against claimants with mental health conditions in 2024 either. In other words, the Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail planted the seed in the public consciousness. Policy-makers took up this convenient narrative and scapegoat. And on the merry-go-round of client media revolving door politics continued. It's easy to see how the corporate media fear-mongering then paved the way for politicians making a political football out of disabled people with mental health conditions. In fact, the Canary's data helped plot a notable timeline of this very development as well. Between January and the end of March 2024, the three posted a flurry of articles that directly honed in on this connection: Cue, a disgusting diatribe from Stride. On 20 March, he opined to the Telegraph on all things stereotyping and stigmatising mental health. He made classic bogus contention of work as a health outcome, claiming that: we seem to have forgotten that work is good for mental health If that weren't bad enough, Stride took to the dismissive and downright despicable diminishing of people's mental health. He derided it as the ""normal ups and downs of human life"" and a case of people ""feeling rather down and bluesy"". The corporate media had been banging on about all this so vehemently, that it gave Stride the perfect ready-made justification for his atrocious claims. And that of course was the entire point. It should therefore come as little surprise that the Tory government followed this up with a raft of ludicrous welfare reform proposals too. Less surprising still: that people with mental health conditions were a particular target. In April 2024, the Tories launched their toxic proposals for changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP). As with the WCA changes, this would also legislate to shut people with mental health conditions out from the disability benefits system. Naturally though, it wasn't the end of it when Labour took to the helm either. Unsurprisingly, Labour's DWP chief hate-hawker Liz Kendall has certainly been living up to her arch-right-wing ideology. While she made a big song and dance that she wasn't jumping on her predecessor's ""bluesy"" bandwagon – she basically did anyway. In November, she suggested that ""self-diagnosed"" mental health had contributed to the rise in people unable to work. So, that would be: people unable to access underfunded mental health diagnosis services then? What's more, it was all wrapped up in a grandstanding over sanction threats, naturally. However, more than her disgraceful diatribes, she has gone pedal to the metal on policy-making as well. For instance, job coaches in more mental health settings is one example of Labour amping up this hostile offensive. Moreover, lo and behold, Labour appears to now be mulling some of these PIP reforms too. And if it seems a little too on the nose that anonymous ""senior government"" sources were spilling the tea to the Telegraph, it really shouldn't. This is what the client media do best. The DWP is scratching the Telegraph's back with an insider tip off. Conversely, the dutiful mouthpiece is doing the government's dirty work, in preemptively announcing it. A shameless PR-type move to lessen the reputational blow this Spring? It seems highly plausible. The dataset also reinforced the fact that it has been a similar story for neurodivergent claimants. The first piece the Canary found goading the link was a Telegraph article in August 2023 titled: Number of children on disability benefit jumps after surge in ADHD and autism cases Of course, many of the articles revolved around this bogus notion the right-wing scapegoat-mongers have been spouting. Specifically, this is that healthcare professionals are over-diagnosing people with ADHD and autism. Naturally, the implication in the coverage seems to be that autistic people, and people with ADHD shouldn't be claiming disability benefits either. Broadly, the articles are also suggesting that many have been wrongly diagnosed, and ergo again, should not be eligible to claim disability-based social support. The Canary's Rachel Charlton-Dailey has been documenting this. In August, she debunked one of these shameful tirades. And notably, the article was emblematic of the broader discourse at play across the Canary's dataset. For one, it had all the hallmarks of the most classic ableist tropes around neurodivergence. Overdiagnosis made its cameo appearance, as did a sweep of antiquated terms which Charlton-Dailey incisively pointed out the outlet had used to ""delegitimise the conditions"". Significantly though, it was the Telegraph's deployment of misleading statistics to underpin its nonsense claims that was most characteristic of the articles in our dataset. In its case, it made a number of deliberate categorical conflations to misrepresent the figures. Charlton-Dailey explained that: Despite linking the two and putting the main total of 730,000 kids with DLA – much, much further down, the article itself explains that less than half of claims (337,000) were for ""neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and Asperger's syndrome"". They then pulled out that 72,500 kids claimed benefits for ""hyperkinetic syndrome – also known as ADHD"", despite making it sound like a separate figure this will have actually gone in with the 337k. Separately, Fullfact also eviscerated the statistical claims of the piece. The article (still) claims that: The number of parents claiming disability benefits for children with conditions such as ADHD and autism has surged by 200,000 since lockdown, new figures reveal. However, this simply isn't true. As Fullfact detailed, that increase instead: refers to the total increase in DLA claims for under-18s, rather than only those related to ADHD and autism. Naturally, there were other problematic parts of the article too. But the bottom line was that it was using inaccurate, manipulated figures to make neurodivergent claimants a target of public acrimony. In reality, neurodivergent claimants actually made up a small fraction of the overall increases. Not that it should matter anyway. Regardless, it hasn't stopped outlet's spewing a slew of headlines all making the same bogus over-egged connection. Other shitty takes on neurodivergent disability claims? What the Times outlandishly branded ""a new industry"" of ""disability influencers"". It tracks that the ableist bigot soapbox would frame a community of disabled people helping other disabled people with the notoriously inaccessible disability benefits process, in this egregiously derogatory way. The bullshit insinuation is of course that neurodivergent people are gaming the system – go figure. And like with the media fanfare over mental health claims, politicians haven't passed up the opportunity to pounce on all this either. Amidst his vile comments on mental health in April, Stride also questioned whether people with ADHD and learning disabled people should be entitled to disability benefits. Predictably, the right-wing outlets have continued with all this in 2025. Less than two weeks in, and establishment shill the Telegraph was platforming former New Labour prime minister Tony Blair's odious warnings to the government on mental health. He revived the ghost of DWP Tory past, parroting Stride's facetious ""ups and downs"" of life drivel. In tandem, Kendall's self-diagnosis claims made a cameo appearance. Once again, it perfectly illustrated how indistinguishable Labour's welfare rhetoric is from the Tories. Ultimately, disabled people know all too well where corporate media scapegoating leads. This latest maligning of mental health and neurodivergence is invariably a warning signal for the next round of callous cuts and reforms. Of course, they won't be the only demographics in line for this. The Canary has documented how it's part of a broader-scale attack on disabled claimants en masse. We don't know the details of what Labour has in store yet this Spring. However, all chatter from the government so far points in the direction of some form of the dangerous WCA and PIP reforms. What is clear is that if it takes its cue from the corporate media's crackdown circus, it will spell more misery and harm for neurodivergent folks and disabled people with mental health conditions alike.",Canary,2025-01-13T12:07:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/msm-mental-health-dwp/
Gaie Delap spent her 78th birthday in prison - and people came out to show solidarity,"A vigil to mark unjustly imprisoned Just Stop Oil activist Gaie Delap's 78th birthday was held outside Eastwood Park Prison on Friday 10th January. It came after she was sent back to prison – despite having served her sentence – because of failures of the criminal justice system. The vigil for Gaie a peaceful and dignified Quaker-led occasion accompanied by family and friends: https://x.com/JustStop_Oil/status/1878396377899655427 It is now three weeks since Gaie was arrested and returned to prison following systemic failings in the management of her home detention curfew. These include evidence of deceit on the part of Serco EMS who manage tagging arrangements on behalf of the Ministry of Justice (see our New Year's statement). Gaie's brother, Mick, who visited her last Friday said: Despite her outrage, tempered with resignation, she tries to stay strong. She knows about the vigil. She is overwhelmed with the messages of support she has received. The best birthday present for her would be that common sense and justice prevail and lead to her re-release. Lily Pridie, her daughter, had this message for her mother: Please stay strong and keep your spirits up. We are so proud of you. Thousands of people are supporting you. Let's hope that something positive comes out as a result of this awful situation. One of the organisers of the vigil Jo Flanagan said: The vigil will be supported by dozens of singers from the Climate Choir Movement which started in Bristol. Several of the organisers of this movement are Quakers and know Gaie personally and attend the same Quaker Meeting House in Bristol including the two co- founders. Many of the principles on which the choir it is founded align with Quaker values including peacefully singing 'truth to power' and standing up against injustice. Close friend Mike Campbell added: Gaie makes it clear too that this is not just about her situation. There are other countless women who are impacted by tagging failures. She told us about a woman released late and then recalled because there was no available bus to get home in time for their curfew. She also witnesses daily the impact of imprisonment on other women, those with mental health problems, addiction issues, mothers separated from their children. Like Gaie, these are women who should not be in prison. Another birthday present for Gaie arrived early. This was in the form of a song called Eastwood Park Blues, written and performed by the Blue House Buoys, with a call to Shabana Mahmood, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Timpson, Prisons Minister to 'free Gaie Delap'. ""Dearest Gaie, we shower you with love"", said a spokesperson for group. Carla Denyer, Green MP for Bristol Central, said ""My heart goes out to Gaie who is spending her 78th birthday behind bars – all because the private company responsible for fitting electronic tags couldn't find one the right size for her. I know her friends and family are desperate to see her come home. Gaie has not broken bail conditions, neither is she a threat to the public. I find it beyond belief that a solution cannot be found to get Gaie home"": As Gaie's MP I have tried everything I can to challenge the decision to send her back to prison – including writing to the prisons minister Lord Timpson and the probation service – and I will continue to push for her release. Hannah Greer, of the Good Law Project who are crowdfunding for Gaie's legal fees, said: You should not be in prison on your birthday. On behalf of the hundreds of supporters whose generosity has so far raised over £20,000 you have our continued support and we send birthday greetings. Melanie Jameson from Quakers in Criminal Justice who are upholding Gaie on her birthday said ""With prisons overflowing, this is no place for peaceful climate protesters. In Gaie's case, we are appalled that Serco's failings have led to her recall"". You can support Just Stop Oil here.",Canary,2025-01-12T12:21:46+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/12/gaie-delap-case/
"McDonnell brands Treasury response to bond markets turbulence ""economically inept""","Former Labour Party shadow chancellor John McDonnell has denounced the Treasury for reportedly planning to use bond markets turbulence as an excuse to cut welfare: The issue is that the bond market itself attaches debt to the financing of public services in a form of corporate welfare. The gilt set up constrains government and functions as a tool for private finance to extract money from the public. This week, Reform MP Rupert Lowe tabled a bill to ban quantitative easing. He said: Our moral decline is clearly evident as true capitalism has been undermined by regular intervention, increasing state regulation and a growing, bloated and inefficient state Regulation often means the standards that uphold quality in society. And the idea the state is necessarily inefficient makes no sense, given public ownership of essential services brings down prices for people and businesses. It also helps control inflation through keeping pricing low on the essentials society needs, like water, energy (say, through a Green New Deal) and the internet. And it's inflation that is a key driver of the increase in price of government bonds. It's a merry-go-round of con artistry. Essentials are a risk free investment for the state to run (and can do in a way that's accountable to the people). That's because we aren't going to wake up one day and say we don't need water anymore or we're going to stop using electricity and live in caves. Lowe further described quantitative easing as a ""national ponzi scheme"". But what we have at present is that money is created when private banks issue loans to people. This is a system where we rent our money from private banks, rather than the state issuing it without interest. Money could be cost price, rather than effective usury. As the Bank of England explains on its website: Most of the money in the economy is created, not by printing presses at the central bank, but by banks when they provide loans... Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Positive Money, meanwhile, estimates that 97% of the money in the economy is created in this way. So, McDonnell was right to call out just how the Labour government is responding to the bond markets. Whether it listens or not remains to be seen.",Canary,2025-01-12T11:11:36+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/12/bond-markets/
150 MPs and public figures slam the Met over pro-Palestine BBC march restriction,"Cross-party MPs and peers, trade union general secretaries, cultural figures and celebrities, writers, journalists, health workers and civil society organisations and activists have condemned police attempts to stop an agreed Protest for Palestine taking place at the BBC on Saturday 18 January. In a statement issued today (10 January) by the six organisations behind the national Palestine marches, and supported by at least 150 high profile individuals and organisations, including Liberty, Amnesty International UK, and Greenpeace, the Metropolitan Police are accused of misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. Among those to have signed the statement are musician Brian Eno, singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, actors Mark Rylance, Khalid Abdalla, Nadia Sawalha and Juliet Stevenson, author Susan Abulhawa, economist Yanis Varoufakis, Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty and Asad Rehman, executive director, War on Want, along with several leading health workers, including London Hospital A&E doctor Dr Andrew Myerson. Labour, Independent, Green, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein and SNP MPs have signed, while trade union leaders include PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, the NEU's Daniel Kebede and FBU leader Matt Wrack. The route of the march was agreed by the Met in November. They have now reneged on that agreement, citing possible disruption to a synagogue, which is not on the route of the march. Making the point about the preciousness of the rights to freedom of speech and protest the statement concludes: It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned. We strongly condemn police attempts to stop an agreed march for Palestine from protesting at the BBC on 18 January. The route for the march was confirmed with the Police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police is reneging on the agreement and has stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. The police should not be misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that the march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue which is not even on the march route. As the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that pro-Palestine marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that Jewish people have been joining the marches in their thousands. The rights to protest and free speech are precious. It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned.

Headteachers warn of Labour's austerity 2.0 as schools face 'death by a thousand cuts',"Headteachers have intervened after a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that funding for primary and secondary schools is facing a 0.8% cut under the Labour Party government. And that's before you account for the 5% cut to each government department that chancellor Rachel Reeves quietly announced before Christmas, branded as ""efficiency savings"". The 0.8% reduction is because of a promised increase in teachers' salaries. But providing more income for undervalued teachers shouldn't come at the price of cutting resources for schools, as well as increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. Overall, the education budget already faced a 9% cut from 2010-2020. This was drastic for school sixth forms that underwent cuts of 26%. The lack of funding forced 47 school sixth forms to close from 2016-2019. Funding for colleges, meanwhile, will still be 11% lower than in 2010. Julie McCulloch, director of policy as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: This report reveals the reality that is facing many schools and colleges – yet another round of cutbacks. It will inevitably mean further reductions to pastoral support, curriculum options and classroom resources. It is also likely that in many cases class sizes will increase. Schools and colleges have been expected to absorb relentless financial pressures over the past 15 years, and they have done an incredible job in minimising the impact on students. But we cannot go on like this. It is death by a thousand cuts. The government must recognise the importance of improved investment in education. When it comes to a share of GDP, education spending has also fallen from around 5.6% of national income in 2010 to about 4.1% in 2023-24. The National Education Union (NEU) is also not happy with Labour's proposed pay increase. The government already issued a 5.5% pay increase for teachers for the 2024-25 academic year. But, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. NEU general secretary Daniel Kebede said: The current proposal of 2.8 per cent is not sufficient to even start to address the crisis in recruitment and retention. The suggestion that an unfunded pay award can be paid for by making 'efficiencies' is an insult to a profession who have already endured 14 years of austerity. Thousands of teachers voted for the change that Labour promised for education. They promised to invest in education, to recruit 6,500 teachers and to value education and to secure the life chances of our children. The austerity has gotten so bad that headteachers are taking on additional roles. Amanda Richards, the headteacher of Sytchampton primary in Worcestershire, said in April 2024 that her school ""literally can't afford"" a permanent caretaker. Richards told the Guardian: I'm 53 this year; I'm not built for lifting and shifting, to be honest with you. But there isn't anyone else to do it. Just before half-term, the toilets in our new building were blocked. So when that happens during the day, it's me who puts the marigolds on and goes down to the toilets with the plunger and tries to unblock it as best as I can. That's a fairly regular occurrence. With regard to things like DIY or maintenance for the building, we don't have anyone to do that. So we either do it ourselves, or we save up bigger jobs for someone to come in and do, because we just couldn't afford somebody to be on hand regularly as a member of staff. A survey has further found that one in six schools in England can no longer afford to employ a caretaker.",Canary,2025-01-09T19:44:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/schools-funding/
How Brexit and Immigration Changes Are Creating a Skills Gap in the UK,"The UK faces increasing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals, exacerbated by shifts in, and far-right rhetoric around, immigration policy and the impact of Brexit. These factors have shaped the dynamics of inbound migration, contributing to growing concerns about skills shortages across industries. Understanding the role of immigration policies, the effect of Brexit, and the resulting skills gap is essential for addressing this issue. The UK's departure from the EU has significantly altered migration patterns, particularly for skilled workers from the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Under the new immigration framework, European nationals are subject to the same visa requirements as non-European nationals, which has reduced the ease of movement for workers who previously filled vital roles in the UK. Before Brexit, the healthcare sector heavily relied on EU nationals, who made up a large proportion of its workforce. According to the NHS, recruitment from the EU has slowed dramatically since the end of free movement, compounding pre-existing staffing shortages. The Skilled Worker Visa has partially mitigated this by enabling those in recognised healthcare roles to apply for a Health and Care Worker visa, which enables those eligible to pay reduced visa fees and benefit from reduced minimum salary thresholds. Nonetheless, administrative hurdles such as the need to secure sponsorship, combined with the UK's departure from the EU, have deterred many professionals from applying. The construction and engineering industries have also been impacted. EU workers were a key source of labour, particularly for roles requiring mid-level skills that often do not meet the minimum salary thresholds required under the current Immigration Rules. Many UK organisations also relied on short-term labour from the EU, with specialist workers travelling to the UK to undertake short work assignments. UK employers are now struggling to fill vacancies, which in turn is delaying projects and increasing recruitment costs. Sectors such as hospitality and agriculture, which rely on seasonal and lower-wage workers, have been particularly affected. Despite the introduction of short-term visas for some agricultural roles, businesses have reported difficulties accessing sufficient labour to meet demand.. The current immigration system recognises that high-skilled workers can be sponsored, but it imposes strict requirements that limit access to the international workforce. The general salary threshold of £38,700 and skill level requirements exclude many mid-level roles. Employers also face high costs, including visa application fees, the Immigration Skills Charge, and the Immigration Health Surcharge, which collectively increase the financial burden of hiring international workers. The end of free movement has reduced the pool of available workers from the EU, particularly in industries where EU nationals previously accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce. For example, the hospitality and construction sectors have seen a notable decline in applications from EU citizens, leading to unfilled vacancies. Brexit-related uncertainty has made the UK less attractive to international professionals, with many professionals wanting to secure EU citizenship – along with the benefits this brings – as opposed to British citizenship. The Government's clear focus on reducing immigration also makes the UK less attractive to those considering emigrating to another country for work. Skills shortages hinder productivity, delay projects, and increase operational costs for businesses. The construction and engineering sectors, which are essential for infrastructure development, face growing difficulties meeting demand. Similarly, reduced staffing in healthcare and hospitality has affected service delivery and customer satisfaction. Employers report greater difficulty in filling vacancies, particularly for mid-level and seasonal roles. This has increased reliance on domestic workers, where available, and has driven up costs for recruitment and training. Businesses are also exploring automation and outsourcing as potential solutions, but these options are not always viable. The UK's ability to position itself as a global leader in technology, research, and innovation is at risk. Skilled professionals are critical for advancing key industries, and difficulties in attracting international talent could stifle growth in emerging fields such as renewable energy and artificial intelligence. Streamlining visa processes and reducing associated costs could help attract skilled workers from abroad. Expanding the Immigration Salary List (previously known as the Shortage Occupation List) to include more roles and lowering salary thresholds for specific industries could also ease immediate pressures. Targeted visa schemes for mid-level roles, such as those in hospitality and agriculture, could address gaps in these sectors. Investing in domestic talent is essential for long-term resilience. Enhanced apprenticeships, vocational training, and partnerships between industries and educational institutions can equip UK workers with the skills needed to fill critical roles. Since winning the General Election, Labour has confirmed its plan to upskill the domestic workforce in order to reduce immigration, and Sir Keir Starmer has recently confirmed that those who sponsor skilled workers will be expected to train people from the local labour market. To address the decline in EU migration, the UK could introduce specific incentives for EU nationals, such as reduced visa fees or streamlined pathways to residency. Recognising professional qualifications from EU countries could also simplify the process of hiring EU-based talent. Earlier this year, the UK Government was involved in discussions enabling the free movement of young people aged between 18 and 30 between the UK and EU (also known as the Youth Mobility Scheme), but thus far, the Government has rejected the possibility of extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to include EU nationals. Creating a more appealing environment for skilled professionals by enhancing working conditions and offering flexible arrangements could reduce the desire to leave the UK. In this regard, the Government has published the Employment Rights Bill, aimed at upgrading the rights of workers to improve work conditions. Policies aimed at improving quality of life, such as affordable housing and access to public services, may also help retain talent. Brexit has undeniably reshaped the UK's workforce, creating new challenges for industries reliant on skilled professionals. While government initiatives such as the Skilled Worker visa and Global Business Mobility visa routes offer partial solutions, more comprehensive measures are required to address the root causes of skills shortages. A balanced approach that combines targeted immigration reforms, domestic workforce investment, and quality-of-life improvements will be necessary to ensure the UK remains competitive in attracting and retaining talent. Collaboration between government, businesses, and educational institutions will be key to developing sustainable strategies for mitigating the impact of these changes.

ANOTHER Just Stop Oil supporter is preposterously sentenced by a judge,"A Just Stop Oil supporter who climbed an M25 gantry after an unprecedented 40c heatwave in the UK was found guilty by a jury in Chichester on Thursday 9 January. Abigail Percy Ratcliff took action in July 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Abigail, 25, a student from London, was among five supporters who blocked the M25 in three places by climbing on the overhead signs after Just Stop Oil declared the M25 a site of civil resistance on 20 July 2022. The action was prompted by news that UK temperatures had recently topped 40c for the first time ever, causing multiple fires to break out and resulting in the busiest day for the London Fire Brigade since the WWII. Before taking action in 2022 Abigail said: The UK crossed the 40 degree threshold yesterday, runways melted, wildfires raged and hundreds died. This is not the new normal, it will keep getting worse until we just stop oil. We must act now. I joined Just Stop Oil because I was worried about my future, about my sister's future, but I think a lot of us have realised this week that we're not talking about the future, we're talking about now, it's happening today. Abigail was found guilty of public nuisance, and given an eight month suspended sentence plus £1,500 in costs. She was previously remanded to prison in November 2022 for three and a half months. Her sentence comes just days after Just Stop Oil supporter Dr Patrick Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. The judge sentenced him to a year in prison. Speaking prior to the trial Abigail said: This protest I'm on trial for was back in 2022, during a heatwave that broke temperature records and killed thousands of people in the UK. And the government at the time was planning to approve 100 new licenses for oil exploration in the North Sea, in light of the evidence of the harm it would cause. The most vulnerable among us were killed that summer and the UK government went ahead and approved those licenses anyway, flagrantly denying the evidence that the climate disaster was already a threat to this nation. It was under those circumstances that I took action. Democracy has failed to protect us. Both the labour and Tory parties are neglecting to take serious action on the climate. We have now passed 1.5 degrees warming over pre-industrial levels. There is absolutely no time for talking about whether it's okay to block a road. It's not okay to sell future generations' futures off for a profit, and that's exactly what these fossil fuel companies are doing. It's exactly what our government is allowing them to do. Peaceful protesters are filling our prisons while the real criminals sit in power handing down a death sentence to future generations. We mustn't go without a fight. Another of those taking action on 20 July 2022 was Louise Lancaster. She was prosecuted in October 2022 for contempt of court for breaking the M25 protest injunction, but received a suspended sentence. Three others who took action on the same day were also given suspended sentences after being found guilty of public nuisance in May 2024. However, that was before 'Lord' Walney called for Just Stop Oil to be treated like a terrorist organisation and the courts started dishing out multi-year prison sentences for nonviolent action. These disproportionate sentences are being challenged at the court of appeal at the end of this month. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

"Labour 'no better' than the Tories on dodgy political donations, polling finds","Capping political donations could help to reset the government's reputation, campaigners claim, as a poll shows two-thirds of the public regard the ethical standards of the Labour Party government as worse or no different than those of its predecessor. The survey, commissioned by pressure group Unlock Democracy, found that by more than four to one, the public favours limiting the amount of money individuals can donate to political parties or politicians, with support for such a move consistent across voters for all major parties. The most recent quarterly data from the Electoral Commission reveals Labour accepted over £2 million in donations of £15,000 or more between July and September of 2024, including £171,000 from the former boss of Autoglass, Gary Lubner. Tom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy, said: The public is fed up with the corrosive influence of big money in politics.3 Labour will find it hard to convince voters it is serious about governing in service of working people while it continues to accept large donations from wealthy individuals and corporations. There is an opportunity here for the government to show clearly that it is different from its predecessor. At the moment, if the public perceives a difference, it's not in a good way. Two-thirds of survey respondents – including more than four in 10 Labour voters – said this government is worse (34%) or no better (31%) than the last government when it comes to behaving ethically, compared to only a quarter (25%) who think it's behaving better. Just as troublingly for a government elected on a promise to restore ""the highest standards of integrity and honesty"" to public life, one in two Labour voters see no improvement with this government in delivering on its promises. Overall, nearly half of all respondents felt Labour was worse in this regard (46%), compared to only one in five (19%) who thought it was doing better. Brake continued: Labour must address these perceptions head-on. More people think the scandals and dysfunction in politics are the fault of the broader system than believe it is only individuals to blame. Half-measures, such as the government's tweaks to rules around second jobs and enhanced ministerial code, won't cut it. Bold reform is what's needed. The government must deliver on its commitments by championing reforms that ensure those with the deepest pockets cannot wield outsized, unaccountable influence. The government has this week reaffirmed its manifesto commitment to strengthening donation rules. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee that the government was considering changes to ensure ""transparency in the process of where donations come from"". This follows MHCLG spokesperson, Lord Khan of Burnley, stating in the House of Lords last December: The government has committed to reforming political finance rules. We are considering changes that will help protect our system from foreign interference, such as tighter controls on donations. A cap on political donations forms part of a suite of measures aimed at protecting UK democracy from big money and foreign interference set out in Unlock Democracy's Democratic Integrity White Paper, a summary of which is available here.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:49:18+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/labour-political-donations/
"DWP complaints up 38%, with Universal Credit causing chaos for countless families","The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has seen a 38% increase in just three years in the number of claimants making official complaints against it. Moreover, the head of the independent body responsible for dealing with claimant complaints has slammed the DWP for "" simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should"". It comes amid a startling 83% increase in the number of complaints accepted by the independent body, too. Perhaps the best summing up of the situation is to be found in one DWP complaint, where it told a dying claimant that they owed it £89,000 – when they didn't actually owe anything at all. The Independent Case Examiner's (ICE) 2023-2024 annual report offers insight into the complaint-handling process within the DWP. It outlines recurring patterns of administrative errors, delays, and the inadequate treatment of vulnerable claimants. All this suggests that DWP has not fully embraced the principles of accountability and effective service delivery. The ICE office serves as a mediator between the public and the DWP, tasked with investigating complaints of maladministration. For the reporting year, the ICE office experienced a 38% increase in complaints compared to the past three years, highlighting a growing dissatisfaction among claimants. Among the complaints accepted for examination, nearly 50% were fully or partially upheld, a figure indicative of consistent service failures. The report asserts a commitment to fostering improvements within the DWP. However, the patterns observed – such as poor communication, lack of prompt action, and insufficient redress – raise questions about DWP's ability to enact meaningful change based on ICE recommendations. The ICE report documents various categories of complaints, such as Universal Credit, disability benefits, debt management, and child maintenance, among others. Universal Credit remained the most complained-about benefit, reflecting its complexity and the impact of policy decisions such as mandatory recovery of overpayments caused by administrative errors. It also had one of the highest rates of complaints being upheld. However, Universal Credit was also subject to one of the most shocking complaints about the DWP. In May 2021, Customers A and B made a joint Universal Credit claim but received no payments as their income exceeded the entitlement threshold. B declared a serious health condition and later claimed New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). In early 2022, A reported that the couple would soon receive capital exceeding £16,000, which temporarily affected their Universal Credit claim, requiring a DWP decision on whether the claim should close or the capital disregarded. The DWP took three months to decide, initially miscalculating capital and incorrectly applying nearly £89,000 from the start of the claim. Although the error was corrected the same day, delays led to a £300 Universal Credit overpayment, which was referred for recovery without notifying A. The claim was eventually closed mid-2022, and Debt Management later contacted A and B to recover the overpayment. A challenged the overpayment, citing distress due to B's terminal condition. DWP's subsequent errors included sending a letter erroneously claiming a debt of £89,000. After further review, DWP acknowledged the mistake and revised the debt to nil. However, their errors caused significant distress during B's final days. The DWP offered just £200 in compensation – despite A saying that the DWP's actions had hastened B's death. Universal Credit's framework's rigidity and lack of proportionality in overpayment recovery indicate structural deficiencies. Vulnerable claimants, unaware of overpayments, are disproportionately penalized, undermining the principles of fairness and trust. The transition from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and related issues in communication exacerbated hardships for claimants. For example, a parent contested DWP's abrupt change in the appointee for their child's DLA without notification. Despite prolonged distress and inconvenience, DWP delayed in resolving the issue, later reinstating the rightful appointee and arrears under ICE's direction. Procedural lapses in notifying stakeholders and delayed responses expose a failure in safeguarding the interests of dependent and vulnerable groups, violating procedural justice. Debt management, a critical area of claimant dissatisfaction, highlighted inconsistencies in application processing and lack of proactive communication. For example, a claimant requesting Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) faced months of delays due to repeated administrative missteps. Despite escalating financial hardship, the DWP failed to address urgent needs until ICE's intervention. The neglect of claimants' immediate financial crises underscores systemic inefficiencies. Such failures question the robustness of the DWP's operational oversight. The ICE report identifies systemic weaknesses within the DWP: The report commends the DWP's incremental changes, such as revised guidance for vulnerable claimants and improved debt management procedures. However, the critical lens reveals these measures as reactive rather than preventative. ICE's Service Improvement Observations (SIOs) repeatedly cite issues stemming from outdated policies or failure to act on past recommendations. Head of ICE Joanna Wallace said of the DWP: Given that there is some delay between the events a customer is complaining about, and my office seeing a complaint, it can be frustrating to still see complaints about things I know DWP have addressed. She particularly noted that Universal Credit was an issue, saying: Overpayments to students would be one example from this last year – I raised this concern and the action DWP had taken to stop repetition in my previous annual report, but these customers with these concerns have continued to come to my office and some of these cases have been amongst the most concerning I've seen. In no small part this is because Universal Credit procedures require all overpayments to be recovered, regardless of their cause. This can mean that a customer can do absolutely everything they should have done in terms of telling DWP about their circumstances, but due to administrative error be overpaid. And overall, Wallace said: I agreed with a customer's view that they had not received the service they should, and that DWP hadn't recognised that fully, in about half the cases I saw during this last year. Most often, as I've commented before, this is due to the department simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should. The 2023-2024 ICE report underscores persistent challenges in DWP's complaint-handling mechanisms – but also its overall conduct. While incremental improvements are evident, the prevalence of service failures, particularly affecting vulnerable groups, demonstrates an urgent need for systemic reforms. Claimants' case studies expose a troubling pattern of indifference and inefficiency, further showing that the department is barely fit for purpose.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:08:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/dwp-complaints-report/
It's obvious why Keir Starmer brushed off a question on toxic political donations at PMQs,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on 8 January, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey questioned the prime minister on party donations: While the honourable member for Clacton may miss out on his big allowance from Elon Musk, the spectre of the richest man in the world trying to buy a British political party should give us all pause for thought. And after years of the Conservatives taking millions of pounds of Russian money, will the prime minister now work with us to bring in long overdue reforms of party funding. So that power in this country lies with the voters and not wealthy overseas oligarchs. Musk is reportedly considering a donation of up to $100m to Reform, although he has now called for its leader Nigel Farage to resign over a disagreement about far-right fascist Tommy Robinson. The thing is, at PMQs Keir Starmer shrugged off the pressing issue of rich people buying our politics, saying: I think we all had a smile... when the honourable member said how cool it was to have the support of Musk, only for Musk to say he should be removed just a few hours later... Of course we're looking at the question of funding more generally. It's no wonder Starmer is so blasé about the corrupting impact of large political donations in politics. Since he became leader in April 2020, the Labour Party has accepted a total of 61 donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. That includes 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping £23.6m from just a handful of people. And the corrupting influence can be seen through the £4m from Quadrature Capital. This a tax haven-based hedge fund with investments in weapons, fossil fuels and private healthcare. Indeed, Labour has even appointed Rachel Kyte as its climate envoy. She also sits on the advisory board of Quadrature Charitable Foundation. By contrast, throughout Jeremy Corbyn's leadership from 2015-2019 the party only received a total of five donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. Instead, donations from those other than trade unions tended to be small amounts from various members of the electorate and funds driven from a mass increase in party membership. Too bad much of the British electorate slept on the opportunity of making Corbyn prime minister. And the situation is worse than super rich individuals and corporations buying influence through donations. Recent research from Transparency International has found that one in every ten pounds donated to UK parties comes from outright dubious sources. That includes where corruption, cash for access, fraud or money laundering has been specifically alleged or proven. The organisation recommends capping donations from individuals and corporations at £10,000 per year. Such a change would be most welcome. It would be a huge step towards de-toxifying UK politics.",Canary,2025-01-08T19:47:06+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/pmqs-8-january/
Corbyn pushes government on RAF base's role in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"On 8 January 2025, independent MP Jeremy Corbyn pushed Keir Starmer's government for transparency on the role that a strategically important RAF base is playing in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. The previous day, Corbyn described in his letter that foreign office parliamentary under-secretary Hamish Falconer had responded to a question of his ""during an Urgent Question on Northern Gaza"". And the former Labour Party leader said Falconer had ""failed to answer or acknowledge my question on the use of the British air base in Cyprus, RAF Akrotiri"". He insisted that: My constituents deserve to know the full scale of this government's complicity and participation in genocide. With this in mind, Corbyn asked for clarification on three important follow-up questions: 3. Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be deployed in Gaza? 4. How many US Air Force flights have flown from RAF Akrotiri to Israel since 7 October 2023? 5. Has your government sought legal advice over the continued use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israeli military operations? And he warned the government to be careful with its actions for legal reasons: Your government will be aware that the ICC has issued arrest warrants to Israeli officials. The government should also be aware that if it knowingly sends weapons to a government whose leader is wanted for war crimes, then it is not immune to the long arm of international law. He was referring to the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issuing arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's former defence minister Yoav Gallant back in November 2024. Both the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government have used RAF Akrotiri (the unique colonial relic on occupied Cypriot land which is part of the ""largest Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom"") to lend a helping hand to Israeli war criminals. So far, RAF Akrotiri has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. And as Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of ""a country which is participating"" in Israel's genocide – ""a direct participant"". Corbyn's original question, that Falconer failed to answer properly, was: Will Britain continue supplying weapons, including parts for jet planes, and allowing the use of RAF Akrotiri as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be used to destroy life in Gaza? And that's a question that everyone in the country should be asking their MPs regularly and repeatedly until British participation in the genocide ends.",Canary,2025-01-09T10:10:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/corbyn-raf-akrotiri/
Met Police just BLOCKED a pro-Palestine protest from marching outside the BBC,"Today (Wednesday 8 January) the Palestine Coalition have been informed by the Met Police that they intend to go back on a previous agreement and impose conditions to prevent us marching from BBC HQ at Portland Place on Saturday 18 January. We have already announced our intention to assemble outside the BBC to protest against the pro-Israel bias of its coverage – something recently highlighted in a detailed report by journalist Owen Jones to which the Corporation has so far not responded. We utterly condemn this attempt to use repressive powers to prevent our planned protest at the BBC. The route for the march was confirmed with the police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police has now reneged on our agreement and stated its intention to prevent our protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. It is unacceptable for the police to misuse public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that our march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue. It follows representations from pro-Israel groups and activists who have been publicly calling for action to be taken to curtail our right to protest against Israel's ongoing genocide. This includes the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis who has openly celebrated the horrific and criminal actions of the Israeli military in Gaza, describing them as the ""most outstanding possible thing that a decent responsible country can do"". In fact, the closest synagogue to the BBC is not even on the route of the march. Moreover, as the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that our marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that every march has been joined by thousands of Jewish people – many in an organised Jewish bloc – and addressed by Jewish speakers on the demonstration platforms. Representatives of the Jewish bloc have written to the police seeking a meeting to express their concerns that the police are choosing to listen solely to pro-Israel Jewish voices, but they have not had any response. We firmly reject any attempt to suppress our right to campaign for an end to Israel's genocidal violence and decades long violations of the rights of the Palestinian people. In the past few weeks, Israel has intensified its indiscriminate attacks including against hospitals and civilians sheltering in so-called 'humanitarian safe zones.' It is this and the ongoing complicity of the British government in these crimes that continues to bring people onto the streets in huge numbers. Our marches represent a diverse cross section of the public including the Palestinian community, many of whom are relatives of those killed by Israel. We remain in dialogue with the Metropolitan Police but call on them to immediately abandon their intention to prevent our protest at the BBC. We call on all those who are rightly outraged by Israel's ongoing genocide and those who uphold the democratic right to protest to join us when we march in London on Saturday 18 January.

Does Britain execute children abroad? Damning new evidence suggests it does.,"The ongoing controversy over RAF Akrotiri's participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza is not the only scandal relating to British armed forces. Because the Afghanistan Inquiry into possible UK Special Forces (UKSF) war crimes has just revealed that SAS officers had a ""golden pass allowing them to get away with murder"" from 2010 to 2013. This is according to a former senior Special Boat Service (SBS) officer who, along with others, had raised concerns in 2011 about SAS executions and cover-ups. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick faced criticism in 2024 for ""casually revealing a UK extra-judicial assassination program designed to evade ECHR jurisdiction"". And there were many official denials. But the revelations from the Afghanistan Inquiry suggest that this type of behaviour may indeed be commonplace. The inquiry's closed hearings do not allow attendance by members of the public, the media, or the legal teams of bereaved families. As the BBC reports: Senior SBS officers told the inquiry of deep concerns that the SAS, fresh from aggressive, high-tempo operations in Iraq, was being driven by kill counts – the number of dead they could achieve in each operation. A junior officer of the SBS, meanwhile, reported how an SAS member had spoken ""about a pillow being put over the head of someone before they were killed with a pistol"". They added that ""some of those killed by the SAS had been children"" likely younger than 16. In an email, another SBS officer showed concern about what might happen if they didn't speak out: When the next WikiLeaks occurs then we will be dragged down with them One said that ""basically, there appears to be a culture there of 'shut up, don't question'"". The low level of accountability for the SAS was apparently ""astonishing"". British support for and participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza has been utterly damning. But the UK seems not to reserve impunity only for its allies' crimes. Instead, it seems to be how things work with our own forces too.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:53:10+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/sas-murder/
Raffi Berg just 'the tip of the iceberg' when it comes to BBC pro-Israel bias,"Raffi Berg, the online editor for BBC News coverage on the Middle East, has been at the centre of a massive controversy in recent weeks. But a new petition from former Channel 4 editor Tamara Abood insists that ""Raffi is the tip of the iceberg"". And she calls for the sacking of people even higher up than Berg over the BBC's shameful (and longstanding) pro-Israel bias, specifically during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Public attention focused in on Berg after journalist Owen Jones published an investigation in December about pro-Israel bias at the BBC. Having interviewed journalists and other staff at the public service broadcaster, Jones revealed that ""senior figures"" had been skewing coverage to be more favourable to Israel while dismissing regular objections from employees who demanded the corporation uphold its supposed commitment to providing fair and impartial reporting. And in particular, Jones highlighted the malign role that Berg played. According to one former BBC journalist: This guy's entire job is to water down everything that's too critical of Israel. Others said he ""micromanages"" coverage, with one insisting that he ""has the power to reframe every story"". Even worse are his connections to the CIA, Mossad, and war criminal Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Jewish Voice for Peace explains: Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism, and is the primary ideology that drove the establishment of Israel. It adds that: While it had many strains historically, the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state where Jews have more rights than others. The pro-Israel (or Zionist) lobby in Britain has a massive influence. In the last parliament, it donated money to a quarter of British MPs, and reportedly had significant sway in the government. Half of the initial cabinet of the current Labour government, meanwhile, had received such funds. Abood argues that the same is true in the British media sector. As she said in the petition text: I have first hand experience of the extraordinary and malign influence that Zionist lobby groups exert over programme makers and broadcasters. I have spent the last 15 months watching in disgust as mainstream broadcasters in the UK have framed what is happening in Gaza through the lens of Israeli propagandists. But Berg is just a part of this, she stressed: Raffi is the tip of the iceberg. Scratch the surface of the BBC and you will find it packed to the rafters with Zionists who will quash ideas for programmes that are critical of Israel and who will frame the reporting on Gaza to centre Israeli interests. Abood also insisted: It is my belief as a former lawyer and tv producer that, in time, our mainstream media will be judged to have been complicit in a genocide by providing cover for Israel's crimes. In fact, as I write, lawyers who specialise in international law and human rights have many of these so-called ""journalists"" in their sights. And she argued that: BBC license payers are being deliberately mislead about the nature and extent of Israel's depravity in Gaza. The BBC is breaching its own requirements, and that of Ofcom, for due impartiality. As a license payer, you should be able to trust the BBC as a credible news source. The BBC is no longer credible. It has shown itself to be an outpost of the Israeli Ministry of Misinformation. Overall, her comments were damning. She said ""the BBC subverts the truth in order to influence the public's response in favour of Israel"", and that there has been ""a deliberate strategy of lies and omissions by broadcasters like the BBC"". Rather than focusing on Raffi Berg, though, she looks to BBC News CEO Deborah Turness. As she emphasised: Your license fee pays her £400K + salary. Deborah Turness must go For her, licence-fee payers deserve so much better. And we completely agree. That's why we should all support the petition and demand change.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:19:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/raffi-berg-bbc/
A family GP has been JAILED for attacking... PETROL PUMPS with Just Stop Oil,"A family doctor has been sentenced to one year in prison for taking action with climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil. Dr Patrick Hart took action in August 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. Esso is a subsidiary of the Oil giant Exxon Mobil which infamously concealed the alarming findings of its own scientists, which showed that fossil fuels caused global warming. Exxon subsequently ploughed millions into a disinformation campaign which initially sewed doubt and later confusion around the emerging climate science. In his closing statement at Chelmsford Crown Court during his trial, Hart said: I disrupted people as an act of care. I damaged the petrol pump screens as an act of care, because in times of great peril, a caring person has to stand up for what is right. My actions have already cost me greatly. I have been handed a suspended prison sentence, and thousands of pounds in costs through a civil injunction for this exact same action. I have been penalised at work and stand to be suspended or lose my licence to practise as a doctor. But I regret nothing. Because to not do it, would have been to give up on caring, and that would be worse. In the face of the permanent collapse of our climate, our economy, our society and life on Earth, the only thing that keeps me going is our continued capacity as people to care, regardless of what happens. Yes, I fear prison, but I am ready to go if I must Hart has already faced civil charges for this action and been fined, as the Thurrock Esso petrol station is subject to a private injunction. He will also face a tribunal after being referred for a disciplinary hearing by his professional regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). In the last 12 months, the GMC has suspended two doctors from the medical register following their convictions for non-violent climate protest. As such Hart stands to be penalised three times for the same action. Before sentencing, Hart said: Right now, the greatest health threat to all of us is the unfolding climate catastrophe. It is the greatest health threat we have ever faced. All healthcare workers have a responsibility to protect the health of their patients. If we do not stand up to the oil and gas executives who are wreaking havoc on our climate and the politicians who enable them, if we do not end the burning of fossil fuels, then we will have failed as a profession and the health systems that we have developed over centuries will collapse. I will continue to fight against the death sentence of fossil fuels for as long as I have strength in me. I have no greater duty as a doctor at this moment in history. Today's sentencing comes after a jury found three Just Stop Oil supporters 'not guilty' in June of 2024 for disabling petrol pumps in the same manner as Hart. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

"""Sex for shifts"": capitalist criminals McDonald's at the centre of another workers rights scandal","McDonald's is confronting renewed allegations of severe abuses of workers rights, with over 100 current and former employees reporting experiences of sexual assault, harassment, racism, homophobia, and bullying. These claims have prompted the UK parliament's Environmental Audit Committee to summon McDonald's UK chief executive, Alistair Macrow, for questioning. Meanwhile, the the TUC has hit back at what it calls the corporate giant's 'race to the bottom'. The BBC conducted an investigation revealing that employees, some as young as 17, faced inappropriate behavior from colleagues and managers. Reported incidents include sexual assault, sexually explicit remarks, homophobia, and a lack of effective response from management when complaints were raised. One former employee recounted being sexually assaulted by a senior manager, while another described a culture where such behavior was normalised. As the BBC reported, workers' claims against McDonald's include: A worker quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023, after she says managers inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she says she was told to ""suck it up"". A 16-year-old current employee based in the West Midlands says he was bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers. A female worker, 20, says a male manager sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald's branch in the East of England in August. Specifically, the BBC noted the case of Claire (not her real name). She told it that: A shift manager asked her for sex in return for extra shifts, which she refused. She was 17, he was in his 30s. ""You don't expect that to happen,"" she said. ""It was totally inappropriate."" Of course, McDonald's is notorious for zero-hours contracts. Across its businesses, including franchises, 89% of staff are on these contracts. The BBC noted that: McDonald's says workers can choose to switch to minimum guaranteed hours. But we have spoken to 50 workers across the country who say they were not given that choice. In response to these allegations, McDonald's stated that it does not tolerate harassment, abuse, or discrimination and is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace. The company highlighted its implementation of new policies and training programs aimed at preventing such behavior. However, the persistence of these issues suggests that existing measures may be insufficient. This is not the first time McDonald's has faced scrutiny over workplace practices. In 2021, the company introduced anti-harassment training following at least 50 employee-filed charges concerning workplace harassment over five years. The Environmental Audit Committee's involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation. The committee is expected to examine McDonald's corporate governance and the effectiveness of its policies in safeguarding employee welfare. This inquiry forms part of a broader evaluation of labor practices within large corporations operating in the UK. The outcome of this inquiry could have significant implications for McDonald's operations and reputation in the UK. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said: No-one should ever find themselves in the position of being asked to exchange sex for shifts. It's abhorrent – the McDonalds CEO has serious questions to answer. This investigation has exposed how sexual harassment and insecure work can go hand in hand. Zero-hours contracts create a huge imbalance of power in the workplace that leaves workers vulnerable to predatory bosses. If staff say no to their manager they face losing all of their work. This is why cracking down on exploitative working practices like zero-hours contracts and giving people stronger protections at work is so important. McDonald's is one of the largest employers in the UK. It should be setting the standard on workforce conditions – not leading a race to the bottom. The problem is – McDonald's is the epitome of the corporate capitalist race to the bottom. It's a business where the planet, biodiversity, human rights, and the rights of its workers are all far-less important than its profit margins. The fact that the BBC has uncovered yet another scandal is not a surprise. It is parasitic McDonald's operating as it is supposed to.",Canary,2025-01-07T11:30:55+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/07/mcdonalds-staff-abuse/
ICC Prosecutor Leading Charge Against Israel Meets Syria's Jihadi Overlords,"International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan visited Damascus, Syria, this weekend to meet with jihadi warlord Ahmed al-Sharaa, the de factor leader of the country after the fall of the Assad family regime. In a message the ICC published on social media, the world court said British lawyer Khan expressed gratitude to ""Syrian authorities"" for ""open & constructive discussions"" regarding holding war criminals and others accountable following the resolution of the Syrian Civil War. Syria endured over a decade of civil war under deposed dictator Bashar Assad that evolved into a melee featuring both fighting between the Assad regime and several opposition militias and a host of terrorist, separatist, and state actors fighting each other in Syria for a variety of reasons. The context of the Syrian civil war allowed the Islamic State to carve out land for a ""caliphate"" in the northern region of Raqqa that was ultimately eradicated through collaboration between the United States and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a coalition of Kurdish-led militias that largely avoided fighting for or against Assad. The war ended in early December when Assad fled the country for Russia. Ahmed al-Sharaa, formerly known by his jihadist name Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, became the de facto leader of the country as the head of the al-Qaeda offshoot militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). HTS launched a surprise assault of Assad forces in late November in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, that sent Assad forces fleeing. The striking success of HTS in Aleppo led to successive captures of territory from Idlib to Damascus; the militia's arrival to the capital prompted Assad to flee. Human rights groups and the United Nations have documented widespread evidence that Assad and several other actors in the civil war committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocities. The ICC is an international court with jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for three types of crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Khan's visit to Syria was reportedly intended to begin the process of formal investigations potentially leading to ICC convictions. Reuters reported that Sharaa's nascent regime invited Khan to discuss war crimes. Khan proclaimed himself pleased with conversations with Sharaa on the possibility of international justice for Syrian civil war crimes. ""Some of the remarks coming out of Syria by the transitional government seem to have indicated an openness to justice and accountability for crimes that may have taken place,"" Reuters quoted Khan as saying. ""I think we're happy to take part in the conversation to tell them the options that they have."" The visit was reportedly a "" surprise "" stop for Khan and the ICC did not offer any specific steps forward for its participation in Syrian justice. Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, so it does not have to accept ICC jurisdiction. The ICC statements and quotes from Khan did not indicate that he discussed in any depth with Sharaa the crimes that HTS terrorists may have committed themselves during the decade-plus of its existence, or what the new Syrian regime would do to defend the human rights of its beleaguered civilians. HTS is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization that sprang out of al-Qaeda. American authorities were offering a $10 million bounty for Sharaa himself, as the leader of the jihadists, until former President Joe Biden rescinded the reward in December. Sharaa, now wearing Western-style suits instead of military fatigues, has offered vague public statements asserting that he would lead an ""inclusive"" government and respect the existence of religious and ethnic minorities in the country, but also affirmed that the government replacing Assad would be Islamist. ""We take pride in our culture, our religion and our Islam. Being part of the Islamic environment does not mean the exclusion of other sects. On the contrary, it is our duty to protect them,"" Sharaa said in an interview in December. Prior to the HTS takeover of the country, Sharaa told CNN that ""people who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly."" Religious minorities, particularly Christians and Alawite Muslims, have expressed alarm at HTS becoming the de facto government of their country. Religious persecution experts have warned that the jihadists have a history of persecuting non-Sunni Muslims and Christians are not safe under HTS. ""HTS, with its al-Qaeda/ISIS roots, has historically been very violent towards Christian minorities, which should mean increased persecution,"" Jeff King, the president of International Christian Concern (ICC), told Breitbart News this month. ""The fall of Aleppo to these groups [Christians] will signify the beginning of the end for one of the last significant Christian strongholds in the region if unchecked."" Critics noted Khan's apparent lack of interest in minority persecutions in contrast to his energetic attempts to prosecute the government of Israel for defending itself following the terrorist atrocities by the jihadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. Khan requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister at the time, Yoav Gallant, claiming they were engaging in crimes against humanity in the Hamas-controlled Gaza region. The ICC issued the warrants in November. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar condemned Khan for meeting with the HTS leadership following his visit. ""He [Khan] already ran to Damascus to meet with al-Julani, head of HTS (designated as a terrorist organization by the UN Security Council), and former al-Qaeda operative,"" Saar wrote in a social media message. ""So much for 'international legal institutions'. Show me who your friends are and I'll tell you who you are."" ""Karim Kahn didn't find the time to come to Israel, a democratic country governed by the rule of law and with an independent judiciary, before issuing arrest warrants against its democratically elected leaders,"" Saar observed.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T20:16:03+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/20/icc-prosecutor-leading-charge-against-israel-meets-syrias-jihadi-overlords/
"Exclusive — Senate Sources: FBI, Senate Democrats Reason for Tulsi Gabbard’s Slow-Walked Confirmation","Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is one of the only members of his national security team in his Cabinet to not even have a Senate hearing scheduled yet. Senate sources familiar with the matter told Breitbart News on Monday that the FBI's background check of Gabbard is taking close to the maximum amount of time the FBI has had to conduct it and is expected back to the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours. As soon as the FBI background check documents are filed with the committee, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)—who chairs the Intelligence Committee—is expected to formally file a notice to schedule Gabbard's confirmation hearing. That's where Senate Democrats come in. If they do not agree to expedite Gabbard's hearing—Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) is the main player here, as he is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee—then the committee under its rules needs to notice the hearing a full seven days later from the notice when it's filed. That means Gabbard's confirmation hearing could drag into next week, and her full confirmation before the Senate could drag into February depending on how ridiculous Democrats get with this whole process. A lot of people close to Gabbard and Trump want to see the Senate Republicans really aggressively throw down hard against the Senate Democrats on this matter, too, multiple sources familiar with the process told Breitbart News. At this point, though, Senate Republicans have not aggressively publicly called out Democrats too much here. That could change in the days after President Trump's and Vice President JD Vance's inauguration on Monday, as sources close to Senate leaders say Republicans are quickly growing frustrated with Democrat obstruction and deep state efforts to slow-walk Trump's cabinet picks. The Senate Intelligence Committee requires nominees it considers to submit multiple elements of paperwork. The first element is Office of Government Ethics filings which Gabbard has already submitted. The second is the FBI background check, and the window for that to be finalized is quickly closing. An agreement between the Trump Transition and the federal government limits the FBI background check timing to 14 days, and the FBI began its process with Gabbard around Jan. 8, per Senate sources. That means the documents should be in front of the committee by later this week, Wednesday at the latest, and as soon as that happens Cotton is expected to notice the hearing for exactly 7 days later. But again, if Warner and the Democrats dropped their nonsense, Cotton could get the hearing scheduled faster—perhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this week. That's what happened with Trump's pick to lead the CIA, John Ratcliffe, who actually had his hearing before the FBI documents were submitted and might even be confirmed by the full U.S. Senate by later on Monday depending on if Democrats consent to move forward. Ratcliffe has the votes for confirmation, and will be confirmed; the only question is whether the Senate Democrats agree to streamline the confirmation vote or resist speedy confirmation. Interestingly, four years ago when former President Joe Biden's pick for DNI was up for confirmation, the Senate agreed to confirm her–Avril Haines–literally on Inauguration Day. Haines got 84 votes, including from several of the Republicans who have yet to wholeheartedly endorse Gabbard. Haines has been a complete radical leftist, so there is zero justification for any Republican who voted for Haines not voting Gabbard. These include Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Todd Young (R-IN). Anything less than full support for Gabbard after they voted for Haines would be seen as a complete betrayal of the nation's security and a demented denialism of the election results from November 5. What's more, the longer these establishment Republicans hold off on publicly backing Gabbard and the longer Democrats keep blowing through every procedural trick in the book to drag this out longer, they are harming national security and these senators would end up being personally responsible for emboldening bad actors on the world stage. In addition, there is a radical leftist who supports ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"" who is currently serving as the acting DNI until such time as Gabbard is confirmed: Of course, any Senate Republican who does not publicly back Gabbard at this time and work aggressively to speed up the confirmation process and pressure Democrats to get on board with moving quickly would be personally responsible for this insanity being installed at the office of the DNI in the Trump administration right now.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T20:08:56+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/exclusive-senate-sources-fbi-senate-democrats-reason-tulsi-gabbards-slow-walked-confirmation/
Trump: Official U.S. Government Policy Is 'There Are Only Two Genders',"President Donald Trump in his inauguration speech on Monday unequivocally rejected the gender insanity pushed by the Biden administration over the past four years. The 45th and 47th president reclaimed biological reality in the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, and promised to restore U.S. government policy to reflect the truth that there are only two sexes. ""As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female,"" he said, garnering a standing ovation from those in attendance. The outgoing Biden administration was unabashed in its efforts to push gender ideology and transgenderism both in the United States and abroad , hoisting transgender flags at agencies , embassies , and the White House . Specifically, the far-left administration attempted, mostly through unelected bureaucrats and rulemaking , to codify ""gender identity"" into all aspects of life , ignoring the differences between the equal, yet complimentary sexes. One outcome of gender ideology has been the attempted erasure of women's sports and spaces, including locker rooms , restrooms , and even prisons . Most notably, the Biden administration backed sex change drugs and procedures for children, and fought for confused children to access mutilating drugs and surgeries, even though such methods can lead to infertility . Transgender activists frequently claim that such sex-mutilating drugs and procedures for confused minors reduce suicides and improve mental health — dubious claims which increasingly appear untrue as more studies and data come to light. Many people who have undergone these sex change drugs and procedures as minors and later decided to reverse course, called detransitioners , have begun speaking out about the irreversible physical damage and mental torment they have experienced . RELATED STORY: Detransitioner: Genital Surgery 'Destroyed My Life' — 'You Need to Be Insane' to Think This Helps Patients In stark contrast, Trump promised on the campaign trail and after the election to protect women's sports and spaces and children from experimental procedures. ""With a stroke of my pen on day one, we're going to stop the transgender lunacy,"" Trump said in a speech at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in December. ""And, I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation — get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools, and middle schools, and high school."" ""And, we will keep men out of women's sports,"" Trump added. ""And, that will likewise be done on day one. Should I do day one, day two, or day three? How about day one?

Javier Milei Condemns Brazil for Keeping Bolsonaro from Trump Inauguration,"President of Argentina Javier Milei blamed the ""regime"" of Brazilian radical leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for not allowing conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro to travel to the United States for the inauguration of President Donald Trump. ""He [Bolsonaro] is my friend. I'm very sorry that the Lula regime won't let him come,"" Milei told Brazilian reporters on Saturday during his attendance at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball. Bolsonaro, a staunch supporter of President Trump and the MAGA movement, has been banned from leaving his country since February 2024 after Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered local police to seize his passport as part of a broad probe into an alleged ""coup"" plot following his narrow defeat in the 2022 presidential election. Shortly after the election of President Trump and Vice President JD Vance in November, Bolsonaro stated that, should he receive an invitation, he would seek permission from Brazil's STF to have his passport temporarily returned so that he could attend. STF Justice de Moraes – a self-styled ""anti-fake news crusader"" and rapporteur of several open cases against Bolsonaro who has ordered police raids against Bolsonaro and his family — denied Bolsonaro's request and subsequent appeal last week. De Moraes claimed the email invitation he received from the Trump Vance Inaugural committee was not sufficient proof he was invited. De Moraes also justified refusing the request by claiming that Bolsonaro represented a ""flight risk"" and that he showed ""indications"" that he may try to flee Brazil and claim political asylum. Bolsonaro's wife, former Brazilian First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro traveled to the United States to represent him, instead. His son Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker, was also invited. Jair Bolsonaro posted a photo of his wife and son in America on Monday and congratulated Trump on his inauguration. While unable to travel, Bolsonaro accompanied his wife to Brasilia's international airport on Saturday and told reporters that he was ""upset"" over de Moraes' refusal to allow him to travel to the United States. ""It would obviously be great for me to go there. So much so that President Trump invited me. I'm upset. I'm still shaken,"" Bolsonaro said. The former Brazilian President also criticized de Moraes and denounced being the target of a ""blatant persecution"" by the STF justice who, Bolsonaro asserted, is doing ""whatever he wants"" with the intention of ""eliminating"" Brazil's right wing. ""Unfortunately, I was unable to attend this event in the United States and without having been convicted a single time,"" Bolsonaro said. ""They will not defeat us with narratives. A person in the Supreme Court cannot be the owner of the truth, the owner of the world."" January 20 marks the first presidential inauguration in U.S. history that features international heads of state among its guests. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who reportedly did not receive an invitation, will be represented by Ambassador Maria Luiza Viotti. According to Brazilian outlets, a delegation of 21 lawmakers, including Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, attended the U.S. Presidential inauguration ceremony. In remarks given during a Monday morning meeting with his ministers, Lula said that he hopes the United States continues to be a ""historic partner"" of Brazil throughout Trump's second administration. ""There are those who say that Trump's election may cause problems for world democracy. As president of Brazil I hope that he will have a profitable administration (...) and that the Americans will continue to be Brazil's historical partner,"" Lula said. On Sunday, Eduardo Bolsonaro published a video on his Instagram account of former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro holding a video call with Jair Bolsonaro while she participated in a dinner on the eve of January 20.

President Donald Trump to Declare National Emergency at Southern Border,"President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency at the southern border, he announced Monday during his inaugural address in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. Trump wielded the critical issue of border security with incredible effectiveness during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, and his policy-heavy inaugural speech made clear he will move swiftly to act on his campaign promises. ""Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders,"" Trump said. ""With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense."" He continued, ""First, I will declare a national emergency on our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy, I will end the practice of catch and release, and I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country."" Trump will go even further. ""Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,"" he said. ""And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks, bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities."" ""As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do,"" Trump said.

"Trump Promises Release of JFK, RFK, MLK Assassination Records","President Donald Trump vowed during his pre-inauguration speech on Sunday night to release records ""in the coming days"" related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Trump also promised to release records related to ""other topics of great public interest,"" during the event at Washington, DC's Capital One Arena. ""As a first step toward restoring transparency and accountability to government, we will also reverse the overclassification of government documents, and in the coming days, we are going to make public remaining records relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, as well as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and other topics of great public interest,"" the 45th and 47th president said. "" It's all going to be released, Uncle Sam,"" he added. Robert F. Kennedy's son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., notably backed Trump's 2024 bid for the presidency, and has been selected by Trump to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). During his campaign, Trump pledged to create a commission on presidential assassination attempts, as a tribute to RFK Jr. ""After I was — can't even believe I have to say this — nearly assassinated in Pennsylvania last month, Bobby called me to express his best wishes. He knows firsthand the risks incurred by leaders who stand up to the corrupt political establishment,"" Trump said at the time. ""And when you stand up, you bring on some trouble for yourself, but you have to do what's right. You have to do what's right for the country. I'll tell you, we are both in this to do what's right for the country."" Both Kennedy's father and uncle were assassinated. Kennedy's father, Robert F. Kennedy, was shot on June 5, 1968, after winning the Democrat primary in California and died the next day. Kennedy's uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been very vocal in his belief that the CIA was involved in the killing of his uncle, although the agency denies the accusations. ""He lost his father and uncle in service to our country, and Bobby himself was subject to repeated threats to his safety during the course of his campaign, while being denied protection by the Harris-Biden administration,"" Trump said. The Biden administration notably only ordered Secret Service protection for RFK Jr. after the Trump assassination attempt and after Trump demanded protection for him. During his rally on Sunday, Trump additionally promised to sign over 200 executive orders on day one of his administration. ""Every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office,"" Trump said.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T18:59:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-promises-release-jfk-rfk-mlk-assassination-records-coming-days/
President Donald Trump Lights Up Political Class: Election a Mandate to Reverse 'Horrible Betrayal' of Americans,"President Donald Trump's election was a mandate to reverse the ""horrible betrayal"" of America and its values, Trump said in his inauguration speech delivered in the Capitol Rotunda right after taking the oath of office to become the 47th President of the United States. ""From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer,"" Trump said, adding, ""During every single day of the Trump administration, I will very simply put America first."" Trump promised that the country will be more ""exceptional"" than ever before, lighting up the political class for leaving Americans in the dust over the last four years. ""We must be honest about the challenges we face; while they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing,"" he said, explaining that the U.S. government now faces a ""crisis of trust."" ""For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair,"" he continued, noting that the government — as it currently operates — cannot even manage a ""simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad.""

""We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders, or, more importantly, its own people. Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown,"" he said, citing the devastation in North Carolina from Hurricane Helene and wildfires in California. ""We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet, more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country, despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them,"" Trump said, promising that ""all of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly."" ""My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom,"" he added.

Exclusive - Schweizer Rips Biden's Family Pardons: 'An Utter Disgrace',"Former President Joe Biden's pardon of five family members before leaving office ""confirms the deep corruption"" during the past four years, says Peter Schweizer, the president of the Government Accountability Institute and Breitbart Senior Contributor. Receiving clemency raises questions about potential wrongdoing, Schweizer suggested in his immediate reaction to the outgoing president's announcement. The family members pardoned include: James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden. ""This pardon is an utter disgrace. A singular act that confirms the deep corruption he has denied for years. We have never had such a self-serving and corrupt president in our history,"" Schweizer said. Schweizer's book, Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite , first identified the family members as the ""Biden 5."" Then-President Biden claimed he pardoned family members because they were victims of politicization. ""My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end."" ""That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,"" he added. ""The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T18:31:32+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2025/01/20/exclusive-peter-schweizer-slams-biden-family-pardons-we-have-never-had-such-a-self-serving-and-corrupt-president/

Exclusive – ‘The Schumer Precedent’: Tom Cotton Smashes Senate Democrats for Holding Up Trump Cabinet Confirmations,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, told Breitbart News that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is personally to blame for slow-walking the cabinet confirmations of President Donald Trump. As it stands on inauguration day just before the inauguration, Trump will see only one cabinet confirmation for sure on Jan. 20—the confirmation of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) as his Secretary of State. Despite several other Trump cabinet picks like CIA Director-designate John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary-designate Scott Bessent, Homeland Security Secretary-designate Kristi Noem, and Defense Secretary-designate Pete Hegseth having the votes for confirmation, the Democrats are using Senate floor procedures to slow down final confirmation votes on these people—possibly endangering the American public in so doing. Now, Cotton is speaking out telling Breitbart News exclusively just moments before Trump is sworn in that if Democrats do not cut the shenanigans now, that he will forever into the future apply what he is now calling ""The Schumer Precedent"" to Democrat presidents whereby they get only one Cabinet pick confirmed on Inauguration Day forever. ""Chuck Schumer is playing with fire with these nominations,"" Cotton said. ""If all they allow is Marco Rubio to be confirmed tonight they'll be setting the Schumer Precedent. For as long as I'm in a US Senator, no Democrat POTUS will get more than one day one official confirmed, regardless of resume or merit."" The Senate has held hearings already for the aforementioned Trump Cabinet picks, and several others, but there are several others yet to even get a hearing. For instance, Trump's Director of National Intelligence (DNI) nominee former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii does not even have a hearing scheduled at this point. Conversely, outgoing President Joe Biden had his DNI confirmed on Inauguration Day in 2021. So this new standard that's being created in large part by Senate Democrats and deep state bureaucrats slow-walking Trump's Cabinet picks could seriously hurt future presidents especially Democrats. But more broadly than this new precedent that Schumer is creating, Senate Republicans either need to figure out a way to get around the obstruction and power through it or they will begin facing the wrath of the Trump base which will hold any Cabinet confirmation delays or failures against Senate Republicans.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T18:14:35+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/exclusive-the-schumer-precedent-tom-cotton-smashes-senate-democrats-for-holding-up-trump-cabinet-confirmations/
Leftist Echo Chamber Bluesky Is Plagued by Bots as Trump Takes Office,"Bluesky, the social media platform that became a leftist echo chamber after the election of Donald Trump, is grappling with an influx of bots and impersonation accounts as Trump takes office. Inc. reports that as Bluesky continues to gain traction among leftists seeking an alternative to platforms like X and Threads, the company is grappling with a growing bot problem. The influx of spam accounts and impersonators is a byproduct of the platform's success, but it's leaving many users frustrated and concerned about the future of their social media experience. In recent weeks, Bluesky users have reported an uptick in bot activity, including dupe accounts impersonating real users and porn bots promoting explicit content. Patrick George, a journalist covering the electric vehicle industry, found himself the target of an impersonation bot despite his relatively modest following of 4,000. The bot contacted one of George's sources, attempting to continue a conversation that never took place. While George was able to report the account and have it deactivated, the experience left him unsettled. According to an analysis by Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, 44 percent of the 100 most popular Bluesky accounts have at least one doppelganger, but only 16 percent of those accounts are labeled as impersonators. V.S. Subrahmanian, a computer science professor at Northwestern University, suggests that smaller accounts like George's can be appealing targets for bad actors, as they can more easily embed themselves in the platform and evade detection. Bluesky's bot problem is a testament to its growing prominence in the social media landscape. The platform has seen its user base nearly double from 15 million in mid-November to 27 million currently, largely driven by users fleeing X in the wake of Elon Musk's controversial involvement with Donald Trump's presidential campaign. However, the influx of bots poses a significant challenge for Bluesky, which lacks the financial resources of its competitors. The platform's current verification method, which involves linking one's profile handle to a custom web domain, is somewhat technical and may not be sustainable as the platform grows. Mantzarlis argues that this method is easily replicable by malicious actors, making it an inadequate solution for a platform hoping to compete with Threads and X. As Bluesky navigates this new terrain, it will need to invest more in developing robust systems to identify and combat bot accounts. Subrahmanian suggests that the company must build training sets that look at both bot accounts and benign accounts to more easily distinguish between the two.

Donald Trump to Declare National Energy Emergency to Lower Energy Prices,"President-elect Donald Trump will reportedly declare a national energy emergency to boost American energy production and lower energy prices. Politico wrote that an incoming administration official said that the soon-to-be 47th president will sign a series of executive orders to speed up energy development. ""The rationale for this national energy emergency is that high costs of energy are unnecessary. They are by design. It is a cause of policy. We can address that,"" the official told reporters ahead of Monday's inauguration. In contrast to Trump's planned move, outgoing President Joe Biden used many national emergency declarations, the Defense Production Act, which grants the president wartime powers, to increase production of green energy. The executive orders will likely address developing critical minerals that industries need to manufacture batteries and other high-tech products, which is viewed as a way to reduce reliance on countries such as China. The Trump administration official continued, ""Critical minerals are so crucial to our national security. They are the building blocks of so much of our technology, and that's incorporated within the definition of energy here and energy abundance and the natural resources that these executive orders will unlock again."" The official stated that the moves will also roll back Biden policies to boost green energy and move the country away from fossil fuel development. This includes ending vehicle fuel economy standards, ending energy efficiency mandates on consumer goods such as gas stoves and dishwashers. For instance, one Biden rule sought to require that a majority of new cards sold sold in the U.S. are electric vehicles or hybrids by 2032. Democrats, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) have argued that America is in a clean energy ""arms race"" with China; Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent noted that China is projected to build 100 coal fired plants this year. He explained. Sen. Wyden, just so we can frame this for everyone in the room, China will build a 100 new coal plants this year. There is not a clean energy race, there is an energy race. China will build ten nuclear plants this year, that is not solar. I am in favor of building more nuclear plants and I would note that the IRA, as scored by the CBO, is wildly out of control of spending on the upside. Trump has said he aims to cut gasoline prices during his first year in office. ""The president is taking these actions as soon as possible here on day one so that we can lower prices as soon as possible for the American people,"" the official remarked.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T17:53:28+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-to-declare-national-energy-emergency-to-lower-energy-prices/
Donald Trump to End 'Birthright Citizenship' via Executive Order,"President Donald Trump will issue an Executive Order ending the awarding of birthright citizenship to the children of illegal migrants, administration officials said. The citizenship order will face years of legal fights before it is reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The rule would not apply to children born before the rule is confirmed. If upheld, the change would sharply reduce the government-created incentives for migrants to sneak into Americans' society and it would help Americans build their own families. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that in 2024 migrants gave birth to almost 400,000 "" anchor babies "" — the term used to describe the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens and other foreign nationals. The decision to birth a child in the United States is rational for foreigners and their children — and is good for progressives' goal of imposed diversity. But the process drains the value of citizenship held by Americans. The Washington Post reported : Trump will issue other executive orders that will ramp up deportations, restart border wall construction and send U.S. troops to patrol the 2,000-mile boundary with Mexico, said the incoming official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules for a call with reporters set by the incoming administration. After Trump is inaugurated, he plans to declare a national emergency at the southern border. Trump will then issue orders to restart the "" Remain in Mexico "" policy of his first term, designate drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, and suspend refugee resettlement in the United States for at least four months, officials said, reading a list of Inauguration Day actions and orders. ... Trump's rapid-fire decrees have been crafted to immediately put immigration advocates and other opponents on their heels, his aides say. They view his November win as a mandate to order sweeping changes to the U.S. immigration system and said the record influx of unlawful crossings in the first three years of the Biden administration demands bold action. Roughly 3.6 million children are born in the United States each year. The birth rate is declining partly because immigraiton flatlines salaries and drives up housing prices, making it doubly difficult for couples to have all the children they would like to. In general, Democrats — and most business lobbies — favor policies that help import migrants over policies that help American families.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T17:46:49+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/20/donald-trump-to-end-birthright-citizenship-executive-order/
Trump Saves the Whales: Plans End to Disastrous Northeast Offshore Wind Farms,"Multiple reports over the weekend indicated that President-elect Donald Trump is promising near-immediate action to shut down offshore wind farm projects throughout the Northeast United States, which were widely unpopular with locals who feared the industrialization of their natural shorelines and environmental destruction. The administration of outgoing President Joe Biden had prioritized funding and support for offshore wind projects during its four years in power, including major wind farm subsidies in the so-called ""Inflation Reduction Act"" and relying on leftist governors in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts to back the projects. The projects attracted loud opposition from local tourism industries and environmentalists, who noted a significant increase in the number of washed-up whale carcasses along the shoreline as sonar work began off the Northeast coast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has rejected the alleged links between whale deaths and offshore wind development, but many prominent local political leaders have rejected the denials on the grounds that they were offered with little detail. NOAA blames the increased number of whale deaths oh an ""unusual mortality event"" that began in 2016, shortly before the development of America's first offshore wind farm, the Block Island Wind Farm off of Rhode Island. The Associated Press confirmed on Friday with Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), one of the most vocal opponents of offshore wind farms in New Jersey, that President-elect Trump had asked for his help in drafting an executive order to stop offshore wind projects. ""I said 'Mr. President, we need to move on this.' He said, 'Yeah, we definitely do. I agree. I'm against them,' "" Van Drew told the Associated Press. ""He said, 'Write an executive order, get it to my people.'"" Van Drew indicated that his draft was meant as more of a first draft to begin the discussion on the executive order than a text that would be replicated verbatim. The Congressman said that he had already written his draft and sent it to Trump's choice to be Secretary of the Interior, former North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. The Interior Department is home to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which is in charge of approving offshore wind projects. Rep. Van Drew was among the most prominent lawmakers opposing wind projects. ""It's going to hurt fishing, hurt our environment, hurt tourism, and just in general I don't see any good in it except that for those people who want to gain something from it, there's a lot of money floating around,"" Rep. Van Drew told Breitbart News in March 2023. ""There's been few things in my career — and I've spanned from being a mayor to what used to be called a freeholder, a county commissioner, to state senate state assembly,"" Van Drew emphasized, ""I don't know if there's anything that has truly in my heart, and I mean this, bothered me as much as this does. I'm really worried about it."" On Sunday, New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra confirmed on social media that he had spoken to Burgum while attending a pre-inaugural event in Washington, DC. Kanitra, formerly the mayor of the coastal community of Point Pleasant Beach, said he discussed offshore wind with Burgum for 20 minutes. ""My fellow offshore wind warriors will be very happy to hear that he told me directly that no new wind farms will be built off New Jersey's coast during the Trump Administration!!!"" Kanitra wrote. ""So sorry to break this news to all the international corporations that were trying to industrialize our ocean and destroy the Jersey Shore, but you guys might as well start packing up now."" Spoke to incoming Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum last night for 20 minutes at the America First Policy... Posted by Assemblyman Paul Kanitra on Sunday, January 19, 2025 Other disparate reports have also indicated that Trump will move swiftly to shut down offshore wind farm development, a move celebrated by some environmentalists who prioritize saving marine life over the reduced carbon emissions that wind development offers compared to more conventional energy sources. In apparent anticipation of Trump's halt in offshore development, BOEM reportedly approved one more offshore wind project in the last days of the Biden administration. The agency offered a final approval to a project known as ""Mayflower Wind,"" expected to be built off the coasts of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts, which would ""grandfather"" in the project. In the event that Burgum halts future projects, those already approved are more likely to be completed. Reports that Trump's administration will not be friendly to wind development preceded the news that some companies would withdraw from offshore wind projects. On Sunday, the Boston Herald reported that the Italian company Prysmian Group announced it would no longer invest in a $300 million offshore wind project in Somerset, Massachusetts, though it did not name Trump as a factor in its decision. ""Prysmian is continuously evaluating market opportunities for our capacity to be aligned with demand,"" the company announced, ""to best serve our customers' needs and to also carry out efficient and timely investments."" ""As a result of the consideration, including the strong growth opportunities in the U.S. and global cable markets, Prysmian has decided to not proceed with the purchase of the land in Somerset,"" it concluded. Opposition to offshore wind development skyrocketed in New Jersey in 2023 following a large number of whales, including dolphins, washing up on the sands of multiple boardwalks, shocking local families attempting to enjoy the traditional activities available there. Point Pleasant Beach, under former mayor Kanitra and represented by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) in Congress, became a focal point of protest, holding a ""Save the Whales"" rally in February 2023. ""The commercial fishing is extremely upset with the visual observations of dead whales floating at sea,"" Brick Wenzel, Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey's, fishing liaison and a longtime commercial fisherman, told Breitbart News in March 2023. ""One vessel said they had seen 3 different whales in one trip. Another had parts of a whale come up in their net. Most of the captains are generational fishers and are in their 60s — No one has heard of or seen anything like the carnage being witnessed."" ""In my 50+ years of working on the ocean, I have never seen anything remotely like this,"" Captain Robert Bogan of the Gambler , a party fishing boat in front of Point Pleasant Beach, wrote in a letter to Rep. Smith he shared with Breitbart News in August 2023. ""Dead whales on our beach absolutely and logically have everything to do with the oceanic geo-surveys."" ""NOAA was so concerned about slowing our boats down to less than 10 knots (basically a crawl), so as not to strike a whale and yet they signed-off on these invasive surveys, and admitted there would be an 'acceptable' whale mortality involved,"" he continued. ""Now, they don't want to admit there was any mortality coinciding with wind research."" ""Ocean Wind I and II,"" the projects that prompted the protest in Point Pleasant Beach, were canceled in November 2023. The Danish company Ørsted, responsible for the projects, withdrew citing inflation skyrocketing under the Biden administration. ""Macroeconomic factors have changed dramatically over a short period of time, with high inflation, rising interest rates, and supply chain bottlenecks impacting our long-term capital investments,"" Ørsted Group EVP and CEO Americas David Hardy said in a statement. ""As a result, we have no choice but to cease development of Ocean Wind 1 and Ocean Wind 2.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:35:14+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/environment/2025/01/20/trump-saves-the-whales-plans-end-to-disastrous-northeast-offshore-wind-farms/
Joe Biden Pardons 5 Family Members Involved in Family Business,"President Joe Biden grants clemency to family members deeply involved in the Biden family business, including brothers James and Frank Biden. Receiving clemency raises questions about potential wrongdoing. ""My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics,"" Biden wrote in a statement. ""Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end."" ""That is why I am exercising my power under the Constitution to pardon James B. Biden, Sara Jones Biden, Valerie Biden Owens, John T. Owens, and Francis W. Biden,"" he added. ""The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense."" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer asked attorney general nominee Pam Bondi, to investigate and prosecute James Biden for allegedly making false statements to Congress, according to a letter obtained by Breitbart News. James is a member of the Biden family business. Many of his interactions with the business are below, as Breitbart News reported: During Comer's probe into the family, he found a $200,000 check from Americore, a company that allegedly defrauded Medicare, which landed in Joe Biden's bank account via James Biden. James Biden denied the check was due to a preexisting business relationship. He claimed the money was a return payment for money Joe Biden lent him. Comer then requested the alleged ""loan documents"" the Biden brothers might have consummated, but the White House stonewalled the request. Comer also subpoenaed James's Lion-Hall Group and JBBSR, Inc., entities. The subpoena appeared directed at obtaining records linked to Joe Biden's corporation, ""CelticCapri Corp,"" which received nearly $10 million in 2017 without specifying revenue line items. James was also business partners with CEFC China Energy Co., an organization closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), Comer discovered that Biden associate Rob Walker received a $3 million wire transfer from CEFC. In turn, four Biden family members — Hunter, James, Hallie, and an unidentified ""Biden"" — received a collective $1.3 million cut from the $3 million wire transfer. Frank Biden, Joe Biden's youngest brother, was ""hired by the Illinois-based industrial manufacturing firm Federal Signal Corp. to help connect the company with Florida lawmakers,"" the Wall Street Journal reported . ""During a weekly call, Frank Biden, 69 years old, would frequently interrupt the meeting and say he had to take a call from 'the Big Guy,' as he put it."" Breitbart News reported on Valerie Biden Owens involvement in the family business: Valerie Biden Owens, the sister of former vice president Joe Biden (D), who served as the campaign manager for his past presidential campaigns, directed $2.5 million from ""Citizens for Biden"" and ""Biden for President Inc."" to her own consulting firm during her brother's 2008 presidential bid alone, Breitbart senior contributor and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer's investigative blockbuster Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America's Progressive Elite reveals.

"Big Tech Titans Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Pichai Seated by Elon Musk at Trump Inauguration","The leaders of the influential tech platforms in the world are attending President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration after donating millions of dollars to his inauguration committee. Silicon Valley leaders, many of whom established the most censorious practices on their respective platforms, are attending Trump's inauguration to become the 47th president. They join prominent Trump adviser and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in taking a place of honor at the inauguration. The list includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim cook, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Other prominent tech leaders attending include TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, OpenAI boss Sam Altman, and Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi. Many of these big tech companies and their chief executives including Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, have donated millions of dollars to Trump's inaugural committee. Several of these tech companies have started pivoting away from their onerous fact-check regimes in favor of prioritizing free speech. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in early January major changers to his platforms' content moderation policies and practices on Facebook and Instagram, including scrapping Facebook's third-party ""fact-check"" system known for its leftist bias. Zuckerberg also announced that the recent election of Donald Trump serves as a ""cultural tipping point"" towards prioritizing free speech over curbing alleged misinformation or hate speech. Meta also eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and will instead focus on hiring regardless of one's immutable characteristics. Google said it would not add fact checks to its search results or YouTube video in Europe, flouting an EU law that requires tech giants to use fact checkers. However, as Pichai is attending Monday's inauguration, it seems that the search giant has not fully pivoted towards Trump . Sundar Pichai of Google and Elon Musk cheer Donald Trump (Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty) Google, in the aftermath of Trump's historic election, planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to ""resist the Republican agenda."" A Google spokesperson said that the big tech company will host the happy hour for Priorities USA; however, the spokesman said that the company would not participate in the ""digital retrospective"" event.

Mexican Government Downplays Cartel Shootout that Triggered U.S. Consular Warning,"Mexican government officials tried to downplay a large-scale cartel shootout in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, that went on for hours. The shootout triggered a security warning from the U.S. consulate in that city. The shootouts occurred on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning throughout Nuevo Laredo. The shootouts started on the western side of the city when a convoy of Mexican army soldiers was carrying out a series of security patrols and encountered a group of gunmen from the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas. The soldiers tried to intercept the gunmen, who began shooting as additional gunmen began to mobilize throughout the city, setting up roadblocks and providing extra support. At the same time, the military forces fought back and called for backup. The fighting soon spread throughout the city, prompting the U.S. Consulate General in Nuevo Laredo to send a security warning and ask all its employees to shelter in place. The shelter-in-place order lasted for approximately 8 hours as gunmen and soldiers chased each other throughout the city. In the aftermath of the shootout, Jorge Cuellar, the security spokesman for the Tamaulipas government, claimed that only three individuals had been injured in the ""isolated event"" and that no fatalities had resulted. The claims by the bureaucrat are false as internal communications within Tamaulipas law enforcement, as well as within Mexico's military, point to at least three dead gunmen and several arrests. As Breitbart Texas has reported , Cuellar has a history of suppressing information about the violence in Tamaulipas and going as far as lying to claim that the state is safe. He is the same public official who claimed that the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros was wrong for issuing a travel alert over kidnappings in passenger buses near the border city of Reynosa.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T16:53:06+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/20/mexican-government-tries-to-downplay-cartel-shootout-that-u-s-triggered-consular-warning/

Sen. John Fetterman Arrives at Inauguration in Hoodie and Shorts,"Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) arrived at the inauguration Monday in his classic fit — a hoodie and shorts — despite the freezing temperatures in the nation's capital. All eyes were therefore not just on Melania Trump's stunning outfit. Fetterman happily showed off gray shorts and a black Carhartt hoodie for this momentous occasion of the swearing in of President-elect Trump for his second term. The fashion choice comes as D.C. fights freezing temperatures, with a high of 28° and wind chills even lower. Because of that, the swearing-in ceremony has been moved to inside the Capitol Rotunda. Trump made this announcement in a January 17 Truth Social post: January 20th cannot come fast enough! Everybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen. It is my obligation to protect the People of our Country but, before we even begin, we have to think of the Inauguration itself. The weather forecast for Washington, D.C., with the windchill factor, could take temperatures into severe record lows. There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!). Therefore, I have ordered the Inauguration Address, in addition to prayers and other speeches, to be delivered in the United States Capitol Rotunda, as was used by Ronald Reagan in 1985, also because of very cold weather. The various Dignitaries and Guests will be brought into the Capitol. This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience! ""We will open Capital One Arena on Monday for LIVE viewing of this Historic event, and to host the Presidential Parade. I will join the crowd at Capital One, after my Swearing In,"" Trump added, noting that ""All other events will remain the same..."" Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) attends the Inauguration of Donald J.

""They're going to make people that have steel mills do very well, and the people that work at those steel mills are going to do very well,"" Trump said. In a statement to CBS News on Thursday ahead of the meeting, Fetterman, who has repeatedly demonstrated he is unafraid to think outside the mainstream of the Democrat Party, declared that he had no ""gatekeeper.""

Steve Bannon: Mark Zuckerberg Is a Criminal that Can't Be Trusted,"In a fiery interview on ABC's This Week , former Trump adviser Steve Bannon accused Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg of being a criminal and called for his prosecution over the infamous ""Zuckerbuck"" donations made during the 2020 presidential election. The Hill reports that Steve Bannon recently launched a scathing attack on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during an interview with Jonathan Karl on ABC's This Week . Bannon accused Zuckerberg of being a criminal and pushed for his prosecution over donations made through his company during the 2020 presidential election. The heated exchange took place as Karl and Bannon discussed Monday's inauguration, where several tech moguls, including Zuckerberg, are set to receive prime seats . Bannon claimed that Trump had ""broken the oligarchs"" and forced them to ""surrender."" When asked if he believed in Zuckerberg's ""conversion,"" Bannon responded with a resounding ""Absolutely not,"" before labeling the Meta founder a ""criminal."" Bannon's accusations stem from ""Zuckerbucks"" — the many millions of dollars Zuckerberg poured into a nonprofit that distributed funds to election boards in 2020. While Zuckerberg claimed the contributions were intended to be non-partisan, Republicans have accused the organization of unfairly distributing the money to benefit leftists. Bannon called for a systematic adjudication of the matter, either through the House or a grand jury led by a special prosecutor. He clarified that he was not directly calling for the Justice Department, under President-elect Trump, to prosecute Zuckerberg. Instead, he suggested that the House should investigate first, and if they are not prepared to do so, a special counsel should be set up to examine the 2020 election seriously. This is not the first time Bannon has heavily criticized the Meta CEO. Earlier last week, he stated that Zuckerberg ""can't be trusted."" Bannon also expressed his belief that Zuckerberg will ""flip on us in the second"" when it becomes convenient for him. The accusations come amid a series of events that have raised eyebrows regarding Zuckerberg's relationship with the incoming administration. The Meta CEO is set to host a black-tie reception on January 20, following Trump's inauguration. Additionally, Zuckerberg has recently attended meetings with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, made a $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural fund, and swiftly ended Meta's heavily biased fact-checking program.

Former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards Dies of Brain Cancer,"Former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards died on Monday at the age of 67 after battling brain cancer. Her family confirmed her death in a statement, saying she passed away at home ""surrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie."" ""Our hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,"" they said, according to NPR. Richards, daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards (D), revealed in January of 2024 she was living with brain cancer, but vowed to continue her fight for abortion while battling her illness. She had been diagnosed in mid-2023 with an incurable and aggressive ailment called glioblastoma. Richards oversaw nearly four million abortions while leading Planned Parenthood for 12 years, between 2006 and 2018, according to Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. During that time, she massively grew the organization, with the base of donors and volunteers increasing from three million to 11 million, according to the The Texas Tribune . She also raised more money than at any other point in Planned Parenthood's history and supercharges the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which is the organization's political advocacy arm. Richards was at the helm of the organization when Planned Parenthood was accused of illegally harvesting and selling body parts from aborted babies, although the organization denies the allegations. She stepped down in 2018, and still continued to work as an abortion activist. A few months before her death, outgoing President Joe Biden awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a private ceremony. The Medal of Freedom is given at the discretion of the president to a civilian who has made an ""especially meritorious contribution"" to the United States. ""Today, I had the honor of awarding Cecile Richards the Presidential Medal of Freedom. With absolute courage, she fearlessly leads us forward to be the America we say we are – a nation of freedom,"" 82-year-old Biden said in a post to X. ""Through her work to lift up the dignity of workers, defend and advance women's reproductive rights and equality, and mobilize Americans to exercise their power to vote, she has carved an inspiring legacy."" Richards urged women to ""be bold"" in speaking about their abortions — during a speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago in 2024, she said women are ""unstoppable"" when they are able to have their unborn babies aborted. ""One day, our children and grandchildren may ask us, 'When it was all on the line, what did you do?' And the only acceptable answer is, everything we could,"" Richards said. Richards is survived by her husband, Kirk Adams, a labor organizer, and her three children, Daniel, Lily, and Hannah.

Chip Roy on Biden's Pardons: 'Let’s Call Them All Before Congress',"""The implication is that they needed"" them, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) said of President Joe Biden's eleventh hour preemptive pardons on Monday. Roy called on Congress to ""demand the truth."" Hours before leaving office, Biden issued preemptive presidential pardons of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Retired Gen. Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 Committee, calling them ""dedicated, selfless public servants"" and the ""the lifeblood of our democracy."" ""These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions,"" the statement reads in part. Of Fauci Biden stated that he ""saved countless lives by managing the government's response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses,"" crediting him for helping the country ""tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic."" ""The United States is safer and healthier because of him,"" he declared, making no mention of Fauci's constant flip-flopping, his erroneous advice — including but not limited to the made-up social distancing rule, universal masking, and vaccine mandates during the coronavirus pandemic — and his involvement in gain-of-function research. ""Implication is that they needed the pardons... So, let's call them all before Congress and demand the truth,"" Rep. Roy said in reaction to the pardons. ""If they refuse or lie – let's test the constitutional 'reach' of these pardons with regard to their future actions,"" he added. ""Absolutely,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in response to Roy's idea. ""But one of the reasons bureaucrats behave badly in the first place is because Congress has failed to wield its oversight and spending authority effectively,"" he added. Andrew Huff, author of The Truth About Wuhan: How I Uncovered the Biggest Lie in History , told Breitbart News Saturday earlier this month that a pardon of Fauci would incriminate everyone, adding that acceptance of a pardon is ""admission of guilt of the crimes."" ""At best, Dr Fauci is guilty of 25 million counts of negligent criminal homicide,"" Huff explained. ""So they knew that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was a leaky lab, but they allowed the research to go on. They illegally exported the technology. They didn't have the proper safety controls in place from a risk management perspective on the United States side and with the contractors involved with this research,"" Huff said, deeming it all illegal. ""So in U.S. law, if the president issues a pardon to someone, and the person accepts the pardon, it's an admission of guilt of the crimes. And if you look at all the individuals involved with the cover up, the export of this technology, that is a violation of the RICO Act,"" Huff explained. ""And you can use, you know, basically the same kind of criminal process and prosecution that they use against mobsters to go after someone like Anthony Fauci and all his conspirators,"" he continued. ""So even if they pardon Anthony Fauci, if he accepts the pardon, it then incriminates everyone involved in the RICO, and they're all guilty ""So you know, if they go and they pardon Anthony Fauci with a blanket pardon, [if] he accepts it, well, he condemns everyone else in the government who's — who is involved in this operation,"" Huff added.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:54:47+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/chip-roy-biden-preemptive-pardons-fauci-january-6-committee-members-lets-call-them-all-before-congress-demand-truth/
Eight Die in Nursing Home Arson Believed to Have Been Set by Resident,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) – Eight people died Monday in a fire at a home for older people on the outskirts of the Serbian capital, Belgrade, that is suspected of being set by a resident, officials said. Seven others were injured in the blaze that erupted around 3:30 a.m. in Barajevo, a municipality on the southern edge of Belgrade, state RTS television reported. ""Emergency crews reacted swiftly ... but unfortunately the fire had already flared up and eight people lost their lives,"" said Serbian Social Care Minister Nemanja Starovic. Police said in a statement that 30 people were in the home when the fire broke out. They said the fire engulfed over a third of the care facility, which is located in a house in a rural area. The suspected cause of the fire was arson, police said. The state prosecutor's office said an investigation is still underway but that initial indications suggest that one of the residents who died in the fire had started it. The injured were transferred to two hospitals in Belgrade, RTS said. At least one person was in serious condition, doctors said.

Farage Says 'Gigantic Cover Up': Southport Killer Rudakubana Guilty,"Rwandan heritage teen Axel Rudakubana unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges including the murder of three young girls and terrorism related offences at the first day of his trial on Monday, prompting Nigel Farage to again express concerns about the coverups he says surrounds the deadly Southport attack. There will be no trial of 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana after he unexpectedly pleaded guilty to all charges put before him in Liverpool Crown Court. The plan had been for the trial proper to begin on Tuesday morning, meaning the families of the deceased were not in court to hear the surprise plea at this morning's preparatory hearing. Rudakubana responded ""guilty"" when three charges of murder, ten of attempted murder, one of possessing a knife, one of producing a biological toxin, and one of possessing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. He has admitted killing six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar. Most of his other victims cannot be named due to their right to privacy as children, but two of the ten victims of attempted murder were adults, a dance teacher who shielded the children from his blows, and a local businessman who ran to their aid. Rudakubana will appear in court again on January 23rd for sentencing. The Judge, Mr Justice Goose, told Rudakubana in court this morning it would be ""inevitable"" that a life sentence would be imposed. Speaking outside the court a spokesman for the Criminal Prosecution Service said the attack was a ""meticulously planned rampage"" and that Rudakubana is a ""young man with a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence. He has shown no signs of remorse."" While Rudakubana will certainly now go to prison, many questions over the attack remain. Indeed, as acknowledged by UK state broadcaster the BBC answers to the mystery of his motivations may now never be answered. They stated: ""Some answers may have emerged from the trial – or they may not. Now, after Axel Rudakubana's guilty pleas this morning, there will be no trial."" British Member of Parliament and leader of the Reform UK Party and the decades-long Brexit movement Nigel Farage, who has previously expressed serious concerns that his absolute right to freedom of speech as a parliamentarian had been curtailed over this case, again expressed concern over a cover-up on those issues as the news of a guilty plea emerged today. Speaking from Washington D.C., where he is to attend the inauguration of once and future President Donald Trump today, Mr Farage told The Daily Telegraph : ""I was pretty certain from what I had been told very early on that this was a terrorist-related attack. I wanted to ask questions in Parliament about what the authorities knew about this man, but my rights of parliamentary privilege were taken away and I was not allowed to say anything, which is extraordinary. I wasn't even allowed to ask any questions in Parliament, and the suggestion that it was because of ongoing court proceedings is completely wrong. This reflects very badly on the Prime Minister."" Mr Farage said it is his understanding that there has been ""a gigantic cover up from day one"" but refuse still to classify the attack as terrorist for political reasons. Adding to Mr Farage's positions was the revelation from the Press Association that while police discovered Rudakubana's attempts to create biological warfare agent Ricin and his Al-Qaeda training manual within days of the attack, these details weren't made public for several months. Mr Farage has previously asserted this delay, which is now officially known, existed and had possibly been a deliberate move as part of the government's management of the public's feelings about the mass stabbing of young children. Farage said the riots that followed the stabbing last year were not suppressed in any way by government censorship, but rather had been fuelled by the information vacuum created by Downing Street. ""What really led to the riots was the withholding of information... The public are capable of absorbing the truth about terrorist attacks, we have had them before without them causing riots"", he said, stating there had not been riots after terror attacks such as the Westminster Bridge attack where the facts were made public quickly. Also made public for the first time today are new details about Rudakubana's school days and his activity in the weeks leading up to the killings. While it is emphasises by the Press Association that these facts have not been proven, it is at least claimed that Rudakubana had said he was ""racially"" bullied at school and carried a knife in the classroom for self-defence. It is stated he was excluded from school for the knife, and staff at other schools he subsequently was enrolled in — although in one case his attendance was recorded as just one per cent — expressed concern about his violence towards others. Rudakubana returned to his former school once and attacked someone there with a hockey stick, allegedly a ""a former bully or someone he had a grievance with"". He attempted to return to the school again just a week before the Southport stabbings but was restrained by his father, it is stated.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:33:51+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/farage-says-gigantic-cover-up-southport-killer-rudakubana-guilty/
Cartel-Connected Human Smuggler Sent to Prison for Kidnapping Texas Teen,"A cartel-connected human smuggler will spend 20 years in prison for the ransom kidnapping of a Texas teen at the hands of the Gulf Cartel in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Sixto Gonzalez Jr. went before Chief U.S. District Judge Randy Crane, who sentenced him to 20 years in prison for the charge of hostage-taking. Gonzalez, a previously convicted human smuggler with known ties to the Gulf Cartel, had pleaded guilty to the charge in May 2023. According to court documents and information released by the U.S. Attorney's Office, on June 19, 2021, the smuggler lured a 19-year-old teenage male from Alamo, Texas, to go with him to the Mexican city of Reynosa for a job opportunity. When the two got to a house in that city, other men were waiting for them and tied up the victim before beating him. The men demanded $5,000 and a weapon in exchange for his release. As a way to pressure the victim's family, the suspects sent a video of them using a wooden board to strike the victim in the buttocks area. Known as a ""tabliza"" or paddling, the practice is a common torture method used by the Gulf Cartel in Tamaulipas. In the video, the men used the board to repeatedly beat the victim until it broke. At the time, FBI agents worked with Tamaulipas state authorities, who were able to locate the house where the cartel gunmen had the victim and rescue him. At the time of the rescue, authorities claimed the victim was restrained with zip ties and had multiple bruises. Court records revealed that while in federal custody, on May 17, 2022, Gonzalez and two other men tried to bribe a correctional officer at the East Hidalgo Detention Center.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T15:25:08+00:00,Border / Cartel Chronicles,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/20/cartel-connected-human-smuggler-sent-to-prison-for-kidnapping-texas-teen/
"Texas Crackdown on Illegal Migrants Nets 50,000 Criminal Arrests, Reduced Crossings","Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is touting the success of the Lone Star State's crackdown on illegal migration he says has curtailed activity of the dangerous Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and resulted in 50,000 criminal arrests. Abbott says that since ""Operation Lonestar"" was launched in 2021, Texas officials and participants in several other states have led to the apprehension of more than 530,400 illegal aliens, 42,900 criminal arrests, and more than 42,900 felony charges, Fox News reported. RELATED: Officer Catches, Arrests Colorado Driver for Human Smuggling ""Our top priority is the safety and security of Texans, including against the growing threat of Tren de Aragua,"" Abbott said in a January 10 post on X. ""We will not allow this gang to operate or gain a foothold in Texas."" Abbott's office also reported ""Operation Lonestar"" interdicted more than 620 million lethal doses of fentanyl, ""enough to kill every man, woman, and child in the United States, Mexico, and Canada combined."" The operation and its subsequent initiatives reportedly cost the state $11 billion, but all of that budget was dedicated to keeping Texans safe, rooting out crime, and putting a cap on the activities of dangerous gangs including Tren de Aragua. ""Because of these efforts, Texas has decreased illegal crossings into the state by 87%,"" said Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris. RELATED: Texas Begins Construction of Historic Floating Border Barrier ""Texas has held the line against the Biden-Harris border crisis for the past four years, and Governor Abbott looks forward to continuing to work closely with President Trump and his incoming administration to protect our state and the nation."" In 2023, Texas passed a law allowing local officials to arrest illegal aliens and deport them from the state, but while that law, Senate Bill 4 , has been mired in lawsuits by activists for illegal aliens, the bill has inspired other states to craft similar laws.

Chicagoans Siding with Trump's Illegal Alien Deportation Plans,"Media outlets have reported Donald Trump's plan to focus on Chicago as a launching pad to begin his promised efforts to round up and deport illegal aliens. While city officials have been plotting ways to hamper that effort, many Windy City voters and citizens are rising up to support the move. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the incoming Trump administration is ""planning a large-scale immigration raid in Chicago"" set to launch sometime during the third week of January after Trump's inauguration. ""The raid is expected to begin on Tuesday morning, a day after Trump is inaugurated, and will last all week, the people said. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will send between 100 and 200 officers to carry out the operation,"" the WSJ reported . The Associated Press added that Trump officials have a list of more than 300 violent criminal illegals that they intend to round up and prepare for deportation back to their native countries. Indeed, incoming Trump border czar Tom Homan has given Chicago and Mayor Brandon Johnson a stark warning, saying , ""We're going to start right here in Chicago, Illinois. And if the Chicago mayor doesn't want to help, he can step aside. But if he impedes us, if he knowingly harbors or conceals an illegal alien, I will prosecute him."" RELATED — ""You Work for Me!"" Trump's New Border Czar Doesn't Put Up with Democrat Nonsense Meanwhile, the city council is lining up to work against efforts by the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to begin rounding up criminal illegals to begin shipping them back to where they belong. Just last week an amendment to weaken the city's policy preventing the Chicago Police Department from working with the feds was defeated by a large margin. More than three quarters of the city's 50 aldermen voted against an amendment introduced by alderman Raymond Lopez and alderwoman Silvana Tabares to allow the CPD to work with ICE to identify and deport illegal aliens convicted of various violent crimes. Mayor Brandon Johnson celebrated the vote to maintain the city's sanctuary city policies, and said, ""Our job is to make sure that people are protected and safe. That is the top priority of any government, and that's what we're going to do."" He added that efforts to roll back protections for criminals ""was just stoking the flames of fear."" ""The people of Chicago can rest assured that the full force of government will do everything in its power to protect the residents of this city,"" the self-professed ""progressive"" mayor insisted. Despite Johnson's claims that Chicagoans are happy that he is making sure they are ""safe,"" many of his own constituents have been railing against his generous and expensive support for criminal illegals. Chicago city hall meetings have become raucous events as citizens have routinely filled the gallery sections to protest Johnson's continuing efforts redirect budget money and city resources away from black communities and to the tens of thousands of illegal aliens that have flooded the city at his repeated invitation. In November, voters surged into city hall to protest Johnson's plan to sharply raise taxes so that he could spend the money on illegals. Johnson ended up losing his bid for higher taxes in that round of budget negotiations. But the protests over his policies have come in waves. In a later city hall meeting, Johnson even cleared the room to prevent the citizen protesters from being heard as he continued to push more spending on illegal migrants. Several weeks before all this, Chicagoans were even heard urging incoming Trump border czar Tom Homan to arrest Mayor Johnson for his efforts to hamper deportation of criminal illegals. Similar incidents have been cropping up since 2023 as citizens have risen up to mount protests over Johnson's fealty to illegals over his own citizens. The protests and conflict have taken a toll on Johnson's approval ratings and he now ranks as one of the nation's least popular big city mayors. A Change Research poll from November, for instance, found that 75 percent of Chicago voters disapprove of Johnson's work as mayor. And another poll taken that same month by Urban City Action and M3 Strategies, found that 60 percent view Johnson unfavorably and his favorable rating was a lowly 28 percent. Johnson now ranks as the most unpopular mayor in modern Chicago history, National Review reported in October.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:29:40+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/20/chicagoans-siding-with-trumps-illegal-alien-deportation-plans/
"Poland Focusses on Security, Russian 'Hybrid Attacks'","POLOWCE, Poland (AP) – Poland's six-month presidency of the European Union is firmly focused on security. As Europe ́s biggest land war in decades rages, fewer places highlight the challenges and contradictions of defending the bloc and its values more starkly than the border with Belarus. Some 13,000 border guards and soldiers protect around 400 kilometers (250 miles) of border. It ́s become a buffer zone since Belarus ́ ally, Russia, invaded neighboring Ukraine three years ago. Similar fortifications farther north line Poland's frontier with the Russian region of Kaliningrad. Poland is Ukraine ́s top logistical backer. Most of the Western-supplied arms, ammunition and equipment helping to keep Ukraine ́s armed forces afloat transit through. Russia, meanwhile, uses Belarus as a staging ground for its invasion. At the border near the town of Polowce, a 5.5-meter (18-foot) steel barrier strung with razor wire and topped by security cameras separates once-friendly communities that war has turned into wary rivals. Drones, helicopters and armored vehicles keep watch. The border crossing is closed. Around 40 border guards and troops could be seen on Jan. 16, when the Polish EU presidency invited 60 reporters from international media to witness the security effort. The road was strewn with layers of concrete obstacles and concertina wire likely to dissuade an advancing army. Border guards peered into Belarus. It ́s needed, the government in Warsaw says, because Russia and Belarus are waging a particular kind of hybrid warfare: helping groups of migrants – mostly from Africa or the Middle East – to break through the border to provoke and destabilize Poland and the rest of Europe. ""We have tightened our visa policy, and above all we have decided to suspend the right to asylum wherever we are dealing with mass border crossings organized by Belarus and Russia,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters on Friday. Almost 30,000 attempted border crossings were spotted last year. Most are young men, often from Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. Polish authorities say they arrive in Belarus on tourist or student visas and are helped across for a fee ranging from $8,000 to $12,000. Poland says they ́re assisted by the Belarus security services and other ""organizers."" They're mostly Ukrainians, perhaps fallen on hard times since fleeing the war. They can earn $500 for each person they help, border officials say. Border guards claim to be routinely attacked. One guard was killed last year and several injured. They say that migrants shoot slingshots, throw small explosives or rocks, or use pepper spray on guards. More than 400 incidents were recorded last year in this section of the border, with 307 people hospitalized. The deputy commander of the Podlaski border guard division, Col. Andrzej Stasiulewicz, said the migrants are hard to discourage. ""Warning shots don ́t work, so force is needed,"" he said. Reporters were shown video and photos purported to show migrants assailing the border. Stasiulewicz said their actions are ""very unpredictable, and very precise and coordinated."" Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders paints a different picture. The charity says it's treated more than 400 people since November 2022, ""many of them stranded for weeks in uninhabitable forests and exposed to violent practices at the border."" People suffered from exhaustion, hypothermia, dehydration and mental health issues. Last year, it noted ""a sharp increase in people carrying the scars of physical assaults, including bruises and dog bites."" It ́s almost impossible to independently verify such reports. The area is off limits. NGOs and media must apply for a permit to enter. EU and international agencies that work with migrants are not invited either, although migrants are provided with their contact details should they want to complain. Stasiulewicz said those who force their way in ""are sent back to Belarus, which is in line with our legal framework."" The Norwegian Refugee Council, a migrant aid charity, has another take. It said that nearly 9,000 ""violent pushbacks "" have been reported by NGOs in what it describes as ""Europe ́s death zone"" since 2021. Pushbacks – depriving someone who may be in fear for their safety of their right to apply for asylum – are illegal under international law. Polish Undersecretary of State Maciej Duszczyk rejects the pushback allegations. He prefers ""turnbacks."" The rationale is that migrants are obliged to apply for asylum in good faith at open border points, not force their way in. The nearest place they can do that is in Terespol, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Polowce. As far as the Polish authorities are concerned, their methods are working. The number of people arriving in Polowce has dropped significantly. Around 670 people applied for asylum there last year, and none to mid-January. The Office for Foreigners was empty when reporters visited. To keep numbers down, the government intends to suspend asylum applications in times of crisis. A draft law winding its way through parliament would see the border shut for 60 days if Warsaw suspects that migrants are being ""weaponized"" – should they approach the border in large groups, try to intimidate Polish officers or damage border infrastructure. ""If anyone uses violence against the border guards, we close the border,"" Duszczyk said. Doctors Without Borders says this could have ""dramatic consequences."" It ́s urged Poland ""to drastically change course of action"" and do all it can to protect migrants and refugees. But EU leaders signed off on Poland ́s actions at a summit last month. Countries on Europe ́s eastern flank received a greenlight to suspend the right to protection when they believe that Belarus and Russia are "" weaponizing"" migrants. Ultimately, security and migration policies are highly politicized. Tusk has been in power for more than a year but his party ́s candidate in a presidential election in May faces a strong challenge from a nationalist opponent. The EU shifted further right in June after elections to the European Parliament, with nationalists and populists shaking Europe ́s foundations, particularly in major powers France and Germany. Tusk believes that tough migration policy can win back voters. ""If we do not want to hand over these matters to radicals, extremists, populists, we must find the right answers so that no one in the world doubts that democratic states are able to effectively defend themselves against illegal migration,"" he said on Friday. He described the ""tough protection"" of borders as a ""sacred duty."" Poland ́s borders also make up the 27-nation EU ́s external frontier. For Tusk, his country ́s security is Europe ́s security. It's a similar argument made by Hungary's staunchly nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:08:03+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/poland-focusses-on-security-russian-hybrid-attacks-with-rotating-council-of-europe-presidency/
Trump Taps Space Force Vet Fired Under Biden in Parting Gift to AWOL Austin,"President-elect Donald Trump recently announced the appointment of Space Force veteran and former fighter pilot Matthew Lohmeier as Air Force under secretary the same day Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin left the building for the last time. Although the timing may have been a coincidence, the move highlights the massive change about to be ushered in at the Pentagon under incoming Trump administration. Lohmeier was fired from his job as a squadron commander in May 2021 under the Biden administration after he published a book in May of that year criticizing Marxism taking hold in the United States military and discussed it on a podcast. Lohmeier had said on the podcast, ""The diversity, inclusion and equity industry and the trainings we are receiving in the military ... is rooted in critical race theory, which is rooted in Marxism."" Lohmeier's comments put him directly at odds with the Biden administration's focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. He was fired by Space Force Command Commander Lt. Gen. Stephen Whiting — who is still in the position. Current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown was the chief of staff of the Air Force at the time Lohmeier was fired. Biden's defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, made diversity his top priority during the first year of his tenure. He appointed the department's first diversity, equity, and inclusion adviser, stood up a counter-extremism working group that seemed aimed at Trump-supporting conservatives, and eliminated restrictions on transgender individuals serving in the military. He also fired more than 8,000 troops who did not want to take the COVID vaccine — a move that effectively targeted many troops who opposed the vaccine based on religious or personal liberty concerns. Austin in a self-congratulatory move posted on social media of him leaving the building to a ""clap out"" — where Pentagon staff lined the halls as he walked out for the last time as defense secretary. Now, Lohmeier, an Air Force Academy graduate and former fighter pilot, will be in position to undo the woke policies in the Air Force that took root during the Obama administration and festered throughout the military under the radar since then. President Trump announced Lohmeier's appointment on Friday, posting on Truth Social: I am pleased to announce that Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeier will be the next United States Under Secretary of the Air Force. Matt is a former fighter pilot, and Space Force Squadron Commander, who has devoted his life to serving our Great Nation. He is a proud graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Matthew will work with the GREAT Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth, to end the devastating ""woke"" policies that have destroyed our Military, and make our Country STRONG AGAIN. Congratulations Matthew! Trump has vowed to fire woke generals, making their fates unclear. Defense Secretary Nominee Pete Hegseth — who is all but certain to be confirmed after locking down the minimum 50 votes in the Senate — said at his confirmation hearing after being asked whether Brown would be removed from his position. ""Every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders,"" he said. Hegseth has said his focus will be on restoring the focus on war fighting skills and standards, and get rid of the woke policies that has eroded the military's readiness.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T14:07:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-tap-space-force-veteran-fired-under-biden-in-parting-gift-to-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin/
'Vengeful': Euro Media Whips Itself Up For Trump Inauguration,"While Europe's politicians learnt their lesson from 2017 and appear to have decided to play nice in public with the incoming President Trump second term, the continent's legacy media feels no such restraint and morning-of-inauguration coverage is loaded with dire predictions, accusations, and even unfavourable comparisons to dictators. While the top story slots for Europe's newspapers on Monday morning were reserved for the news and images of the Israel hostage deal, as the morning ground on and the clock counted down to Trump-hour these stories were rapidly displaced with inauguration content, with many publications incapable or unwilling of hiding their content for the results of American democracy. In the United Kingdom, The Guardian sets the tone that could immediately be seen in left-liberal newspapers continent-wide, warning of the coming ""Vengeful second term"" and stating ""the United States was bracing for a new era of disruption and division"". Drawing meaning from the plan for Trump to be sworn in under the Capitol rotunda which featured on January 6th, 2021, the paper stated: ""Few imagined then that Trump, twice impeached and now a convicted criminal, would set foot inside the White House again. But over the weekend the 78-year-old revelled in his improbable political comeback with supporters of his Maga (Make America great again) movement."" Reviewing the feeling in Europe as a whole, the paper's Diplomatic editor noted the old continent is more hostile to Trump than most other regions worldwide — citing a recent global poll that found ""European anxiety about Donald Trump's return to the White House is not shared in much of the world"" — and stating: ""the foreboding is great"". Yet in the UK, as elsewhere in Europe, the publishers less aggressively opposed to Trump focussed more on procedure: the history of American presidential inaugurations, what to expect from the day ahead, and the timings of events. National newspaper of record The Times led with Trump's comments from the night before about executive orders and the coming golden age, stating: ""Trump vows to start destroying Biden's legacy within hours"". In France, which has a very well developed left-wing media ecosystem, Libération warns Trump is to be ""Revengeful and more uninhibited than ever"" in their lead, while Le Monde the editor's pick is an op-ed comparing once and future President Trump to Russia's Vladimir Putin. Conservative-leaning newspaper Le Figaro , meanwhile, carries a guest piece by a prominent French lawyer and essayist who states the age of ""democratic, open and universalist"" America is now comprehensively over, and that for the rest of this century the country is to develop ""oligarchic, protectionist and imperial"" characteristics. President Trump thinks and acts ""like Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin or Recep Erdogan"", he declares, stating President Trump is to build ""an imperial America that claims the same principles as the tyrannies and autocratic regimes of the 21st century"". In this view, European states must be content to be vassal states in the new American empire, or the European Union should respond by transforming itself into an imperial power in its own right to ""defend our sovereignty, our freedom and our civilization"". This is not an uncommon point of view in Europe on any day, never mind Trump's inauguration day: to turn the European Union, what was once merely a free trade area, into an armed and active empire is a matter of simple reflex for the progressive and globalist-minded of the continent. It is the default position for many in the capitals of Europe. In Poland, the liberal-leaning Wyborcza takes this view too, stating what doesn't kill Europe (Trump) will only serve to make it stronger (pan-European Federal superstate). Rzeczpospolita meanwhile publishes and absolute laundry list of everything the globalist class hates and fears about Trump, stating its view that while ""Democracy and the rule of law have been the glue of the free world for eighty years"", President Trump is working to ""extinguish the West"". German newspapers are just as blunt. The progressives at Die Tageszeitung (TAZ) refer airily to the Trump government as ""The Horror Clown and His Cabinet of Horrors"" and decry his supporters, as well as fans of Elon Musk, as fools who confuse success with competence, appearing to tacitly imply there is some moral superiority in being a highly technically competent failure. ""Many Europeans are looking forward to [the inauguration] with great trepidation"", reckons Tagespiegel , expressing its concern that ""Europe will pay the price for American dissatisfaction"".",Breitbart,2025-01-20T13:02:35+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/vengeful-second-term-european-legacy-media-whips-itself-up-over-trumps-inauguration-day/
"Biden Preemptively Pardons Milley, Fauci, and January 6 Committee Members","President Joe Biden preemptively pardoned former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Retired Gen. Mark Milley, Anthony Fauci, and members of the January 6 Committee — with just hours left in his administration. In a statement released Monday morning at 7 a.m. — just several hours before President-Elect Donald Trump's inauguration, the White House issued a statement from Biden touting them ""dedicated, selfless public servants."" He claimed he believed in the rule of law, but said, ""But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing."" House Oversight Committee Republicans reminded Americans that Biden also pardoned his son Hunter Biden — which the outgoing president had told the country he would not do: Joe Biden will be remembered for using his last few weeks in office to shield his son from the law and protect himself. Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) posted: ""Mark Milley might be pardoned but we will continue to explore ways to hold him accountable."" Biden's statement said in full: Our nation relies on dedicated, selfless public servants every day. They are the lifeblood of our democracy. Yet alarmingly, public servants have been subjected to ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties. In certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions, including General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, and the members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions. General Milley served our nation for more than 40 years, serving in multiple command and leadership posts and deploying to some of the most dangerous parts of the world to protect and defend democracy. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he guided our Armed Forces through complex global security threats and strengthened our existing alliances while forging new ones. For more than half a century, Dr. Fauci served our country. He saved countless lives by managing the government's response to pressing health crises, including HIV/AIDS, as well as the Ebola and Zika viruses. During his tenure as my Chief Medical Advisor, he helped the country tackle a once-in-a-century pandemic. The United States is safer and healthier because of him. On January 6, 2021, American democracy was tested when a mob of insurrectionists attacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn a fair and free election by force and violence. In light of the significance of that day, Congress established the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol to investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes of the insurrection. The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth. Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions. I believe in the rule of law, and I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics. But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing. Baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families. Even when individuals have done nothing wrong—and in fact have done the right thing—and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances. That is why I am exercising my authority under the Constitution to pardon General Mark A. Milley, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Members of Congress and staff who served on the Select Committee, and the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the Select Committee. The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense. Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:46:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/president-biden-preemptively-pardons-general-milley-anthony-fauci-and-january-6-committee-members/

Pope Francis Debuts on TikTok to Hawk New Autobiography,"ROME — Pope Francis made his debut on TikTok Sunday to promote his new autobiography, written with Italian journalist Carlo Musso for Mondadori. ""I would like to thank Mr. Carlo Musso who had the patience to help me remember so many things about my life,"" the pontiff said on the controversial Chinese social media platform in regard to his book titled Hope: The Autobiography . ""It is an autobiography, but for me autobiographies are to thank God for what he has done with my life,"" he said from the study of his Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. ""Ultimately, the real protagonist is the Lord who took me by the hand and led me forward."" On Sunday evening the pope appeared on Italy's number-one television talk show Che Tempo Che Fa (""What Weather We're Having""), during which he also spoke of his autobiography with host Fabio Fazio. The book ""gives a sense of what I am like,"" Francis said. The pope has suffered criticism from conservatives for doubling down in the autobiography on his decision to ban the Traditional Latin Mass (TLM) in Catholic parishes, specifically lamenting its appeal to the ""younger generations."" The ""rigidity"" of those who prefer the Traditional Latin Mass ""is often accompanied by elegant and costly tailoring, lace, fancy trimmings, rochets. Not a taste for tradition but clerical ostentation, which is none other than an ecclesiastical version of individualism"" the pope declares. ""These ways of dressing up sometimes conceal mental imbalance, emotional deviation, behavioral difficulties,"" he continues. ""Not a return to the sacred but to quite the opposite, to sectarian worldliness,"" he adds. As one review noted , the pope comes close to ""conflating a love of the Old Mass with psychosexual disorder"" and to ""equating liturgical conservatism with effeminacy."" The pope's de facto ban on the TLM was also sharply criticized by a number of high-ranking Catholic prelates, including Cardinal Gerhard Müller, the former chief of the Vatican's doctrinal office (CDF), Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen, and Cardinal Raymond Burke, former head of the Vatican's highest court. Cardinal Müller rebuked Pope Francis for his severe clampdown on the TLM while allowing progressives to reject central tenets of the faith with impunity. Pope Francis has ""drastically restricted"" the celebration of the Latin Mass with the clear intent to ""condemn the Extraordinary Form to extinction in the long run,"" Müller stated. By punishing the conservative peripheries, Francis ""ignores the religious feelings of the (often young) participants in the Masses according to the Missal of John XXIII"" without the ""slightest empathy,"" he wrote. ""Instead of appreciating the smell of the sheep, the shepherd here hits them hard with his crook,"" Müller declared, with an allusion to one of Francis' favorite sayings. Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former bishop of Hong Kong, similarly insisted that the measures were unreasonably harsh and hurt ""the hearts of many good people."" The pope's attack on the TLM ""considers the very existence of a parallel rite to be an evil,"" Zen declared, and reflects wishes ""for the death of the [traditional] groups."" Cardinal Burke published an essay bemoaning the pope's attack on conservative Catholics. Those who are attached to the Traditional Latin Mass ""are deeply disheartened by the severity of the discipline"" imposed by Pope Francis in his letter and ""offended by the language it employs to describe them, their attitudes and their conduct,"" Burke wrote. ""It is apparent from the severity of the document,"" Burke said, that Pope Francis issued it ""to address what he perceives to be a grave evil threatening the unity of the Church."" The pope's message to the ""devout faithful who have a deep appreciation and attachment"" to the Traditional Latin Mass is that ""they suffer from an aberration which can be tolerated for a time but must ultimately be eradicated,"" Burke declared.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:09:03+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/20/pope-francis-debuts-on-tiktok-to-hawk-new-autobiography/
Nelly Says 'It's an Honor' to Perform at Trump's Inauguration in Response to Backlash: 'The Klan Was Created by the Democrats',"Rapper Nelly has defended his decision to perform at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, calling it ""an honor."" Nelly said in an often contentious interview with fellow rapper Willie D that he will be performing at the Liberty Ball on Monday out of respect for the office of the president. ""I'm not doing this for money. I'm doing this 'cause it's an honor. I respect the office,"" Nelly said. ""It don't matter who is in office. The same way that our men and women, our brothers and sisters who protect this country, have to go to war and have to put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office."" ""So, if they can put their life on the line for whoever [is] in office, I can damn sure perform for whoever [is] in office,"" he added. ""I was born on military base in Austin. My father served. My grandfather served. My uncle served. My auntie served. My cousins served. I've entertainment the troops all over the world. Ain't no money in that. That's something that I felt I had to do because I was one of those kids on those military bases, "" Nelly added. Nelly also dismissed the idea of Trump being a white supremacist. ""I would ask them to show me where he's a white supremacist,"" Nelly said. ""The politics, for me, is over. He won! He's the president. He's the commander in chief of what I would like to say is the best country in the world."" ""It is an honor for me to perform for the president of the United States, regardless of who is in office. If President Biden would've asked me to perform, I would've performed. If Vice President Kamala Harris would've won and asked me to perform, I would've performed,"" he added. The Grammy-winner also criticized Biden and Democrats, saying it was racist when Biden told radio host Charlamagne da God ""you ain't black"" if you vote for Trump. The conversation later changed when host Willie D called America a ""Klan country."" ""That was created by the Democrats. The Klan was created by the Democrats,"" Nelly said, a historic point to which Willie D conceded. ""If you tell me this a Klan country. I ask you what party did the Klan come from. All the damage the Klan did, in the 20s, the 30s, the 40s, ... all the damage that they did — but that party — we supposed to forgive all of that damage?"" Country artist Carrie Underwood will also be performing at the event along with Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus and Lee Greenwood. ""I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,"" Underwood said in a statement. ""I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T12:00:24+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/20/rapper-nelly-defends-performing-at-trumps-inauguration-its-an-honor/
Senior UK Royals Plan Tour of America Under Trump for Soft-Power Push,"Senior members of the British Royal Family are reportedly planning on touring the United States during the incoming Trump administration in a bid to improve relations. According to a report from The Times of London , yet-to-be-named top members of the British Royal Family are starting to plan trips to America as early as 2026. The Labour Party government in the UK of Sir Kier Starmer got off to a rough start with the incoming administration, with the leftist party dispatching operatives and activists to the United States to aid the Kamala Harris campaign. This came on top of a long history of Labour cabinet members frequently disparaging President Trump, including Britain's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who previously described the American leader as a ""woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathising sociopath"" and a ""dangerous clown"". Even the appointed ambassador to Washington, former Tony Blair communications director Peter 'Prince of Darkness' Mandelson, called President Trump a ""little short of a white nationalist and racist."" However, the Labour Party government, including Lammy and Mandelson, have attempted to soften their rhetoric around Trump as Britain will seek to avoid tariffs and still hopes to ink a post-Brexit trade deal with America. While the leftists that staff the Labour government may not be to the taste of the 47th President, Mr Trump has long been a vocal admirer of the British Royal Family and has often highlighted his own British heritage, with his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump hailing from the Isle of Lewis. Therefore, London may seek to use the Royals as a go-between and as soft-power negotiators to sway Trump once again to elevate the UK-U.S. relationship above others in Europe. According to The Times , Royal trips to America will likely coincide with the 250th anniversary of America's founding, during which President Trump promised year-long festivities. A senior UK government source told the paper: ""Donald Trump has a clear affinity for the royal family. ""He had a great relationship with the late Queen, recently met Prince William and has spoken highly of King Charles. A royal tour to the US would help reinforce the 'special relationship'."" Indeed, Prince William was one of the first international figures to meet with Trump following his re-election, meeting in private with the president-elect on the sidelines of the re-opening of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris last month.

Pope Francis: Trump's Illegal Immigrant Deportation Plan Is a ‘Disgrace’,"ROME — Pope Francis has trolled President-elect Donald Trump on the eve of his inauguration, insisting his plan to deport illegal immigrants from the United States is a ""disgrace."" Appearing on Italian national television Sunday night, the pontiff was asked about Mr. Trump's deportation plan and answered that ""this is not the way to solve things."" During a 49-minute interview, Fabio Fazio, the host of Che Tempo Che Fa (""What Weather We're Having""), recalled that Monday would be the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who has made it known that ""within two days he will begin his program of expulsion of irregular immigrants from the United States."" Asked whether he had spoken to Trump about this, the pope made known that he hasn't spoken with the president-elect since he came to the Vatican in May 2017, suggesting that he had not congratulated him on his election. ""But if it's true, this will be a disgrace, because it makes these poor wretches, who have nothing, pay the price for the imbalance,"" Francis said of the deportation plan. ""This isn't right. This is not the way to solve things."" On January 9, Pope Francis declared that migrants should not be treated as a ""problem to me managed"" but should be ""welcomed"" for their skills and aspirations. ""I find it greatly disheartening to see that migration is still shrouded in a dark cloud of mistrust, rather than being seen as a source of empowerment,"" the pontiff said in his yearly address to members of the diplomatic corps. ""People on the move are seen simply as a problem to be managed,"" he lamented, insisting that they should not be ""treated like objects to be moved about."" Migrants ""have dignity and resources that they can offer to others; they have their own experiences, needs, fears, aspirations, dreams, skills and talents,"" he said. What is needed is an international effort to confront the phenomenon of migration by creating ""safe regular pathways,"" the pope urged. At the same time, the Vatican recently announced the tightening of its own border controls, threatening stiff penalties for anyone entering its territory or violating its airspace without permission. In a recent decree, the Vatican said that violators of its borders will face monetary fines ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 euros and prison sentences from one to four years. Anyone who ""enters the territory of Vatican City State with violence, threat, or deception will be punished with imprisonment from one year to four years and a fine from €10,000.00 to €25,000.00,"" the Italian-language text reads. The document goes on to clarify its understanding of ""deception,"" noting that it includes sneaking into Vatican territory without permission. ""Entry by fraudulent circumvention of the State's security and protection systems or by evading border controls shall be deemed to have occurred 'by deception,'"" the decree elucidates. The Vatican City State is the world's only completely walled-in sovereign territory, whose entry points are manned by members of the Swiss Guard, backed up by armed gendarmes not far away. All but one of the entry points are locked tight from dusk until dawn.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T10:09:33+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/20/pope-francis-trumps-illegal-immigrant-deportation-plan-is-a-disgrace/
'He's Back' -- TIME Magazine Salutes Donald Trump's Triumphant Return,"Out with the (very) old, in with the new. TIME magazine has saluted President Donald Trump by putting him on the cover of it latest edition in honor of his return to the epicenter of public life in America. Of course, there is no shortage of his supporters who would argue he never really left. Trump is seen clearing President Joe Biden's belongings from the desk in the Oval Office with a single sweep of his arm in the inauguration edition while sending the octogenarian's aviator glasses flying into oblivion at the same time. The image comes with the simple honorific: ""He's Back."" The magazine previewed the new cover in a post on X on Sunday, touting its story titled ""Donald Trump's Disruption is back."" The illustrated TIME cover is the fourth for the magazine by artist Tim O'Brien, who has previously depicted Trump either seated at or floating above the famous resolute desk, as the NY Post notes . The article calls the incoming 47th commander-in-chief ""an unpredictable force for change"" and concedes, ""Whatever one thinks of him, he has altered America in ways unimaginable a decade ago."" In December, the magazine named Trump its annual ""Person of the Year."" That effort drew sneers, disbelief and canceled subscriptions from readers who supported Vice President Kamala Harris in the election a few weeks earlier, as Breitbart News reported . RELATED: We Are SO Back! Trump Gives Remarks After Being Named Time's 2024 ""Person of the Year"" Trump was named TIME magazine's Perso n of the Year in 2016, as well, after his upset victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. TIME magazine's tradition – which started in 1927 as ""Man of the Year"" – recognises a person or movement that ""has done the most to influence the events of the year"".

Historic: Trump Will Be First President to Host Foreign Leaders at Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday will feature multiple heads of foreign governments among the dozens of VIP guests expected to attend, a first in American history. Most of the world leaders expected, many of them already attending events this weekend in Washington, are from the Spanish-speaking Western Hemisphere and are outspoken anti-communist leaders. They will be accompanied by high-level representatives of other countries that will not be sending their presidents, such as Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. The Associated Press confirmed this weekend that Trump's will be the first inauguration ceremony attended by any foreign head of state. The swearing-in ceremony is part of a varied, days-long itinerary of events that began on Saturday with a reception for the president, continued with a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Sunday, and on Monday will feature a parade and the traditional inaugural ball. In between the daytime festivities and the inaugural ball, Trump will have an opportunity to engage in some presidential business. Reports indicate that he is considering signing as many as 200 executive orders on Monday, many to reverse the policies of leftist predecessor Joe Biden. Biden and all other living American presidents – Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush – are expected to attend. The first world leader to meet with Trump after his electoral victory in November, Argentine President Javier Milei, has been touring Washington throughout the weekend and is expected at the inauguration. Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa, currently running for reelection amid a chaotic gang war, also reportedly accepted the invitation to attend. Paraguayan President Santiago Peña arrived in Washington, DC, this weekend, as well, stating in an interview that the State Department team led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) Trump has assembled is a ""dream come true"" for his country. Trump reportedly invited Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to attend the inauguration; reports remain unclear regarding whether he would attend or not. Bukele has not addressed the invitation in public at press time; he posted a cryptic photo of himself on social media on Sunday night that led to further inconclusive speculation about his attendance. Outside of Latin America, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, often described as an ideological ally to Trump, has confirmed that she is planning to attend the inauguration. Reports indicate that President-elect Trump also invited genocidal dictator Xi Jinping to attend the ceremony and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Both declined, but Xi sent his vice president, Han, who will be the highest ranking Chinese official in history to attend an American inauguration. Xi also held a phone call with Trump on Friday that the president-elect said was ""very good"" and would ""solve many problems."" Modi dispatched his top diplomat, Foreign Minister Jaishankar, who was also seen out and about in Washington this weekend meeting with other inauguration guests. Jaishankar held a meeting on Sunday with his Australian and Japanese counterparts, the foreign ministers Penny Wong and Takeshi Iwaya respectively, which he described only vaguely as featuring a ""discussion on the state of the world."" On the guest list but unable to attend is another prominent conservative leader in the Western Hemisphere: Brazilian former President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro and Trump maintained an extraordinarily friendly relationship when both were in office and, Bolsonaro recently noted, share the bond of both surviving assassination attempts. Bolsonaro is facing several legal cases at home in Brazil that have resulted in the socialist government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva seizing his passport, branding him a ""flight risk."" Bolsonaro requested a special approval to travel to the United States for the inauguration, noting that he left the country to attend Milei's inauguration in 2023, but the Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF) rejected his requests on the grounds that the email invitation he received was somehow insufficient proof he was invited. Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker in Brazil, is expected to attend the inauguration and spent the weekend meeting with Milei and other conservative leaders in anticipation of the event. Other prominent conservative leaders from around the world are expected to be in attendance, including longtime Trump ally Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom and the head of the populist Spanish party Vox, Santiago Abascal. Abascal shared an ebullient moment at a pre-inauguration event with Milei, who elbowed through a crowd to embrace him. Trump ended the last day before his second term in office with what many believe could be his last political rally in Washington, DC – an event to thank supporters and celebrate the electoral victory a final time. In his remarks on Sunday, Trump promised supporters they were ""going to have a lot of fun watching television tomorrow"" while he repealed ""every radical and foolish executive order of the Biden administration ... within hours."" He promised a special emphasis on eradicating ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" (DEI) provisions in the federal government.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T05:48:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/historic-trump-first-president-host-foreign-leaders-inauguration/
Report: Trump to Snip Transgenderism Out of Federal Government on Day One,"President Donald Trump will remove transgenderism — root-and-branch — from the U.S. federal government via an Executive Order, likely on his first day, according to a report in FreePress.com. The action will implement the preferences of many millions of American citizens, including some who voted on election day just to win this valuable prize. TheFreePress.com reported that the order — titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"" — will ensure that: All radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms are removed. Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination. ""Woman"" means an ""adult human female."" The Executive Order directs that Government identification like passports and personnel records will reflect biological reality and not self-assessed gender identity. The order also suggests that Trump's Department of Justice will legally defend Americans who oppose the workplace use of transgender-style pronouns. The win is a huge victory for the many women and men who organized and fought against the transgender ideology. The winners include the many young women who defied peer pressure to ""detransition"" from the ideology, British author JK Rowling, and Riley Gaines, a swimmer who was required to compete against a man — Lia Thomas –in a women's competition at university. Gaines helped turn that 2022 sports defeat into a political victory. Many reporters at Breitbart News charted the debate closely and wrote more than 4,000 articles on the topic since 2008 . Trump's Executive Order order is likely to be very popular, according to data in an Ipsos poll conducted in early January. The poll showed that 77 percent of Republicans, and 49 percent of Americans, agree that ""Society has gone too far in accommodating transgender people."" Only 23 percent of Americans, and just 37 percent of Democrats, say society has not gone far enough. Twenty-eight percent of Americans said, ""Society has reached a reasonable balance when it comes to accommodating transgender people."" Ipsos The poll also showed that 79 percent of Americans — and 94 percent of Republicans — say male athletes should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. Only 18 percent said men should be allowed into women's sports. The FreePress report said officials would also crack down on transgender-related medical treatment of children. The poll showed that 71 percent of Americans — and 90 percent of Republicans — said doctors should not be allowed to prescribe ""puberty-blocking drugs or hormone therapy to minors between the ages of 10 and 18."" Stephen Miller: ""There are men and there are women. And it's not up to you whether you're a man or a woman. That's a decision that's made by God and it can't be changed."" [image or embed] — Aaron Rupar ( @atrupar.com ) January 19, 2025 at 4:26 PM Trump's election — and similar polls — may push transgenderism ideology to the margins of society and the media. The ideology says the government should force Americans to treat particular men — or teenagers — as if they are women whenever the man or teenager says he is transgender. In contrast, Americans have built their laws, social norms, and civic expectations on the recognition that the two biological sexes are equal, different, competing, and complementary. However, the Democratic Party coalition of the diverse includes a strong base of pro-transgender donors — and one new representative who insists he is a woman. The representative — Rep. Sarah McBride (D-DE) — was just given a leading role in setting policy within the Democrats' House caucus.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T05:01:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/report-trump-excise-transgenderism-federal-government-day-one/

GOP Demands Investigation of CDC for Funding 21 Abortions Overseas,"Republican lawmakers are demanding an investigation into Biden's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for allegedly illegally using U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay for at least 21 abortions in Mozambique through PEPFAR (the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). ""Frankly, it's not a surprise to find that they are performing abortion with U.S. taxpayer dollars,"" said Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Security and Diplomacy Bureau. ""Their denials over the years have rung hollow in the face of their aggressive promotion of abortion and collaboration with some of the largest international abortion providers."" ""The CDC's actions are a direct violation of both the letter and spirit of the law. It is unacceptable for our government to use PEPFAR's taxpayer dollars to promote or provide abortion, especially in a program meant to save lives from HIV/AIDS,"" Smith added. Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, confirmed on Thursday that the CDC recently disclosed that PEPFAR funds were used to pay health workers who performed at least 21 abortions and accused the CDC of violating the Helms Amendment, a policy which prohibits the use of U.S. foreign aid to pay for abortions abroad. ""It is disgusting that the Biden Administration has allowed U.S. taxpayer dollars to be used to perform abortions overseas. This is not only illegal – it cuts against deeply held American values,"" Risch said in a statement. ""The CDC must be investigated for its misuse of PEPFAR funds, and those who have violated long-standing U.S. laws that protect life must be held accountable. This violation means that the future of the PEPFAR program is certainly in jeopardy. I will not support one dollar of American money going towards abortion anywhere in the world, and I will do all I can to ensure this never happens again."" ""For 20 years, PEPFAR has been a global health issue with deep bipartisan agreement and respect for life, but the actions of the CDC have polarized and destroyed this bipartisan foundation. Whether CDC staff were being overly zealous, stupid, evil, or inept, they have violated the law and done a disservice to the country and those suffering from AIDS worldwide,"" he added. PEPFAR was created in 2003 under President George W. Bush has ""invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response, saving 25 million lives, preventing millions of HIV infections, and supporting several countries to achieve HIV epidemic control...,"" according to the State Department. While abortion is legal in Mozambique, a review of service providers in the country who receive PEPFAR funding revealed that four nurses had performed at least 21 abortions since January 2021, Reuters reported , citing three U.S. officials who briefed members of Congress this week. Officials alleged that this is the first time they have discovered PEPFAR-funded providers performing abortions in the program's history. ""That's why we wanted to notify Congress right away,"" said one of the officials, who is involved in administering PEPFAR at the State Department. ""It also is an important indication that the compliance measures we have in place have been effective, but could be further strengthened."" A State Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly allegedly told Politico that the CDC worked with the Mozambique Ministry of Health to investigate the abortions and see if there had been a violation of the law. The investigation revealed that four nurses operating in a small province of the country allegedly were unaware that they were not allowed to perform abortions while receiving PEPFAR funding, the official said. A CDC spokesperson told the outlet the Mozambique government refunded the money, $4,100, with the spokesperson noting that the agency spends $189 million in PEPFAR funds in Mozambique. ""CDC identified the error, took immediate action, has a plan in place to prevent it from happening again and briefed relevant committees,"" the CDC spokesperson said. The State Department told the outlet that PEPFAR will begin requiring every service provider to state annually that they have received training and understand the rules around receiving PEPFAR funding. The revelation comes less than three months before PEPFAR is up for reauthorization. Up until 2023, Congress had typically granted five-year reauthorizations to the program, however, it was renewed for only one year last March after Congressional Republicans sounded the alarm on the Biden administration trying to use the program to push for abortions abroad — mostly in Africa. At the time, Rep. Smith warned that Biden had "" brazenly hijacked this foreign aid program"" in 2022 by changing PEPFAR's strategic plan to include abortion promotion in its HIV/AIDS projects. PEPFAR's Regional Operational Plan Guidance for 2023 also stated that the program worked with ""organizations advocating for structural, systemic, and institutional reforms in law and policy regarding sexual, reproductive, and economic rights of women."" Smith further alleged that millions of dollars in PEPFAR funding under Biden had been given to organizations with a record of pushing abortions and lobbying to end pro-life laws abroad. READ MORE – GOP Congressman: Biden Admin Has ""Brazenly Hijacked"" AIDS Program to Push Abortion in Africa Smith was not alone in sounding the alarm. In May 2023, pro-life and conservative organizations wrote a letter to lawmakers asking them to remove any possibility of PEPFAR funding or promoting abortion abroad. ""We are concerned that grants from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) are used by nongovernmental organizations that promote abortions and push a radical gender ideology abroad. We urge you to ensure that any reauthorization of PEPFAR ensures that taxpayer money is not used for such purposes,"" the letter reads . In June 2023, 139 African parliamentarians also sent a letter to Congress stating they have ""concerns and suspicions that this funding is supporting so-called family planning and reproductive health principles and practices, including abortion, that violate our core beliefs concerning life, family, and religion.""",Breitbart,2025-01-20T03:46:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/gop-demands-investigation-bidens-cdc-taxpayer-funding-21-abortions-overseas/
Trump to Visit California Friday; Breitbart News Leads Coverage of Wildfires,"President-elect Donald Trump told tens of thousands of supporters at a rally in Washington, DC, on the eve of his Inauguration on Sunday that he intends to devote his first presidential visit to the California wildfires on Friday.

Trump to Sign over 200 Executive Orders on Day One -- Just Like 'The Agenda',"President-elect Donald Trump is preparing to sign over 200 executive orders as soon as he reaches the Oval Office after Inauguration — just as Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel B. Pollak suggested in his book, The Agenda . In The Agenda: What Trump Should Do in His First 100 Days , Pollak suggests over 200 executive orders, actions, and memoranda to launch Trump's policies and overwhelm Democratic Party attempts at ""lawfare"" to stop them. In August, he wrote: ""I have a new book coming out August 20. It's called The Agenda: What Trump Should Do in His First 100 Days . In it, I lay out over 200 suggestions for executive orders, executive actions, policy changes, and memoranda that President Trump can adopt immediately upon taking office."" Pollak wrote in November: ""[T]his author has recommended over 200 executive orders, actions, and policies that Trump should enact in his first 100 days, given that the media will portray him as a ""lame duck"" who cannot run again, and given past difficulties in passing his agenda through Congress, even in 2017-18, when — as in 2025 — Republicans control both chambers."" And Breitbart News' Wendell Husebø wrote in December: ""Breitbart News published a list of ten executive orders that Trump could issue on his first day.

Texas Man Pleads Guilty to Vandalizing Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers,"A Texas man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to vandalizing pregnancy centers in May of 2022 in response to the leaked Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade . Ethan Skorick, 23, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a press release. On May 7, 2022, Skorick intentionally damaged the properties of Loreto House and Woman to Woman pro-life pregnancy resource centers located in Denton, Texas. He vandalized the buildings with words including ""NOT A CLINIC,"" ""FORCED BIRTH IS MURDER,"" and ""PRO BIRTH [does not equal] PRO LIFE,"" and defaced the clinics security cameras with spray paint, according to court documents. Loreto House Between 3 and 3:10 a.m. Saturday, an unknown subject spray painted the building, sign, and three cameras at Loreto House in the 1100 block of Bonnie Brae Street. If you have information regarding the suspect in the video or information related to this incident, please contact Denton County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-388-8477 or www.dentoncountycrimestoppers.com. Posted by City of Denton Police Department on Wednesday, May 11, 2022 Skorick said he vandalized the pro-life pregnancy centers because ""both facilities provide reproductive health services that I opposed,"" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported , citing his statements from court documents. ""I was angered by the United States Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , which previously provided Constitutional protections for abortion services,"" he said, according to court documents. Crisis pregnancy centers notably offer support to pregnant women in need who choose life for their unborn children, including providing free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, medical exams, parenting classes, items like food, diapers, clothing, and financial assistance for housing. Many pro-life pregnancy centers also help women after their babies are born. RELATED: Fourth Pro-Abortion Activist Convicted in Florida Pregnancy Center Vandalisms ""This defendant sought to prevent fellow citizens from exercising rights protected by law,"" said U.S. Attorney Damien M. Diggs for the Eastern District of Texas. ""People cannot resort to destroying property in an effort to intimidate or prevent others from engaging in lawful activity simply because they disagree with the law. This office will remain dedicated to protecting the rights of all Americans to safely access medical services and ensuring providers can perform their duties freely."" Skorick faces up to one year in prison and up to $100,000 in fines, according to court documents cited by the Star-Telegram. The FACE Act was signed into law in 1994 by then-President Bill Clinton and prohibits ""violent, threatening, damaging, and obstructive conduct intended to injure, intimidate, or interfere with the right to seek, obtain, or provide reproductive health services."" The FACE Act has been a flashpoint in the abortion debate during the Biden administration, with the DOJ using the law to almost explicitly go after pro-life advocates who peacefully protest at abortion clinics. While the law was written to equally protect abortion clinics, pro-life pregnancy resource centers, and churches, 97 percent of FACE Act cases since the law's inception have been against pro-life advocates. READ MORE – Explainer: DOJ Uses KKK-Era Charge to Extend Prison Time for Pro-Life Activists Data obtained by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) shows that in less than four years, Biden's DOJ has accounted for more than a quarter of all 211 FACE prosecutions. At least 55 FACE Act cases have been prosecuted during the Biden administration, and only a handful of those have been against pro-abortion activists, despite an increase in attacks against pro-life pregnancy centers and churches following the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturning Roe . Some Republicans have called the FACE Act unconstitutional and have proposed doing away with the law altogether in response to the Biden administration's apparent weaponization of it. Democrats reject that assessment, countering that the federal law is needed — on top of state laws — to dissuade protesters from engaging in violent behavior.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T02:30:36+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/texas-man-pleads-guilty-vandalizing-pro-life-pregnancy-centers/
"Trump Vows to End Biden's DEI Mandate, Return to 'Merit System'","President-elect Donald Trump said at his Make America Great Again rally on Sunday that he will end President Joe Biden's ""diversity, equity, and inclusion mandates"" in favor of a merit-based system. Trump detailed his plans at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, DC, after vowing to sign a slew of executive orders on day one that would reverse policies of the Biden administration. ""Every radical and foolish Executive Order of the Biden administration will be repealed within hours of when I take the oath of office. Oh, you're gonna have a lot of fun watching television tomorrow,"" Trump said. He then zoned in on Biden's ""diversity equity and inclusion mandate."" ""But we're going to stop the destructive and divisive Diversity Equity and Inclusion mandates all across government and private sector and return our country to the merit system,"" Trump declared. ""You know, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States is allowed to go by the merit system, which is what made us great in the first place,"" he added. ""That was a big, big ruling that a lot of people don't even know about, but that was a big, tremendous ruling."" Trump did not specify which ruling he was referring to, but it could be the Court's decision in 2023 to strike down affirmative action in college admissions. ""And you're focusing on character, competence, qualifications in all hiring decisions,"" Trump said. ""Now, you're allowed to go by competence, ability, and genius. You don't have to hire somebody to send up one of his rocket ships that doesn't know anything about what's happening."" Trump first vowed to eliminate DEI programs across the federal government in 2023 after the court's decision on affirmative action. His mandate election has led to a self-purge of DEI in the private sector and sent the Pentagon into what sources called ""absolute disarray"" as he aims to fire military leaders who pushed DEI, as Breitbart News Pentagon Correspondent Kristina Wong reported.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T02:01:16+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2025/01/19/trump-vows-end-bidens-dei-mandate-return-merit-system/
AOC Criticizes TikTok for Praising Trump's Efforts on Restoring TikTok,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized TikTok for praising President-elect Donald Trump for vowing to delay a ban on TikTok, stating that he is ""not president right now."" In stories on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez referenced a message that appeared on TikTok after the social media app was restored in the United States for Americans to access. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the app for praising Trump for calling for companies to not allow the app to remain dark, and for stating he would issue an Executive Order delaying a ban on the social media app. Ocasio-Cortez also criticized the app for calling Trump, ""President Trump,"" and pointed out that Trump ""is not president right now"" and is still ""a private citizen."" ""Welcome back! Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.,"" Ocasio-Cortez said as she read the message that appeared on TikTok. ""First of all, Donald Trump is not president right now. He is a private citizen. He does not have access to presidential powers, he does not have the ability to do any of that. So, please understand that TikTok's decision to name Trump in the notification is a choice. They are signaling that they are privately collaborating. They have agreed to privately collaborate with Donald Trump and the Trump administration."" Ocasio-Cortez added that TikTok deciding to thank Trump and call him ""President Trump,"" meant that ""every social media platform"" in the U.S. has been ""taken over by the right-wing."" ""What this effectively means is that every social media platform, mass social media platform in the United States, has been taken over by the right-wing,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""With the exception of Bluesky, but Bluesky's still very small — relatively. When I say put the pieces together, Elon Musk took over Twitter and there's open reporting. It's pretty obvious as well, that they have manipulated the algorithms, they've artificially manipulated the algorithms to boost right-wing content on X and to amplify harassment."" On Sunday, TikTok issued a statement that they were ""in the process of restoring"" access to American users after Trump had said he would delay a ban on TikTok. The statement came after Trump stated on Truth Social under his Executive Order, ""there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark."" ""I'm asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark,"" Trump wrote. ""I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order."" TikTok going dark in the U.S. came after a federal appeals court upheld the law requiring ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok to either sell the app or face a ban in the U.S. As a result, ByteDance had until January 19 to either sell Tiktok or face a ban, unless the president granted a 90-day extension.",Breitbart,2025-01-20T01:44:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/aoc-criticizes-tiktok-praising-trump-vowing-delay-ban-not-president-right-now/

We'll look at individual cases. But I'm going to be acting very quickly,"" Trump said.

Biden Grants Posthumous Pardon to Black Nationalist Marcus Garvey,"In his final full day in office, President Joe Biden has given a posthumous pardon to black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Referring to the pan-Africanist and racial separatist as a ""renowned civil rights and human rights leader,"" Biden said his 1923 conviction and subsequent five-year sentence was an ""injustice."" Born in 1887 in Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica, Garvey moved to the U.S. in 1916 before forming the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which aimed to ""establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa."" In 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud after advertising the sale of stocks in a boat for his shipping company, Black Star Line, which the business did not yet own. After being found guilty and sentenced to serve five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey's sentence in 1927, and deported him back to Jamaica. Biden's Sunday statement from the White House on Garvey's posthumous pardon is as follows: Marcus Mosiah Garvey (1887-1940) was a renowned civil rights and human rights leader who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927. Notably, Mr. Garvey created the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as ""the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement."" Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction. The outgoing president has set a new record for giving out the most individual pardons and commutations, announcing on Friday that he was commuting sentences for almost 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders. Biden also notably pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing a 17-year sentence after being convicted of tax and gun charges.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:42:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/law-and-order/2025/01/19/biden-grants-posthumous-pardon-to-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey/
Trump to Swear In with Personal Bible and Lincoln Bible During Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump will swear into office with two Bibles — one given to him by his mother, and one that President Abraham Lincoln used in his own inaugural ceremony in 1861.

Trump's Bible is a 1953 revised standard version, the outlet reported. He will also be sworn in with the historic Lincoln Bible, which was used by former President Barack Obama at both of his inaugurations and Trump at his first inauguration. ""It has only been used three times since, by President Obama at each of his inaugurations and by President Trump at his first inauguration in 2017,"" the Trump inaugural committee stated.

Poll: Most Americans One-Word Summary of Biden's Legacy Is 'Nothing',"Americans who participated in a recent poll appear to view President Joe Biden's (D) time in the White House as a big nothingburger. A poll conducted for the Daily Mail by J.L. Partners with some 1,009 registered voters asked how they would describe 82-year-old Biden's time in office, the Mail reported Sunday: When the results are arranged in a word cloud, the most common answer sticks out at the center. The next most popular answers are economy, inflation, and infrastructure, in a more encouraging nod to one of his landmark pieces of legislation. Yet the same word, 'nothing' stands out when the responses are split by political persuasion. ... When voters were asked whether they can remember a single Biden achievement, more than half say they cannot. Some 37 percent say they 'strongly' agree with the statement that they cannot name a single one. Social media users were quick to share their thoughts on the Mail 's report, one person writing , ""Worst President Ever. Good riddance."" ""Destroying the economy and enriching his family off of the American taxpayers,"" someone else commented , while another user replied ,""Hes wrecked our country and gotten dirty rich while doing it."" Meanwhile, a recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that ""border and immigration handling"" was named as Biden's biggest failure, per Breitbart News. ""The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels 'like a morgue' and 'glum' as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in,"" the article said. It is also important to note that Americas have been suffering under the grip of inflation during the Biden-Harris presidency. ""U.S. consumer prices climbed at a faster rate in December, capping off the inflation-plagued Biden administration's final year and suggesting that the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down inflation may have run out of steam,"" Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. In addition, Biden's health and ability to serve has also been questioned. In December, CBS News reporter Jan Crawford claimed that Biden's ""obvious cognitive decline"" was the most underreported story in 2024, per Breitbart News.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:51:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-one-word-summary-president-joe-bidens-legacy-nothing/

"Jon Voight, Matt Boyle, James O'Keefe Tribute Andrew Breitbart","WASHINGTON, DC – Award recipients, ranging from actor Jon Voight to Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle, praised Andrew Breitbart during the Patriot Awards on Saturday, underscoring the immeasurable scope of his legacy. After winning one of just a handful of Patriot Awards, which recognize individual contributions to the MAGA movement, Voight gave a nod to Breitbart in his remarks. He recalled meeting Breitbart at a small gathering of conservatives in Hollywood years ago. WATCH — Actor Jon Voight Remembers Andrew Breitbart at Patriot Awards: ""I Loved Him"": ""I saw Andrew Breitbart, and I'm sitting there next to Gary Sinise and I'm saying, 'Gary, this guy's got it. He's amazing,'"" Voight recalled. Voight reminisced about his conversation with Breitbart after the event. ""I said, 'Andrew, you're a special guy.' I said, you know, 'What are you going to do with that energy?' And I was saying to him that, you know, 'I say a few things, I'm not as open as some people, but I say a few things — I'm not afraid to get in the game a little bit,'"" Voight recalled. ""And he said to me, 'Jon, I can't wait. I can't wait to get into their faces.'"" ""I said, 'Oh, this guy's dangerous,'"" he added, drawing laughs. ""And then I saw what he did with that energy. He did confront everything. He said these most wonderful things."" As one Voight pointed to Breitbart's famous standoff with Occupy protesters, telling them to ""behave"" themselves and to ""stop raping people!"" ""He got up in front of them, and they would shout him down and try to shout him down, and the press was there, right? So he knew what to do with the press,"" Voight said. ""He stood up and stood in front of these people, he went right to them, and he said, 'Stop raping! Stop raping!' He said it like 15 times, and that was it. That was the way the message got across to people that these people were perverse people, you see, bad people, criminals."" ""And anyway, he had this great imagination, and I loved him, and I spoke to him the day before he passed,"" Voight added. ""And he was he was attacked, you know, just like in the way our president was attacked, Rudy Giuliani was attacked, and all that, but he stood up. He was so beautiful, such a beautiful person."" Boyle also paid homage to Breitbart after being presented with his award. ""Andrew Breitbart always used to talk about how culture is upstream from politics and you have to win the culture war. Well, let me make it clear: the Presidential Inaugural Committee just announced that Nelly is performing at one of the inaugural balls on Monday night. Last night, we had Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Soulja Boy performing — not my cup of tea, but whatever. The point is — Rascal Flatts are performing at another one, Carrie Underwood is singing at the inauguration — we've won the culture war, guys,"" Boyle said, to applause. ""I will say, Andrew Breitbart would be so proud of where we are as a movement today; he was a really good friend of mine, and we have a very, very bright future ahead of us,"" he said to close out his remarks. ""So here in the heart of the establishment media's power, if you will, in Washington, DC, at the National Press Club, we declare: The establishment media, you are dead, and we're going to win this thing."" James O'Keefe, founder of O'Keefe Media Group, also honored Breitbart when he accepted his Patriot Award. ""So I'll keep this pretty short, but you know I appreciate this honor and Andrew Breitbart, there's so much to say, but way back when, because I've been doing this since I was in college, he used to say 'We are the media now' right? ' We are the media,'"" O'Keefe said after noting OMG broke a story last week leading to the firing of a Pentagon official. ""This week, you know, in an extraordinary series of events, the Pentagon fired this guy for, you know, he's an adviser to the Joint Chiefs; he's in meetings inside the Situation Room inside the Pentagon, and in an extraordinary series of events, not one single member of the DC press corps reported on it,"" O'Keefe added. ""So I think Andrew used to say this in so many words, but it's not that the legacy media is just merely not reporting news– n ow they're in the news suppression business. And stop complaining about the media. Understand that now you, me, we are the media."" The tributes come as the 13th anniversary of Breitbart's passing, March 1, 2025, approaches. The Patriot Awards, which are 18-inch bronze statues of Trump, resemble a larger-than-life two-story bronze statue of Trump, which Breitbart News first reported of in November as it neared completion. ""PATRIOT Founder Ashley Sansalone was responsible for the idea to create the statue and manages the construction and logistics of the project,"" event host Dustin Stockton told Breitbart News.

Poll: Most Americans Have Poor View of President Biden's Time in Office,"Citizens are not looking favorably on President Joe Biden's (D) time in office as President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration approaches. According to CBS News polling, ""When Americans look back now on Biden's presidency, 37% approve of the job he has done over the last four years. That is just below any approval mark he received while in office,"" the outlet reported Sunday. When Biden took office four years ago, most Americans felt optimistic about the job he would do. However, following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that left many service members dead, his approval rating took a dive and continued to drop as Americans suffered in the grip of inflation, and ""it never recovered,"" the article stated. Social media users shared their thoughts on the CBS News report, one person writing , ""And you did everything possible to cover for him. You're a joke."" ""Over the past four years you told us he was fit for office, reducing our debt, and bringing illegal workers across the border to help America. You have earn 'old media' tag which you will never shed. What you paid to play has earned you a walk in the media shadows,"" another user commented . Meanwhile, some members of the Democrat party are distancing themselves from claims that Biden was fit to serve, Breitbart News reported January 7. ""After Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July following a poor debate performance, Democrats claimed he was fit to serve,"" the outlet said. ""Now two weeks before Biden leaves office, a handful of Democrats are starting to trash the president and warn of accountability."" A recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that ""border and immigration handling"" were named as Biden's biggest failure as president, per Breitbart News. The news of Biden's decline in favorability comes as Trump prepares for his inauguration on Monday in Washington, DC, AFP reported Saturday. Per the CBS News report, ""This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,174 U.S. adults interviewed between January 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

"Actor, CNN Show Host Michael Ian Black Wants to 'Fu**ing Impeach' Trump Before He's Sworn In","Well, that didn't take long. Donald Trump has yet to take the oath of office at his second inauguration and Hollywood celebrities are already clamoring to run him out of office. Trump surprised fans and foes alike over the weekend when he announced the release of $TRUMP, his very own cryptocurrency. The meme coin's value is already surging as a feverish flood of buying sent its market capitalization through the roof on Saturday to several billion dollars. That's good news right? Not if you ask left-wing comedian Michael Ian Black. ""Fucking impeach him,"" Black wrote in a Bluesky screed. Fucking impeach him. [image or embed] — Michael Ian Black ( @michaelianblack.bsky.social ) January 18, 2025 at 3:21 PM If you didn't already know, Black wasn't rooting for Trump during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he was among the few people who thought Kamala Harris ""kick Trump's withered old ass"" during their one and only debate. Black, a co-captain on the CNN quiz show Have I Got News for You , was last seen on these pages embarrassing himself on the aforementioned CNN program for making false claims about a diplomatic success story Trump explained during the aforementioned debate. Black spent Trump's first term in office obsessing over nearly ever thing the president-elect did or said. He wrote an anti-Trump children's book and even advised reporters tell Trump to ""fuck off."" Black is already reeling again, so we can probably expect more of the same sad shrieks.

"Michael Rapaport Celebrates the Demise of 'Dirty, Biased, Damn Near Soft Porn Dumphole' TikTok","Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport celebrated the shuttering of Chinese-owned social media outlet TikTok, which went dark on Sunday in the wake of a ban put in place by an act of Congress. TikTok went dark on Sunday in compliance with the ban put in place by Congress and upheld on Friday by the U.S. Supreme court. Consequently, the site told users that it was shutting down in compliance on Sunday but also noted they were hoping to work with Donald Trump to resolve the issue. For Rapaport, TikTok's seeming demise was all good news. The Prison Break actor jumped to his account to celebrate TikTok's closure on Sunday, and called the Chinese-affiliated site a ""dumphole."" ""Say what you want about Elon & Zuckerberg at least we know where to find them,"" he said in his caption. ""TikTok, au revoir,"" he said emphatically in his video. ""You did it to yourself, TikTokers,"" he added. ""You can say what you want about Elon Musk, you can say what you want about [Mark] Zuckerberg,"" he continued, ""at least we have a face,"" he said of X and Facebook's owners. ""At least we have people to complain to, we can tweet at them, we can DM them, we can put our face on wax and scream and yell at them, we don't know who the fuck has been running this platform [TikTok]. This platform is dirty. This platform is biased. It's damn near soft porn on here."" ""I've seen some crazy shit on TikTok. You did it to yourselves, TikTok, you did it to yourself TikTokers!"" he exclaimed. ""Say what you want about Facebook, Instagram, X, Whatsapp, Snapchat, at least we know who's running the joint,"" he explained. ""We don't know what the fuck and who the fuck is doing what at TikTok. And the vile, antisemitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, soft porn, tits and ass, every fucking five seconds the weirdos, the creeps, the creep cock-suckers — bye bye TikTok, you did it to yourself, if this is signing off, farewell. You know where to find me, I'm on Instagram and X and Facebook."" ""See ya later assholes,"" he concluded with a beaming grin. Rapaport's glee may have been a bit premature, though, because only hours after shutting down, TikTok began restorting service after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push out an executive order in the social media outlet's favor after he is inaugurated.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T19:27:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/19/michael-rapaport-celebrates-the-demise-of-dirty-biased-damn-near-soft-porn-dumphole-tiktok/
German Ambassador Warns Trump Will Undermine 'Constitutional Order',"Germany's ambassador to the United States reportedly warned that Donald Trump's incoming administration will undermine ""basic democratic principles"" and seek a ""redefinition of the constitutional order."" While European leaders have been relatively muted in their response to the re-election of Donald Trump, particularly compared to the hysterical reaction to his victory in 2016, the panic has apparently merely been confined to backrooms rather than in public. According to Reuters, a confidential document briefing Berlin on the incoming administration signed by Ambassador to the U.S. Andreas Michaelis warned that the incoming administration would seek ""maximum disruption"" and usher in ""a redefinition of the constitutional order – maximum concentration of power with the president at the expense of Congress and the federal states."" ""Basic democratic principles and checks and balances will be largely undermined, the legislature, law enforcement and media will be robbed of their independence and misused as a political arm, Big Tech will be given co-governing power,"" the document reportedly added. The ambassador went on to warn that Trump would seek to weaponize the Department of Justice and the FBI against his political enemies and to help facilitate mass deportations. Michaelis suggested that the new administration could go so far as to launch a ""military deployment within the country for police activities would be possible in the event of declared 'insurrection' and 'invasion'."" Additionally, the German ambassador pointed to the supposed danger of Trump's alliance with X owner Elon Musk, who has become a nemesis of the political establishment in Berlin for backing the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the February elections. According to Michaelis, Trump and Musk may seek to enact a ""redefinition of the First Amendment,"" claiming that they intend to punish non-friendly media outlets. ""One is using lawsuits, threatening criminal prosecution and licence revocation, the other is having algorithms manipulated and accounts blocked,"" he claimed. It comes as the German Defence Ministry announced this week that it would no longer actively post on X, complaining that ""the factual exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult."" Berlin's Foreign Ministry refused to verify or comment on the leaked document but affirmed that it still considers the United States to be a key ally of Germany. ""The Americans chose President Trump in a democratic election. Of course, we will also work closely with the new U.S. administration in the interests of Germany and Europe,"" the ministry said . The opinion of the German ambassador may not matter for much longer anyway, with the leftist coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsing the day after Trump's victory, the governing Social Democrats look set to be removed from office following the February federal elections in Germany.

Dave Chappelle Wishes Trump the Best in ‘SNL’ Monologue: 'The Whole World Is Counting on You',"Dave Chappelle returned to the Saturday Night Live stage clad in a sharp suit, smoking a cigarette, and armed with an array of searing jokes touching on the presidential election, the Los Angeles wildfires, Sean Diddy Combs, and President-elect Donald Trump, whom the veteran comedian wished for success in his second term. ""The presidency is no place for petty people. So, Donald Trump, I know you watch the show. Remember, whether people voted for you or not, they're all counting on you,"" Chappelle said, after jokingly saying he knows Mr. Trump watches the show. ""Whether they like you or not, they're all counting on you. The whole world is counting on you."" ""I mean this when I say this: Good luck. Please, do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time,"" Chappelle continued. ""Do not forget your humanity. And please, have empathy for displaced people, whether they're in the Palisades or Palestine."" Those were the last lines of his nearly 20-minute monologue. Chappelle started his act by explaining how he initially told SNL creator Lorne Michaels he didn't want to host the first episode after the election, as he did in 2016 and in 2020. After repeatedly telling Michaels no, Chappelle said he had an epiphany: ""You know what? I could just get rid of all these old Trump jokes. I'll do it!"" he said, adding ""The moment I said yes, L.A. burst into flames!"" Chappelle, who lives in Ohio, one town over from Springfield (more on that later), noted how the deadly L.A. fires broke his heart. He also realized how the negative comments online lambasting the many celebrities who lost their homes reminded him why he hates poor people: ""Because they can't see past their own pain."" ""The other day on the news, they said these fires were the most expensive tragedy that ever happened in the United States' history. I think that's because people in L.A. have nice stuff. I could burn 40,000 acres in Mississippi for like six or seven dollars,"" Chappelle joked. ""If you were a rational, thinking person, you'd have to at least consider the possibility that God hates these people."" Chappelle later turned his attention to Trump and his comments about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, last year. ""Trump's a wild guy. He said the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's dogs and cats. I live one town over from Springfield. That's not what happened in Springfield at all,"" Chappelle said. He said he wanted to show his support to the Haitian immigrants to let them know they were welcome. ""Every day I'd drive over to Springfield and eat lunch at the Haitian restaurant,"" Chappelle said, pausing, ""And to be honest with you, I don't know what that meat was. But whatever it was, it fell right off the bone."" Chappelle said he realized in the worst way why he didn't know about Diddy's ""Freak Off"" orgy parties. ""Oh my god, I'm ugly! That's a tough way to find out,"" he joked. ""Can you imagine if you were me reading the newspaper finding out: everyone in Hollywood had an orgy behind your back?""

Google Defies EU's 'Fact-Checking' Requirements for Search and YouTube,"Google has informed the European Union that it will not integrate work from ""fact-checking"" organizations into its Search and YouTube platforms, as the EU prepares to expand its disinformation laws. The Verge reports that Google has notified the European Union that it will not comply with the bloc's upcoming requirements to integrate ""fact checking"" into its Search and YouTube services. The tech giant's decision comes as the EU is in the process of formalizing its voluntary disinformation commitments into law under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Google had previously signed the EU's set of voluntary commitments in 2022, which aimed to reduce the impact of online disinformation. However, in a letter addressed to the European Commission's content and technology czar Renate Nikolay, Google's global affairs president Kent Walker stated that the fact-checking requirement ""simply isn't appropriate or effective for our services."" Furthermore, Google plans to withdraw from all fact-checking commitments in the Code before the rules become law in the DSA Code of Conduct. The EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation currently requires signatories to collaborate with fact-checkers in all EU countries, make their work accessible to users in all EU languages, and reduce financial incentives for spreading disinformation on their platforms. The code also mandates companies to simplify the process for users to recognize, understand, and flag disinformation, as well as label political ads and analyze fake accounts, bots, and malicious deep fakes that spread disinformation. However, these commitments are not legally binding at present. Google's objection to the fact-checking requirements is not entirely unexpected, as the company has not included fact-checking as part of its content moderation practices thus far. In its agreement with the EU, Google had stated that ""Search and YouTube will endeavor to reach agreements with fact checking organizations in line with this measure, but services will not have complete control over this process."" While 40 online platforms have signed the code, including Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch, and Meta, the level of commitment to fulfilling the requirements has been inconsistent. Twitter (now X) initially signed the code but withdrew after Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform. The European Fact-Checking Standards Network has also noted that many of the other digital platforms that signed the voluntary disinformation code have been lax in fulfilling their commitments. The EU is currently in discussions with signatories to determine which commitments will be formalized into official rules under the DSA. It remains unclear whether all of the code's requirements will be included in the final legislation. The European Commission has yet to announce when the code will officially become law, having previously stated that it is expected to come into force by January 2025 ""at the earliest.""

Six People Shot in Six Hours in Brandon Johnson's Chicago,"Six people were shot during an approximate six-hour time-frame Saturday night into Sunday morning in Mayor Brandon Johnson's (D) Chicago. Chicago 32 reported the first two shooting victims were shot and wounded at 9:39 p.m. Saturday and the sixth victim was shot at 3:46 a.m. Sunday. The first two victims–men who are both 37-years-old–were sitting in a vehicle ""in the 5800 block of West Madison Street""–when someone opened fire on them then fled the scene. Both men were wounded with non-life-threatening wounds. Just before midnight Saturday, a 25-year-old woman and a man were traveling in a vehicle ""in the 2800 block of North Laramie Avenue"" when gunshots rang out. Both were shot and wounded, but the injuries are not life-threatening. Roughly two hours later, a 19-year-old was shot and left in serious condition following a verbal altercation with another individual. The altercation occurred in a parking garage ""in the 3100 block of North Central Avenue."" At 3:46 a.m. Sunday, a 41-year-old man was also shot following an altercation. He was hospitalized in fair condition.

NYT: L.A. Firefighters Took 20 Minutes to Respond to Palisades Fire,"Firefighters took 20 minutes to respond to the Palisades Fire on January 7, according to the New York Times , confirming what sources have told Breitbart News over the past two weeks about the city's poor reaction. Breitbart News learned from local neighbors that while there was a fire engine near the origin of the fire, due to a traffic accident, it took 20-25 minutes for a helicopter to arrive at the top of the mountain ridge above Pacific Palisades where the fire began, and 44 minutes for a full response by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters have told Breitbart News that they did not pre-deploy ahead of the fire, despite warnings of extreme winds, due to budget cuts by Mayor Karen Bass and the city council that discouraged the use of overtime pay for pre-deployment. The Times reported Saturday: The [ Times '] review showed a series of planning failures, delayed evacuations and significant shortfalls in firefighting resources that together hampered efforts to limit the spread. Fire dispatch transmissions suggest that firefighters did not arrive on scene until about 20 minutes after the first 911 call in Pacific Palisades, a possible missed chance to stamp out the blaze while it was still small, the review showed. Residents are still piecing together evidence about how the fire started. Many believe that it was caused by re-ignition of a burn scar from a fire caused by fireworks set off by hikers on New Year's Eve, though arson is also a possibility.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:26:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/nyt-l-a-firefighters-took-20-minutes-to-respond-to-palisades-fire/
Millionaires Flee UK in Record Numbers Since Left-Wing Labour's Election Win,"British millionaires are fleeing the country in record numbers since Sir Keir Starmer's left-wing Labour Party claimed last year's election win and set out in socialist fashion to try and tax the country into prosperity. Turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses has raised further concerns about Labour's punitive tax plans while moves to remove the non-domiciled tax regime that allows people to keep non-UK income in a foreign country, in exchange for a fee, is also being blamed. LBC reports some 10,800 people with liquid assets of over $1 million left the country in 2024, an increase of over 150 percent on 2023, in a move predicted not long after Starmer moved into Number 10 Downing Street. A total of 78 centi-millionaires (people with $100 million or more) and 12 billionaires departed the UK last year, according to New World Wealth, a research firm. The news, coming on the back of recent turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses, has raised further concerns about Labour's push to punish the rich will also hitting farmers, old age pensioners, and everyday taxpayers with a host of penalties. Millionaires are mostly moving to other European countries such as Switzerland and Italy, as well as to places such as the United Arab Emirates. Labour are getting rid of the non-dom regime from April, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would raise nearly £13 billion over five years. Over 70,000 people with non-dom status lived in the UK in 2023. An intense lobbying campaign from wealth advisors and representatives for non-dom's ensued in the run-up to the Autumn Budget, where the policy was announced. Experts warned it would lead to a ""tidal wave"" of departures. David Hawkins, of Foreign Investors for Britain, a group representing non-doms explained the Government's policy is ""a monumental act of national self-harm"". He said : ""It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It's a real worry because more and more people are leaving. And it's businesses, jobs, investment, spending into the economy and tax take and philanthropy that are hit.""

London Mayor Khan Warns of 'Resurgent Fascism' with Trump's Return,"Far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the ""spectre of a resurgent fascism"" threatens the West with the rise of populists in Europe, tech giants rolling back censorship, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The leftist Labour Party politician, writing for the Observer , the sister paper of the Guardian , likened the growing rejection of neo-liberal globalist policies in Europe and America to the rise of fascism in the ""1920s and 1930s"". ""The far right is on the march,"" Mayor Khan exclaimed. ""From Switzerland and Sweden to Hungary, Austria and Italy, European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism."" ""In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month's federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back,"" he lamented. The far-left mayor said that the rise of populist parties is ""deeply worrying... especially if you're a member of a minority community."" ""We should be in no doubt, this is a perilous moment. The spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the West,"" Khan declared. Khan went on to argue that the global left must do more ""to inoculate our societies against the virus of far-right populism. History shows us the time to act is now."" A major area of concern cited by the London mayor is social media, which he claimed is ""fuelling racist populism and polarisation."" Khan pointed to X owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk, whom he accused of using his social media platform as a ""propaganda tool to amplify lies and advance the cause of the far right."" He also lamented the decision by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to remove its so-called fact-checking apparatus in favour of an X-style community notes system, which he claimed was an act of bending the knee to the incoming Trump administration. Khan, who has long advocated using state power to crack down on speech, suggested that countries like the UK should use legislation such as the Online Safety Act to counteract the popularity of populist messages on social media. This act empowers the government to impose hefty fines of up to ten per cent of a large internet firm's global revenue if it fails to police so-called ""harmful content."" The London mayor has been a vocal critic of Trump, demanding in 2017, for example, that the then-president should be barred from having a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II over his supposed use of "" xenophobia, racism, and 'otherness' as an electoral tactic "". Not one to take such accusations lightly, Trump branded Khan a "" stone-cold loser "" for failing to tackle knife crime and terrorism in London.

Failure to Record Ethnicity of Criminals Soars Among British Police Forces,"British police forces have been accused of being afraid of getting called racist as the recording of criminal ethnicity fell to the lowest rate in at least 15 years. According to Ministry of Justice data unearthed in Freedom of Information requests by former Tory minister Neil O'Brien, the percentage of instances in which British police failed to log the ethnicity of child sex offenders stood at 28.7 per cent last year, up from 11.6 per cent in 2010. For sex crimes as a whole, police failed to record the ethnicity of 29 per cent of perpetrators, up from 15 per cent, The Telegraph reported . Similarly, police failed to record the ethnicity of those convicted of murder, rape, and assault resulting in grievous bodily harm in over one in three instances (34.4 per cent) last year, compared to 11.8 per cent in 2010. The trend of listing the ethnicity of criminals as ""unknown"" was also seen in lower-level crimes, including 44 per cent of robberies last year, up from 14 per cent, and 30.2 per cent for shoplifting, compared to seven per cent in 2010. The MoJ figures showed the most significant increase in drug offences, from an eight per cent failure to record ethnic data in 2010 to 39 per cent in 2024. The failures come despite years of warnings that police forces throughout England had overlooked the scourge of child rape grooming gangs, in which mostly Muslim Pakistani-heritage men sexually preyed upon and trafficked young white girls for fear of appearing racist or stoking ethnic divides. Last week, a national police task force revealed that Pakistanis are up to four times more likely to commit child sexual grooming crimes than the general population. However, even the task force admitted that their figures were ""limited"" as police forces in England and Wales had only recorded the ethnicities of around a third of suspects. Commenting on the revelations, former Conservative government minister Neil O'Brien surmised that political correctness was to blame for the increasing instances of police not recording the ethnicities of offenders. ""It has to be wariness on the part of the authorities about recording and fear of being called racist,"" the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston MP said. ""We don't see a big rise in refusal to declare in other services, and the rise across the country is completely inconsistent."" Robert Jenrick, the Conservatives' shadow justice secretary, demanded that the government provide Parliament with an annual report documenting every convicted offender's ethnicity, nationality, visa, and asylum status. ""The reduction in published data on the ethnicity of convicted criminals, in sharp contrast to data on age or sex, will only fuel perceptions that the British state is covering up the costs of migration,"" Jenrick said. ""We urgently need all the data so that, for the first time, we can see the actual impact of different types of migration."" While establishment governments of both Labour and the Tories have refused to publish data relating to the criminality of migrant groups in Britain, an analysis conducted last year by The Telegraph found that foreigners were over a quarter more likely to be imprisoned than the native population. The report also found wide disparities among different foreign nationalities, with Albanians being by far the most likely to be imprisoned, at a rate of one in 50, followed by migrants from Kosovo, Vietnam, Algeria, Jamaica, Eritrea, Iraq, and Somalia. On the other hand, Germans were the least likely, followed by Italians, Greeks, Americans, Sri Lankans, French, and Chinese. The findings led to calls for the government to curtail migration from countries which produced higher numbers of migrant criminals.

TikTok Goes Dark for Americans Hours Before Ban Takes Place,"American TikTok users were faced with a message that the app was unavailable Sunday and they would not be able to use it, hours before a ban was set to take effect. ""Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now,"" a message pops up on the social media app when users in the United States open the app. The message further explains that due to a ""law banning TikTok"" being enacted in the U.S., Americans are unable to use the app. However, the message continues to praise President-elect Donald Trump for having ""indicated that he will work"" with TikTok to find ""a solution to reinstate TikTok."" ""A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,"" the message on TikTok reads. ""Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!"" TikTok going dark comes after the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the ""sell-or-ban legislation"" on the app. Trump has previously expressed that he has a ""warm spot"" in his heart for TikTok, citing how he ""won youth by 34 points"" in the presidential election. Trump has also indicated that ""TikTok had an impact"" on him winning the election and stated his administration would look into it. As Breitbart News's Alana Mastrangelo previously reported , in December a federal appeals court upheld that required ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to sell the app or face a possible ban in the U.S. During a recent interview with NBC News, Trump revealed that he would ""most likely"" give TikTok a ""90-day extension"" to avoid a ban.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T08:51:31+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-goes-dark-for-americans-hours-before-ban-takes-place/
Youngkin Orders Flags to Be Flown at Full-Staff for Trump's Inauguration,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) ordered the flags in the state to be flown at full-staff for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday. In a statement issued on Saturday, Youngkin ordered the American flag and the flag of the Commonwealth of Virginia ""to be flown at full-staff"" for Trump's inauguration on Monday. Youngkin added that the flags would be lowered to half-staff the next day in honor of former President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter Jr., who passed away in December at the age of 100. Youngkin said in a statement: In accordance with the authority vested in me as Governor and in accordance with federal law 4 U.S.C. § 6(d), I hereby order that the flags of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia are to be flown at full-staff on all state and local buildings and grounds in the Commonwealth in recognition of the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States. ""The flags will be lowered back to half-staff the following day to continue honoring former President James Earl Carter, Jr. and remain at half-staff through January 28, 2025,"" Youngkin added. ""I hereby order that the flags shall be raised at 11 am on Monday, January 20, 2025 and lowered at sunrise on Tuesday, January 21, 2024."" Youngkin joins Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in making announcements that flags in their states would be raised to full-staff for Trump's inauguration. In December, President Joe Biden ordered the flags to be flown at half-staff for a period of 30 days in honor of Carter: NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr., and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. Other governors, such as Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson (D) Missouri Gov.

Adam Schiff Re-Hires Former Radical Pro-Palestinian Staffer Maher Bitar,"Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has re-hired Maher Bitar, a former White House staffer who spent his student years as a pro-Palestinian radical in Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and played a major role in the Biden administration. Bitar's new job is confirmed by Legistorm. He also previously worked for Schiff during the first impeachment effort against then-President Donald Trump, who will return to office on Monday. As Breitbart News reported last year: Maher Bitar, the White House Coordinator for Intelligence and Defense Policy at the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), was a radical pro-Palestinian activist and a leader within Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). The SJP is one of the most prominent groups involved in the pro-Hamas, antisemitic ""encampment"" protests that have taken over dozens of university campuses. Its parent group is also the target of a lawsuit by survivors and families of victims of the October 7 terror attack that alleges SJP is a propaganda front for Hamas in the U.S. In addition, conservative author Daniel Greenfield wrote about Bitar's record for the Jewish News Syndicate: At the PSM [Palestine Solidarity Movement] conference in Georgetown [in 2006], Bitar had run a session describing how to best demonize Israel. Next year, he facilitated a Palestinian Student Society summit addressed by Joseph Massad , who had called Israel a ""Jewish supremacist state"" and praised terrorism. ... A few years later, Bitar could be found presenting at a Sabeel conference featuring some of the worst bigots like Rebecca Vilkomerson of JVP, who had invited a terrorist to address the BDS hate group, and Richard Falk, who had endorsed a book which wondered whether ""Hitler might have been right after all."" ... Bitar went to work for UNRWA, interned at the misnamed and militantly anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and studied at Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre, writing papers on the so-called ""Nakba"" and on ""Palestinian"" activism. He appeared to describe Israel's security barrier as a ""segregation wall."" Schiff is considered a pro-Israel Senator, by the standards of the Democratic Party, but his reliance on Bitar for advice on national security policy signals a possible shift mirroring the anti-Israel drift of much of the rest of his party.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T03:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/adam-schiff-re-hires-former-radical-pro-palestinian-staffer-maher-bitar/
Youngkin Slams Biden's Clemency of Men Who Killed Police Officer,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) criticized President Joe Biden for granting clemency to ""two violent criminals"" who killed a police officer, stating that he was ""beyond outraged."" In a press release on Saturday, Youngkin stated that what made Biden granting clemency to Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson ""even more unconscionable"" was that ""the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House"" against commuting the sentences. Youngkin noted in the press release that ""both"" men had ""admitted to being responsible for the brutal killing of Officer Allen Gibson in Sussex County Circuit Court."" Claiborne and Richardson were ""acquitted of the 1998 murder"" of Officer Allen Gibson, a Sussex County police officer, according to WRIC News. The outlet noted that while the men were ""acquitted by a federal jury,"" they ended up receiving ""a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge."" However, in an unusual move, they still received a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge. Previously, a legal analyst told 8News that it was a ""miscarriage of justice"" to cross-reference a charge someone had been acquitted of when sentencing, adding that he had never seen that before. ""I am beyond outraged and in utter disbelief that President Biden would announce clemency for Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson—two men who admitted for being responsible to brutally killing Officer Allen Gibson,"" Youngkin said in a statement. ""What makes this even more unconscionable is the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House not to commute these sentences as they are violent offenders."" ""The pain and sorrow this clemency causes the Gibson family is unimaginable,"" Youngkin added. ""To know that the men who took Officer Gibson's life will walk free is not just a grave injustice—it is a heartbreaking blow to those who continue to mourn his sacrifice. This is despicable; a grim day for justice and for the families who trust that our system will hold the guilty accountable."" Youngkin's criticism of Biden commuting the sentences of Claiborne and Richardson came a day after Biden commuted the sentences of almost 2,500 people. As Breitbart News previously reported , in December, Biden issued presidential pardons to 39 Americans who were ""convicted of non-violent crimes,"" and commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 others.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T02:12:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/glenn-youngkin-slams-bidens-clemency-of-men-who-murdered-va-police-officer-beyond-outraged/
HHS Defunds EcoHealth for Facilitating Gain-of-Function Research,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has cut off all funding and ""formally debarred"" EcoHealth Alliance Inc. and its former president, Dr. Peter Daszak, after finding evidence that it facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight and violated statutes in its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Evidence was gathered over an eight-month investigation by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in a Friday news release . A letter from HHS states that a five-year ""period of debarment for Dr. Daszak is necessary to protect the Federal Government's business interests,"" and confirms that EcoHealth terminated his employment on January 6 of this year. A May 2024 interim report from the coronavirus subcommittee revealed ""serious, systemic weaknesses"" within NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that ""enabled"" Daszak to fund ""dangerous"" gain-of-function research with the the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) with a multi-million dollar federal grant. Then-subcommittee Chair, Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), accused the British doctor of having ""blatant contempt for the American people,"" calling it ""reprehensible"": EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak is not a good steward of U.S. taxpayer dollars and should never again receive funding from the U.S. taxpayer. Dr. Daszak and his organization conducted dangerous gain-of-function research at the WIV, willfully violated the terms of a multi-million-dollar NIH grant, and placed U.S. national security at risk. This blatant contempt for the American people is reprehensible. It is imperative to establish higher standards of oversight at the NIH. The Select Subcommittee's detailed and comprehensive report today holds Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance accountable and sheds light on severe shortcomings in our public health systems. On top of debarment, the interim report also recommended that Daszak be criminally investigated. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) celebrated the defunding and debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak in a Friday statement: ""Justice for the American people was served today. Bad actor EcoHealth Alliance and its corrupt former President, Dr. Peter Daszak, were formally debarred by HHS for using taxpayer funds to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in China,"" the Kentucky Republican said in the committee's press release. ""Today's decision is not only a victory for the U.S. taxpayer, but also for American national security and the safety of citizens worldwide."" ""Given that a lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is the most likely origin of COVID-19, EcoHealth and its former President should never again receive a single cent from the U.S. taxpayer,"" Comer added. EcoHealth Alliance's period of debarment is set to end on May 14, 2029, and Daszak's is set to end six days later, Fox News reported. The medical research firm got nearly $100 million from the U.S. government over the last 15 years, the outlet noted.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T01:21:17+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/18/hhs-defunds-ecohealth-dr-peter-daszak-for-facilitating-dangerous-wuhan-gain-of-function-research/
Georgia 'BLM' Mayor Under Fire for Spending 1.000s of Taxpayer Dollars,"A Georgia mayor who claims to be ""America's first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office"" is accused of spending $26,000 of public funds for unauthorized expenses, primarily for international travel. South Fulton Mayor Khalid Kamau has come under fire this week residents and at least one city council member questioned items he allegedly bought with his city-issued purchase card, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Kamau, who boasts of being a ""self-proclaimed Elected Activist"" and BLM protester on the city's website , identifies as a ""socialist"" who was proud to support legislation to ""eliminate Columbus Day in favor of Indigenous People's Day"" and to ""ban the box"" asking city job applicants to disclose their criminal history. When asked if the mayor had made unauthorized purchases, Councilwoman Helen Willis said, ""It appears so. Within the last fourth quarter of 2024, it was approximately $26,000."" One of the major purchases was a trip to Africa, she alleged. ""It's a pretty large amount of unauthorized charges, mainly for international travel,"" Willis told the Atlanta outlet. Kamau, who was elected in 2017 and goes by ""Mayor Kobi"" on Instagram for unclear reasons, documented a 20-day trip to Ghana in December on the platform, one disgruntled resident told WSB-TV. One video shared by the mayor on December 22 shows him dancing with a couple of smiling ladies at a popular beach club in the West African nation's capital of Accra: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mayor Kobi (@kobi.cares) ""I wanted to find out if taxpayers paid for this trip,"" the resident, Reshard Snellings, told the station. ""We should not be asked to go without something so that our elected officials can travel all over the globe."" When asked if the city of South Fulton was conducting any business in Africa, Councilwoman Willis said no. ""Not to my knowledge, that isn't even a priority,"" she told the outlet. ""We need more economic development here and we don't need to go to Africa in order for the city to have a multi-business deal."" On top of multiple flight purchases totaling more than $5,000, there was also a $1,300 purchase for a drone and multiple expensive Amazon orders, according to WSB-TV. Councilman Jaceey Sebastian, mayor pro tem, said that Kamau needs to provide an explanation. ""There are some things that I see in the public that need some explanation,"" he said to Fox 5 Atlanta. Councilwoman Linda Pritchett concurred, saying, ""I would like to see the mayor have the opportunity to address the issue transparently."" While international travel is not prohibited for the mayor, using the city card for personal items and services is. The city council ultimately voted to suspend international travel for 30 to 45 days while that statute is reviewed, the local Fox affiliate reported. Kamau has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the accusations are politically motivated. ""It's really a smear campaign. You will see in the meetings, the people who are talking the most are running for mayor in 2025,"" the mayor said to WSB-TV. Kamau was arrested at a complete stranger's home and charged with trespassing and burglary in 2023, after allegedly bypassing a ""No Trespassing"" sign on a property in the neighboring town of Fairburn and entering a lake house without permission, 11Alive reported. The homeowner held Kamau at gunpoint and called the police. When officers arrived, the mayor claimed he was taking his dog to a nearby park when he saw his ""dream home"" and knowingly trespassed because he wanted to buy it. He was later released on an $11,000 bond.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T00:40:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/local/2025/01/18/georgia-black-lives-matter-mayor-under-fire-for-spending-thousands-of-taxpayer-funds-on-africa-trip/
Former Intel Officials: Tulsi Gabbard Puts Party Loyalty Far Behind Duty to Country,"Former intelligence officials said that Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard has put ""party loyalty far behind duty to country."" In the week after his historic election, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Gabbard to serve as director of National Intelligence. ""For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,"" Trump s aid in a written statement. ""I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!"" Gabbard thanked Trump on X ""for the opportunity to serve as a member of your cabinet to defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people,"" adding, ""I look forward to getting to work."" Her nomination garnered swift backing from many leaders in the intelligence community. Bernard Hudson, a retired CIA official who was the agency's chief of counterterrorism, where he oversaw the CIA's efforts in the Global War on Terror, said in a statement to Breitbart News, ""To be successful, a Director of National Intelligence must have two key attributes. One, they need to have the confidence of the President. An intelligence chief without this is going to be a severe disadvantage in trying to carry out their duties. Tulsi Gabbard clearly has the confidence of the incoming Chief Executive. Two, the DNI needs to be willing to speak truth to power, no matter what the personal or political cost to them. This tends to be easier said than done. Tulsi Gabbard has already demonstrated she is willing to pay a steep price for speaking uncomfortable truths. ""During her run for the Democratic nomination for President, she demonstrated this time and time again. And she paid a price for it, but it had not deterred her from seeking and speaking the truth. In regards to her experience with the intelligence world, she's been both a consumer of tactical and strategic intelligence,"" he continued. ""As a soldier, especially during her combat tour in Iraq, she has seen the value, and sometimes the limitations, of tactical intelligence for the warfighter."" As a member of congress sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was privy to and responsible for understanding and supporting some of the most sensitive and vast global intelligence programs the United States has. Lastly, she is someone who has put party loyalty far behind duty to the country,"" the former senior CIA officer concluded in his statement to Breitbart News. ""That bipartisan background should help her demonstrate to the American people that the intelligence community she leads is a non-partisan tool that supports the key interests of the United States and its key allies."" Robert C. O'Brien, who served as the 27th U.S. National Security Adviser under Trump, on Sunday wrote an op-ed calling on the Senate to confirm Gabbard and all of Trump's national security nominees. He explained: Gabbard also has an open mind and the curiosity necessary to evaluate complex and, often, contradictory reports that are commonplace in the Intel World. Her path from congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate to supporting President Trump demonstrates her ability to put country above party and ideology when the facts require courageous action. ... In my hours of meetings with Gabbard since her nomination, it is clear why the president selected her to serve as DNI. She listens, she asks questions that go to the heart of the matter being discussed and she is concise and eloquent in sharing her views. She is also unafraid of the IC bureaucracy that she will have to reform and bring into the 21 st Century by rooting out partisanship and introducing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing into both intelligence collection and analysis. On Sunday, Gabbard received the backing of Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee after the nominee said she believes in balancing the need for protecting Americans' civil liberties and national security. Lankford explained: She's now coming in and saying, those changes have been done because even since she was in Congress, there have been quite a few changes that we've made in Congress to make sure we're protecting the civil rights of Americans. But when she came out and said, ""Hey, this is something I'm going to stand for"" – that's part of the role of the Director of National Intelligence is to make sure we're actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:25:04+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/former-intel-officials-director-national-intelligence-nominee-tulsi-gabbard-put-party-loyalty-far-behind-duty-to-country/
Poll Shows Post-Election Crash in Public Tolerance for Illegal Migration,"Just 10 percent of Americans oppose President Donald Trump's promise to deport illegal migrants with criminal records, according to an Ipsos poll for the New York Times . In contrast, 87 percent support the deportations strongly or ""somewhat,"" so providing a broad consensus for a national enforcement campaign. And just 19 percent of Americans — fewer than one in five — strongly oppose ""deporting all immigrants who are here illegally ,"" the Ipsos poll also showed. Fifty-six percent support the deportations strongly or somewhat. The post-election collapse of tolerance for illegal migration was spotlighted Saturday when the newspaper posted its early-January poll of 2,128 citizens and residents that confirmed recent polling trends . The broad shift in political opinion — dubbed a ""preference cascade"" by academics — was likely caused when Trump's campaign and November win showed Americans how many other Americans oppose migration. The new numbers will help Trump and his deputies begin the careful, low-drama, and gradual removal of millions of wage-cutting, rent-spiking migrants from U.S. society. A patient and popular enforcement campaign will also help shift the political attention to the even bigger impact of legal migration on Americans. Already, the rising public demand for less legal migration was spotlighted over Christmas when Twitter erupted in a furious debate over white-collar migration via the H-1B visa program. That drama was ignored by the poll but is expected to rise as the nation draws closer to the 2026 election. Pro-migration groups, however, hope the Trump enforcement is chaotic and rushed because any tactical mistakes will help their media allies paint the repatriations as cruel and counterproductive. The newspaper's coverage of the poll downplays the drama, saying : Many Americans who otherwise dislike President-elect Donald J. Trump share his bleak assessment of the country's problems and support some of his most contentious prescriptions to fix them, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Ipsos . The new poll includes much evidence that GOP voters are leading Democrats away from their politically disastrous support for the quasi-open borders policies put in place by President Joe Biden's pro-migration, Cuban-born border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. For example, only 16 percent of Democrats oppose the deportation of criminal migrants, and only 34 percent of Democrats now ""strongly"" oppose the deportation of "" all immigrants [emphasis added] who are here illegally."" Overall, 55 percent want all migrants to be deported, and 87 percent want crminal migrants to be deported. These numbers — the approaching 20256 midterm elections — help to explain why a critical share of Senate Democrats are expected on Monday to support the Laken Riley bill that would allow the detention of criminal migrants. Similarly, 56 percent said the Mayorkas migration has caused more crime. Just 38 percent — including 63 percent of Democrats, said the migration ""doesn't have much impact on crime."" The poll said that 41 percent of Americans, including 68 percent of GOP voters — say ""immigrants today are a burden on our country because they take our jobs, housing and health care."" However, the ""forced choice"" question did not offer alternative answers, so it prodded 56 percent of respondents to say immigrants ""strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents."" There is much evidence that legal and illegal migration makes ordinary Americans poor and less productive . Elsewhere in the poll, Ipsos asked if there were too many or too few legal migrants. Thirty percent said too many, and just 24 percent said too few. But the plurality of 43 percent picked a middle option — ""the right number"" — likely because the respondents do not know that Biden's deputies imported roughly one migrant for every American birth since 2021. Other recent polls show less support for migration. A January 5-8 survey by YouGov showed a 34 percent plurality believes legal migration makes the nation ""worse off,"" and a 41 percent plurality favor cuts or ending legal migration. Just 17 percent favor additional legal migration. Similarly, a January 8 poll by YouGov showed that 27 percent of Americans want the white-collar H-1B migration program to be reduced or eliminated, while only 17 percent want it increased. Among Republicans, 40 percent want to cut or eliminate the program, while only 12 percent want it to be expanded.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:08:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/18/poll-shows-post-election-crash-in-public-tolerance-for-illegal-migration/
Google CEO to Attend Inauguration After Hosting Party for Left Resistance,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai will attend Monday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump after the search giant in November planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to ""resist the Republican agenda."" The inauguration will feature many of the most prominent Silicon Valley leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and Google's Pichai. While other big tech platforms have tried to steer right in the aftermath of Trump's landslide election, Google reportedly planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those affiliated with the super PAC sought to ""resist the Republican agenda."" Breitbart News's Lucas Nolan wrote : According to an invitation obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Priorities USA will first hold a ""digital retrospective"" to discuss the role of online campaigning in the 2024 election cycle and strategize ways to ""resist the Republican agenda."" Following this meeting, Google will co-host a social hour for the attendees. Priorities USA, which has received substantial funding from billionaire donors such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg, reportedly spent $75 million on digital mobilization efforts to support Harris's campaign. The timing of the event is particularly notable, as President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Google, accusing the company of rigging its search engine to promote negative stories about him. While Trump has indicated that he may not pursue breaking up Google as a monopoly, he has vowed to take action to ensure that the search engine is ""more fair."" A Google spokesperson said that the big tech company will host the happy hour for Priorities USA; however, the spokesman said that the company would not participate in the ""digital retrospective"" event.

Exclusive--Kentucky AG Commissioner: Confirmation of USDA Nominee Brooke Rollins Will Help Make America Healthy Again,"Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said on Breitbart News Saturday that swiftly confirming agriculture secretary nominee Brooke Rollins will aid the Trump administration's efforts to Make America Healthy Again. Shell spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as nearly two dozen state agricultural commissioners have called for a speedy confirmation of Rollins. ""There is no mystery as to why President-elect Donald J. Trump won 433 of the nation's 444 farming-dependent counties with an average of 77.7% of the vote,"" the commissioners wrote in their letter. Shell said that Rollins will have the policy acumen to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one of the largest federal departments. ""What I love about her the most is she comes from a policy background, the think tank world,"" Shell remarked. Rollins has led many major conservative think tanks, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the Trump-backed America First Policy Institute. ""She brings a different perspective that will solidify what we need to move into the future for Kentucky agriculture and American agriculture and our interests abroad,"" the Kentucky commissioner wrote. Shell noted that Rollins can help push back against other countries' unfair trade practices to boost American agriculture and cut ""so much red tape"" holding back American farmers. He also argued that if President-elect Donald Trump could do ""one thing"" to aid farmers, it would be to lower gas prices. Shell noted that Rollins could work alongside Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to enact the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. He said that ""food is medicine"" and that health starts with decentralizing our food system. Shell also noted that schools often do not provide the proper food for America's school children. ""There's no way to make America Healthy Again without American farming and American agriculture. It starts with the food that we eat,"" he explained to Breitbart News Saturday .

NYT Exposes 6 People Responsible for Trying to Cover Up Joe Biden's Health,"""Six key people"" knew of President Joe Biden's condition for years and tried to cover it up, the New York Times reported Friday. The establishment media tried for years to help the president appear able to lead the nation, but now that Biden is set to retire from office, some in the media are beginning to expose those who worked behind the scenes to cover up the state of Biden's health. The six key people who covered up Biden's health situation were, according to the Times' Katie Rogers, Adam Entous, Maggie Haberman, and Carl Hulse: First Lady Jill Biden Hunter Biden Mike Donilon, the president's longtime strategist, Steve Ricchetti, the president's lawyer Annie Tomasini, the deputy chief of staff Anthony Bernal, the first lady's most senior aide Many — if not all — of those named in the report still claim Biden is fit to serve. ""I mean, today, I think he has a full schedule,"" Jill Biden recently told the Washington Post . ""He started early with interviews and briefings, and it just keeps going."" ""We can get through it,"" Ricchetti reportedly told lawmakers about Biden's health before he stepped aside as a candidate. ""We think our allies on the Hill are wrong."" The Times reported on the coverup: The people closest to President Biden were well aware that he had changed. He talked more slowly than he had just a few years before, needed to hoist himself out of his seat in the presidential limousine and walked with a halting gait. ... The president's acknowledgment has put a new spotlight on his family and inner circle, all of whom dismissed concerns from voters and Mr. Biden's own party that he was too old for the job. And yet they recognized his physical frailty to a greater degree than they have publicly acknowledged. Then they cooperated, according to interviews with more than two dozen aides, allies, lawmakers and donors, to manage his decline. They rearranged meetings to make sure Mr. Biden was in a better mood — a strategy one person close to him described as how aides should handle any president. At times, they delayed sharing information with him, including negative polling data, as they debated the best way to frame it. They surrounded him with aides when he walked from the White House to the waiting presidential helicopter on the South Lawn so that news cameras could not capture his awkward bearing. The Times's report is corroborated. Biden's aides successfully covered up his health until he stepped into the spotlight for July's debate, according to Wall Street Journal interviews with nearly 50 people, including many who had direct knowledge of the operation. Interviews conducted by the Journal reveal Biden's aides protected the ""diminished"" president from cabinet members, donors, pollsters, and top Democrat lawmakers, who might have undermined the aides' directives. Biden's aides reportedly excluded negative stories about the president in his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign. Those closest to the president took the following actions to cover up Biden's health, the Journal reported: Adjusted the presidential schedule, starting at the beginning of his term, due to ""Biden's advanced age"" Limited Biden's schedule because he ""became tired if meetings went long"" causing him to ""make mistakes"" Told ""visitors to keep meetings focused,"" including meetings with senior Democrat lawmakers and some cabinet members Excluded negative stories about the president from his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign Implemented greater than normal ""controls"" over who Biden ""spoke with,"" what they ""said to him"" Limited ""the sources of information he consumed"" Gave Biden great assistance at public events, which was characterized as ""hand holding"" unlike ""other recent presidents have had"" Allowed Biden to start his day later in the morning, ""since Biden has never been at his best first thing"" Handled things in such a way that ""[a]t least one cabinet member stopped requesting calls with the president, because it was clear that such requests wouldn't be welcome"" Dictated agency ""decisions and expect[ed] cabinet agencies to carry them out"" Fielded concerns from cabinet members, who were mostly not allowed to take their concerns directly to the president Tried to protect the president, who ""couldn't recall lines that his team had previously discussed with him"" during meetings Prevented the press, donors, and stakeholders in Biden's campaign from direct contact with the president Often repeated ""basic instructions to him, such as where to enter or exit a stage"" Looked for a ""voice coach to improve the president's fading warble"" Many Republicans believed Biden was in poor health for years. The speculation, based on visual evidence, appeared to be confirmed when Special Counsel Robert Hur characterized Biden in February 2024 as ""an elderly man with a poor memory.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T20:46:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/nyt-exposes-six-people-responsible-trying-cover-up-joe-bidens-health/
WaPo Admits Trump 'Already Conquered' Washington Before Inauguration ,"President-elect Donald Trump ""already conquered"" Washington, DC, before Inauguration Day, the Washington Post 's Marianne LeVine , Clara Ence Morse, and Aaron Schaffer admitted Saturday. The report details a ""stark contrast to his divisive entry in 2017 and departure in 2021"" compared to Trump's reelection, but it failed to mention the amount of obstacles he overcame to achieve the greatest political comeback in American history. Trump ultimately defeated political opponents who tried to imprison him, bankrupt him, remove him from the ballot, and make him politically irrelevant by introducing a partisan committee to investigate January 6 — and whose inflammatory rhetoric created a ripe environment for two assassination attempts. The omission amplifies the Post's framing of Trump's return to Washington: President-elect Donald Trump is returning to Washington triumphant: His legal cases are behind him, corporate executives are flocking to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, his inaugural committee has raised record sums of money for Monday's ceremony and the Republican Party is now fully in his control. It's a stark contrast both to his 2017 inauguration — when Trump came to Washington as a political unknown without close personal relationships to his Cabinet or congressional leaders — and to his departure from the Oval Office in January 2021, when he was widely condemned for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Now, many of his Cabinet picks appear poised to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate, including his controversial pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, whose nomination seemed in danger just a month ago. Trump is expected to sign scores of executive orders as he takes office, especially on the border, a central issue of his presidential campaign. He is personally closer to his proposed Cabinet and other top aides compared with eight years ago and is enjoying some of the highest favorability ratings of his political career. Days before coming into office, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that both Trump and President Joe Biden have sought to take credit for. The report did mention how Trump's polling numbers are high, perhaps as high as they ever have been. A CNN poll found Trump's approval rating was 48 percent, up from 39 percent just last year. Trump's imminent return to Washington has caused President Joe Biden to feel ""totally dejected,"" NBC News reported based on people who recently met with officials. The mood at the White House reflects the state of the Democrat party. The shattered party does not appear to know why Trump won or how to prevent further Democrat defeats. It is in the middle of revamping its nine-year-old talking points that claimed without evidence that Trump and Republicans were racist, bigots, and misogynists. In recent weeks, the bewildered party does not seem equipped to mount a strong resistance to Trump's cabinet nominees, most of whom appear to be on a glide path to confirmation, although Senate Democrats might try delay tactics, moves that are expected but can be overcome with strong Senate Republican leadership. ""It's hard to reflect, it's hard for it to sink in that we're done here — until we're actually done and out the gates with our stuff,"" one White House official told NBC News. ""That's their mood... it hasn't sunk in for people who are still here yet because we're working until the last minute.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:55:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2025/01/18/wapo-admits-trump-already-conquered-washington-before-inauguration/
"Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross Attend Pre-Inauguration Crypto Ball -- Both Fantasized About Killing Trump","Rappers Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross appeared at the pre-inauguration ""Crypto Ball"" on Friday — signaling a change of heart for both rappers after they fantasized about killing President-elect Donald Trump in their music, with Snoop even pretending to point a gun at the then-president in a music video. Snoop Dogg headlined the pro-Trump Crypto Ball event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington D.C., with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in attendance — along with other rappers including Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, according to multiple reports. Video footage from the party has gone viral, showing Snoop Dogg taking the stage to perform a set for the tuxedoed crowd. In a video message , Ross denied he was performing at the event, though he did appear to confirm his attendance saying, ""it's a private 'vibe' I'm doing with my brother Snoop Dogg."" However, additional viral footage from Friday's party showed Ross performing on stage. Snoop Dogg vehemently opposed Trump during his first term in the White House. In 2017, the rapper starred in a politically-charged music video for the single ""Lavender"" that saw the rapper pull a gun and ""shoot"" a parody clown version of then-President Donald Trump. Rick Ross also fantasized about the death of Trump. In a music video for his single ""Free Enterprise"" released in 2016, Ross rapped: ""Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman/Now accept these words as they came from Eminem."" The lyrics are an apparent reference to George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Rapper Soulja Boy has publicly opposed Trump, attacking fellow rapper Kanye West during a radio interview in 2019 by questioning his support for the then-president in a profane rant. ""You supporting Trump, bruh? What the fuck wrong with you, bruh? That shit not right, bruh,"" Soulja Boy erupted on The Breakfast Club. Snoop Dogg signaled a change of heart when it comes to Trump a year ago during a conversation with the U.K. Sunday Times. ""Donald Trump? He ain't done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris,"" he told the outlet, later adding: ""So I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump."" Friday's Crypto Ball was a private, four-hour affair, with tickets going for $2,500 and $5,000, according to a report from Coindesk. Other attendees included Trump's crypto czar pick, David Sacks, as well as tech entrepreneurs Michael Saylor, Brian Armstrong, and the Winklevoss brothers.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:50:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/18/snoop-dogg-rick-ross-attend-pre-inauguration-crypto-ball-both-fantasized-about-killing-trump/
Brad Sherman Criticizes Pacific Palisades Residents Who Returned to Their Homes,"Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) criticized residents of the Pacific Palisades who had returned to their homes without authorization, telling a telephone town hall on Wednesday that they had ""ruined"" things for other local residents. Sherman was providing information about federal relief funds and fielding questions about when people would be allowed to return to their homes — whether to remove any remaining belongings, or simply to grieve the ruins. The Los Angeles Police Department and the National Guard are currently denying entry to residents in the evacuation zones, and have said that anyone caught violating a 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew in the area will be arrested. He said that while police escorts had been provided for some residents for several days (Jan. 9-11), they had been suspended — and he blamed the fact that some people had tried to return to their homes, often successfully. You're gonna say, ""Well, why not at least let me in to check out my own house?"" Um, they were doing that for a while, they didn't have the resources. And then there's another problem that I hesitate to mention and that is some people were taken in to look and they stayed, they ""de-evacuated"" themselves, they walked in their front door and locked it behind them, and, uh, they were not arrested. And so, uh, they kind of ruined it for other people. Of course the research commitment is also very high to, to, to escort people back in. So they've got to deal with the toxic chemicals, they've got to deal with the safety of the utilities, in order to, uh, uh, I, in order to let people into the fire area. I'm sure we'll get more questions on that. Sherman's comments triggered outrage among some residents, who are worried about looting and who have, in some cases, hired private security companies to protect their neighborhoods, or have slipped past police and the National Guard. There are a few residents who have refused to evacuate, preferring to live secretly in their surviving homes without electricity, power, gas, or water rather than to leave.

"Israel Will Release Mass Murderers, Terrorists in Hostage Deal","Israel will release major terrorists, including those who have murdered dozens of civilians, in exchange for the 33 hostages who will be freed by Hamas from captivity in Gaza, where they have been held illegally for 470 days of war. Under the terms of the deal, there will be a ceasefire lasting six weeks (42 days), during which Hamas will free several living hostages once a week, plus twelve hostages in the final week, freeing living hostages before deceased ones. In return, Israel will withdraw partially from Gaza, and will release roughly 1,900 terrorists — including nearly 1200 who were arrested during the war, and more than 700 who were already serving prison sentences in Israeli prisons. While no terrorists who took part in the October 7, 2023, attacks will be released, Israel has agreed to release some terrorists who committed mass murder in past terrorist attacks. For example, according to Israel's Army Radio, one terrorist who will be released was involved in planning a suicide bombing at the Megiddo junction in northern Israel in 2002, during the second intifada . The attack killed 17 innocent civilians who were simply riding a public bus. The Israeli government said Saturday that authorities would begin notifying families of victims of terror that those involved in the murders of their relatives were about to be released. The ceasefire-and-hostage deal goes into effect on Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. local time in Israel — though there could still be snags. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government will not go through with the deal unless Hamas fulfills its obligation to provide the names of the hostages to be released. The Red Cross is preparing to handle the transfer of hostages, as it did in the last truce, in November 2023, though the international agency has come under criticism for failing to visit the hostages during their captivity, and allowing Hamas to use the releases as propaganda events. Update: Netanyahu addressed his nation on Saturday night, emphasizing that Israel had not given up its military gains in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. He quoted from the Bible, citing Jeremiah 31:16: ""And the children shall return to their borders.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:45:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/18/israel-will-release-mass-murderers-terrorists-in-hostage-deal/
Aggressive Driver Shot Numerous Times After Allegedly Chasing Couple,"An aggressive driver was shot numerous times Friday night in Houston, Texas, after allegedly brake-checking, blocking, and chasing a couple riding in another vehicle. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. KHOU reported that the suspect, a man in his 40s, was driving a pickup truck when he allegedly ""zeroed in on a car driven by a 20-year-old man."" There was also a pregnant woman in the car with the younger man. The driver allegedly brake-checked the 20-year-old, drove into oncoming traffic to get beside him, and finally, blocked the car's forward motion, then exited his truck with his hand near his pockets. The 20-year-old feared for himself and for the woman with him and opened fire, hitting the 40-year-old numerous times. Houston Police Department's Lt. R. Willkens explained: The 20-year-old's actions are tentatively being referred to as self-defense and come just weeks after another Houston shooting in which a 24-year-old woman claimed self-defense for her actions. AB C 13 noted that the 24-year-old shot and killed a man at an apartment on Christmas Day. Police indicated the man, 22-year-old Jonathon Mason, was dead when officers arrived.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Wednesday predicted that ""most, if not all"" of President-elect Donald Trump's nominees will get at least 50 votes in the Senate on Breitbart News Daily . When asked if he believes Pete Hegseth, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense, will get 50 votes, Johnson replied, ""Oh, yeah, I think most, if not all, Trump nominees will."" ""The default position of Republican senators is this is a convincing election,"" he said, explaining that it is presidents who decide who they want in their cabinet, not senators. ""Our role is to respect the results of the election and confirm that the people that President Trump wants to surround himself in his administration,"" the senator said. ""He's ultimately responsible."" Host Mike Slater pointed to an analysis from the Washington Post that highlighted a number of senators who could potentially vote ""no"" on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's choice for Health and Human Services Secretary. ""Well, what's interesting is I did sort of the unofficial whip count for Bobby Kennedy early on, and I talked to, I think 41 of my Republican colleagues and 15 Democrats. I think that was my account almost. The conversation was almost identical with everyone. It was started off with, 'Boy, there's a lot that I really love that Bobby's trying to do,' but they have concerns,"" he said, explaining that Kennedy can ""easily"" alleviate those concerns. ""And I think he will, and I think he has, so we'll see how this goes. I know there will probably be an extensive lobbying effort from all corners of the swamp... because by bringing forward the truth to the political process here, it does threaten people's business models, I suppose, but that's what we need,"" he said, explaining that the American people ""absolutely support getting to the truth of what is causing chronic illness.""

Poll: Plurality Either 'Enthusiastic' or 'Satisfied' with Next 4 Years of Trump,"A plurality is either ""enthusiastic"" or ""satisfied"" with President-elect Donald Trump leading the country over the next four years, according to the latest weekly survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, ""How do you feel about the next 4 years with Donald Trump as president?"" Overall, 47 percent are either enthusiastic or satisfied. Of those, 31 percent said they are enthusiastic, and 16 percent are satisfied. Another 31 percent said they are actively upset, and 13 percent are ""dissatisfied but not upset."" Another nine percent remain unsure. Predictably, most Democrats — 60 percent — are upset, compared to 31 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans who feel the same. One in five independents said they are enthusiastic, as did 71 percent of Republicans. Only two percent of Democrats feel the same way. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 U.S. citizens. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey comes as the Democrat Party remains in disarray after its loss to Trump — a loss that occurred even after they subverted the will of their voters and coronated Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump instead of President Joe Biden. To their surprise, Trump not only won the election but secured every single swing stat, as well as the popular vote. RELATED — Trump: MAGA Saving, Not Threatening Democracy Biden, 82, still believes that he would have defeated Trump had he remained the Democrat nominee. ""Do you believe you could have won in November?"" USA Today 's Susan Page asked Biden in a January interview. ""It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,"" he said, referencing polling. However, Biden was not so confident that he would have the ""vigor"" to serve four more years. ""Do you think you would've had the vigor to serve another four years in office?"" she asked. ""I don't know. That's why I thought when I first announced, talking to Barack about it, I said I thought I was the person,"" he said, adding: I had no intention of running after Beau died – for real, not a joke. And then when Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn't looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton. But I don't know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old? Trump's inauguration is less than a week away. So far, the president-elect's inaugural committee has raised over $170 million, according to reports.

It listed several failures, but a plurality, 23 percent, chose border and immigration handling as Biden's biggest failure. The high inflation rate came in second place with 17 percent choosing that as Biden's biggest failure. In third place is Biden's decision to run for a second term, with eight percent choosing that as the biggest failure of his presidency. Six percent said Biden's biggest failure is the withdrawal from Afghanistan, six percent said handling the Israel-Hamas conflict, five percent said handling investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, five percent said pardoning Hunter Biden, and four recent said ineffective messaging. Another three percent said his handling of abortion policy, and three percent said the increase of the national debt. One-third of Republicans chose border and immigration handling as Biden's biggest failure, and 24 percent of independents agreed. Fifteen percent of Democrats said Biden's decision to run for a second term was his biggest flop. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 respondents. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels ""like a morgue"" and ""glum"" as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in. According to NBC News : In the White House, the mood feels ""like a morgue,"" according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don't appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said. ""He's totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,"" another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump's impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden's aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week.

Outrage over Short Prison Sentences for Grooming Gang Child Rapists,"The British judicial system has come under criticism after eight child rape grooming gang members were given what some feel were light sentences for the abuse and rape of two girls in Keighley in the late 1990s. The West Yorkshire Police revealed Friday that over the past two years, the Bradford Crown Court has sentenced eight members of a grooming gang over the sexual exploitation of two young girls between 1996 and 1999. However, the announcement was mired by what many saw as overly-lenient sentences for child rape, particularly given that most offenders in Britain are released after serving just half their sentences behind bars. This would likely mean that some of those imprisoned by the Bradford court would serve less than two years in prison for raping a child. The police force said that following the first trial, which concluded on October 20th of 2023, five men were jailed, including Amreaz Asghar,47, for four and a half years for rape, Perwaz Asghar, 50, for six and a half years for two indecent assaults, Mohammed Din, 47, for 14 years for 11 counts of rape, Sajid Mahmood Khan, 45, for three years for rape, and Zehroon Razak, 47, for six and a half years for rape. Following the conclusion of the second trial, which concluded on Friday, a further three men were sentenced, though two were tried in absentia as their whereabouts are currently unknown. The West Yorkshire Police said that Ibrar Hussain, 47, was jailed for six and a half years for two counts of rape. The two men tried in absentia, Fayaz Ahmed, 45, and Imtiaz Ahmed, 61, were sentenced to seven and a half years and nine years in prison, respectively. The two victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 years old during the time of the grooming offences. Mohammed Din was convicted of raping both girls, while the other men were convicted of raping the first victim to come forward to police, which she did as an adult. Responding to the sentences, former detective turned grooming gang whistleblower Maggie Oliver said : ""These sentences in this Keighley group rape gang case just beggar belief, again – children of 13/14 raped repeatedly and their rapists will serve HALF these sentences!!!! So 18 months for one of the rapists, just over 2 years for another. ""Shocking! Yet again! And I honestly find myself lost for words, and I've no doubt the police officers who have put this case together are equally disgusted with these sentences! Disgusting!"" Grooming gang victim and activist Sammy Woodhouse added : ""The Judges in the UK are sentencing men to 3 years for raping a child. He won't even serve half of that. Absolutely vile. No wonder there's so many children being raped in our country."" The British public also appears to want harsher sentencing for grooming gang child rapists. According to a survey published this week by Friderichs Advisory and JL Partners, some 47 per cent of Britons support life sentences for such offenders, while 30 per cent backed the death penalty for grooming gang child rapists. Following the publication of the sentences in Keighley, Detective Chief Inspector Vicky Greenbank of Bradford District Police said: ""We welcome the sentences that have been handed down to these men. Cases such as these are incredibly sensitive and complex and it has taken years of painstaking investigation to bring them before the courts. ""I would like to take this opportunity to praise both victims for coming forward and reporting these offences to the police. They have both shown immense patience whilst the criminal investigation has been ongoing and courage throughout the court process. ""The abuse both girls endured robbed them of their childhood and I hope seeing these men sentenced for these horrendous offences, will give them justice and some closure.""

'Shark Tank' Investor O'Leary Offers $20 Billion Cash to Buy China's TikTok,"Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary is offering $20 billion in cash to buy communist China's social media platform TikTok. During an interview Friday on Fox News's America's Newsroom , O'Leary said , ""Right now, $20 billion's on the table. Cash."" O'Leary said in March that he or another American would buy TikTok to keep it from being shut down, per Breitbart News. He stated at the time, ""It [is] not going to get banned. I'm going to buy it. Somebody will buy it. It won't be Meta and Google. A regulator will stop that. A syndicate will be formed. I'd like to be involved obviously. What I would do is form a bipartisan committee, an advisory committee for 18 months. Go to them and say to them, how much will you let me keep of the Chinese?"" There have been strong opinions regarding a potential ban of TikTok as users, who are mostly teenagers and young adults, do not want access interrupted or restricted, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. O'Leary's recent $20 billion offer comes after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law requiring the company to find a buyer or face being banned, the Fox report continued: In its decision, the Supreme Court backed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a law passed by Congress last April with wide bipartisan support. The law gave TikTok nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services. Congress has voiced concerns about how the app could be used as a weapon or a way to gather massive amounts of data from users. ""TikTok, ByteDance and several users of the app swiftly sued to block the ban in May, arguing the legislation would suppress free speech for the millions of Americans who use the platform,"" the Fox article reads. ""After a lower court upheld the ban, the Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok's emergency request to either block or pause implementation of the law under a fast-track timeline just nine days before the ban was slated to go into effect,"" it said. TikTok will ""go dark"" when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday unless a deal is made to keep it going, O'Leary said. Meanwhile, TikTok users are reportedly shifting over to another app called Xiaohongshu, or ""Little Red Book"" as the ban looms, Breitbart News reported on Friday. ""Xiaohongshu, which Chinese media is referring to as 'RedNote' in an apparent bid to distance it from its Mandarin name – is also controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and is named after all-time murder champion Mao Zedong's 'Little Red Book' of communism,"" the article said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:15:58+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-offers-20-billion-cash-buy-chinas-tiktok/
"GOP Rep. Pushes Bill Prohibiting State Bans on Certain Rifles, Shotguns","Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) introduced legislation this week that would prevent states from banning rifles and/or shotguns that are legal federally. The legislation, the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), would operate as a national preemption law, preventing states from banning firearms the federal government has not banned. Moreover, it would undo bans contained in laws like New York's SAFE Act. Rochester First quoted Tenney. ""The SAGA Act nullifies New York's unconstitutional SAFE Act and prevents other states from enacting laws that violate the Second Amendment,"" she said. ""This legislation upholds our country's founding principle of protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans, even from liberal states with anti-gun policies."" The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) reached out to Breitbart News regarding SAGA, noting that the measure is cosponsored by Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and Nick Langworthy (R-NY). CCRKBA chairman Alan Gottlieb pointed to the SAGA Act, noting that it allows ""America's gun owners...[to] put anti-gun lawmakers on notice that we're tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and that our rights are more important than their ill-advised crusade to disarm law-abiding Americans and erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.""

The AfD is an increasingly popular right-wing party which the EU establishment wants to isolate in a cordon sanitaire. According to the European Commission, Ms. Weidel's chat with Mr. Musk ""improperly boosts"" her agenda over her political rivals ahead of Germany's upcoming Feb. 23 elections and constitutes ""foreign interference"" in the German electoral process. Brussels has also reacted in outrage to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent announcement to end the fact-checking era on Facebook and restore free expression. Zuckerberg regretted that in the past, Facebook had suppressed information, and he confirmed years of systematic online censorship, either on demand of politically biased ""fact-checkers"" or under direct government pressure. While the American elections were ""a cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech,"" Mr. Zuckerberg pointed out that Europe has yet to come to the same conclusion. ""Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship,"" he said. The Meta boss was at once denounced by the European Commission. He is not telling the truth when he says the EU is institutionalizing censorship, European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen whined. It is ""not true"" and ""misleading,"" she wailed. At the same time, she took a snipe at Elon Musk for his support of AfD on X, threatening the platform with legal sanctions, saying that X has ""obligations under our Digital Services Act and X is supposed to assess and mitigate the risks they are posing to our electoral processes and to civic discourse."" Last December, the presidential elections in Romania were annulled after an outsider had surprisingly won the first round with 23 per cent of the vote. According to the EU bigwigs, this was the result of foreign ""disinformation"" spread via TikTok and other social media platforms. While the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA) pays lip service to freedom of speech, it acts as an instrument to restrict freedom of speech and censor social media platforms so that ""risks to the electoral processes and civic discourse"" are ""mitigated"". On these platforms, politicians such as I, who were the victims of media bias, but also every citizen, can freely speak our minds and voice our opinions without ""mitigation"" by the powers that be. The fact that platforms such as X and Facebook are owned by Americans is used as a xenophobic pretext to add ""foreign interference"" to ""the risks to Europe's electoral processes and civic discourse."" The EU uses the word ""democracy"" in the same way as the former Communist dictatorship in East-Germany used to call itself the German ""Democratic"" Republic. In the infamous G""D""R, ""democracy"" also needed to be protected against critics who were said to be in cahoots with foreign powers. I am the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), by far the most popular party in the Netherlands. For decades, the PVV and other parties like mine have hardly ever been fairly treated by mainstream journalists. But never did the European Commission voice any concern about how the disinformation about us might ""improperly boost"" our political adversaries or how it might subvert the ""electoral process."" I am not complaining, just pointing out the EU hypocrisy. I am not complaining, because guess what? The scandalous behaviour of the mainstream media had the same effect as water on a duck's back. It flowed off us. The voters kept coming to us because voters are mature enough to make their own decisions. For decades, we were also the victims of outright censorship by some social media outlets. Parties like mine have been censored online for years. I am one of many like-minded European politicians whose views were banned. Whenever we voiced our opinion on Islamization or mass immigration, so-called fact-checkers had our messages removed as ""hate speech"". It happened to me on Twitter — before that company was bought by Elon Musk — and on YouTube. Despite years of social media censorship, however, we kept winning the elections. Voters can feel when they are being lied to. They sense when they are being deceived. They realize well enough that the authorities are deceiving them when social media remains silent about what is happening on the streets of Europe. Indeed, the electorate is mature enough to make their own decisions. Companies like X and Facebook are abandoning censorship. I applaud them for that. The mainstream media say they ""sprint to kiss Trump's ring"" and ""suck up to the incoming president,"" but the decision is plain common sense. Censorship is a costly business and just not worth the effort. The mainstream media refuse to see it, but they are a dying breed. Who cares about what The Guardian writes? Parties such as mine have survived decades of media bias and disinformation; if anything, it has only made us stronger and more popular. Ultimately, we won. This will happen everywhere. Ultimately, freedom and truth will prevail! The only ""risk to the electoral processes"" that I see in Europe, is the EU ""interfering"" in elections because Brussels does not like the outcome and claims it has to protect ""democracy"" against the voters.

Maine Admits Licensing Transnational Criminal Organizations to Grow Marijuana,"Maine's Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) Director John Hudak told state legislators he is aware that his office has been issuing marijuana grow licenses to persons associated with Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO). On Wednesday, Hudak told members of the state legislature's Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee that his agency cannot deny the medical licensing requests. Hudak told the committee members that state statutes did not give his office the authority to deny the licenses to the suspected Transnational Criminal Organizations. Hudak's statements were made in response to concerns about illegal cannabis cultivation in parts of Maine that are believed to be controlled by Asian Transnational Criminal Organizations, including those with connections to China. Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow, told the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee legislators that individuals associated with the TCOs who have had to grow operations raided by authorities in the past are now using the medicinal license application process to continue their illicit activity and avoid law enforcement scrutiny. Hudak elaborated saying ""They're applying so they can have a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card, or what they perceive as a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card to continue to do the operations that they're doing."" Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) addressed the issue of foreign criminal organizations operating in her state with FBI Director Christopher Wray during a June FBI budget hearing just days after a Somerset County Sheriff's Office raid shut down an illegal growing operation that involved 1,500 marijuana plants and more than 30 pounds of processed marijuana. The unlawful growing operation was located adjacent to a daycare. During the hearing, Collins asked Wray, ""What is the theory about why Chinese nationals or Chinese Transnational Criminal Organizations are setting up these illegal marijuana growing operations in states like Maine?"" Wray responded saying the FBI was actively conducting several investigations into the connections between illegal grow operations and the Chinese government itself. Still, no clear connections had been established at the time. Wray did, however, acknowledge the agency is seeing more ties between the growing operations and Chinese organized crime. As for why the Chinese TCOs are choosing to engage in illicit marijuana cultivation, Wray went on to say, ""Our assessment is that it's a combination of the fact that it is activity that can be done relatively cheaply, and by comparison to other drugs in the United States, the consequences that they face from a legal perspective are not as severe as that they might be in other countries where they might also want to operate."" Collins has spearheaded several efforts to address the issue that she believes is assisting the Chinese TCO's to launder money for other purposes, including to bring more fentanyl into the country. The latest admission that state licensing officials knowingly provide cover for the illicit growing operations will likely hinder federal efforts to crack down on the foreign TCOs operating within the state.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T14:28:45+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/18/maine-admits-licensing-transnational-criminal-organizations-to-grow-marijuana/
GRAPHIC: Cartel Gunmen Behead Rivals as Mexican Officials Claim Crime Dramatically Lower,"Three days of shootouts led to several dead gunmen and a gory beheading as members of the terrorist organization Cartel Jalisco New Generation continued their push for control of the western state of Michoacan. This escalation in violence comes one day before Mexican government officials talked about how crime has decreased in recent weeks. On Friday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her top security officials held a news conference. During the presentation, they displayed a series of statistics claiming that violence had decreased in states like Sinaloa and Guerrero. They also claimed to have made numerous arrests and seized various weapons, causing noticeable decreases in crime. Hours before the news conference, gunmen from Cartel Jalisco New Generation photographed themselves beheading a rival in the state of Michoacan. The killing came at the end of three days of constant shootouts as CJNG has been pushing into the town of Apatzingan to take over areas controlled by a small cartel called Knights Templar. The latter cartel is allied with a ""self-defense"" group run by the narco-terrorist Juan Jose ""El Abuelo"" Farias. As Breitbart Texas first reported last year, several smaller cartels from Michoacan, including Los Viagras, the forces of El Fresa, El Boto, and others, joined forces with CJNG to fight off their rivals. Earlier this year, CJNG and its allies announced that they would be making a push for APatzingan and the surrounding communities and try to push out the Knights Templars. Since then, violence has escalated throughout the state. As Breitbart Texas reported , El Abuelo Farias has a long history of crime in Michoacan and other parts of the country and has been arrested in the past on organized crime and drug trafficking charges. However, in 2018 and other prior cases, Mexican judges ordered his release under suspicious circumstances. For several years, Michoacan has been ground zero to a fierce turf war as various organizations continue to fight for control of lucrative drug production and drug trafficking routes into Mexico.

Ukrainian Police Raid Draft-Dodgers in Nationwide Conscription Searches,"Ukrainian police conducted nationwide raids on draft dodger gangs on Friday as the country battles to generate enough conscripted soldiers to keep its military competitive in the war against Russia without radically widening recruitment criteria. The National Police of Ukraine said they conducted ""over 200 searches"" of gangs assisting illegal border crossings by adult Ukrainian males, who have been banned from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia's invasion in 2022. The searches ""at the premises of persons involved in illegal transactions"" took place in 19 of 27 Ukrainian regions, police said Friday. According to the AFP news agency, the raids against draft dodging-enabling gangs followed searches of 600 addresses last week. In a statement, Ukraine's police said draft-dodging crimes are ""committed through fraud, forgery of documents, unauthorized interference in the operation of electronic registers, and bribery of officials."" Announcing the latest raids, Ukraine's police published images, including one anonymised picture [top] of officers wearing police and 'Cyberpolice Department' patches on their coats accompanying fatigue-wearing armed officers of the national police's Special Patrol unit. While Ukraine has over a million men in its conscription army, thousands of nationals have evaded call-up orders or registration on the national database. As previously reported in 2023, 20,000 military-aged men were known to have illegally crossed Ukraine's borders by that point to flee abroad. Ukraine's border guards said then they had caught another 21,000 at the frontier and brought them back into the country. While many will presumably have fled out of concern for their own lives, attempting to go abroad is not without risks, with the Ukrainian government stating in Spring 2024 that they know of 30 people who died trying to flee the country . A spokesman for the government said those who died had attempted to get out of Ukraine by trying to cross hazardous mountain passes, swimming border rivers, and in some cases, had even been killed by wild animals in the wilderness, presumably bears, which are common in that part of Europe. Some reportedly have frozen to death trying to cross the Carpathian mountains. It is claimed that the recent crackdown on draft dodgers has caused ""panic"" among those avoiding enlistment and the criminal gangs that support them. Even before this recent change in tactics, military officers in ""conscription squads"" patrolled the streets of Ukrainian cities, checking the identities of men to ensure they had entered their details in the national database and were not fugitives if call-up papers had been served. In 2024, men were dragged out of a Kyiv nightclub if they were unable to show their identity papers or produce proof of exception from conscription amid overnight raids on restaurants, shops, and music venues. UK broadcaster the BBC noted a wedding of a young Ukrainian couple where half the guests didn't show up because they were in hiding from conscription and felt turning up was too risky, and noted: ""For those avoiding the draft, public transport is now off limits. So, too, are restaurants, supermarkets, and weekend trips to the park to play football."" The broadcaster cited the remarks of one conscription officer who said of the people he was rounding up at train stations: ""I don't consider them men. What are they waiting for? If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes, rape their women, and kill their children."" Those caught dodging can face criminal prosecution. But as reported in the Ukrainian press this week , courts can take a lenient view in rare cases. A Poltava man who was discovered to have been served call-up papers but who had ignored them for a year was let off with one year on probation as the judge noted he has an elderly mother who was dependent on his care, has a young child, and that he had made regular donations of money to the military. Ukraine reduced its minimum age of conscription from 27 to 25 last year, a difficult and unpopular decision the government had resisted in a bid to avoid a post-war demographic crisis by risking the deaths of the country's generation of future parents. The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is in the 40s. There have been protests in Ukraine by groups of wives, mothers, and children against the fact conscription is open-ended and lasts for the duration of the conflict. Protesters state they want their men back and call for a return of the pre-war standard of an 18-month callup.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T12:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/ukrainian-police-raid-draft-dodgers-in-nationwide-conscription-searches/
W.H.O. Demands World Give It $1.5 Billion to Handle Emergencies,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) launched a campaign on Thursday urging the world to invest $1.5 billion into its emergency fund – a separate pool of money from its regular operations funding intended to address health crises around the world. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus launched the campaign at a press conference on Thursday accompanied by an over 100-page brochure detailing the various global health emergencies the W.H.O. intends to address, focusing heavily on the collapse of a functioning state in Afghanistan, poor conditions caused by Hamas terrorists exploiting health centers to hide fighters and terrorists in Gaza, and the spread of cholera, malaria, and monkeypox (mpox) in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.N. agency predicted that it would have to address 42 health emergencies around the world in 2025. The costly appeal follows years of bad press as a result of the W.H.O.'s poor performance under Director-General Tedros. The W.H.O. was at the forefront of efforts in early 2020 to assure global observers that the highly contagious novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, was not capable of ""human-to-human transmission"" and later published a report on the origins of the virus so lacking in clarity that Tedros himself condemned it. Scores of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have accused W.H.O. staffers of raping them for forcing them to have sex for much-needed jobs or other humanitarian needs. In 2023, the W.H.O. paid some of the victims $250 and offered them baking classes. Tedros obtained a second term at the helm of the world's largest public health body in 2022 in an election in which he ran unopposed. The W.H.O. emergency appeal touted the agency's work in DRC, among other countries, as a prime reason for requesting upwards of a billion dollars in additional funding. The breakdown of how the agency expected to spend that money listed DRC as one of the least expensive crises for 2025, however, using up only about $2 million of the $1.5 billion requested. The most expensive crisis on the list is that in Gaza, labeled as the ""occupied Palestinian territory."" The W.H.O. is asking for nearly $300 million to address the situation in the war-torn area controlled by Hamas for nearly two decades. The W.H.O. is also asking for $141 million to offer health care and other aid to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of the Assad family dynasty in December. The ongoing crisis in Sudan, it predicted, would require $135 million to address in 2025. ""The climate crisis, increasingly frequent and severe disasters, and unprecedented levels of conflict are jeopardizing health and decimating health systems, making those displaced more susceptible to disease, and disrupting lifesaving, vaccinations and care, particularly for children,"" Tedros and W.H.O. Emergencies Director Michael Ryan wrote in a message accompanying the appeal. ""We are no longer moving from emergency to recovery but instead enduring rolling crises that extend across years and decades, making health services inaccessible to many,"" they continued. ""Yet, as the urgent need for assistance grows, the global financial landscape is shrinking, forcing us to make increasingly difficult decisions about whom we can reach and how far we can go."" In a press conference to announce the push, Tedros insisted that health crises in the modern era were ""relentless, overlapping, and intensifying."" ""Without adequate and sustainable funding we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not,"" he noted grimly. The two branded offering funding to the W.H.O. a ""powerful act of global solidarity"" that could ""save lives ... uphold the universal right to health, and to help restore peace to communities."" The appeal emphasized that this $1.5 billion is intended for the W.H.O. Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE), not the general pool of funding for the W.H.O. The CFE is distinct from general funding in that it is easier and faster to use those funds and is intended, the agency explained, to ""revolutionize how public health emergencies are addressed."" While claiming the funds will be used to address health emergencies explicitly, the appeal's brochure repeatedly emphasizes the agency's fixation on ""climate change,"" declaring it ""a health crisis"" itself ""wreaking havoc on human health, societies, economies, and overwhelming health care systems worldwide."" ""Climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, are intensifying disease outbreaks and worsening health inequities,"" the W.H.O. claimed. ""WHO leads emergency responses and builds resilience in health systems to mitigate these impacts."" The agency also claimed the money would help in the ""prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, asserting it would fund ""strengthening the prevention of, and response to, genderbased violence, including capacity-building and increased accountability within W.H.O."" This commitment did not specifically address the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in DRC. The W.H.O.'s appeal arrived less than a week before the United States, one of the W.H.O.'s most generous donors historically, welcomes President-elect Donald Trump into the White House once again. Trump famously cut funding and withdrew from the agency in 2020 in response to its catastrophic handling of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, declaring that the W.H.O. ""failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable."" Outgoing President Joe Biden reintegrated America into the W.H.O. and restored funding. Multiple reports following Trump's election in November indicated that the president-elect is planning to withdraw from the W.H.O. ""immediately"" after taking office.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T04:20:44+00:00,National Security,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/17/w-h-o-demands-world-1-5-billion-emergencies/
Exclusive—Sen. Tim Sheehy Ushers in Bold New Era of MAGA Leadership: ‘This Country Was Not Founded by 65-Year-Old Bureaucrats’,"The United States ""was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats"" but by patriotic young risk takers, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) explained in a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Marlow opined that officials in President Joe Biden's administration like Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had ""no leadership qualities."" He questioned why the Democrats support these establishment politicians and get ""offended"" when Republicans support ""natural leaders"" who are ""outside the box thinkers"" like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth, who have been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve in his new administration. Sheehy agreed that ""leadership matters"" and said that the U.S. is dealing with multiple disasters–such as rising inflation and a ""wide open border""–because the country is being led by bureaucrats who have ""really never done anything else in their"" lives outside of politics. ""Leadership matters and decisiveness matters, and this country was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats,"" Sheehy said. ""The signers of the Declaration of Independence, I think the average age of the signers was like 24 years old. I mean, you look at — some of them were 18, 19, 21 years old. Thomas Jefferson was 33... These were young people who had a vision for the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, which is this country."" ""It wasn't 80-year-old, career government bureaucrats who took the risk to craft a new concept of human governance,"" he continued. ""It was young people who were creative, who had a decisive vision and were willing to take the risk to act on it."" Sheehy added that ""in the last 50 years,"" the U.S. ""drifted away"" from having younger political leaders and shifted instead towards having ""highly educated, highly qualified, very experienced, bureaucrats to run the government."" ""This technocrat concept, which, you know, Obama put that on afterburners and Biden just took it to a whole level further,"" Sheehy continued. ""This whole technocrat outlook–where we need these people who've really never done anything else in their life other than be involved in government policy–and the downfall of that is exactly what we're seeing. The results are laid bare: Afghanistan disaster; $36 trillion in debt and growing rapidly disaster; wide open border; 20 million illegal immigrants; we have foreign policy crises around the world; rapid inflation; record interest rates."" ""Pick a category that's going well and show it to me, because I don't think there's any of them,"" Sheehy concluded. ""And, we've been led there by people who are apparently so highly qualified to be doing it.""

Exclusive—‘No Excuse’: Former Aerial Firefighter Sen. Tim Sheehy Details What CA Got Wrong Ahead of Wildfire Disaster,"There was ""no excuse"" for California not to be prepared for the wildfires engulfing Los Angeles County, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT), a former aerial firefighter, explained during a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Sheehy detailed the scope of the Los Angeles wildfires, the government's role in the disaster, and the environmental policies that make firefighting more difficult. Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL who founded the aerial fire fighting company Bridger Aerospace, explained that ""the entire wildland fire community"" has been sounding the alarm for years that ""we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness"" in fighting wildfires. Sheehy noted that over the past 18 months there have been increasingly destructive wildfires in states as far-flung as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Texas; and, thus, he argued that there was ""no excuse"" for California to have been unprepared for a similar situation. ""It's not just me saying it,"" he said. ""The entire wildland fire community has really been screaming from the rooftops for years that we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness for these types of disasters. Just look at the last 18 months. Lahaina, Maui — remember that was wiped off the map? One hundred people [were] killed. In December and November, we had fires burning in New Jersey. Last year in February, March, we had the Smokehouse Creek fire in Texas, [the] largest fire in Texas history, second largest fire in American history. And then, of course, now we're seeing literally... L.A. burning to the ground in front of us."" Sheehy added that wildfires were ""threats we can prepare for and can fight."" ""What we're seeing in L.A. particularly is the confluence and culmination of decades of wrong-headed policies that have put common sense on the back burner and instead prioritized a bunch of really goofy priorities,"" he said. He noted that the wildfires that occurred in California were not a ""Pearl Harbor moment where the first time it ever happened, nobody saw it happen."" ""This has been happening all the time. I mean, Paradise, California, wiped off the map; Lahaina, Maui, wiped off the map; as I said all the other fires I listed,"" Sheehy explained. ""This threat is not a one-time out-of-nowhere typhoon. This is something that happens every single year for decades. And there's no excuse not to be prepared. I think for those in the industry, we were more prepared about 30, 40 years ago. We had a far more supportive environment for what we called full suppression, which is when we basically have a lot of helicopters, a lot of airplanes, a lot of firefighters ready to go."" Sheehy explained that we had been seeing a ""massive decrease in suppression preparedness,"" and he attributed the decrease in wildfire suppression preparedness to environmentalists who have ""taken over"" and said, ""'Nope, fighting fire is bad.'"" He noted in particular the resistance from environmentalists to the use of water additives in fighting fires. ""Every other country in the world that fights wildfire puts foam and gel additives into the water so when they spray the fire, just like a fire extinguisher, the water foams up and is three to six times more effective to suppress that fire,"" Sheehy explained. ""Every other country in the world does that, except for, ding, ding, ding, America. And, why? Because the environmentalists have said, 'Nope, those foams could be bad for the endangered goldfish in that pond, so therefore you can't use that.'"" ""Two things can be true,"" Sheehy added. ""We can want to protect our environment and take care of our endangered species. We can also want to protect our communities and protect our people from getting burned alive and their houses burned down. We can do both. Right now, we've chosen, instead to prioritize the protection of spotted owls, and trees, and salamanders, and goldfish instead of our communities.""

Elizabeth Warren Accuses Longtime Democrat Donor Sam Altman of Seeking 'Favors' from Trump After $1 Million Inaugural Donation,"Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) in a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accused the tech entrepreneur of wanting ""favors"" from President-elect Donald Trump after donating $1 million to his inaugural committee; Altman has been a longtime donor to Democrats. ""Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats...,"" Altman wrote on X, sharing the letter he received from the two Senate Democrats. Altman has confirmed to outlets he plans to attend Trump's inauguration on Monday. It appears that the two Democrats have accused Altman of seeking some form of a quid-pro-quo scheme. ""You have a clear and direct interest in obtaining favors from the incoming administration: your company and many other Big Tech donors are already the subject of ongoing federal investigations and regulatory actions,"" Warren and Bennet claimed. The two continued, saying that the ""industry's efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules."" ""This would be good for billionaire tech executives, but is bad for America,"" they added. Warren and Bennet also said that the donation ""raise[s] questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration."" The two Senate Democrats are attacking the OpenAI CEO as many outlets have reported that Altman has overwhelmingly donated to Democrats over Republicans. In one July report, Newsweek wrote that Altman has donated to hundreds of Democrats and just one Republican. Even a cursory glance at federal election databases show that Altman has been a major funder of the Democrat Party. Altman wrote on X that his own donation ""was a personal contribution as you state; i am confused about the questions given that my company did not make a decision.""",Breitbart,2025-01-18T02:02:37+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/elizabeth-warren-accuses-longtime-democrat-donor-sam-altman-of-seeking-favors-from-trump-after-1-million-inaugural-donation/
First Female Los Angeles Fire Chief Faces Calls to Resign as Blazes Rage On,"Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Chief Kristin Crowley, the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the position, is facing calls to resign as the destructive wildfires rage on in Southern California. Crowley has found herself in an awkward situation with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D), who has also received demands to step down, after she said the city ""failed"" her department and claimed that budget cuts ""limited"" their ability to respond to ""large-scale events."" The fire chief, who was appointed by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) in 2022, then ""disappeared"" into a closed-door meeting in Bass's office last Friday ""for so long that they missed an evening news briefing,"" the New York Times reported. Sources close to the situation told the Daily Mail that the mayor summoned Crowley to her office to fire her but said, ""Whatever happened in that meeting, minds got changed."" ""[Crowley] was going into the meeting, telling everybody goodbye, because she was told the whole purpose of the meeting was to fire her,"" the source told the U.K. outlet. By the next morning, the Times reported that the chief and the mayor were ""projecting a unified front, though the tension was apparent."" ""The chief and I are in lock step,"" the mayor, who also entered her role in 2022, said. ""And if there are differences that we have, we will continue to deal with those in private."" Firefighters are still trying to extinguish the nearly 40,000 acres of active wildfires, which have killed at least 27 people since they began on January 7, NBC News reported. The drama intensified when active and retired LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators wrote a scathing letter demanding that Crowley step down: Arguing that the chief's statement that the city ""failed"" her department was ""ill-advised"" and ""poorly timed,"" the coalition of unnamed current and former local fire officials concluded that Crowley has ""lost the confidence of the Mayor and more importantly you have lost the confidence of many Chief Officers of the LAFD."" The group also claimed in the letter that the controversial chief knew about the LAFD's budget issues before she entered the role but ""went along"" with the budget cuts, per NewsNation: Another large portion of criticism directed at the department's leader stems from the fact that a shift of about 1,000 firefighters were ""not on standby"" when powerful winds swept through Los Angeles, picking up embers and rapidly spreading the flames, the California Globe reported. There also were not any additional firetrucks positioned in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood — where the initial major blaze sparked last Tuesday — in advance, the outlet noted.

"Americans Increasingly Saying No to Sex, Especially Amongst Young Men","Americans are increasingly losing their appetite for sex, especially amongst young men, according to a government study. Sexlessness has climbed among adults aged 22-34 years old, data from the National Survey of Family Growth found. This trend is especially profound with the youth, with 10 percent of young males and seven percent of young females claiming that they are still virgins. ""In sum, for young adult males, sexlessness has roughly doubled across all measures over the last 10 years or so. For young adult females, it has risen by roughly 50 percent,"" the Institute of Family Studies (IFS), which analyzed the study, stated. Twenty-four percent of males in this age bracket had reported not having sex between 2022-2023, which is up nine percent compared to 2013-2015. For women, that figure is up 13 percent from eight percent. When asked if he or she had sex in the last three months, 35 percent of men and 31 percent of women said that they had not. Among those that are having sex aged 22-34 years-old, more are finding less love. The Institute of Family Studies blamed a lack of matrimony as one of the biggest drivers for lack of sex. ""One of the biggest drivers of declining sexual activity is the decline in marriage. Married people have more sex, and for most young adults, marriage is occurring later or not at all. As a result, sex is declining,"" the IFS wrote . The institute continued: There was a rise in the share of heterosexual males with no female sexual partners in the last year—but it was driven mostly by a decline in the number of males with one female partner, and secondarily by a decline in the number of men with two. There was no change at all in the prevalence of heterosexual men with large numbers of female sexual partners. Thus, what we can actually observe is not that a small number of men are having sex with more and more women, but simply that men and women are failing to couple off together: the major decline is in sex between people who only had sex with one person in the prior year, i.e. approximately monogamous sex. A Pew Research study found that 25 percent of Americans 40-years old and younger had never been married.",Breitbart,2025-01-24T21:11:22+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/pre-viral/2025/01/24/americans-increasingly-saying-no-to-sex-especially-amongst-young-men/
Nebraska went big for Trump—and that may kill its economy,"Nearly 60% of Nebraskavotedfor Donald Trump last November. There is perhaps no state more dependent on immigrants than Nebraska. Oops. Thisexcellent NPR storyhighlights the challenges this Trump-loving state now faces as a result of its voters' choices. ""Nebraska is one of the top meat producers in the U.S. It also has one of the worst labor shortages in the country,"" reporter Jasmine Garsd writes. ""For every 100 jobs, there are only 39 workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."" She mentions the executive director of the state's pork producer's association as smiling ""wearily"" as colleagues urge attracting more immigrants to the state to help fill positions ... and yet they vote for the guy who wants to deport them all. On the other hand, there remains a staunch belief that Trump won't actually carry out his mass deportation threats. ""There's no way it can,"" the pork guy says about the deportations. And for now, maybe he's right. Trump seems more interested in usingperformative raidsin Chicago and other sanctuary cities to demonize local Democratic politicians and officials who refuse to do his bidding (which they aregenerally permitted to do). Trump may rip a few dozen undocumented immigrants out of their new community, but he's more interested in a raid's propaganda value than he is in its results. If he really wants to deport masses of undocumented immigrants, there's an obvious place to start: red states. Many Republican governors have offered to help. Take Nebraska. ""I am encouraged by the strength of President Trump's immigration and border security orders,"" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillensaid in a statementthis past Tuesday. ""The state of Nebraska will support these efforts. On my return to Lincoln this week, I will issue an executive order to all state agencies directing them to cooperate to the full extent of the law with federal efforts to enforce our immigration laws and affirmatively support the apprehension of criminal aliens."" The NPR story quotes a lovely parishioner at an Episcopalian church who is working to serve and protect the state's immigrant community: ""I think there's still enough in our Nebraska DNA that we do depend on each other. We come from storms, weather incidents, where you depend on your neighbors and you go dig somebody out of a snowstorm. Even if you don't really like them, you go dig them out because it's what you do. Because we're Nebraska."" That parishioner says people in the state ""understand the economic necessity of [immigrant labor], and we are not stupid.""

The origins of Trump’s war on diversity,"Explaining the Rightis a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know. Donald Trump spent his first week in office using the power of the presidency to attack decades of actions to promote diversity. Trumpissued executive ordersrolling back desegregation orders, instructing government offices that promote diversity to be shuttered, and laying off workers tasked with promoting inclusion. He even threatened federal employees, ordering them tosnitch on each otherto expose any pro-diversity positions that might have flown under the radar. Trump, of course, has along history of racism, and the conservative movement and Republican Party he leads has frequently voiced opposition to social progress. But the executive actions in his second administration are occurring with a level of vigor much higher than in his first term. So what happened? In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set offa series of protestsagainst racial injustice throughout the United States and the world. While such protests have always occurred, the uprising of 2020 happened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic—and while Trump was in the White House, pursuing a racist agenda that includedpraising Nazisand other right-wing extremists. Conservatives, still reeling from significant advances from Barack Obama's presidency, chose to strike back by more forcefully opposing pro-diversity efforts in government, academia, and business. Activists like Christopher Ruforallied conservativesto attack diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and falsely claimed that the academic ""critical race theory,"" which discusses systemic racism, was being taught at all school levels rather than just in college. At the same time, conservative media—led by outlets like Fox News—attacked any and all advances toward racial and gender equity as ""woke,"" subverting the meaning of the term originally coined by Black activists to promote racial awareness. Suddenly, according to Fox,everything under the sunwas ""woke."" When M&M's added a female character to its advertising, Fox's Harris Faulkner complained that the brand was ""back to pushing woke politics, the company now introducing a new progressive pack of chocolates: women M&M's."" Conservative pundit Buck Sexton appeared on Fox to argue that lingerie company Victoria's Secret's choice to get rid of its ""angels"" concept was a sinister plot to ""go a little bit woke."" Similarly, leading Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisdeclaredthat his state was at war with ""woke."" DeSantis ordered the state to only use red, white, and blue lights on bridges—prohibiting lights that celebrate events like Pride Month or Juneteenth. He even wenton the attackagainst one of the state's biggest and most beloved companies, Disney, because diversified some of its content. Trump was involved in all of this by promoting attacks on diversity from within the presidency, includingfalsely labelingthe racial justice protests as being purely violent. Trump is also a habitual consumer of Fox News and the network has a demonstrated ability to influence his world view, as can be seen by the slew of Fox talking headsnow populatinghis administration. While Trump was adopting this posture, many of the former members of his administration and their ideological allies were concoctingProject 2025, which isextremely focusedon rolling back many civil rights gains and other advances—like same-sex marriage—that have occurred in the ensuing decades. Now in his second term, Trump has installed Project 2025 architects in his Cabinet and is already implementing their wish list. Trump began his political careerriding a waveof racist right-wing anger after the United States elected its first Black president. And now, he and his party have the civil rights movement squarely in their crosshairs.",Daily Kos,2025-01-26 00:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298925/-The-origins-of-Trump-s-war-on-diversity
How Eric Adams’ downfall led him straight into Trump’s arms,"In a recent interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, New York City Mayor Eric Adams alleged that the Democratic Party ""left"" him. ""People often say, 'Well, you know, you don't sound like a Democrat, and you know, you seemed to have left the party.' No, the party left me, and it left working-class people,"" said Adams, who is running for reelection as a Democrat against the backdrop of five federalcriminal charges. The roughly50-minuteinterview with Carlson, one of Donald Trump'smost ardent allies, is Adams' latest attempt to appeal to the president, whoexpressed a willingnessto pardon him for his crimes. It also represents a break from Adams' past attitudes toward Carlson.During his 2021 mayoral run, Adams said he didn't ""want or need the support of Tucker Carlson, or anyone else who perpetuates racist, anti-immigrant propaganda."" But a criminal case clearly changed his outlook. More recently, Adams' attempts to curry favor with the president have been downright pathetic, butwithout the helpof his constituents, Adams might need to bring in the big guns. During his conversation with Carlson, Adams criticized both the Biden administration and Democrats' immigration policies, which he onceclaimedthreatened to ""destroy New York City."" He also said that the indictment against him was politically motivated. ""You complained about allowing hundreds of thousands of illegals and this indictment was punishment for complaining,"" Carlson said. ""That is clearly my belief,"" Adams confirmed. Later, Carlson questioned why Republican-led states shouldn't bus asylum seekers to New York City. For years, red states like Texas havespent millions of dollarsbusing immigrants to blue cities like New York in what amounts to a cruel political stunt. ""Isn't it fair to send all their illegals here because you guys welcome them?"" Carlson asked, nodding to the fact that New York is asanctuary city, meaning it aims to shield immigrants from unwarranted enforcement actions, including arrest or deportation. ""No, we're not welcoming them. Let me be very clear,"" he said, adding thatformer President Joe Biden and his aides once told him to tamp down his criticism regarding the influx of immigrants to help the party during the 2024 presidential election. ""Basically, be a good Democrat, Eric,"" Adams said. ""That was the basic overall theme."" ""It appeared to me there was a bigger focus on the national election and not on what it was doing to the cities,"" Adams later said, nodding to the influx of immigrants in New York City that officials estimatecosts $5 billion. The interview aired on the Tucker Carlson Network Tuesday evening but, asPolitico reports, was never promoted on the mayor's public schedule. A spokesperson for Adamsalso told the outletthat it was Carlson who requested the interview. ""Mayor Adams does not believe we should be living in silos and speaking into echo chambers,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""At a time where our country is so divided, the mayor believes we must break out of our comfort zones and speak with everyone—even those we may not always agree with."" While Adams, at times, gently refused some of Carlson's claims, it was a relatively friendly chit-chat. But the timing of it is interesting, as it comes amid increased speculation that Adams is angling for a presidential pardon ahead of hisApril trial. Adams, who wasfirst electedin 2021, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud, and two counts of illegally soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign national. Since at least October, Adams has tried to play nice with Trump and other Republicans. That month, after Trump defended Adams and suggested that both of them had been unfairly ""persecuted,"" Adamsavoided criticizingTrump. Now Adams is done playing coy. Shortly after Trump's reelection in November, Adamsrequested a meetingwith Trump's incoming border czar, Tom Homan, then later danced around whether he'dconsider switching parties. Adams was a registered Republican from 1995 to 2002 before becoming a Democrat. Indeed, if party switching or, at the very least, cozying up to Republicans who are close to the president, is the way to win favor with Trump and the GOP, Adams' most recent interview and actions would suggest he's all in. On Monday, Adams scrapped his public scheduleto make the trekto Washington, D.C., after the Trump administration extended a last-minute invite to his inauguration. Adams, whopractically beggedTrump for a ticket, made the pilgrimage in thewee hours of the night. He had met with the president in Palm Beach, Florida,merely days prior. ""Inauguration Day is a sacred American tradition. Our country has been through so much, and every president has the honor and responsibility to protect and lead the American people,"" Adamswrote on X. ""I believe there's much we can achieve working alongside the federal government as we support our city's values and fight for New Yorkers."" Even if the interview with Carlson was just a formality, Trump is reportedly lapping up Adams' interest in his administration. According toRolling Stone, the president's allies have rightly called Adams ""thirsty"" for Trump's attention and even questioned when the ""actual begging and love letters start."" Adams isunlikely to be reelectedlater this year, so maybe his newfound fealty to the GOP is part of his backup plan once he's out of office. Or maybe he's angling for a role in Trump's Cabinet. After all, it is arevolving doorof senior-level administrators.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 22:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298270/-How-Eric-Adams-downfall-led-him-straight-into-Trump-s-arms
Maddow blasts Trump for his dangerous public health gag order,"The first few days of Donald Trump's second term have given Rachel Maddow a lot to cover, including the president's approach to public health. ""[Trump] has ordered that all information be stopped, including scientific information, to advise hospitals on how to deal with this emerging epidemic,"" Maddow said. The Trump administration's decision tocease all public-facing communicationfrom federal health agencies has been widely criticized. ""Is that popular? Is that a good idea? Is that perceived as a popular idea among the American people? Is that what you thought you were voting for?"" Maddow asked. ""You know what else isn't a popular idea? Bird flu."" Maddow went on to point out that the price of eggs hasskyrocketedas a result of the bird flu, inflating an already fraught economic situation. At the same time, Trump's choice to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has reportedlysolicited a raw milk purveyorto take up a role in the Food and Drug Administration. Scientists warn againstthe consumption of raw milkfor many reasons, least of which is that it canspread diseases like bird flu. ""In the meantime, stop releasing any information on this bird flu thing—anything,"" Maddow concluded. ""Honestly, it sounds scary. Maybe if we don't talk about it, maybe it'll go away. And by the way, pay no attention to the price of eggs."" Thebird fluhas affected livestock across the United States, from poultry to cattle. In January, thefirst human deathconnected with the disease was recorded in Louisiana.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 18:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/25/2298931/-Maddow-blasts-Trump-for-his-dangerous-public-health-gag-order
Hegseth confirmed as Trump's defense secretary in tie-breaking vote,"The Senate confirmedPete Hegsethas the nation's defense secretary Friday in a dramatic late-night vote, swatting back questions about his qualifications to lead the Pentagon amidallegations of heavy drinking and aggressive behaviortoward women. Rarely has a Cabinet nominee faced such wide-ranging concerns about his experience and behavior as Hegseth, particularly for such a high-profile role atop the U.S. military. But the Republican-led Senate was determined to confirm Hegseth, a former Fox News host and combat veteran who has vowed to bring a ""warrior culture"" to the Pentagon, rounding out PresidentDonald Trump'stop national security Cabinet officials. Vice President JD Vance was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote, unusual in the Senate for Cabinet nominees, who typically win wider support. Hegseth himself was at the Capitol with his family. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunesaid Hegseth, as a veteran of the Army National Guard who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, ""will bring a warrior's perspective"" to the top military job. ""Gone will be the days of woke distractions,"" Thune said, referring to the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives being slashed across the federal government. ""The Pentagon's focus will be on war fighting."" The Senate's ability to confirm Hegseth despite a grave series of allegations against him will provide a measure of Trump's political power and ability toget what he wants from the GOP-led Congress, and of the potency of the culture wars to fuel his agenda at the White House. Next week senators will be facing Trump's otheroutside Cabinet choicesincluding particularly Kash Patel, a Trump ally who has published an enemies list, as the FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard as director of the office of national intelligence; and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, the anti-vaccine advocate at Health and Human Services. ""Is Pete Hegseth truly the best we have to offer?"" said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, urging his colleagues to think seriously about their vote. Hegseth himself was working the phones late Friday to shore up his support, his confirmation at stake. ""He's a good man,"" Trump said of Hegseth while departing the White House to visit disaster-hit North Carolina and Los Angeles. ""I hope he makes it."" Trump leveled criticism of Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who announced they would vote against Hegseth. And Tump raised fresh questions about Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying, ""And of course Mitch is always a no vote, I guess. Is Mitch a no vote?"" In the end all three voted against Hegseth, as tensions soared late Friday at the Capitol. McConnell, the former GOP leader in the Senate, had not declared his vote, but signaled skepticism in an earlier speech when he declared he would confirm nominees to senior national security roles ""whose record and experience will make them immediate assets, not liabilities."" He voted against. It takes a simple majority to confirm Hegseth, and Republicans, with a 53-47 majority in the Senate, could only lose one more objection. One Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, sent the Senate swirling as he raised questions and was provided information and answers, said a person familiar with the situation Thursday and granted anonymity to discuss it. But Tillis ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth who he said ""has a unique perspective"" and is passionate about modernizing the military. He said he spoke to Hegseth for ""nearly two hour"" about his concerns. Democrats, as the minority party, have helped confirm Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand CIA DirectorJohn Ratcliffein bipartisan votes to Trump's national security team within days of his return to the White House. But Democrats gravely opposed to Hegseth have little power to stop him, and instead have resorted to dragging out the process. Hours before the vote, Democrat after Democrat took to the Senate floor to object. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said during the debate there are few Trump nominees as ""dangerously and woefully unqualified as Hegseth."" Hegseth facesallegations that he sexually assaulted a womanat a Republican conference in California, though he has denied the claims and said the encounter was consensual. He laterpaid $50,000 to the woman. More recently, Hegseth's former sister-in-lawsaid in an affidavitthat he was abusive to his second wife to the point that she feared for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegation, and in divorce proceedings, neither Hegseth nor the woman claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse. During afiery confirmationhearing, Hegseth dismissed allegations of wrongdoing one by one, and vowed to bring ""warrior culture"" to the top Pentagon post. Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job if confirmed. But Republican senators facing an intensive pressure campaign by Trump allies to support Hegseth have stood by his nomination, echoing his claims of a ""smear"" campaign against him. A Princeton and Harvard graduate, Hegseth represents a newer generation of veterans who came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He went on to a career at Fox News as the host of a weekend show, and was unknown to many on Capitol Hill until Trump tapped him for the top Defense job. Hegseth's comments that women should have no role in military combat drew particular concern on Capitol Hill, including from lawmakers who themselves served. He has since tempered those views as he met with senators during the confirmation process. Murkowski said in a lengthy statement ahead of a test vote on Hegseth that his behaviors ""starkly contrast"" with what is expected of the military. ""I remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,"" Murkowski wrote on social media. Collins said that after a lengthy discussion with Hegseth, ""I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed."" But one prominent Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a veteran and sexual assault survivor, came under harsh criticism for her skepticism toward Hegseth and eventually announced she would back him. Hegseth would lead an organization with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of $850 billion. In exercising its advise and consent role over Trump's nominees, the Senate is also trying to stave off his suggestion that the GOP leaders simply do away with the confirmation process altogether, and allow him to appoint his Cabinet choices when the Congress is on recess. Trump raised the idea of so-called ""recess appointments"" during a private White House meeting with Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a step many senators are trying to avoid.",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 03:09:35,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2299021/-Hegseth-confirmed-as-Trump-s-defense-secretary-in-tie-breaking-vote
GOP congressman makes oddly specific proposal to give Trump third term,"Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles has proposed legislation that would amend the Constitution, allowing Donald Trump to run for a third presidential term. ""I am proposing an amendment to the Constitution to revise the limitations imposed by the 22nd Amendment on presidential terms,"" Ogles saidin a statement. ""This amendment would allow President Trump to serve three terms, ensuring that we can sustain the bold leadership our nation so desperately needs."" Ogles also argued that the administration of President Joe Biden had left America in ""decay,"" echoing the false narrative offered by Trump and other Republicans.Nonpartisan datashows that under Biden the unemployment rate fell, crime decreased, and factory openings and infrastructure spending has significantly increased. Ogles' amendmentincludes the following wording: ""No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms."" The change would upend the current law as laid out in the22nd Amendment, which limits presidential terms to two. The only president in U.S. history to be elected to more than two terms was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat whonotably spentthe bulk of his presidency in a fight againstglobal fascismand buildingthe social safety net—while Trump hasembraced fascistsandseeks to cutthe net. But what is particularly notable is that the Ogles change includes a limit of two consecutive terms. There are four former presidents that are alive, in addition to Trump. Of those men, only two would be eligible for another shot at the presidency if Ogles had his way—Trump and Biden. The law would conveniently prohibit Presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush from running again because they all served two consecutive terms. Conveniently Trump's two-term Democratic predecessors all have electoral records significantly dwarfing Trump's track record. Trumpwonthe 2024 race with a popular vote margin of 1.5% and that is the only of the three times he has run for president that he received a popular vote majority or plurality (he lost the popular vote to former Sec. Hillary Clinton in 2016). By contrast, Obama has thesecond largestpopular vote margin of all the living presidents thanks to his 7.27% victory in 2008 against the late Sen. John McCain. Obama's reelection win also comes out well ahead of Trump, after he won by 3.86% in 2012 in his defeat of former Sen. Mitt Romney. Clinton, who is actually two months younger than Trump, also has a much better electoral track record. Clinton won by 5.56% in 1992 and by 8.51% in 1996—the biggest margin of the living presidents. Even his fellow Republican Bush, who like Trump also lost the popular vote before his first presidency, outperformed Trump. A constitutional amendment doesn't just need approval from Congress, but also hasto be ratifiedby 38 of the 50 states. Historically this has been a careful and deliberate process and extremely rare. The last amendment to be added is the 27th amendment, whichbecame lawin 1992. Ogles' proposal is the work of a Trump supporter attempting to extend his presidency in an impractical way. The congressman has been criticized in the comments ofhis Instagram accountfor pushing for the unlikely legislation just a day aftera school shootingin his district, arguably a more pressing concern. But then again, how else could he show his devotion to the MAGA cause?",Daily Kos,2025-01-25 00:00:26,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298973/-GOP-congressman-makes-oddly-specific-proposal-to-give-Trump-third-term
Trump gloats about pardoning criminals who attacked abortion clinic,"Donald Trump flexed his presidentialpardoning powers againon Thursday,granting clemencyto 23 anti-abortion lawbreakers. The move came one day ahead of the annual March for Life rally in Washington, D.C. On Friday, aprerecorded videoof Trump was broadcast to the anti-abortion marchers. In the video, Trump praised himself for pardoning the criminals, including extremist Paula Harlow. ""At 75 years old, Paula was sentenced to two years in prison, after praying outside of a clinic,"" he said. ""That's why she was sentenced to two years."" However, the facts paint a different picture. Harlow was one ofnine protestersindicted in March 2022 for using chains, ropes, furniture, and themselves to block the doors to a health care facility that provides abortions. Per theJustice Department, Harlow and the other eight lawbreakers ""forcefully entered the clinic"" as a means to keep people from accessing medical care that went against the activists' beliefs. Another pardoned woman—whom MAGA die-hard Charlie Kirkdescribedas a ""peaceful"" activist ""persecuted by the Biden regime""—is Bevelyn Williams. In reality, Williams was sentenced to 41 months in prison after shecrushed a clinic employee'shand and used other means to block peoples' access to the clinic, according to the Justice Department. She also threatened ""war"" on the clinic's staff, saying she would ""terrorize this place."" Presidential pardons aside, the thousands of anti-abortion marchers descending upon the nation's capital on Friday seem to forget one important aspect of the March for Life rally: They've already achieved their primary goal. Thefirst March for Lifewas held on Jan. 22, 1974, on the anniversary ofRoe v. Wade, in protest of the monumental case granting federal abortion rights to women. But after the conservative-controlled Supreme Court overturnedRoein 2022, states can nowban abortionto their anger's content. However, allowing states to ban abortion isn't enough for the anti-abortion extremists.

Trump ramps up pettiness by revoking more security—including for Fauci,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that he pulled federal security protection for former top U.S. health official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, making him the latest casualty of Trump's revenge tour. Fauci, whoretired from government servicein December 2022, served as the nation's top infectious diseases expert amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He was protected by federal marshals, and later by a private contractor, that was paid for by the National Institutes of Health, according to The New York Times. Sources close to the situation also told CNN,which first reported the move, that Fauci's detail was abruptly terminated on Thursday evening. This past June, Fauci said he and his familystill receive death threats, in part, because right-wing figures like Trump repeatedly promoted baseless lies about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine. ""It's a pattern,"" Fauci toldCNN, adding that when someone in the media or Congress ""gets up and makes a public statement that I'm responsible for the deaths of X number of people because of policies or some crazy idea that I created the virus— immediately you can, it's like clockwork—the death threats go way up."" In May 2022, for instance, a West Virginia manpleaded guiltyto sending Fauci and other federal officials emails that threatened to kill them. Given that, and the public-facing role Fauci played during the pandemic, he's now hired his own private security that he'll pay for himself. During a press conference in North Carolina on Friday, Trumpdefended the moveas a natural progression that comes once officials no longer serve in the federal government. He also suggested that Fauci has more than enough money to pay for his own security detail. ""When you work for [the] government at some point your security detail comes off and you know, you can't have it forever. So I think it's very standard,"" Trump said. ""We took some off other people, too. But you can't have a security detail for the rest of your life because you work for [the] government."" Of course, this is easy to say if you're president, as they getprotection for the rest of their lives. This is the latest move in Trump's revenge arc. Earlier this week, heyanked security detailfrom his former national security adviser, John Bolton, whosharply criticizedthe president in his memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened."" Trumpcited the memoiras one of his reasons for revoking Bolton's security detail. ""The memoir's reckless treatment of sensitive information undermined the ability of future presidents to request and obtain candid advice on matters of national security from their staff,"" Trump said in theexecutive orderfrom Monday that announced the move. ""Publication also created a grave risk that classified material was publicly exposed."" (Not that Trump has ever been accused ofdoing such a thing.) In addition to Bolton, Trump also moved to end security details for former Secretary of StateMike Pompeoand former State Department officialBrian Hook. Both men were granted additional protection because they faced threats from Iran. At least, in Fauci's case, Trump might not be able to retaliate against him personally.

California governor to crash Trump's photo op in fire-ravaged state,"President Donald Trump is set to follow his Friday visit to North Carolina, which was hit by Hurricane Helene, with a trip to wildfire-ravaged Southern California. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a longtimeTrump nemesis, said he has yet to hear from the president—but plans to greet him at the airport anyway. ""I look forward to being there on the tarmac to thank the president, welcome him, and we're making sure that all the resources he needs for a successful briefing are provided to him,""Newsom saidto reporters on Thursday in Pasadena, where he signed two bills greenlighting $2.5 billion in recovery efforts. ""There's no limit to the resources we'll provide for that briefing."" Wildfirescontinueto batter Southern California, with a new one threatening San Diego County as of Friday. Fueled by record winds, the firestorm has killed 25 people and caused a staggering$250 billionin estimated damages, making it one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history. Despite the devastation, Trump and theGOP-led Congresshave floated the idea of withholding federal aid for the Golden State. He has also lied and said that California officials mismanaged the water supply after some fire hydrants in the Pacific Palisades area ran dry at the height of the fires. Los Angeles firefightersrefutedthis claim, arguing that hurricane-strength winds battering a drought-ravaged landscape mean ""no water system in the world"" could've stopped the wildfires. Trump has repeatedly spreadmisinformationabout the causes of the Los Angeles fires and suggested he will not release any aid unless the state changes its policies or caves on his mass deportation plans. On Friday, he told reporters he wants mandatory voter identification added to the list of capitulations he's demanding from the progressive state—something experts say leads tovoter suppression. ""People want to have voter identification. You want to have proof of citizenship. Ideally, you have one-day voting. But I just want voter ID as a start, and I want the water to be released,"" Trump said on a tarmac in Asheville, North Carolina, repeatingnonsensical claimsabout California's water supply. ""After that, I will be the greatest president that California has ever seen."" Trump also repeatedlysaidhe plans to overhaul or get rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is tasked with responding to natural disasters. ""I think we're going to recommend that FEMA go away,"" Trump said, adding that he'd dismantle the agency by signing an executive order. AsDaily Kosreported, this is sure to hit the red states that voted for him the hardest. Trump has ahistoryof playing politics with cities and states devastated by natural disasters if their leaders and voters disagree with him politically. His tried-and-true gambits include issuing threats via social media and spreading misinformation and conspiracies about FEMA recovery efforts, with conservative mediafollowing his lead. As apossible 2028 Democratic presidential contender, Newsom is not backing down from his standoff with Trump. Despite the ongoing tensions, he has consistently emphasized that his focus remains on getting aid to Californians, and not on petty partisan squabbles. ""My message to the incoming administration, and I'm not here to play any politics, is please don't play any politics,"" Newsom said during a Jan. 7 press conference. It's hard to ignore the sense that for Trump, this trip is more about posturing than problem-solving, and Newsom's challenge to the new administration has set the stage for a potential confrontation. But the Golden State's dire need has made the political chess game all the more frustrating for the thousands of people affected by the fires.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 21:00:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298934/-California-governor-to-crash-Trump-s-photo-op-in-fire-ravaged-state
Boebert mocked in her home state for playing anti-trans bathroom cop,"Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert was mocked on-air by a news anchor from her home state after the Republican was caught patrolling a bathroom on the lookout for transgender people. ""Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert is tackling a key issue driving the high cost of living for Coloradans: Whether the one transgender woman in Congress is using the right bathroom,"" 9News anchor Kyle Clark said. The event, which Clark described as a ""restroom inquisition,""was witnessedby Bloomberg reporter Billy House. House said he saw Boebert running out of the Capitol's women's restroom on Thursday afternoon and that she complained to security that ""a guy"" was inside. Boebert then wrangled Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been themost vocal anti-trans figurein Congress, and took her into the bathroom to investigate. The two women later exited, without uncovering ""a guy"" as had been claimed. ""There was a rumor there was, but it wasn't true,"" Boebertlater admittedto House. Following the election win of Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, the first openly trans person to serve in Congress, Mace led a crusade in November toadopt a rulesegregating bathrooms in the Capitol by ""biological sex."" Speaker Mike Johnson agreed and initiated the restriction. At the time, Florida Rep. Maxwell Frostsaid, ""I just don't understand why bathrooms are top of mind for her, why she's thinking about where future members are going to piss and shit."" Months later, Boebert and Mace are clearly still on the case, diligently patrolling the bathroom to ensure that the ""proper"" genitalia is in use to comply with the speaker's rules. But it will not lower the price of eggs or in any way assist the residents of their home states.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 20:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298945/-Boebert-mocked-in-her-home-state-for-playing-anti-trans-bathroom-cop
Musk continues to overstep his authority—and Trump is pissed,"Allies of Donald Trump are annoyed that ""First Buddy"" Elon Muskcontinues to assert his dominanceover the president. In fact, one White House official toldPoliticothat the unelected co-president ""very much"" overstepped when he trashed a recent artificial intelligence project that the president had announced. Earlier this week, Trump publicized a newStargate ventureto help grow AI infrastructure in the United States. The new entity will also start building out a data center and the electricity generation needed for therapidly growing AI in Abilene, Texas, according to the White House. With an initial investment of $100 billion, there are plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. ""This monumental undertaking is a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential,"" Trumptold reportersat the White House on Tuesday. ""We're going to make it as easy as it can be."" Hours after the announcement, in a rather unprecedented move, Musk took to his social media platform, X, to dunk on the deal. He claimed that OpenAI, whose leaders, along with those from Oracle and SoftBank, had stood alongside Trump during the announcement, is too poor to fulfill its high-dollar pledge. In a sense, the Tesla CEO divulged the rocky ground beneath Trump's deal while elevating his own knowledge of AI and tech. This is sure tofurther inflamethealready shaky relationshipbetween the two self-imagined strongmen. ""They don't actually have the money,"" Muskwroteon X in response to a post from OpenAI announcing the digital infrastructure deal. ""SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority."" Musk alsoreshared a postfrom another X user who suggested that Sam Altman,a Trump cronyand OpenAI's CEO, and his team smoked crack to ""come up with their $500 billion number for Stargate."" According toFortune, OpenAI and SoftBank will lead the project, with SoftBank taking on the venture's financial responsibility and OpenAI assuming operational duties. Altmancalled Stargate ""the most important project of this era."" One can imagine, then, that Trump wasn't too pleased when Musk pooh-poohed it. One Trump ally told Politico that Musk isabusing his relationshipwith the president; another claimed Trump's staff was ""furious"" over Musk's various X posts. ""It's clear [Musk] has abused the proximity to the president,"" the Trump ally said. ""The problem is the president doesn't have any leverage over him and Elon gives zero fucks."" It's possible that Musk's temper tantrum was a result of the fact that he seemingly wasn't invited to Tuesday's White House presser. Notably, Muskowns an AI startupand has long been critical of Altman, hisonetime partnerin the burgeoning AI world. (Altman and Musk cofounded OpenAI, but Musk later departed and sued Altman and the company, alleging that they betrayed the firm's founding principles. Musk dropped this lawsuit before filing another. In the second suit, Musk claimed he was ""deceived"" into cofounding the company.) At least publicly, Trump attempted to downplay Musk's actions and blamed his diatribe on X on Musk'sdisdain for Altman. ""The government's not putting up anything. They're putting up money. They're very rich people, so I hope they do,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""And, I mean, Elon doesn't like one of those people."" But it seems obvious that,as some journalists have predicted, the relationship between Musk and Trump is destined to flame out. Trump's allies have alreadyexpressed concernwith the level of access and power Musk has. After all, Musk harbored blame forhelping tanka bipartisan budget proposal in December, but was never really punished for doing so. Since then, arguably, he's only received more access to the goings-on of the Oval Office. After all, he has aWhite House emailand office space close to the West Wing. It's just weird that an unelected senior adviser would publicly criticize one of the president's prized initiatives and expect things between the two to be okay after. Trump put up with a lot of internal discord in his first term but has shown this time around that he's fine pushing out those who annoy him. He's already joked at least once that Musk ""won't go home"" and that he ""can't get rid of him."" At the time, these were just jokes—or so Trump says. But it'd be somewhat ironic if the guy whopushed out his Department of Government Efficiency cochairis next in line to get the pink slip.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 19:00:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298900/-Musk-continues-to-overstep-his-authority-and-Trump-is-pissed
'Reign of terror': Trump immigration raid blasted for targeting veteran,"The Trump administration is coming under fire for an immigration raid in New Jersey that detained an American citizen who is also a military veteran. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agentsraided a Newark, New Jersey, business on Thursday. According to Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, ""one of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned."" The raid comes just a few days after Donald Trumpsigned a flurryof anti-migrant executive orders as his administration and congressional Republicansplan to implementa policy of mass deportation. In an interview with longtime Trump admirer Sean Hannity on Fox News,Trump saidhis policy is focused on migrants who pose a security threat, which can be determined by merely looking at people. ""Open borders with people pouring in. Some of whom, I won't get into it, but you can look at them and you can say, 'Could be trouble, could be trouble,"" Trump said. Trump is a racist who has expressed anti-migrant sentiment for years, largely targeting brown-skinned members of minority groups. Barakaexplainedthis ""egregious act is in plain violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,"" referring to protection against unreasonable search and seizure. ""Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,"" he added. New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Colemandescribedthe raid as ""unconstitutional"" and evidence of ""the reality of Trump's reign of terror."" Ina joint statement, New Jersey Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim said they were ""deeply concerned"" about the raid and that they have reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, for answers. ""Actions like this one sow fear in all of our communities—and our broken immigration system requires solutions, not fear tactics,"" the senators added. Veteran groups previously expressed concern about Trump's actions against migrants before the New Jersey incident. As part of the administration's anti-immigration efforts,ICE has been giventhe power to rapidly deport migrants who are legally in the country, including those granted temporary protected status under the Biden administration. In a letter addressed to Trump, veterans' groupsexpressed fearthat the crackdown would endanger the safety of interpreters who had helped the military during the war in Afghanistan, as well as their families, now living in America. Trump is implementing the immigration policy he has long touted and Republicans are on board with it, but just a few days in and veterans are already among the people who are in the crosshairs.

Democratic AGs slam DOJ’s immigration threats as ‘empty words’,"In a unified response on Thursday, Democratic attorneys general from 11 states issued ajoint statementcondemning the Department of Justice's recent threats to prosecute state and local officials who do not comply with President Donald Trump'ssweeping immigration enforcementagenda. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, along with attorneys general from New York, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont, issued the statement. The statement centers around the Supreme Court's landmark decision inPrintz v. United States, which ruled on the constitutional limits of federal authority, particularly to enforcement of federal laws. The Democratic attorneys general called it a ""touchstone of our American system of federalism,"" separating the rights of state and federal government. ""We are reminded by longstanding Supreme Court precedent that the U.S. Constitution prevents the federal government from commandeering state resources to enforce federal laws,"" the attorneys general assert. ""InPrintz v. United States, the Court made it clear that the federal government cannot 'impress into its service—and at no cost to itself—the police officers of the 50 states.' This principle is a cornerstone of American federalism, ensuring a clear division of powers between state and federal governments."" The joint statement goes on to say while the federal government can use its own resources to enforce immigration laws, it cannot force state or local law enforcement agencies to do the job for them—and that Trump is overstepping his presidential authority. ""Despite what the President may claim, he cannot simply rewrite the Constitution to suit his agenda,"" the statement continues. ""His recent threats to weaponize the Department of Justice against public servants who are merely following state laws is not only overreach, but also a direct attack on local governments' ability to serve their communities. This is an affront to the very system of checks and balances that protects us all."" This unified response comes on the heels of a controversialinternal memoissued by the DOJ, which suggests that state and local officials, particularly in so-called ""sanctuary"" cities and states, could face prosecution if they obstruct or fail to comply with the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. The memo outlines an aggressive expansion of immigration enforcement tactics, including the use of federal resources in ""sensitive areas"" like schools, churches, and health care facilities—places that are traditionally seen as safe zones for vulnerable immigrants. The DOJ memo argues that state and local officials must adhere to federal immigration mandates under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, and failure to do so could result in criminal charges or civil penalties. ""Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, or failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,"" the document states. ""The U.S. Attorney's Offices and components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution."" The threat of legal action has sparked widespread concern among immigrant rights advocates and state leaders, who warn that it could lead to more tensions between federal and local authorities, particularly in cities and states that have passed laws designed to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. While the memo's implications are unclear for now, the attorneys general are expressing their unity and readiness to defend their states' rights and local autonomy. They stress that these threats will not be taken lightly and that they are ready to act if necessary.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 16:00:23,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298727/-Democratic-AGs-slam-DOJ-s-immigration-threats-as-empty-words
Grifter in chief: Trump finds a new way to exploit his MAGA minions,"Donald Trump'slist of griftsis seemingly endless, but his new stake in the cryptocurrency market might bring one of his biggest cash hauls yet. Earlier this week, the first convicted felon to be elected U.S. presidentlaunched his own meme coin, $TRUMP, sending the value of his self-titled digital currency (briefly) skyrocketing. For those who don't quite understand the crypto market, meme coins or tokens rose to popularity in 2013 and have been used by celebrities and influencers alike to cash in on their brand and notoriety. But because of the lack of regulation around cryptocurrency, some high-profile hucksters have also managed a ""rug pull"" on the giddy fans who hoped that investing in their favorite celeb's new coin would help them get rich. A ""rug pull"" is a term used to describe when creators of a digital coin—which has a limited supply—sell most or all of their personal stake after their fans substantially increase the value. This subsequently tanks the value of the coin and sends fans' investments tumbling. A recent example of this scenario:Haliey Welch, who rose to fame as the""Hawk Tuah"" girl. After she gained overnight fame thanks to a bawdy viral video, Welch launched a podcastand later her own meme coin, $HAWK. The value of Welch's coin soared after itsDecember launch—but the value plummeted a mere two hours later and Welch's fans felt they were part of a ""pump and dump"" or ""rug pull"" scheme. Welch has beenwrapped up in legal battlesover the matter ever since. Welch's team claims that what happened wasn't a ""rug pull"" and places the blame on single parties buying a majority of the coins and quickly selling them for a profit. But the exploitation of buyers who are investing in crypto based on fandom alone is a major concern that ties back to Trump's meme coin ventures. Crypto expert and fraud investigator Stephen Findeisen, known as Coffeezilla, expressed his disdain for Trump's latest marketing gimmick on X. Findeisen noted that ""most"" of the people destined to lose money on the $TRUMP coin will be his MAGA supporters, while 80% of the tokens will be vested to insiders during Trump's presidency. ""[This] should be a crime but crime is legal now [I guess?],"" hewrote. Jessica Tillipman, an anti-corruption and government ethics professor at George Washington University, told Daily Kos that this ""black box"" of potential profit Trump stands to gain from crypto sits atop a list of many other grifts in Trump's back pocket. And as Tillipman points out, there are no actual laws stopping a president from profiting off of the people he was elected to serve. Past presidents have acted in good faith without the pressure of legal ramifications—but Trump has never met a norm he wasn't happy to trample on. ""We've always relied on this system of norms,"" she explained. ""I think people were pretty surprised to see how few restrictions there were on what a president could do, because we hadn't seen this before."" While restrictions are in place for presidential infractions such as outright bribery, crypto offers a grey area allowing foreign investors to potentially dump large funds into the coins as a workaround, Tillipman speculates. Trump's appointedartificial intelligence and crypto czar David Sackshas been notably silent on the $TRUMP launch. Daily Kos reached out to the tech investor and former Paypal CEO for comment but did not immediately hear back. No one knows how much Trump will net from his (orhis wife Melania's) meme coins. Some finance experts havespeculatedthe windfall could reach the billions, as the value of the individual coins shoots up to $40 or more for the 200 million coins in rotation.A total of 1 billion coins will be ""unlocked"" over the course of three years, according to Quartz. While a Trump-affiliated company owns 80% of the coins, no one knows exactly how many of the coins are owned directly by the president. And even as Trump pushes his branding, his crypto trading platform, World Liberty Financial, ismaking multimillion-dollar movesas well. All in all, Trump is virtually guaranteed to profit from crypto—regardless of how his personal coin venture turns out. Bibles, cologne, shoes, and now meme coins are fueling Trump's never-ending grift—and the newly inaugurated president stands to make untold millions off the very people who elected him in hopes that he would save them a buck or two on eggs and gas.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 15:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298540/-Grifter-in-chief-Trump-finds-a-new-way-to-exploit-his-MAGA-minions
Why some Democrats are shrugging as Trump wreaks havoc,"It's been a weird few months as we liberals have come to terms with the reality of yet another four years of Donald Trump-fueled chaos, instability, hatred, and insanity. Unlike 2017, when outraged liberals took the streets in resistance, it seems many of us are just shrugging our shoulders this time. This is their America. They are welcome to wallow in it. AndCiviqspolling,visualized by The New York Times, confirms it. For those who don't know, Civiqs is a polling and research firm owned by Kos Media, which also operates Daily Kos. It's hard to be a reality-based community if we don't have solid data to understand where America is and what might move it in the right direction. Thus, for the last decade, Civiqs has provided insight deep into the American psyche. For example, early last year, I declared that Democrats had lost the immigration debate and that it was right for President Joe Biden to work with Republicans to take the issue off the board for the elections. I based that primarily on thisCiviqs chart, which shows support for granting undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship fell from 58% on Election Day 2020 to around 46% by early 2024—with those wanting deportation moving up from 31% to 45% across the same time period. More distressing, Civiqs' paywalled data shows that Latino support for a pathway to citizenship fell from 67% on Election Day 2020 to 53% by early 2024. The signs were all there. We're tracking them. The New York Times used Civiqs' data to come up with nifty visualizations contrasting how voters when Biden was in the 2024 race, after he left it and endorsed Kamala Harris, and now, as Trump takes office. As you can imagine, Republicans have radically shifted from being angry to being hopeful. Democrats are scared and depressed. But there are a couple of interesting observations within that broader take. Among all respondents, those saying they're angry have gone from 29% to 16%. Yes, a big chunk of that is happy conservatives. But among Democrats, we've gone from 10% angry while former President Joe Biden was running, to 6% angry when Vice President Kamala Harris was running, to 13% today. We just haven't seen an outpouring of liberal anger, and the reason is clear: We warned Americans about what would happen if Trump was reelected, and they didn't listen. They believed Trump's lies about Harris, refused to believe him about his plans, and ushered in the dumbest, most incompetent president in history back into office. We're not angry. We're shrugging our shoulders, saying, ""You fucked around. Having fun finding out."" One of the harsh realities of the Republican Party is that it isheavily composed of white, non-college-educated Americans, while Democrats arelargely a white-collar, college-educated party. Biden funneled billions of dollars into red counties and states to rebuild shattered rural economies,bailed out the Teamsters, and enacted the strongest pro-labor agenda since former President Franklin D. Roosevelt—and voters, by and large, rewarded him and his Democratic Party by bringing back Trump. Trumpwonthose making $50,000 or less by 2 percentage points, afterBiden won them by 11 pointsin 2020, according to exit polls (which are not perfect). And while the exit polls don't break out income and race, it's clear that poor white voters went overwhelmingly for Trump. Non-college-educated white voters—a decent proxy for income attainment—voted for Trump 66% to 32%. Meanwhile, college-educated white voters backed Harris 53% to 45%. Among all college graduates, Harris won 56% to Trump's 42%. So it's not surprising that among voters making more $100,000, Harris won them 51% to 47%. A significant number of Democrats also live in blue states, which have the kind of social safety nets to insulate their residents from some of Trump's promised abuses. Obviously, lots of Democrats will still suffer under the Trump administration, but his own voters will likely bear the brunt of it—and that takes some of the sting out of Harris' loss. It's easier to suffer the consequences when we see his own voters (as well as nonvoters) realize the error of their ways. For instance, when TrumprescindsBiden's ""Executive Order 14087 of October 14, 2022 (Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans),"" it isn't just Harris voters suffering the consequences. When Trump targets the Latino community—mycommunity—it's hard to feel too sorry when 46% of them voted for Trump, according to exit polls. Even the GOP's most loyal Latinos—Miami Cubans—gotslapped on Day 1of Trump's new presidency when he ended emergency parole for them, which provided an additional pathway to legally enter the country. On issue after issue, the Trumpists are running into the cold hard reality of their choice. Take the Trump-loving account Jamieson on X. Here's them on Jan. 10: And now here's them just a day into the new Trump presidency: Whosigned that executive order, Jamieson?Who??? It's about time people learn about all the ways that Bidendidlower prices. Trump has alsostopped disbursementsunder the Inflation Reduction Act, most of which has benefited red America. ""Republican-led states were projected to receive the lion's share of the IRA's grants and subsidies,"" reported PV Magazine, a publication covering the solar industry. ""$337 billion in IRA funding for factories and renewable energy projects in 'red states,' significantly outpacing the $183 billion expected for 'blue states."" If Democrats pass legislation with only Democratic votes, like the IRA, the bulk of the benefits should go to blue states and blue voters. But hey, Biden foolishly tried to help them, and they empowered the guy who wants to hurt them. This is the same guy who surrounded himself with working-class people at his rallies but who, at his inauguration, featureda trillion dollars of net worthin his small crowd, even seating many of them in front of his own Cabinet picks. That's who they voted for. So ittotallymakes sense liberals aren't as angry as we were in 2017. Back then, we assumed the American people were bamboozled, or that Hillary Clinton was a bad candidate, or something something. But now? People knew exactly what they were voting for, and they will suffer for it. And yes, that makes our own suffering more bearable. And who knows, if even 5% learn from their mistakes and decide to vote differently in 2026 and 2028, then we'll be able tosalvage somethingfrom this clusterfuck. One final point, from the conclusion of The New York Times' article: Shitisfucked up, and people are fed up. And the Democratic Party's deference to institutions that haven't served America well ended up biting us in the ass. Trump supporters are, at their core, nihilist. They don't care about norms and institutions and traditions being torn down—none of those have demonstrably helped them. And that's not just MAGA but also a lot of soft Republican voters and even some Democrats who voted the right way, despite feeling alienated from our economic and political classes. Democrats will need an answer for that. In fact, the 2028 presidential primary, which will start much sooner than anyone realizes, will be all about it.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 14:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/24/2298263/-Why-some-Democrats-are-shrugging-as-Trump-wreaks-havoc
Only 2 GOP senators have a problem with Hegseth’s heinous history,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska,announcedin a social media post on Tuesday that she will vote against Donald Trump'sdisgraced secretary of defense pick, Pete Hegseth. With this move, Murkowski became the first Republican to publicly say she would oppose one of Trump's Cabinet picks, though he'slikelyto still get confirmed during the Friday vote. In a lengthy statement, Murkowski said that the ""allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking,"" which Hegsethhas denied, ""starkly contract"" with what is expected of someone tasked with leading the Department of Defense. She also expressed concern about Hegseth'spast commentsthat women don't belong in combat roles, though he attempted to walk this back during his Senate confirmation hearing. ""After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense. I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness,"" shewrote. ""The past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment,"" Murkowski went on. ""... These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers. Men and women in uniform are held accountable for such actions, and they deserve leaders who uphold these same standards."" Joining Murkowski in opposing Hegseth's nomination isSen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. On Thursday, during a procedural vote to advance his nomination, Collinsvoted against doing so,along with Murkowski. The rest of the Senate GOP opted to move forward with Hegseth's confirmation, in a 51-49 vote. Unfortunately, assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, the two Republicans' votes aren't enough to prevent Hegseth's confirmation. It's somewhat notable that Collins seems to oppose Hegseth's nomination now, just one day after she called the most recent report of his alleged abusive behavior ""troubling."" By that, Collins was referring to anaffidavitfrom Hegseth's former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth. In it, Danielle alleged that Hegseth abused alcohol to the point where he ""passed out, threw up, and had to be carried out of family events and public settings, sometimes shouting sexually and racially offensive statements."" It also said that Hegseth engaged in threatening behavior toward his second wife, Samantha Hegseth, to the point that she devised an ""escape plan"" that involved texting a ""safe word"" to friends and family in case she ever needed assistance. Danielle also accused Hegseth of making racist and sexist comments, including his argument that women shouldn't vote or work and that Christians need to ""outbreed"" growing Muslim populations. In astatementto NBC News, Samantha denied any physical abuse in her marriage to Hegseth, whose attorney also denied the latest charges. Hegseth appeared to clear his most difficult hurdle last week, skating throughhis confirmation hearingwhere his Republican allies largelylobbed him softball questions. After the hearing, Sen. Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who previouslyexpressed skepticismtoward Hegseth's bid, saidshe'd now support him. But these new reports on Hegseth's behavior come as the Senate is preparing for a crucial vote to advance his nomination. Indeed, even the newest allegations, however damning, aren't enough to move many members of Trump's GOP. In addition to helping clear the way for a final confirmation vote,Sen. Eric Schmitt, Republican of Missouri, suggested that Democrats were colluding with Hegseth's enemies to tank his bid. ""It's desperate. This is a sad attempt by Democrats to oust a reformer,"" Schmitt toldPolitico. Notably, these aren't the only allegations that could potentially sink Hegseth's bid to lead the Department of Defense. In 2017, he wasaccused of rape, though hemaintainsthat the encounter was consensual.

You’ll never guess which notorious files Trump forgot to declassify,"Donald Trump ordered the declassification of files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy. ""A lot of people are waiting for this for a long, for years, for decades,"" Trump said as he signed the executive order Thursday. But, of course, Trump seems to have forgotten to declassify the files on Jeffrey Epstein, theserial sexual abuser of minorswho hobknobbed with many wealthy and important folks during the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2019, Epsteindied by suicidein his jail cell in Manhattan, where he was being detained on federal sex trafficking charges. Then-president Trumphelped spreadconspiracy theoriesquestioning the nature of Epstein's death. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump appeared in a Fox News interview that sure made itseemlike Trump was all in on releasing the Epstein files and getting to the bottom of things. But when you view the full interview, you can see that Trump is uncomfortable with the proposition of releasing the Epstein files. Maybe most problematic for Trump is his very public relationship with Epstein, which spanned the better part of two decades. That friendship soured in 2004 after a squabble over Florida real estate, according to theWashington Post. At least some QAnon conspiracists will be excited to see this move, since so many of them havefetishized and atomizedconspiracy theories around the Kennedys. But it remains to be seen if Trump will do anything about the files on his former pal Epstein.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 00:30:19,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298747/-Trump-releases-files-on-deceased-public-figures-except-for-one-infamous-case
Elon Musk is facing more fallout over his Nazi salute,"Subreddit communities are banning the use of links from X after Donald Trump's billionaire bestie Elon Musk threw outtwoNazi salutesduring the indoor inaugural parade. Musk had the world ablaze with furor and controversy once again after throwing out his arm in a ""Sieg Heil"" as he thanked the crowd for ""making it happen."" While some sources, such as the Anti-Defamation League, dismissivelycalled itan ""awkward"" hand gesture, others, including a popularGerman newspaper, left no room for ambiguity. The weekly paper Die Zeit titled a piece ""Ein Hitlergruß ist ein Hitlergruß ist ein Hitlergruß,"" which translates to ""A Hitler salute is a Hitler salute."" And though many can't seem to agree on whether or not a grown man who owns one of the largest social media companies is aware of what a ""Sieg Heil"" is, hundreds of moderators behind Subreddit groups aren't fooled by Musk's deflection. Almost immediately, communities across Reddit began banning the use of X links, starting withpopular sports subredditssuch as r/NBA and r/NFL, both of which include at least 10 million people. Despite their names, these Subreddits are not officially affiliated with the sports giants. According tothe BBC, more than 100 Subreddits have banned the use of X links since Musk's Nazi salutes. ""This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now,"" the moderator of the Subredditr/pcgamingwrote. ""X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently."" Groups such as these cite not only Musk's egregious behavior and the toxicity coming out of his social media platform, but they have also considered the usability of posting links to X—which now requires users to have an account to view. As communities on Reddit distance themselves from the increasingly volatile and pro-white nationalist platform,journalistsandcompaniesalike are also making their exodus from the app. Subreddits pertaining to PC gaming might come as a personal blow to Musk, whoadmitted to paying gamersto help him win video games. While he juggles arguing over public policy andimmigration, Musk also seems to be spending time trying to defend his self-imposed reputation as a ""living god of video games."" It might be hard to defend his title when no one is around to listen.",Daily Kos,2025-01-24 00:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298734/-Elon-Musk-is-facing-more-fallout-over-his-Nazi-salute
Kook who said there are too many gays on TV will lead government agency,"Donald Trumphas selectedright-wing activist L. Brent Bozell III to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The agency is independent of the federal government andoverseesthe Voice of America broadcast network as well as other taxpayer-funded news and information services targeting Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Bozell will require Senate approval to become CEO of USAGM. Trump's latest pick is best known for creating the extremist Media Research Center, which has claimed for decades that mainstream media is liberal and does not provide enough of a platform for conservative views. MRC has stood by this claim even as mainstream media organizationsfurthered liesabout Iraqi weapons of mass destruction,advanced falsehoodsabout former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, and arecurrently bucklingto Trump. Along with his crusade against the ""liberal media,"" Bozell and his organization have also repeatedly complained that movies and television shows sometimes acknowledge the existence of LGBTQ+ people and occasionally regard them as perfectly acceptable members of society. In a 2013 column,Bozell lamentedthat gay characters on movies and TV shows ""never face any real opposition to the gay agenda on these so-called 'inclusive' programs."" He also railed against a project by the advocacy group GLAAD which tracked the number of LGBTQ+ people depicted in entertainment. He referred to GLAAD as ""trend-enforcers"" who ""want children indoctrinated."" A few years before that,Bozell wrotethat he was upset that actors and media outlets expressed sympathy for gay teens who face bullying, describing them as ""evangelists for a revolution of sexual immorality."" Bozell's Media Research Center alsocomplainedthat Yahoo! deleted anti-gay hate comments, that the mediadidn't depictenough ""ex-gays,"" and wasincensedat CNN for purportedly supporting ""homosexual causes."" MRC evenboycottedthe notoriously right-wing CPAC conference because a group that supported gay equality was allowed to attend. At one point,Bozell even demandeda congressional investigation of an art exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington because it depicted ""images of an ant-covered Jesus, male genitals, naked brothers kissing, men in chains, Ellen DeGeneres grabbing her breasts."" The exhibitwas pulledafter Bozell and other conservatives complained. On foreign policy matters,Bozell was amongthe contingent of conservatives who insisted that weapons of mass destruction had been found in Iraq. Bozell made the claim in 2006, long after it had been discovered that no such weapons existed. He is also a reliable presence spoutingright-wing talking pointson Fox News programs. Trump's decision to tap Bozell for the post echoeshis choiceof conspiracy theorist Kari Lake to head Voice of America. These selections make it clear that Trump intends to infuse the government's media infrastructure with extremist right-wing values and talking points. But it seems that extremism runs in the family. Bozell's son L. Brent Bozell IV, wassentenced to 45 months in prisonfor assaulting law enforcement, destroying government property, and other charges stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot instigated by Trump. Bozell's son was among the 1,500 people who werepardoned by Trumpon Tuesday for their participation in the insurrection.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 23:00:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298719/-Kook-who-said-there-are-too-many-gays-on-TV-will-lead-government-agency
AOC's chat with Jon Stewart is the jolt Democrats need right now,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York spoke with Jon Stewart on his podcast ""The Weekly,"" Thursday. In a sprawling interview the two talked about the billionaire oligarchy Donald Trump represents and the state of the Democratic Party. What makes Trump more dangerous this go-around, according to Ocasio-Cortez, is how much more he has been normalized by the elite class. Describing what we have been watching thepast few weeksas a ""billionaire feeding frenzy,"" and ""a kiss ass race,"" AOC said that ""the important thing for people to understand about this administration is that you're being ripped off ... everybody is being ripped off."" Ocasio-Cortez was critical of the Democratic establishment's reliance on clearly archaic social mores that are no longer effective, but warned against the nihilism inherent in rhetoric that both political parties are the same. ""When you look at how, for example, Putin has operated in Russia and the way they've been able to kind of take things over in these oligarchies, these kleptocracies, they prey on that exact logic, on that exact predicate, which is that everyone's corrupt and is all corrupt. And so who gives a fuck?"" She added that there are a lot of people in Congress trying todo good things, and people should demand that from their representatives. ""When we decide to hold people to a higher standard, then things actually do get better."" AOC was optimistic about positive change in the Democratic Party, saying that while she did not become the top-ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee,losing out on an intraparty vote to 74-year-old Rep. Gerry Connolly, she was moved into a powerful position on energy and commerce. Shortly after the election, the congresswomanappealed directly to her constituents via social mediato find outwhy some of them voted for both her and Trump. ""They see two people that are fundamentally anti-establishment,"" she told Stewart. ""Two people that do not respect a rule if the rule does not lead to an outcome, like a positive outcome."" She added that as far as messaging goes, one of the shifts she's seen is that people will believe a politician speaking directly to them. Unfortunately, that includes immigrants in her community who believed Trump when he claimed that only criminals would be harassed as a part of his immigration policy. However, with an ever-right-moving media, AOC said appealing directly to constituents offered Democrats a real shot at getting a message through. ""If you ask a working-class American or just any normal American, what is a Democrat? What do they stand for?"" Ocasio explained to Stewart. ""They will not really be able to give you a clear answer. And so our party needs a clear and strong agenda."" ""The stuff that's crazy to me is like, the answers are stuff, like, we're just asking for things that our parents and our grandparents had,"" Ocasio-Cortez added. ""Like, tuition-free public colleges and universities, not new, not new."" She also added an appeal to Medicare for All, and a platform that includes promises to Americans young and old. ""There are very, very few swing seats left in America. Republicans and this whole system has been gerrymandered that the number of swing seats is so low,"" AOC said of why she felt there needed to be more progressive candidates primarying less progressive ones across the country. ""At the end of the day, people who are in Congress want to return to Congress,"" Ocasio-Cortez explained. ""And the reason that the Republicans have so much enforcement is because they're more scared of a primary than they are of a general election.""

How Trump’s tax cuts could have devastating impacts on health care,"To pay for Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations, the GOP hasoutlineda sweeping $5 trillion in cuts from Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. These government-funded health care programs support 70 million elderly, poor, and disabled Americans. If the plan goes forward—which it is likely to in the GOP-led House and Senate—it could have devastating impacts on U.S. health care. In their50-page memo, Republicans outline how they would use a 10 percent tariff on all imports to save the government money—at the cost of American consumers. If implemented, the GOP's plan would strip undocumented immigrants' eligibility for health care, cut Affordable Care Act expansion, implement requirements for Medicare that experts say would remove 600,000 recipients, and create ""site neutrality"" that would force doctors to perform procedures in their offices instead of outpatient hospital settings. Site neutrality is the idea that patients should pay the same price for the same service, regardless of where it's performed. The goal is to reduce health care costs and promote the viability of independent practices—at the expense of potentially making a patient less safe due to not being in a hospital setting when they receive intensive care. Trump recently signed an executive orderrepealingPresident Joe Biden's prescription price caps for people on Medicare and Medicaid, calling them ""deeply unpopular"" and ""radical."" He also issued a directive Tuesday toprohibit any public communicationfrom the Department of Health and Human Services until it is reviewed and approved by a presidential appointee. The Republican plan would reduce the federal government's Medicare cost burden, leaving states to pick up the slack. Health care has long been a target for Republicans, primarily because it's one of the largest items in the federal budget, accounting for nearlya quarterof all federal spending—an estimated $1.7 trillion in 2024 alone. Cutting these programs is part of a broader strategy to reduce federal spending, but it's also one that could disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Americans. In response to the anticipated slashes, Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts voiced their opposition in aletterto HHS nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this month. ""I am concerned about Republican proposals to cut Medicaid in order to pay for proposed tax cuts to ultra-wealthy individuals and large corporations,"" Warren wrote. ""The House Republican Contract Against America will end Medicaid as we know it, destroy the Affordable Care Act, and eliminate the mortgage interest deduction, which will raise costs on tens of millions of working-class and middle-class Americans,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffriessaidin a press conference Thursday, adding that Democrats vow to push back on the agenda ""with every fiber in our body."" The GOP's proposed cuts would upend the lives of millions of people, all for the benefit of the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Will that stop them, though? Not likely.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 21:00:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298689/-How-Trump-s-tax-cuts-could-have-devastating-impacts-on-health-care
New FCC chair eagerly carries out Trump’s war on the press,"If President Donald Trump really ""loves"" the First Amendment as much as he claims to, he's got an odd way of showing it. Trump and his cronies have beenwaging a war against the pressfor years now. So it shouldn't be a surprise that members of his new administration want to help him destroy the Fourth Estate. On Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the new chair of the Federal Communications Commission,said it would again consider three complaintslevied toward ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News after a conservative group alleged the networks were biased against Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign. The Center for American Rights, a right-wing nonprofit law firm, initially filed the three complaints against the outlets. One accused ABC News of bias toward former Vice President Kamala Harris after one of the network's moderators fact-checked Trumpduring their September presidential debate. Another alleged that CBS News engaged in ""significant and substantial news alteration"" relating to the editing of a preelection interview with Harris. And a third charged that NBC News had violated the equal-time rule when Harrismade a guest appearanceon ""Saturday Night Live"" the weekend before this past November's presidential election. Shortly before Trump's inauguration this month, the outgoing FCC chair, Democrat Jessica Rosenworcel,dismissed four pending petitions and complaintsbefore the FCC, including one regarding Fox News. ""The facts and legal circumstances in each of these cases are different,"" Rosenworcelsaidin her order dismissing the cases. ""But what they share is that they seek to weaponize the licensing authority of the FCC in a way that is fundamentally at odds with the First Amendment."" Carr, aProject 2025contributorTrump pickedto lead the agency, reversed her decision. The new FCC chair has made clear his desire to see the agency fight Big Tech's supposed ""censorship cartel."" But it's clear that partisanship is motivating his latest moves. Unsurprisingly, he did not revive the complaint against a Fox-owned television station. The complaint argued the station should lose its license for promotingbaseless lies and conspiracy theoriesregarding the results of the 2020 presidential election. With this move, Carr will put the three cases back into pending or active status, meaning the complaints can be adjudicated on their merits, according to right-wing outletNewsmax. As expected, the announcement was praised by conservatives. ""Glad to see that our campaign for truth and transparency through the [FCC] won't be stopped by the prior chair's last minute attempt to excuse the networks from accountability,"" Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, said ina social media poston Wednesday. Rosenworcel may harbor some blame for Carr's latest stunt, though. Had she acted a few weeks earlier, she could've prevented the reversal from happening since there is usually a 30-day buffer period, according to a source who spoke withthe New York Post. Still, this surely won't be the last time the Trump administration goes after the press. Throughout his 2024 campaign,journalists expressed fearthat he and his allies would use the court system to punish or silence his critics on the grounds that bad coverage of Trump was defamatory. Since his win this past year, the president has said he wants to ""straighten out"" the press, which seems to meanicing out or silencing reporterswho offend him. But Trump's compulsive hostility toward the press has gonebeyond blacklisting journalistswho ask tough questions. He's now attempting to quash entire news networks. The president's revenge tour is already off to a great start for him. In December, he scored a win byreaching a settlementin his lawsuit against ABC News over host George Stephanopoulos saying on-air that Trump was found ""liable for rape."" (What he was actually found liable for was ""sexual abuse."") That same month,Trump himself suedIowa-based pollster Ann Selzer over a survey she released days before the election in which she predicted Harris would carry Iowaby 3 percentage points. (Trump went on to win the state byroughly 13 points.) It's not surprising, then, that Trump is nowfloating the idea of shutting down MSNBC. Reacting to news that CNN would lay offabout 6% of its workforce, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, ""MSDNC is even worse than CNN. They shouldn't have a right to broadcast—Only in America!"" The post was a clear shot at the left-leaning network, with ""MSDNC"" being a portmanteau of the network's name, MSNBC, and the Democratic National Committee's initials. These statements, coupled with the latest moves by Carr, make it easy to wonder just how far Trump will take his grievances against those who dare to cross or question him.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 20:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298677/-New-FCC-chair-eagerly-carries-out-Trump-s-war-on-the-press
Trump orders federal employees to be more racist,"The Trump administrationhas sent directivesto federal employees ordering them to snitch on each other to reveal if they are involved in diversity programs. In an email from the Office of Personnel Management the administration said, ""We are aware of efforts by some in government to disguise these programs by using coded or imprecise language."" The email further warns federal employees that if they do not turn in their fellow workers they could face ""adverse consequences."" The email does not detail the consequences for disobeying the order. The directive is another in a series of actions from Donald Trump meant to attack the gains of the Civil Rights Movement under the guise of curtailing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Republicans have falsely alleged that DEI programs prioritize mediocrity over merit, a long-standing boogeyman that has been used to attack reform. Trump issueda flurry of executiveorders in the same vein over his first few days in office which seek to remove DEI programs and employees within the federal government. Trump even rescinded diversity efforts at the Federal Aviation Administration and falsely blamed a 2023 database error that caused flight problems on diversity programs. In one particularly troubling order, Trump rescinded a 1965 executive order from former President Lyndon Johnson which was key in preventing racial segregation at companies working with the federal government. The administrationalso ordereda halt to civil rights cases at the Department of Justice with a letter directing the supervisor of the agency's civil rights decision not to file ""any new complaints, motions to intervene, agreed-upon remands, amicus briefs, or statements of interest."" But when he was campaigning in 2024, Trump couldn't even explain what DEI is—despite attacking it over and over again. During his interview with the National Association of Black Journalists Trump was asked to defend claims from Trump supporters that Vice President Kamala Harris was a ""DEI hire."" ""How do you define DEI?"" Trump asked. The snitching directive and other associated anti-DEI actions are a manifestation of the planslaid out inthe right-wing Project 2025, which argues for replacing the nonpartisan federal civil service with conservative loyalists. Trump claimed that the plan was not associated with him, but his presidency is carrying out its directives. Federal workers are also facing other pressures. The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency hasbeen interrogatingfederal workers to uncover their purported political stances, while Trumphas initiatedorders that seek to undo long-held employee protections for those workers. Since Trump took office, federal workers are now facing unprecedented attacks in addition to their existing burdens of serving the public.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 19:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298676/-Trump-threatens-federal-employees-orders-them-to-snitch-on-each-other
How Trump’s plan to upend FEMA will screw his supporters the most,"Donald Trump said Wednesday that he wants to completely upend the Federal Emergency Management Agency, encouraging states to handle their own disaster responses. ""FEMA is a whole 'nother discussion, because all it does is complicate everything. FEMA has not done their job for the last four years,"" hesaidduring a batshit crazy interview with sycophantic Fox News host Sean Hannity. ""But unless you have certain types of leadership, it's really, it gets in the way. And FEMA is going to be a whole big discussion very shortly, because I'd rather see the states take care of their own problems."" As an example, Trump said that if a tornado were to hit Oklahoma, he'd want the state to respond and for FEMA not to have any role in disaster aid. Sending FEMA back to the states is an idea ripped straight from the pages ofProject 2025, the unpopular right-wing policy roadmap of which Trumplied abouthis involvement during his 2024 campaign. ""Reform of FEMA requires a greater emphasis on federalism and state and local preparedness, leaving FEMA to focus on large, widespread disasters,"" the nearly 1,000-page screed says. Of course, leaving disaster recovery to states would hurt Trump supporters the most. Florida, Louisiana, and Texas—three states Trump won handily in 2024—have ""received the lion's share of FEMA direct assistance since 2015,"" Axiosreported. NBC Newsreportedahead of the November election on the negative impacts that the FEMA plans in Project 2025—which Trump now seems to have adopted—would have on states like Florida where hurricanes cause billions of dollars worth of damage on an annual basis. The NBC News report says: What's more, decentralizing FEMA and making states responsible for disaster relief at a time whenclimate change causesunpredictable and costly weather-related disasters—including in places that don't typically experience those types of weather events—could lead to chaotic recoveries, with states unprepared to quickly mobilize disaster responses. ""It almost becomes unthinkable that states would ever be able to recover without long, costly recovery periods that would come out of state and local budgets,"" Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator under President Barack Obama,told NBC News. Trump's call to upend FEMA comes after hewrongly blamedCalifornia leaders for the devastating fires that are ripping through the southern portion of the state. Trump and other Republicanshave liedabout why the fires were so brutal, claiming that it's because of California's water management despite firefighters saying thatno municipal water system on earthcould have provided enough water to combat these fires. Trump and his GOP pals in Congress are nowthreatening to withholddisaster funding for California to punish Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Trump wrongly blamed for the fires. In fact, Trump's whole FEMA plan seems to be a way to punish California for the fires. Still, California's wildfires aren't the only natural disasters that Trump and the GOP have been politicizing. Following Hurricane Helene, which devastated parts of North Carolina with unprecedented flooding, Trump and the GOPspewed a torrent of liesabout the FEMA response in an effort to try to weaken support for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The lies were so pervasive that FEMA had tocreate a fact-checking webpageto combat them. But now it appears that the ultimate outcome of the lies could be the decimation of FEMA, which will not only hurt California, but also millions of Trump's own supporters.

Fox News melts down over 'woke bishop' who called on Trump to show mercy,"Fox News has gone all-in on attacking Right Rev. Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop who delivered the national prayer service at National Cathedral on Tuesday and called for compassion for LGBTQ+ people and migrants. In her sermon, Budde asked Trump to ""have mercy."" Trump panned the event as ""not too exciting."" He later posted an angrier complaint on his Truth Social Platform,writing, ""The so-called Bishop who spoke at the National Prayer Service on Tuesday morning was a Radical Left hard line Trump hater. She brought her church into the World of politics in a very ungracious way."" Fox News echoed Trump's invective throughout its broadcast day, targeting Budde for her views and her physical appearance. ""Fox and Friends"" host Lawrence Jones exclaimed ""Oh my God!"" after a clip of Budde's speech was aired. ""As someone who comes from generations of preachers, I would have walked out,"" he added. Jones said it was not an ""appropriate"" time for Budde to speak out and that she should have done so in private. His co-host Ainsley Earhardt worried that ""there are children there that are hearing this message,"" apparently concerned that children might hear something about ""mercy"" toward others in a church—somethingfrequently associatedwith Jesus Christ and Christianity. Also on the panel, host Steve Doocy suggested that the sermon was a sign that the president and other Washington officials should stop attending services at National Cathedral. On ""Outnumbered,"" host (and former Trump press secretary) Kayleigh McEnany complained that Budde was ""preaching politics from the pulpit"" (something Fox News has encouraged for decades with conservative policy). Her co-host Harris Faulkner suggested that rhetoric like Budde's reflected poorly on the Episcopalian church's decision to allow women to serve as clergy. ""It was so awkward not to have a faith-filled, forward-looking positive message at a time when we know the numbers of people going to church are falling again,"" Faulkner lamented. Panelist Gerri Willis said the message was evidence that Protestantism has ""gone woke."" ""There seems to be such an emphasis on the issues of wokeism, whether it's helping people of different race or different sexual persuasion or whatever, instead of focusing on The Word,"" Willis added. Summarizing the panel's take on the event Faulkner said, ""If you believe in the Lord, that was offensive."" ""The Five"" co-host Jeanine Pirro labeled Budde as a ""woke bishop"" and ""nasty clergywoman,"" and accused her of ""hijacking"" the service. In prime time, host Laura Ingraham kept the insults flying, calling Budde a ""Peter Pan lookalike"" and referring to her as a ""warrior-princess waif."" Her fellow prime-time host and infamous misogynist Jesse Watters called Budde the Democratic Party's ""new Avenger."" He then asked, ""Would the bishop show mercy if someone showed up to her church service, cut the line at Communion, guzzled the blood of Christ, flipped over the body of Christ, and then snatched all the cash from the offering plate?"" Despite the attacks from the sitting president and his cheerleaders at the right-wing cable news channel, Budde remained unbowed. ""I don't hate the president, and I pray for him,""Budde told NPR. ""I don't feel there's a need to apologize for a request for mercy.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 17:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298639/--Woke-bishop-Fox-News-freaks-out-over-plea-to-Trump-for-compassion
GOP celebrates Trump's release of violent criminals—but no one else does,"Donald Trump and his GOP defenders are trying to rewrite history of the violent and deadly insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, all in an effort to inoculate Trump from criticism after hepardoned 1,500 insurrectionists, including hundreds who violently assaulted law enforcement officers. In an interview with Fox News sycophant Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday night, Trump defended hisunpopular pardonsby falsely declaring that the law enforcement assaults ""were very minor incidents."" Also on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson announced thecreation of a new committeeto investigate the Jan. 6 attack, giving Republicans an avenue to spread disinformation about who was responsible despite it being Trump's fault. ""We are establishing this select subcommittee to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people,"" Johnson said in a statement, as if we don't have hours of video tape showing what happened and hours of interviews with witnesses who say Trump is to blame. CNNreportedthat it is Trump himself who asked for the committee, so it's no surprise that lap dog Johnson acquiesced to Dear Leader's command. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, went to the jail in Washington, D.C., where many of the violent offenders were being held anddeclaredshe wanted to be the first to give them a tour of the Capitol they had defiled four years earlier. One of the men released from that prison hasalready been rearrestedon gun charges. Great going, guys! So much for making the streets safer. Right-wing white supremacist Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence Trump commuted, was also alreadyseen at the Capitolon Wednesday, andmet with Florida GOP Rep. Gus Bilirakis. Rhodes, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to18 years in prison, was caught on tape after the insurrectionsaying, ""My only regret is they should have brought rifles. We should have brought rifles. We could have fixed it right then and there. I'd hang fucking Pelosi from the lamppost."" ""I think it's new and interesting that they're using the front door this time,"" Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the now-defunct committee that probed the Jan. 6 attack, toldThe Associated Press. Judges who oversaw the trials of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists are aghast at Trump's pardons, issuingblistering statementsdecrying the decision. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw Trump's federal case on his effort to steal the 2020 election, wrote in a decision dismissing the case against one of the insurrectionists that Trump's pardons ""cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power."" The Fraternal Order of Police, the union that endorsed Trump's reelection bid, also slammed Trump's move, saying in astatementthat the union ""firmly believe[s] that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences."" If only they had ahint ahead of timethat Trump was going to pardon violent cop assaulters.

Did Vivek Ramaswamy leave DOGE—or did it leave him?,"Vivek Ramaswamy, the failed presidential candidate President Donald Trumptapped in Novemberto co-lead the toothless Department of Government Efficiency, wants you to think hequit the projectbecause heplans to run for governor of Ohio. In a post tosocial mediaon Monday Ramaswamy noted it was an ""honor to help support the creation of DOGE"" but that he was stepping aside for greener pastures. Reporting fromThe Washington Post, however, suggests that Ramaswamy didn't leave on his own accord. Rather, he was pushed out by billionaire Elon Musk because he didn't share the same vision for the initiative as theunelected co-president. According to the Post, Ramaswamy was the mastermind behind a November op-ed in theWall Street Journalwhere the two advocated for slashing billions of dollars' worth of essential government services. Ramaswamy allegedly wanted DOGE to function as a sort of think tank—a nongovernmental body whose function would be to determine which government agencies could be slashed and which regulations could be repealed without congressional approval. But Musk had no interest in this, according to the Post, which cited more than a half-dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation. The Tesla CEO and X owner apparently had a ""competing vision,"" which entailed doing things from a ""technology-first perspective."" He also wanted DOGE to operate within the government. Tensions were exacerbated after Ramaswamy went on a social media rant where he alleged thatAmerican culture rewards mediocrityand voiced support for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers (something Musk also supports). But his tirade didn't sit well with Trump's allies or Musk, according toPolitico. ""Everyone wants him out of Mar-a-Lago, out of D.C.,"" a Republican strategist who is close to Trump's advisers told the outlet. A second source told Politico that ""they wanted [Ramaswamy] out before the [""mediocrity""] tweet—but kicked him to the curb when that came out."" Musk, anuisance in his own right, also made it known that he no longer wanted Ramaswamy to be part of DOGE. A person close to the advisory commission told Politico that Musk didn't think it was feasible for Ramaswamy to both campaign for public office and work within the federal government. Then there's the fact that, despite being co-chairs of the special commission, Musk was supposedly the one who called the shots. The Post noted that while Ramaswamy visited the SpaceX offices that housed DOGE staff on various occasions, only Musk had the authority to direct their work. ""They've been wanting Vivek to step aside so Elon could have more control,"" one person briefed on the matter told the Post. ""There was tension, and then they had an out and kind of took the out."" In other words, the two were never really partners—they were co-heads in name only, or CHINOs. Apparently, Ramaswamy had performed virtually no DOGE-related work since early December, according to Politico. One person with knowledge of the deteriorating DOGE structure told the Post the joint arrangement was ""probably doomed from the jump."" And they were right: Musk's vision seems to have won in the end. For instance, while draft executive orders preferred by Musk were implemented, ones put forth by Ramaswamy and his team were reportedly ignored by Musk and are unlikely to get issued, according to the Post. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderrenaming the U.S. Digital Service, created under former President Barack Obama, to the U.S. DOGE Service, which will determine best practices for the government use of technology. Specifically, the purpose of Musk's DOGEwill be to""implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,"" according to the executive order. This is far more in-line with Musk's technology-forward vision for DOGE. It also landed him aWhite House officeandemail address—and all the unbridled access that comes with that. In his new role, per the executive order, Musk will have ""full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems."" And now, thanks to Trump, DOGE will be able to sidestep federal hiring rules—and Trump's hiring freeze—sinceDOGE is a White House office. Despite the reportedly heated behind-the-scenes exchanges between Musk, Ramaswamy, and allies for both men, it appears there's no bad blood between the two. Before announcing his departure from DOGE, Ramaswamy posted a photo of the two shaking hands. According to the Post, Musk is also expected to publicly endorse Ramaswamy's gubernatorial candidacy. With Ramaswamy out of the picture, Musk will likely have to bear the brunt—and face the potential consequences—of thevarious lawsuitstargeting DOGE. Ramaswamy's future is less clear. We don't know whether he can win statewide in Ohio, and Trump seems to care little about his political future. A spokesperson for the president only issueda half-hearted statement, saying Trump's team ""expect[s] him to play a vital role in making America great again.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 15:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298516/-Did-Vivek-Ramaswamy-leave-DOGE-or-did-it-leave-him
Why is Trump being so hard on his former pal Putin?,"Donald Trump is a Russian asset, whether willing or unwilling. His obsequiousness toward Russian strongman Vladimir Putin during his first term wasn't just embarrassing—it became a grave national security threat. Trump literallysided with Putinover his own intelligence agencies. And why wouldn't he? Russia was a major factor in his 2016 election victory. Meanwhile, Trump'sfirst impeachmentwas literally centered on his effort to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, drumming up a fake Hunter Biden investigation in exchange for anti-tank weapons to try to stave off a looming Russian invasion. Last year, Trump repeatedly promised toend Russia's warin Ukraine within ""24 hours"" of taking office, which many took to mean pulling U.S. support for Ukraine and freezing the conflict in its current state—something Russia desperately needs. Yet a funny thing has happened. Trump slobbered over Putin, believing that he and Russia are strong and mighty, serving as an example for his own imperialist and undemocratic designs. But Russia is not strong and mighty. In fact, Russia has run out of tools to prop up itsfailing economy. And out-of-control inflation, sky-high interest rates, and lower global energy prices have put Putin in a precarious position. Somehow, Trump noticed this, and his disdain couldn't be clearer. We just might have somehow lucked into a pro-Ukraine Trump presidency. Trumpshared his thoughtsabout Russia's war in Ukraine on Truth Social Wednesday morning. How does Trump always manage to get so much wrong? Russia didn't lose 60 million lives in World War II;it lost 27 million. And, really, seven million of those were Ukrainian, as that total is for the Soviet Union, not Russia. That's a lot, so why the need to exaggerate it? Probably because thetotalnumber of people killed in World War II is around 60 million, and Trump is just too stupid to know the difference—or to fact check. Furthermore, tariffs don't mean shit to Russia, since the U.S. doesn't really trade with them. In 2022, the United States imported just $15 billion in Russian goods and services. Thanks to deep sanctions, what little we exported, like intellectual property (movies and such), was either appropriated by Moscow or just stolen. But sanctions are something that could be hiked up, which would be a welcome response from the Trump administration. If Trumpreallywants the war to end (and to take credit and have statues raised all over Ukraine in his honor), then he needs to do what former President Joe Biden was loath to do: open up the arms spigot and remove all restrictions on their usage. More specifically, he needs to flood Ukraine with aircraft—Ukraine now flies F-16s—and long-range missiles. Russia has endless manpower to incrementally take ground in Ukraine. In October 2024, U.S. intelligence agencies estimated Russian casualties for the entire war at more than 600,000, including those killed and wounded. And that pace has increased year over year as Russia runs out of armor but continues to send soldiers on foot, motorcycle, and even in civilian vehicles. Yet manpower continues to be sourced from Russia's poorest, more remote regions, insulating the oligarch elites in Moscow and St. Petersburg from direct consequences. That economic instability, on the other hand, hits those oligarchs in the only place it matters, and a continued10% inflation rateis taking a bite out of everyone's earning power. How long can the czar remain in power if his people are starving? Meanwhile, the country's banking system ison the verge of collapseas Moscow forces them to lend to the military industrial complex—at levels that far exceed their ability to cover the risk. With their inability to access foreign reserves due to sanctions, they are isolated and exposed. Wary of being caught up with retaliatory sanctions from the United States and the European Union, China issteering clear. While Russia still has significant financial reserves to cover its massive defense-related budget deficits, they are on pace to bedepleted by 2030, according to an analysis by Janes—and that's assuming energy prices don't crater. Saudi Arabia has beenthreateningto open the spigot, and if Trump's policy to encourage additional domestic drilling pans out, global prices might further tumble to Russia's great peril. And additional Western sanctions on oil and on countries that help Russia circumvent sanctions (cough, cough,looking at you, India) will further tighten the noose. Long-range missiles would help accelerate Russia's economic woes. Ukraine's biggest war gains the past year came from systematically targeting Russian economic engineslike refineries and factories. On the ground, Ukraine needs to merely hold the line, extracting a steep price on Russian advances. But if they want to win the war, it will be with long-range missiles. Unfortunately, Trump didn't threaten that, but once Putin ignores Trump's demands for ""A DEAL,"" it would be a logical next step to ratchet up the pressure. Someone might even whisper in his ear—with their fingers crossed behind their back—that if he helps end the war, a Nobel Peace Prize is on the table. Trump's 180-degree turn on Putin clearly stems from Russia's weakness not only in Ukraine, but also in Syria following the country's humiliating defeat. One Russian Telegram channelclaimedthat secret negotiations between Russia and Trump representatives in December failed when the Americans made demands that Putin was unwilling to meet. That is quite the conspiracy theory. The United States doesn't need China to know the state of the Russian economy. Heck, I've linked to a bunch of Western media sources and analysts who have had their finger on Russia's true economic situation throughout the entire war. But the underlying point is quite interesting. Not only is it against China's interests for the war to end, but Russia is also reliant on it for just about everything right now. Plus, China loves to see EU and U.S. dollars and assets spent on Putin's theater rather than on Taiwan. The end result is a weak Russia and a pathetic Putin, groveling before North Korea for weapons andmanpower. And if there's one thing Trump abhors, it's weakness. By aligning himself against China, Republicans' favorite geopolitical boogeymandu jour, Trump is further susceptible to influence from pro-Ukraine voices inside the GOP and his administration. If he wants to end the war, Trump needs to give Ukraine the means and permission to further target Russia's failing economic engine. Long-range missiles are the way to do it.",Daily Kos,2025-01-23 14:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/23/2298528/-Why-is-Trump-being-so-hard-on-his-former-pal-Putin

How Trump's DOJ plans to enforce his brutal immigration raids,"Aninternal memofrom the Department of Justice revealed that, if state or local officials in sanctuary cities and states don't comply with Donald Trump's immigration raid orders, they will face prosecution. According to the document obtained by CNN, the DOJ will be used to carry out Trump's executive orders to conduct mass deportations and immigrant raids, which can now be extended to ""sensitive areas"" like churches, health care facilities, and schools. The memo asserts that state and local officials must comply with the department under the Constitution'sSupremacy Clause, otherwise they could face criminal prosecution or civil violation charges. ""Federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands and requests,"" the memo said. ""The U.S. Attorney's Offices and litigating components of the Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution."" Meanwhile, ""border czar"" Tom HomantoldCNN's Dana Bash that ICE officials havebegun conducting""targeted enforcement operations""—or raids—as directed by Trump. Similarly, the Pentagon announced Wednesday thatit will send1,500 military troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, where Trumpdeclareda state of emergency. These troops will be joining the 2,500 Army Reserve and National Guard troops that are already at the border. Several Democratic attorneys generalfiled a lawsuitTuesday against Trump's executive order that attempts to ban birthright citizenship—a right that's enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. It's unclear if they, too, will cower to Trump's whims. On Tuesday, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who has been a vocal Republican critic of Trump,sharedsome profound advice on how to handle the president.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett puts the GOP on blast about immigration myths,"During Wednesday'sHouse Judiciary hearing on ""Restoring Immigration Enforcement in America,"" Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas did some debunking of the GOP's most racist and ignorant mythmaking concerning undocumented immigrants'crime ratesandtax burdens. ""I do want to be clear. Federal law already, no matter if it's under the Biden administration or if it's under a Republican administration,"" Crockett said, ""we all agree that we want to be safe."" She reiterated that theLaken Riley Act, whichwas passed by the Senate on Monday,and will strip away due process for undocumented immigrants who areaccusedof a crime, is an egregious andinhumaneoverstepping of authority. ""I want to play a little game with you,"" Crocket said to witness David Bier, who is the director of Immigration Studies at the CATO Institute. Bier has beencritical of Trump and the Republican Party's disingenuous handling of immigration policyand enforcement in our country. ""It's called 'rhetoric versus reality,'"" Crockett continued. ""Is this rhetoric or reality? Immigrants commit more crimes than U.S. citizens."" ""Rhetoric,"" Bier responded. Crockett received the same responses from Bier when she asked if ""immigrants are just living off the federal government and contribute nothing,"" and whether ""immigrants only enter at the southern border."" Crockett then asked Bier about the perpetrators of various shootings across the country. Crockett asked about terrible shootings like the one that took place in Charleston,South Carolina, in 2015, of nine Black parishioners at theEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. She also asked about a shootinginEl Paso, Texas, in 2020, at a Walmart, targeting Latinos, that resulted in the death of 23 people. Her last question was about the 10 Black people shot and killed at a Buffalo, New York,supermarket in 2022. ""In fact, in each of these cases, it was white supremacists,"" Crockett said.

"Trump's youngest kid enters the family business—no, not grifting","Like father, like sons. Barron Trump, the youngest son of Donald Trump, is reportedly entering the real estate ring. According toNewsweek, the 18-year-old student at New York University embarked on a luxury real estate venture with former classmate Cameron Roxburgh in July 2024. Their company—Trump, Fulcher & Roxburgh Capital Inc.—was dissolved right after Donald Trump's presidential election win in November in order to not attract media attention, according toRoxburgh. However, per Roxburgh, the two plan to relaunch their high-end real-estate development company in the spring. The two young men—who both attended the $40,000-a-year Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida—are eyeing golf courses and other properties in Arizona, Idaho, and Utah. Roxburgh told Newsweek that Barron's father did not contribute monetarily to their company. However, given that Barron is the son of thegrift-loving presidentand doesn't appear to be working a fast food job to pay for these real estate investments, it's perhaps fair to assume that funds could be linked back to daddy dearest. The other incorporator, Carter Fulcher, is reportedly the cousin of Republican Rep. Russ Fulcher of Idaho, who is seemingly not involved in their business plans. While Donald doesn't appear to be directly funding his youngest's real estate venture, Roxburgh told Newsweek that Barron has been receiving real estate advice from his father. This is all on-brand for the Trump family and seems to be more of a right of passage for the young Barron than anything else. The eldest Trump sons, Eric and Don Jr., haveprofited immenselyfrom their father's real estate investments and have leveraged the Trump name to continue business of their own. Real estate handoutsand reportedtax evasionsaside, Eric and Don Jr. were passed the keys to the Trump real estate kingdom ahead of his first term, in 2017. It's hard to keep track of all the scandal,fraud, andbankruptcysurrounding the Trump family real estate empire, including the$355 million civil fraud judgementDonald Trump was hit with in February 2024 for lying about his wealth to banks and insurers. More so, Donald's lore alone is steeped in lies and tax evasion. AsThe New York Times reported, the convicted felon received what would be about $413 million today from his father's real estate empire, and used tax schemes and outright fraudulent methods to grow his fortune. In other words, nobody in the Trump world is self-made or playing fair. Even Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, has been benefitting from Trump alliances by way ofobtaining permits forluxury hotel complexes in Albania and Serbia. And as for Barron—who was reportedlypivotal in introducinghis father to thepodcast broswho boosted his campaign—his biggest role in this business venture is likelykeeping his nose clean.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 22:15:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298510/-Surprise-Barron-Trump-reportedly-wants-in-on-the-family-grift
Trump's inauguration is a ratings bust,"The ratings are in, and let's just say they don't look too good after Donald Trump's second inauguration. In fact, his ratings are downrightunderwhelmingcompared to both his own 2017 inauguration and Joe Biden's in 2021. Trump's inauguration rating dipped 27% from Biden's 2021 viewership and 20% from his first inauguration in 2017, which must be devastating to the president, who loves to harp about hiscrowd sizes. According toThe Wrap, a combined total of 24.59 million viewers tuned in to cable and network news. Fox News, for obvious reasons, received the highest ratings, making up nearly half of the total viewership, with an average of 10.3 million viewers from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM ET. CNN averaged 1.7 million viewers during the same period, MSNBC had 848,000 viewers, ABC had 4.7 million viewers, CBS had 4.1 million viewers, NBC had 4.4 million viewers, and there is no immediate information on audience ratings for streaming platforms. That means that more peoplewatchedBeyonce's Christmas halftime show than the 47th president's inauguration. Those numbers seem especially bleak when you consider the size of the U.S. population and the fact that a relatively modest 7.2% of U.S. residents watched Trump's inauguration. But, hey, at least they didn't have to witness the endless spectacle of Trumpclaimingrecord crowds, an ongoing theme from his first inauguration. For those with short memories, Trump's first term kicked off in 2017 with a bizarre and unprovoked obsession over his crowd size. During hisfirst White House press conference, he directed his short-lived Press Secretary Sean Spicer to lie about how many people gathered at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., comparing his crowd to that of former President Barack Obama in 2009—whose audience people can see in photos was clearly more prominent. At least they didn't miss much, other than Trumpnot putting his handon the Bible during his oath of office, an awkward air kiss with Melania, and an array of billionaire oligarchs front and center.

Egg prices skyrocket and Trump appears not to give a cluck,"Egg prices have surged to anall time highin the new year. As Donald Trump and his billionaire cabal enter the White House, the increasing grocery prices highlights how disingenuous the hand-wringing was during the Biden administration. To be clear, the surge in egg costs is out of Trump's tiny hands. Theavian flu, which has been ravaging farms across the country since this summer, has created massive shortages, increasing the price of eggs to more than $7 per dozen in some places. Meanwhile, fast-food chains like Blake's Lottaburger in Albuquerque, New Mexico, arereportedlyplanning on adding a $1 surcharge to meals that include eggs starting on Thursday. But President Joe Biden wasn't offered that bit of grace during the initial surge in egg costs in 2023 when it was revealed that a large swatch of inflationary costs weredue to corporate malfeasance, specificallycollusionbetween the two largest egg producers in the country. Meanwhile,Trump's flock of quacksoccupying the U.S. government includesraw milk purveyorRobert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services. There is very little reason to think that Kennedy—orTV doctor Mehmet Oz—has any answers related to public health, let alone a surging avian flu crisis. In fact, it was reported Tuesday that the Trump administration hasput a pauseon federal health agencies' communications. So if you were hoping to stay on top of public health concerns, like containment (or lack thereof) of the avian flu, you're out of luck. And while Trump can't be blamed for the conditions surrounding skyrocketing egg prices, it is a perfect encapsulation of how acutely bogus his claims have always been. Trump waited until winning the electionbefore admittingthat he wasn't going to be lowering grocery prices anytime soon. This wasn't much of a surprise to the people actually listening to his speeches on the matter, as it was alwaysunclear whether or notTrump understood what groceries were in the first place. Trump's inability to expedite his promises to the American people is nothing new, but hehasbeen willing to act very quickly in order toissue petty attackson his perceived enemies, while signing aslew of racistandunpopular executive orders.

Trump’s aides had no idea of his Jan. 6 pardon plans to ‘release ‘em all’,"President Donald Trump's decision to issue pardons to the violent insurrectionists who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, isn't onlywildly unpopular with the electorate—but the move apparently caught many of Trump's aides and supporters by surprise. Two officials who worked on Trump's transition toldNBC Newsthat the decision topardon the more than 1,500 people convictedfor their role in the violence was made mere days before Monday's inauguration. ""He is who he is,"" one person who worked on Trump's transition team told the outlet. ""Expectations are sometimes set as best as can be expected, and sometimes they change quickly."" Throughout his presidential campaign, Trumprepeatedly saidthat one of the first acts of his second term would be to free the people who were convicted of breaching the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in his name. At one point, Trump said he'd consider issuing pardons on a ""case-by-case"" basis, suggesting that he might not be as lenient toward those who were found guilty of violent offenses. After all,169 people pleaded guiltyto assaulting police officers,five of whom later died. But of course, Trump effectively left everyone convicted for their actions off the hook. On Monday, heissued roughly 1,500 pardonsand commuted the sentences of 14 imprisoned insurrectionists, allowing them to go free. According toAxios, an adviser familiar with the pardon discussions said that ""Trump just said: 'Fuck it: Release 'em all.'"" While most Republicans are fine playing dumb andpretending like they didn't truly understandthe scope of Trump's pardons, others were mystified by the president's actions. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, told NBC News that denying pardons to those who attacked the police officers whoRepublicans claim to care about""is a more defensible position and easier to support."" ""You have to wonder whether you really want to put people back on the street who haven't paid their dues for having done those things,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the nation whichendorsedTrump's latest presidential bid,issued a joint statementon Tuesday with the International Association of Chiefs of Police in which members slammed both the Biden and Trump administrations for pardoning or commuting the sentences of those convicted of killing or assaulting a police officer. Before leaving office, former President Joe Bidencommuted the sentencesof 37 death row prisoners, including at least two of whom hadkilled a police officer. ""Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety—they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law. Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families,"" the statement said. Part of what makes Trump's leniency toward his supporters even more abhorrent is the fact that his vice president was seemingly just as surprised by it. In a Jan. 12 interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" JD Vance said people who committed violence on Jan. 6, 2021 ""shouldn't be pardoned."" Since then, though, it appears Vance has come around to the fact Trump is king, andhis actions rarely match his words. NBC News reported that once it became clear Trump planned to issue sweeping pardons for those involved in the deadly attack on the Capitol, the entire administration, including Vance, quickly got on board. ""Everyone has been clear that we were looking at all the cases and the ultimate decision, which the Vice President ended up being a driving force behind, was more encompassing action,"" a second transition official told NBC News. ""The President ended up airing on leniency given how political and broken the process was."" Trump, for his part, has defended his disgusting pardons, even going so far as to compare the rioters in prison to ""hostages."" During a Tuesday press conference at the White House, he suggested that his imprisoned supportershad suffered enough behind bars. ""These people have already served years in prison and they've served them viciously,"" Trump said. ""It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing."" More recently, on Wednesday, CNNreportedthat Trump administration officials are toying with whether to invite some of the convicts to the White House for a potential meeting and visit with Trump. Predictably, Republicans are trying to justify Trump's awful decision to pardon the insurrectionists bynoting thatBidenpardoned some members of his familyjust before leaving office. But the comparisons are of apples and oranges at best. Biden's last-minutepreemptive pardonswere controversial, but they were issued as a sort of protection to potential Trump administration targets who have not been indicted, let alone convicted, of a crime. Trump, on the other hand, moved to protect more than 1,500 people, many of whom were indicted, tried, and convicted of criminal wrongdoing. While many of those who have now been set freehave praised Trump'smove, it sets a foreboding tone for the rest of his presidency. If this was truly a last-minute move by Trump, that would suggest that the next four years will be nothing more than him making a series of disastrous and potentially harmful decisions based on whims and vibes. And we're all going to suffer the consequences.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 20:00:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298458/-Trump-s-aides-had-no-idea-of-his-Jan-6-pardon-plans-to-release-em-all
Trump unveils 'plan' to end Russia's war on Ukraine—and it's dumb as hell,"Donald Trump on Wednesday teased that his plan to end Russia's brutal war against Ukraine is to put tariffs on Russian goods and put sanctions on the country, the latter of which the United States is already doing.

It's time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!"" Tariffing his way to peace is not likely to work. That's because Russia and the United States are barely trading at all right now because of the war. In 2024, the U.S. imported almost $2.9 billion in Russian goods—down from $29.6 billion in 2021, the year before the war started, according todatafrom the U.S. Census Bureau. That's a 90% decline. The U.S. is alsoalready imposing punishing sanctionson Russia, and that hasn't stopped Putin from continuing his deadly war to seize land in Europe. On Jan. 10, the Biden administration announced new sanctions on Russian oil producers, oil-carrying vessels, and Russian energy officials, targeting Russia's biggest form of income. ""The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,"" now-former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellensaidin a news release at the time. ""This action builds on, and strengthens, our focus since the beginning of the war on disrupting the Kremlin's energy revenues, including through the G7+ price cap launched in 2022. With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports."" Of course, during the 2024 election cycle, Trumppromisedto end the war before he even took the oath of office—something that obviously didn't happen. He also said he would end the war within his first 24 hours in the White House, something thatalsodidn't happen. Russia has been mocking Trump since he took office. RT, Russia's state-owned propaganda network, posted avideoof Trump falling asleep at the National Prayer Breakfast on Tuesday. ""Trump must be tired after signing all those executive orders, deporting all those people and abolishing all those genders,"" RT wrote alongside the video.

Republicans are rushing Hegseth through despite horrific new allegations,"Senate Republicans are accelerating the timeline for a vote on Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, even asnew allegationsof abusive behavior have surfaced. Senate Majority Leader John Thunefiled a motionTuesday to end the debate on Hegseth's nomination, which means that the Senate will vote on the nomination by Friday or Saturday. The motion follows the Senate Armed Services Committee's14-13 voteto advance the nomination to the Senate floor. Every Democrat on the committee opposed Hegseth's nomination, while all of the Republicans supported him despite previous allegations of drunkenness, financial mismanagement, and abuse—including a letter in whichhis own mother said he was abusive. On Monday,it was reportedthat Hegseth's former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a sworn affidavit that he abused his second wife. Inthe document, Danielle said that Hegseth's ex-wife had an ""escape plan"" in which she would text members of her family for assistance in getting away from him when he became violent. The affidavit also said that she hid in a closet in fear of him. Hegseth is also accused of being drunk while in military uniform, which is a violation of service laws, while on duty with the Minnesota National Guard. Danielle also accuses Hegseth of making frequent racist and sexist comments, including arguing that women shouldn't vote or work and stating that Christians need to outbreed growing Muslim populations. Hegseth's attorney denies these allegations. ""There was no question that Pete Hegseth is unqualified and unprepared to be secretary of Defense. The affidavit adds additional weight to a case that is already overwhelming against him,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut,told reporters. But Republicans were unmoved. Sen. Lindsay Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Donald Trump's top congressional allies, claimed without evidence that the allegations ""didn't happen"" and refused to address the concerns about Hegseth's alleged drinking problem. The affidavit echoesprevious concernsabout Hegseth's alleged pattern of behavior throughout his life. Trump picked Hegsethfollowing his stintas a Fox News host, during which he praised Trump and established misogynistic stances, like his belief that women should not serve in military combat positions. Senate Republicans have now proven that they share Trump's desire to put Hegseth in charge of the most lethal military in human history—regardless of allegations of abuse.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 18:30:01,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298461/-GOP-advances-vote-on-Hegseth-s-nomination-regardless-of-abuse-allegations
Trump doesn't want you to know if another deadly pandemic might kill you,"Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday ordered federal health agencies to cease all public-facing communication, The Washington Postreported, a move that will leave Americans in the dark about everything from viral outbreaks to the spread of possible food-borne illnesses. The directive to halt all communication with the public comes amid aparticularly bad virus season, with influenza A, COVID-19, RSV, and norovirus tearing through communities across the country. It also comes as abird flu outbreakis causing an egg shortage, leading to spiking egg prices. Currently, the outbreak is mostlycontained to animalslike poultry and cows. And humans who have contracted bird flu got it from infected animals, not other humans. In December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—an agency Trump has now essentially placed a gag order on—announcedthat a human in Louisiana was in critical condition after contracting bird flu from exposure to a backyard flock of infected birds. ""It has been determined that the patient had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks,"" said the CDC. ""This is the first case of H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. that has been linked to exposure to a backyard flock. ... No person-to-person spread of H5 bird flu has been detected."" However, scientists are warning that thevirus is mutatingand could cause yet another public health crisis under Trump's watch. According to The Washington Post, the CDC was set to issue three reports this week about the bird flu outbreak but now will not. People within the public health agencies are reportedly not sure why Trump ordered all communication with the public to cease. One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal from the new administration, told The Washington Post they are hopeful this communications pause is just the sign of a badly run transition and not something more nefarious. ""We have tried to assume good intentions here, and that they're just disorganized,"" the official said. However, it's worth noting that in 2017, during Trump's first presidency, he ordered a similar pause in public-facing communication from the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Agriculture, and the Interior Department, ordering them to, as The Washington Postreportedat the time, ""convey only information that supports the new president's agenda."" Trump also has a history of trying to keep public health information from the public. During his botched response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump wanted people tostop testing themselves for the virusbecause a high number of cases wouldmake him look bad. It's unclear how long Trump's administration will gag public health agencies or whether the agencies will be able to release factual information when the order is lifted. Even more troubling is that Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services—which oversees the CDC and its communication on disease outbreaks—is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-science quack who falsely believes vaccines cause autism anddrinks raw milk, which can expose humans to bird flu. Experts are speaking out about the new gag order, saying it endangers public health. ""More cases of H5N1 [bird flu] are occurring in the United States than in any other country. Pausing our health communications at a time when states are scrambling to contain this virus is dangerously misguided,"" Jennifer Nuzzo, aprofessor of epidemiologyat Brown University,wrotein a post on X. ""This will make America less healthy and will worsen the virus's economic tolls.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 17:45:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298419/-Trump-doesn-t-want-you-to-know-if-another-deadly-pandemic-might-kill-you
"Trump pardons notorious drug trafficker—wait, what?","Donald Trump on Tuesday pardoned the creator of Silk Road, a dark-web marketplace where people sold heroin, cocaine, LSD, and other illicit drugs by using cryptocurrency to keep the transactions anonymous and avoid being caught by law enforcement. Ross Ulbricht wassentenced to life in prisonfor creating the website, in which he made millions of dollars profiting off of illegal drug sales as well as thesale of illegal services, such as computer hacking and forged documents, like passports and Social Security cards. ""Make no mistake, Ulbricht was a drug dealer and criminal profiteer who exploited people's addictions and contributed to the deaths of at least six young people,"" Preet Bharara, the now-former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York whose office prosecuted Ulbricht in 2015,saidin a statement at the time. But Trump has now pardoned Ulbricht and set him free, marking the second time in as many days that Trump let criminals back onto the street. On Tuesday, hepardoned roughly 1,500 Jan. 6, 2021, insurrectionists, many of whom violently assaulted law enforcement officers. Pardoning a major drug trafficker is bizarre for Trump, who hasvowedto give the death penalty to drug dealers. ""We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught selling drugs, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,"" Trump said in November 2022. ""Because it's the only way."" However, last May at the Libertarian National Convention, Trumppledged to pardonUlbricht in exchange for Libertarians' vote. Libertarians have fought for Ulbricht's release since they support wide-ranging drug legalization and viewed Ulbricht's life sentence as government overreach. ""If you vote for me, on Day 1, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht,"" Trumpsaidat the convention as the crowd chanted Ulbricht's name. ""He's already served 11 years. We're going to get him home."" In the Truth Social post announcing Ulbricht's pardon, Trump wrote that his pardon is making good on his pledge to Libertarian voters. ""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trumpwrote. ""The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!"" What's more, Ulbricht is supported by crypto bros, who have been arguing for Ulbricht's release for years. Bitcoin Magazine hailed Ulbricht's pardon, whichcalledit a ""monumental victory for Bitcoiners."" Trump is also now a cryptocurrency fan, following the launch of his memecoin. Here's how it wasdescribedby Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell: Now thatcrypto has apparently made him even richer, Trump fancies himself one of the crypto bros and did them a solid by releasing Ulbricht.

Trump kills 1965 anti-segregation order in blizzard of racist actions,"Donald Trump has along historyof racism, fromexcusingthe actions of Nazis to promoting the racist birther conspiracy theory. Trump alsosurrounds himselfwith racist advisers like Stephen Miller, who is currently formulating the administration's harsh immigration policy. Trump continued this approach in the first few days of his second presidency by issuing a series of executive orders meant to undo past actions by the U.S. government to address the harmful effects of racism. Trump and his fellow Republicanshave for yearsattacked programs meant to counter racism and encourage diversity, attacking diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. They have falsely claimed that these programs prioritize mediocrity over qualified individuals and decision making. But in reality, the anti-DEI crusade has been a smokescreen for rolling back civil rights. Inhis executive order""Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,"" the Trump administration made this posture clear. The orderexplicitly rescindsExecutive Order 11246, which President Lyndon Johnson signed in 1965—an order Johnson used to desegregate federal contracting. As the Department of Labor websiteexplains(for now, at least), the Johnson order ""reinforced the requirement that federal contractors not discriminate in employment and take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity based on race, color, religion, and national origin."" The department also notes that the Johnson order—now gone, thanks to Trump's actions—were a ""key landmark in a series of federal actions aimed at ending racial, religious and ethnic discrimination."" Reversing an order meant to attack racism and pro-segregation policies was described by the Trump administration ina releaseas ""protecting civil rights and expanding individual opportunity."" In addition to undoing Johnson's actions against segregation, Trump also blamed airline problems on diversity programs. The administration issuedan orderinstructing the Department of Transportation and the FAA to ""immediately stop Biden DEI hiring programs and return to non-discriminatory, merit-based hiring."" The order claimed without evidence that increasing diversity in transportation programs somehow makes travel more dangerous for Americans. As evidence, the administration pointed to a January 2023 FAA outage as ""an illustration of the importance of FAA competence."" But in reality, as theFAA determinedat the time of the outage, the cause was a corrupted database issue that occurred when files were deleted by mistake by a contractor. That's not exactly a diversity issue. The Trump administration alsoissued a blanket orderthat fires all staff within the federal government tasked with addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion issues. But even as decades of work to dismantle bigotry were being undone, new reporting revealed that Trump's inner circle has benefitted from these supposedly problematic programs. The New York Timesreportedthat Kash Patel, Trump'scontroversial pickto lead the FBI, benefitted from a DEI program. Patel participated in the American Bar Association's Judicial Intern Opportunity Program in 2003. According to the association's website, the program ""provides opportunities to students who are members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the profession, including students from minority racial and ethnic groups."" Patel benefitted from the same kind of programs that Trump is undermining for millions of Americans, but as part of the presidential inner circle, he gets a pass.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 16:15:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298429/-Trump-issues-blizzard-of-racist-executive-orders
"Trump unleashes ICE raids on churches, schools, and health care facilities","Donald Trump is following through on some—albeitunpopular—campaign promises. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services released astatementrescinding all of the Biden administration's guidelines for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ""that thwart law enforcement in or near so-called 'sensitive' areas."" In 2021, the Biden administrationexpandedthe definition of ""sensitive locations"" to include social services spaces in the locations where ICE could not arrest people. This meant places such as domestic violence shelters, food banks, counseling facilities, and disaster response centers were off limits for federal raids of undocumented immigrants. But Trump's new guidance doesn't just remove Biden's expansions, but it also includes plans to now allow ICE to raid and arrest people in places of worship, hospitals, and schools. ""The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,"" aDHS statementsaid. Under the first Trump administration, ICE did not have a good record of using ""common sense,"" withnumerous lawsuitsand allegations ofsystemic sexual abuse. ""I said a few times here and there before the election that we'll see what the mass deportation plan looks like when it's ICE agents dragging grandmothers out of churches and, well, here we are,"" New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouiewrote on Bluesky. How this will all unfold remains unclear. Trump's ""border czar"" Tom Homan recentlywalked backsome of the mass deportation promises made during Trump's campaign, though the Trump administration has already planned immigration raids in sanctuary cities likeChicago. While Trump might not be able to deport tens of millions of people as he promised, he is certainly keeping true to his promise to terrorize Americans and their families.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 15:30:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298304/-Trump-unleashes-ICE-raids-on-churches-schools-and-health-care-facilities
‘Totally f-cked’: Instagram users are upset about platform’s shift right,"As Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg rubbed elbows with fellowfront-row billionairesduring Donald Trump'sinaugurationMonday, Instagram users began to notice that searches for the term ""Democrats"" yielded rather dark results. ""Hey, Meta, what the fuck is this?"" influencer Mercedes Chandlerasked in an Instagram videoalongside a screenshot of an error screen. When some users searched the hashtag ""Democrat"" Monday morning, they were hit with the message, ""We've hidden these results. Results for the term you've searched for may contain sensitive content."" In astatement to the BBCTuesday, Meta said, ""We're aware of an error affecting hashtags across the political spectrum and we are working quickly to resolve it."" The company insisted this was not targeted and that the disruption impacted other search terms, including one unspecified Republican hashtag. But once service was restored, users were still claiming that their feeds looked different than before. Multiple social media users told Daily Kos that when they searched the term ""Democrat,"" the results were flooded with Republican content, often from right-wing media like Breitbart, Fox News, and Newsmax. ""I think it's time to leave Instagram. This is totally fucked,"" one user posted alongside a screenshot of their MAGA-laden search results. In our own independent Instagram searches, Daily Kos acquired similar findings. However, we noticed a mix of Republican and Democratic content from the ""Republican"" hashtag as well. Meta declined Daily Kos' request for comment. While theories abound regarding what could be happening behind the scenes with Instagram's algorithm, Zuckerberg has been making much more apparent MAGA-friendly moves. Zuckerberg, who notoriously butted heads with Trump during his first administration, gave in and bent the knee to the convicted felon this time around. The college lonely boy-turned-multibillionaire not only gave a whopping $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, but he alsodismantledMeta's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs;removed fact checkingfrom Facebook and Instagram; and made changes to Meta's ""hateful conduct"" policy, which now allows the use of hate speech toward women, transgender, and nonbinary people. ""We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,"" Zuckerberg said in astatementearlier this month. And as the freshly permed Zuckerberg cozies up to theNazi-saluting Elon Musk, he's also announced a company move to Texas—where Musk's empire is headquartered. Ultimately, it's unclear if Instagram's algorithm is laden with MAGA content because of string pulling behind the scenes or if content from right-leaning creators is just simply more popular. One thing, however, is clear: Owners of the social media platforms that connect people, shape opinions, and keep people informed areeating out of Trump's handgoing into his second term. What they do with this newfound power remains to be seen.",Daily Kos,2025-01-22 14:45:21,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/22/2298243/--Totally-f-cked-Instagram-users-are-upset-about-platform-s-shift-right
These Democrats are uniting against Trump's birthright citizenship ban,"The remaining guardrails of democracy are holding strong—for now. Democrats have wasted no time challenging Donald Trump's attempt to thwart birthright citizenship during his signing of ominous executive orders on his first day in office. A group of Democratic attorneys general announced Tuesday that it wouldlegally challengeTrump's birthright citizenship ban, asserting it as unconstitutional. The group cited the 14th Amendment, which states, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" The group included attorneys general of Arizona, Washington, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Michigan, Colorado, Delaware, Nevada, Hawaii, Maryland, Maine, Minnesota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, along with the District of Columbia and San Francisco. The groupcitesthat it brings this action ""to protect their states, localities, and residents from the President's flagrantly unlawful attempt to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship based on their parentage."" Since 2018, Trump has beenpushing to endbirthright citizenship through executive order. But even an executive ordercan't overrulethe Constitution, and Congress can't pass nor implement an unconstitutional bill. Rather, a constitutional amendment, which requires38 of the 50 statesto ratify, is needed to amend the Constitution. ""President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship is a direct attack on the Constitution and the fundamental rights it guarantees to every child born on American soil,"" New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said. ""The Fourteenth Amendment is clear: citizenship is not a privilege to be granted or revoked by political whim—it is a right enshrined in the very fabric of our nation. We will not stand by as this administration attempts."" ""On day one, President Trump moved to use executive power to effectively amend the Constitution in an unprecedented, but not unexpected manner,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. ""With the exception of indigenous peoples and the descendants of enslaved peoples, the United States is a nation of descendants of immigrants, many of whom risked their lives for the promise of a better life. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that no matter your family's country of origin, if you are born here, this is your home, this is your country."" ""I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, and this executive order is plainly unconstitutional. Babies born here in Vermont have a constitutional right to be embraced as Vermonters and Americans,"" Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said. Meanwhile, just hours into his presidency, Trump was hit with numerouslawsuitsfrom groups like American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, and State Democracy Defenders Fund for his unconstitutional executive order and for the Department of Government Efficiency's violation of theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. It's unclear whether Trump's ban on birthright citizenship will reach the Supreme Court.

"Republicans are back to playing dumb, as Trump does the unforgivable","Fearing the wrath of Dear Leader, congressional Republicans are either refusing to comment on Donald Trump'sdisgusting pardonsof violent Capitol insurrection convicts, or are flat-out lying about what Trump actually did to avoid having to criticize his behavior. Hours after being sworn in to his second term, Trump gaveunconditional pardonsto 1,550 people who either pleaded guilty to or were convicted of crimes related to their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. According toThe New York Times: Trump also commuted the sentences of members of right-wing militia groups theProud Boys and Oath Keeperswho were convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in planning and encouraging violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021—leading to the release of those men from prison. But multiple members of the House and Senate, including Republican congressional leaders, told reporters on Tuesday that they couldn't make a judgement on the blanket pardons Trump issued because they haven't read up on them yet—the least believable lie on earth. ""I haven't gone into the detail,"" Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said. ""I don't know all the cases. I certainly don't want to pardon any violent actors. But there's a real miscarriage of justice here so I'm totally supportive of it,"" Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of WisconsintoldFox News reporter Chad Pergram, apparently unaware that Trump pardoned violent actors. Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabamasaidhe wouldn't be for pardoning the violent insurrectionists, but wouldn't comment because he ""didn't see"" if Trump did that. Republican Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota knew that Trump issued pardons, but played dumb about what they entailed. ""My understanding, there was a range of actions that he took. And I guess I want to look and see what those are,"" Hoevensaid. Other lawmakers straight-up lied about the pardons, saying Trump issued them on a ""case-by-case basis."" ""We're not looking backwards, we're looking forward,"" Senate Majority Leader John ThunetoldCNN's Manu Raju, adding, ""I think they were case-by-case."" Meanwhile, a number of GOP lawmakersrefused to comment at allon the pardons, or tried to shift the conversation to formerPresident Joe Biden's preemptive pardons of his familymembers, who were likely to be harassed by the Trump administration. ""Republican senators are physically shrugging when reporters ask them what they think of Trump pardoning January 6 defendants,"" Haley Byrd Wilt, a Capitol Hill reporter for the nonprofit news outlet NOTUS,wrotein a post on X. Former Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now Trump's secretary of state,saidhe wouldn't comment. ""I'm not going to engage in domestic political debates,"" Rubio told NBC News. In anotherinterviewwith CBS, Rubio refused to comment again, saying ""I work for Trump."" ""I assume you're asking me about the Biden pardons of his family,"" Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of IowatoldSemafor's Burgess Everett—a ridiculous whataboutism. ""I'm just talking about the Biden pardons, because that is so selfish."" Sens. John Cornynof Texas andJim Banksof Indiana also tried to pivot to talking about Biden's pardons. ""You've seen President Biden's preemptive pardons. Pardons of his own family. The power presidential pardons is one granted to a president and there's really no role for the Congress ... it's the president's prerogative,"" Cornynsaid. The pardons go against what Trump's own vice president said just a few days ago that Trump would do. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" JD Vancesaidin aJan. 11 appearanceon ""Fox News Sunday."" To be sure, a few Republicans criticized Trump. ""I'm disappointed to see that and I do fear the message that is sent to these great men and women that stood by us,"" Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the few Republicans who's actually stood up to Trump in the past,said. ""Anybody who is convicted of assault on a police officer, I can't get there, at all.

Mitch McConnell of KentuckytoldSemafor, referring to Vance's belief that violent insurrectionists shouldn't have been pardoned. ""No one should excuse violence. And particularly violence against police officers."" Of course, we don't want to praise anyone for doing the bare minimum and speaking the truth about Trump's awful actions.

Russian state media mocks Trump a day after he criticizes Putin,"RT, Russia's state-owned propaganda network, mocked Donald Trump just a day after he offered up light criticism of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. RTposted a videoof Trump apparently dozing off at a National Prayer Service in Washington along with the caption, ""Trump must be tired after signing all those executive orders, deporting all those people and abolishing all those genders. Melania makes sure he doesn't pull a Biden and fall asleep."" The jab at Trump comes less than 24 hours afterTrump criticizedPutin for ""not making a deal"" to end the war against Ukraine. ""He's not doing so well. I mean, he's grinding it out ... it's not making him look very good. ... I think he would be well off to end that war,"" Trump told reporters. Trump has usually avoided criticizing Putin over the issue of Ukraine. Trump has even claimed that the war wasn't Putin's fault and blamed it on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The war began in 2022 afterPutin lied and saidareas of Ukraine were under control by neo-Nazis, justifying an incursion across the border by the Russian military who has been there since. Not only has Trump offered up excuses for Putin, he haseven blamedUkraine for their predicament—at one point claiming that Zelenskyy ""let that war start."" RT has traditionally been in Trump's corner. In September, the Department of Justiceaccusedthe network of being part of a scheme to funnel millions of dollars to pro-Trump media influencers. Then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said RT was ""functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus."" Trump, of course, benefitted from Russian assistance during the 2016 presidential campaign. A bipartisan report from the Senatereleased in 2020detailed contacts between Trump associates and the Russians, who distributed pro-Trump disinformation. The Russian criticism of Trump comes on the heelsof signalsfrom North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un that he would pursue his ""toughest"" anti-U.S. policy.

Trump seems hell-bent on jamming through some wildly unpopular promises,"Shortly after being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump set out to fulfill many of his campaign promises, signinga flurry of executive ordersandpardoning roughly 1,500people convicted for their role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. While many of these moves haveearned him plauditsfrom bothmembers of the mediaand his base, polling shows they're divisive, if not outright unpopular, with the American electorate. Starting with Trump's most audacious immigration-related proposals, he's sought tosend troopsto the Southern border, reinstate the controversial ""remain in Mexico"" policy for asylum-seekers, and end birthright citizenship for those born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants—a conceptpromised by the Constitution's 14th Amendment. While Americans' attitudes toward increased immigrationhave souredand there's anuptick in supportfor securing the U.S.-Mexico border, the public hasn't quite taken to mass deportations,which Trump has promised. A DecemberCiviqs poll for Daily Kosfound that just over half of registered voters (53%) support this, while an almost equal percentage (46%) were opposed. Deporting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been convicted of a crime nets even less support. According to recent polling fromThe Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, just 37% of Americans support deporting undocumented immigrants who have not committed a crime, compared with 44% who are against doing so. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderseeking to end birthright citizenship—despite the fact that few Americans want him to do so. The same AP-NORC poll found that 28% of Americans support this, while a majority (51%) were opposed. It's possible that recent polling might undersell how many people are opposed to this policy, especially since it's sure to get tied up in legal challenges. Republicans have pushed to end birthright citizenshipsince at least 2011, but polling from around that time suggests that there was never a majority support for it. For instance, a 2010 poll fromQuinnipiac Universityfound that 45% of registered voters said they wanted to ""continue to grant citizenship to all children born in the U.S.,"" while 48% said that existing laws should change ""so children of illegal immigrants are not automatically granted citizenship."" According to former special counsel Jack Smith'sreport,Trump could not accept his loss to former President Joe Biden in 2020 sohe triedto ""direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol ... to further delay it."" Smith added that the crowd was predominantly supporters of Trump and that they ""violently attacked"" law enforcement officers attempting to secure the building. The ensuing riot was a rough day for law enforcement.Roughly 140 officers were injured, andfive later died. Public sentiment is overwhelmingly against pardoning the convicted rioters. The sameDecember Civiqs pollfound that 51% of voters were opposed to pardoning the rioters, including a plurality (47%) who said they were strongly opposed. Other surveys have found similar results. According to December polling fromCBS News/YouGov, 80% of Americans still disapprove of the actions of those who forced their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6, compared with 19% who approve of it. Meanwhile, AP-NORC found just only 2 in 10 Americans favor pardoning most people who participated in the attack, but a much larger share (6 in 10) oppose it, including half who strongly oppose it. Trump has also announced plans toimpose 25% tariffson imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1. But according to data from theGlobal Strategist Group, released in December, 3 in 5 Americans view tariffs unfavorably and believe that they'll increase costs (which they likely will). Meanwhile, data released on Tuesday byNavigator Researchshowed that 37% of registered voters support Trump's tariff plan, while a slightly larger share (41%) are against it. Like Trump's other proposals, support for tariffs is highly partisan: Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (67%) support imposing taxes on foreign goods, while 67% of Democrats oppose it. Independents are more split on the issue: While a plurality (43%) are against Trump's tariff plan, roughly one-third of them (35%) are unsure. On Monday, Trumpsigned an executive orderdirecting the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, but about half of Americans oppose this, according to aforementioned AP-NORC polling. That polling found that roughly half of Americans (52%) ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" oppose that action, with even Republicans fairly split on it (only 45% support the move). Meanwhile, only 2 in 10 Americans (21%) support withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a move that could isolate the nation from the global campaign to curb climate change. Another one of Trump's executive orders mandated that federal employeesreturn to the officefive days a week, ending almost all remote-work arrangements. This is likely to be one of the Trump administration's most unpopular policies since many workers have come to appreciate the flexibility of remote or hybrid work, which was popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic. In October, thePew Research Centerfound that a little under half (46%) of U.S. employees who work from home at least sometimes would be unlikely to stay at their current workplace if their employers required them to come into an office. Only about one-third (36%) said they would stay at their current job if existing remote-work policies changed. There are a number of reasons why workers might prefer more flexible work policies, thoughGallupfound in 2021 that some of the top reasons for wanting fully remote work included avoiding a commute (52%) and feeling more productive (35%). While Democrats most strongly oppose the majority of Trump's plans, Republicans also display some ambivalence, especially over pardons for Jan. 6 rioters. Despite Republican lawmakers and Big Tech allies hyping up Trump, this data seems to suggest that Trump'shoneymoon periodmight be over soon. Then again, if Trump's ever on the outs with voters and finds himself looking to curry favor with them, maybe he can sign an executive orderto lower the prices of eggs.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 23:30:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298220/-Trump-seems-hellbent-on-jamming-through-some-wildly-unpopular-promises
Trump pans prayer service after bishop calls for ‘mercy’ on immigrants,"Donald Trump gave a negative review to a church service that asked for mercy for immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community. Trump attended a national prayer service at National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday accompanied by Vice President JD Vance. The Right Rev. Mariann Budde, an Episcopal bishop, delivered the service and called for unity across ideologies. Directly addressing Trump, Budde said, ""In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared. There are gay, lesbian, and transgender children in Democratic, Republican, and independent families—some who fear for their lives."" Budde then mentioned immigrants and noted, ""The vast majority of immigrants are not criminals,"" as Vance appeared to roll his eyes and Trump shuffled in his seat. ""I ask you to have mercy on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away,"" Budde asked. Following the service, Trumpwas askedby reporters to comment. ""Not too exciting,"" he said. ""They could do much better."" Budde's call for mercy comes as Trump prepares to deliver on the anti-immigrant promises he made during the presidential campaign, most notably planningfor mass deportations. Senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, who hasa considerable history of racismand affiliations with white supremacists,recently huddledwith congressional Republicans to begin making plans on that front. Trump also signedan anti-transgenderexecutive order, claiming that there are just two biological sexes—a return to his campaign's demagoguery of transgender Americans. (Biologistslargely disagreewith the idea of binary sex.) Trump's flippant remark following the religious service comes just a day after henotably declinedto put his hand on the Bible during his inauguration ceremony, bucking a cross-party tradition. His negative review of the sermon also echoes his habit of reacting poorly to criticism. During the presidential campaign, hebacked outof a second debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, who waswidely seen as the winnerof their first and only debate. As arguably the most prominent leader in the world, Trump will attract considerable criticism, and like the last time he held office, he is showing early signs of not being able to handle it well.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 23:00:05,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298265/-Trump-pans-prayer-service-after-bishop-calls-for-mercy-on-immigrants
How the right is justifying—and even celebrating—Musk’s Nazi salute,"Feeling emboldened by Donald Trump officially being sworn in as president, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, gave a nod to Germany's Nazi Party—you know, the one thatkilled six millionJewish people and started World War II. ""Thank you for making it happen,"" Musk said to the raucous MAGA crowd during an inaugural event speech, which he wrapped up by doing the ""Sieg Heil,"" or Nazi salute—twice, just to clear up the possibility that it might have been an unintentional slip-up. Obviously, people have been expressing their reactions of shock and disgust on social media from around the world—except, of course, by far-right Trump supporters and white nationalists, who justified and praised the salute. ""I studied the Nazis at university, taught the history of Nazi Germany on two continents and wrote for major newspapers about Nazi Germany,"" Mike Stuchberywrote on X. ""I am internet famous for fact-checking chuds on the history, ideology and policy of Nazi Germany. That was a Nazi salute."" ""For every dingbat posting Kamala or [Hillary] waving... they're not doing the wind-up, hand to heart which is the hallmark of the Nazi/fascist salute,"" Stuchbery said inanother post. Democrats in Europe were equally aghast, with Spanish Minister of Labor and Social Economy Yolanda Díazdeciding to leaveX after ""the entire world witnessed Elon Musk mimicking a Nazi salute during Donald Trump's inauguration."" Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzsaidat the World Economic Forum Tuesday that Musk has the right to free speech, but ""what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions."" Muskrespondedon his platform X on Monday in an attempt to downplay his Nazi gesture. ""Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, corporate media coverage of Trump has beenoverwhelmingly positive, with POLITICO co-founder John F. Harris writing that Trump is a ""great president."" The Washington PostlabeledMusk's Nazi salute as merely ""exuberant speech,"" and The New York Times explained it away with theheadline, ""Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture."" So we're watering down Nazi salutes as ""hand gestures"" now? To add insult to injury, the Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy organization, defended Musk,sayingthat he ""made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute."" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quicklyrespondedto the ADL's statement. ""Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity. People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all,"" she wrote. During her hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New Yorkdeniedthat Musk did a Nazi salute whenasked about itby Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. Meanwhile, white nationalist and far-right commentators like self-identified ""Christian"" Evan KilgorepraisedMusk's salute. ""Holy crap... Did[Musk] just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington D.C... This is incredible,"" he wrote. But after criticism came roaring in, Kilgorebacktrackedby insulting everyone with autism whodoesn'tsalute Nazis. ""Elon Musk is autistic. He was excited. We all know his intentions weren't to make a Sieg Heil,"" he wrote. ""It looked much more like a Roman Salute. Can we all have a sense of humor for 5 seconds?"" Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of theextremist and conspiratorialplatform Gab,sharedthe photo of Musk doing the Nazi salute with the caption, ""Incredible things are happening."" ""Incredible"" is certainly one way to put it. This moment—and the four years to come—will serve as a significant flashpoint in the slow, steady battle over the normalization of fascism and oligarchy in U.S. politics and culture.

Trump immediately reminds America of his pettiness and fragile ego,"Less than 24 hours into his second term, Donald Trump is already trying to settle scores with his perceived enemies, taking multiple petty actions to stroke his giant and fragile ego. Less than two hours after being sworn in, Trump had a portrait of Gen. Mark Milley—the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who called Trump a ""fascist"" and a ""dangerous"" person—removed from the Pentagon, The New York Timesreported. The portrait had beenunveiledjust 10 days ago. Milley is one of the people Trumpput on his enemies list. Trump's hatred of Milley runs so deep that former President Joe Biden gave Milley apreemptive pardonto prevent Trump from ordering his administration to prosecute Milley for whatever made-up crimes they could conjure up. Milley said he was grateful for Biden's pardon. ""I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,"" he said in a statement. ""I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety."" Trump also announced that he removed four people Biden appointed, including Milley. Trumpwrotein a post on X: Andres is a humanitarian who has beennominatedfor a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit he founded that feeds people suffering from natural disasters, war, and poverty. Andres wrote in a post on X that he couldn't be removed from his position because he already resigned a week ago. Andreswrote: Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta and later worked in the Biden White House as the director of the Office of Public Engagement. Like Andres, Bottoms said she already left her position so Trump's ""firing"" was moot. ""A day late and a dollar short ... My resignation from the President's Export Council was submitted January 4, effective yesterday,"" Bottomssaid. ""You can't fire someone who has already resigned. Of all the things happening in the world, not sure why I'm on Donald Trump's mind at 1:30 am following his inauguration, but I count it as a badge of honor."" And it's unclear why he targeted Hook, who actuallyservedin Trump's first administration as an envoy to Iran. As for other pettiness, following Trump'sdark and low-energy inaugural address, he gaverambling 30-minute remarksin which he complained about his 2024 victory and lied about voter fraud, falsely saying he ""would have won the state of California"" in 2024 were it not for fraud. In thoseremarks, Trump also falsely accused Milley as well as the members of Congress who investigated the Capitol insurrection of being guilty of ""very, very guilty of very, very bad crimes""—making Biden's preemptive pardons look well justified. Ultimately, Trump's first day in office was anabject disasterthat proved his detractors right when they warned that his second term would be four years of Trump going after anyone who he deems insufficiently subservient.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 21:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298193/-Trump-immediately-reminds-America-of-his-pettiness-and-fragile-ego
Why the internet is blaming a billionaire couple for California fires,"Online creators have been buzzing aboutStewart and Lynda Resnick, billionaires who own a portion of Southern California's water supply, claiming that the couple is to blame for fire hydrantsrunning dryamid the ongoing wildfires across the region. But while the Resnicks have areputationfor being the ""California couple who uses more water than every home in Los Angeles combined,"" the blame is actually misplaced. The Resnicks made their billions from theirWonderful Company, which produces foods like Wonderful Pistachios, POM pomegranate juice, and Halo tangerines. In 1994, the Resnicks signed acontroversial backroom dealsecuring 58% of the Kern Water Bank. But according toCBS News, California's water laws allow owners the right to usage, not ownership of the water itself. Moreover, the state actually has laws prohibiting people from withholding or hoarding water. Felicia Marcus, former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, told CBS News that the state constitution includes a ""prohibition against waste and unreasonable use."" In other words, if ""you actually ended up in a situation where somebody was withholding water at a grand scale,"" the government could step in. The Resnicks, whopledged $10 millionfrom Wonderful Companyfor wildfire relief efforts,are just one example of the misinformed blame-throwing going on since the fires started. President Donald Trumpfalsely claimedthat California Gov. Gavin Newsom's failure to sign a ""water restoration declaration"" was the reason for water supply shortages. Newsom's office later noted that ""no such document"" even exists. Other finger pointing was aimed atAI and tech companies, where social media users quickly circulated claims that super computers used up the water supplies desperately needed by the firefighters. Thereal reasonfor the lack of water, however, is much more complicated. And, even more so, Los Angeles was simply not equipped for a natural disaster of this scale even with water supplies at a historical high. ""What's happening in LA is not because there's not enough water in LA in storage,"" Marcus said. ""There are no urban water systems that are built out to handle a firestorm like this."" At the end of the day, people are angry and scared. Many have lost their homes, their financial safety net, and their sense of security. And as of Jan. 16,at least 27 peopledied in the fires. While conditions have eased, allowing firefighters to push back the flames, the ultra-dry conditions have expertsconcerned about future vulnerability. For those looking to help out but not sure where to start, disaster relief expertIrwin Redlenertold Daily Kos that it's not always helpful to throw money at large nonprofits like American Red Cross, since they often already have large endowments for disasters. Instead, he recommends supporting charities at the local level, including churches. But even that, unfortunately, can be complicated as it's difficult to trace where exactly funds are going. ""It's hard for the consumer to tell what is actually most effective,"" he said, adding thatCharity Navigatoris a helpful tool for assessing a charity's effectiveness. Redlener also pointed out that the destruction from the California wildfires will last much longer than the media coverage. ""It will disappear from the front pages of news organizations, and it will be replaced by other issues. And, ironically, that may be the time when we really need to be thinking about what's happening to the people who have been affected by the disaster,"" he said. ""So sometimes it might be worth it for people to sort of hold on to their generosity.""",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 20:00:22,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297340/-Why-the-internet-is-blaming-a-billionaire-couple-for-California-fires
'Great president': Mainstream media slobbers all over Trump,"Early in Donald Trump's new presidency, mainstream media outlets confirmed fears of how they would cover him—by avoiding the truth, equivocating on his abuse of power, and even praising him. The actions by widely read and watched outlets was the continuation of a recent trend that has seen outlets likeABC News,MSNBC, andThe Washington Postcave to Trump, even before he was sworn in. ""Time to Admit It: Trump Is a Great President,"" readsthe beginning of a Politico headlinepublished Tuesday. Contrary to its appearance, the column was not written by Trump himself or even one of his many MAGA acolytes in the media. Instead, it is the work of Politico co-founder and current Global Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, a longtime mainstay of Washington journalism. The gushing goes beyond the headline as Harris writes, ""[Trump] is someone with an ability to perceive opportunities that most politicians do not and forge powerful, sustained connections with large swaths of people in ways that no contemporary can match. In other words: He is a force of history."" When the mainstream press isn't prematurely declaring Trump's greatness (and ignoring thedeath tollof his previous stint of making America ""great""), it equivocated on one of his first acts, which gave a green light to hundreds of criminals. Trumppardoned about 1,500 people convictedof attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, over the protests of millions—including the police officersbattered and bruised by insurrectionists attempting to overturn the election. ButatThe Washington Post, this was the equivalent of President Joe Biden'sdecisionto preemptively pardon figures like Anthony Fauci, retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, and members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee whom Trump and his MAGA movement have targeted. ""Biden started the day with pardons. Trump finished with many more,"" reads the Post headline—as if pardoning Enrique Tarrio, convicted of sedition against the United States, is the same thing as pardoning Dr. Fauci, who MAGA world hates for the sin of telling Americans to mask up during a global pandemic. Things aren't much better at The New York Times.Their headlineon Trump's pardons: ""In Dueling Pardons, an Intensified Fight Over the Meaning of Jan. 6."" Apparently, the Times believes that Biden issuing a pardon to Milley, whom Trump has lambasted for calling him a ""fascist,"" is on the same level as Trump's pardon of the man who stormed the Capitol with a ""Camp Auschwitz"" hoodie. At a post-inauguration rally for Trump, his co-President andcampaign benefactorElon Musk—the richest person in the world—gave a Nazi salute. Twice. Yet,atThe Washington Post, it was merely an ""exuberant speech."" Meanwhile, forThe New York Times, the furor at the hand motion was explained away: ""Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture."" Meanwhile, NBC's Chicago affiliate apparentlyposted a videoof Musk's speech where the feed cut to a shot of the audience at the precise moments of the offensive salutes. Over the course of the 2024 election, the mainstream pressmade clearthat it would prioritize criticism of Democrats like Biden and Vice President Harris while playing down offenses by Trump. Now that Trump is back in the Oval Office, the press is continuing that trend. The press has long been described as the watchdogs of democracy, but these outlets show that the watchdog has gone on a break.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 18:00:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298201/-Mainstream-media-fails-the-Trump-test-on-his-first-day-back
Trump's speech raises the old question: Is he evil or merely stupid?,"In Donald Trump's new conceit, America was a hellhole in 2016, he made it great, then former President Joe Biden broke everything, but thanks to Trump's 2024 election win, everything will be great again. Or, as he said inhis inaugural addresson Monday, ""The golden age of America begins right now."" You know he is full of shit. I know he's full of shit. We'd like to think everyone around him knows so as well, but doeshe? It's the age-old question: Is Trump evil or merely stupid? Ifhis inaugural speechsays anything, it's that he is delusional in what he thinks he can accomplish. After some throat clearing, Trump's speech begins: One of Trump's conceits is that other countries no longer respect the United States but that they did respect us when he was president—a time when the world literallylaughed at him. Right off the bat, we find out that Trump has no intentions of uniting the country. Rather, he'll be airing his usual grievances—Trump's 24/7/365 celebration ofFestivus. Trump wants to end the weaponization of the Justice Department? So patently absurd, especially as Trumpfrequently talks aboutall his enemies he wants to prosecute. Just this past Saturday, heshared a poston his Truth Social platform that called for Democratic politicians to be prosecuted. It's going to be an exhausting four years. Sunlight is pouring over the world, y'all. Imagine the gall of saying that when the front row of your inauguration audience—in front of your Cabinet picks—is the modern American oligarchy: Net worthof those pictured as of Tuesday morning: Tesla CEO Elon Musk: $425 billion Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: $241 billion Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: $212 billion Google CEO Sundar Pichai:$1.3 billion Add in Bernard Arnault, whoalso attendedand whose familial net worth is $181 billion, and you get a combined net worth of nearly $1.1 trillion. TRILLION. Four of the five richest men in the world were there, and it's possible all five were if Trump pal Larry Ellison was also somewhere in the crowd. Trump will stand there and talk about ""extracted ... wealth from our citizens"" when he seems to havejustpulled apump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemeon his own followers? It's telling that when talking about national disasters, his real empathy has always been for the wealthy: Maybe those powerful and wealthy individuals can pay their fair share of taxes to support those services? Not to mention the brutal insult to the firefighters bravely fighting those fires in Los Angeles. Also,Trump cut the FEMA budgetlast time he was president. You better believe it'll get hacked this time around as well. It won't be remembered as such. Why would it be? Sheesh. And no, the nation isn't unifying. It'sjust as divided as always. In any case, Trump then starts with his promises, leading with sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. As I've written before,good luck with that. Even his own border czar, Tom Homan, is trying to temper expectations. The U.S. is already atop energy exporterin the world. Trump will soon take credit for somethingBiden has largely done. Given the climate crisis, though, this may not actually be a good thing. Congrats, Elon Musk, who owns the electric car company Tesla. Also, the Green New Deal isn't law. Is Trump talking about green energy projects under Biden's Inflation Reduction Act? In one of those inexplicable things Democrats keep doing to themselves, the bulk of investment from that lawwent to red congressional districts. And those Republicansdon't want to give up that sweet federal cash. Me, I'm actually rooting for Trump to kill those projects. If Republican voters want federal investment in their communities, they can vote Democratic next time. And when Democrats have power, they need to spend that money ontheirconstituents. Build those factories in blue cities and states. Give them a reason tokeepvoting Democratic. Because watching their tax dollars go to ingrate conservatives isn't doing the party any good. Every business leader, including those sitting in Trump's inauguration audience, knows that this will be a tax on American consumers. Along with any deportations the administration manages, this will prove to be deeply inflationary. So all those people complaining about the price of eggs? Buckle down—it's about to get much worse. Also, there's already an ""External Revenue Service."" It's thecustomspart of the U.S.Customsand Border Protection agency. Put a pin on this one. Itwon't age well. Cruelty will certainly be the official policy of the United States. I'm gonna have to research what ""radical political theories"" he's talking about. Is itwomen in combat? I bet it's women in combat roles. Our armed forces are facing arecruiting crisis. Trump wants to make it worse. I'm laughing too! Trump's a loon. He also claims he'll take back thePanama Canal. But remember, he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, as he threatens Panama (andGreenland and Denmark, andCanada, among other allies). He wants to keep kids disease-free ... and yet he wantsa vaccine denierto lead the Department of Health and Human Services ... all while being the dude wholovesMcDonald's. He wants his legacy to be peace, and nothing says ""peace"" more than actual, literal imperialism. So ... is his vision of ""unity"" and ""peace"" actually more like ""world conquest""? Sure seems that way. Because nothing says ""angry, violent, and totally unpredictable"" like Trump himself and his MAGA movement. Indeed, if there'sanythingwe are sure to see over the next four years it's more anger, violence, and unpredictability, courtesy of Trump. That is already his legacy, andeverythinghe is pushing for—deportations, inflationary tariffs, anti-trans hate, and imperialism—will only further cement that legacy.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 17:00:09,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298037/-Trump-s-speech-raises-the-old-question-Is-he-evil-or-merely-stupid
Trump hit with barrage of lawsuits over his lawless Day 1 actions,"Just hours into his second term, Donald Trump has been hit with multiple different lawsuits. The lawsuits are challenging his spate of lawless executive orders that hesigned from a big boy deskin front of a crowd of his economically anxious supporters wholeft thousands of dollars worth of their belongingsoutside of the Capitol One Arena Monday afternoon. The lawsuits target everything from Trump'sblatantly unconstitutional executive orderthat reinterprets the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, to his toothless Department of Government Efficiency advisory commission. And more lawsuitscould be on the way. The ACLUsuedTrump over his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, which is plainly guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump's executive order states that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to people born to undocumented parents, and thus those people should not be given birth certificates. From theorder: The ACLU said in its lawsuit that this order violates the Supreme Court's ruling inUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark. ""The Supreme Court conclusively determined that all children born in the United States are citizens, subject only to very limited exceptions,"" the ACLU lawsuit said of theWong Kim Arkdecision. ""This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans,"" Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,saidin a statement. ""We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail."" Trump's executive order creatingDOGE, meanwhile, was hit with three lawsuits, all of which allege that the fake government department violates theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which defines how such committees operate. The public interest law firm National Security Counselors was first out the gate in suing the advisory commission led by co-President andNazi saluterElon Musk. (DOGE was also supposed to be led by billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but Ramaswamy was reportedlyoustedbefore his job even began. He is preparing to launch a bid for governor in Ohio, as his fetish for losing elections can't be suppressed.) The NSC lawsuitsaysthat under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, DOGE is considered a ""federal advisory committee"" and thus must ""be balanced in terms of points of view represented,"" have public meetings held with 15 days of advance notice and have minutes available to the public. DOGE follows none of those rules. Asecondlawsuit from six public interest groups, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also alleges that DOGE violates FACA. ""DOGE's unchecked secrecy, access, and private influence—bought by political loyalty—is anathema to efficient, effective government. Indeed, any federally endorsed, but fundamentally private, advisory effort to shape how our government serves the American people must comply with federal transparency laws, including FACA. Defendants have not done so,"" the lawsuit states. And athirdsuit from Public Citizen, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the American Federation of Government Employees, also says DOGE is in violation of FACA. ""AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,"" American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelleysaidin a statement. Finally, the National Treasury Employees Union filedsuitover Trump'sexecutive orderthat seeks to make it easier for him to fire federal employees. ""When establishing hiring principles, Congress determined that most federal government jobs be in the merit-based, competitive service. And it established that most federal employees have due process rights if their agency employer wants to remove them from employment. Because the Policy/Career Executive Order attempts to divest federal employees of these due process rights, it is contrary to congressional intent,"" the lawsuit states. ""This order is about administering political loyalty tests to everyday employees in the federal workforce who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve their country,"" NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in astatementto Bloomberg Law. Of course, Trump doesn't care about following the law, as he thinks he is above it, so it's unclear if he would even follow court orders that arise from these lawsuits. Already, he is blatantly violatingthe law that banned TikTokby signing an executive orderpausingthe app ban.

Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of ""law and order,"" one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump's pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost ""patriots"" and ""hostages"" in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump's actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio's caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump's action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading ""Camp Auschwitz,"" referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump's action. ""One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,"" Gonelltold HuffPost. ""It's a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It's a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again."" Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, ""This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump's pardons,writing, ""President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists."" One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that ""these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose."" The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.'s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""I don't think it's causing much controversy."" She later added, ""President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system."" Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 15:01:24,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298174/-Law-and-order-Trump-slammed-for-freeing-terrorists-and-Nazi-sympathizers
Why is Trump stockpiling so much cash?,"Business leaders and wealthy donors are surrendering to President Donald Trump's demands for more money, and his team said it expects to amass an eye-popping $500 million by summer. According toAxios, Trump is hoarding cash partly because he doesn't want his second administration to be seen as a lame duck, even though he's constitutionally prohibited from running again. Of course, the fundraising efforts will benefit Trump first and foremost. With half a billion dollars in his coffers, Trump could surely continue wielding control over the GOP, using the money to punish his dissenters. ""The money is just pouring in at Mar-a-Lago. Trump doesn't have to lift a finger. Everyone's coming to him,"" one anonymous Trump adviser told Axios. The adviser added that Trump's team is ""on track"" to raise $500 million by June. ""It's sort of a target but it's just a realistic projection of what's happening."" The money is feeding into several accounts, including Trump's inauguration fund, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, the Securing American Greatness nonprofit, the Republican National Committee, and the fund for Trump's future presidential library. While it's been thoroughly reported that business and tech moguls aremajor Trump donorsand were beingrewarded with plum seatsat Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, people from the cryptocurrency industry are blowing them out of the water. A Trump adviser told Axios that ""crypto guys"" were giving as much as $20 million. Notably, it's not just tech and crypto bros added to Trump's treasure trove of cash. The donors come from a wide range of industries—from agriculture and insurance to finance to health care. These donations are a stark change from what we saw four years ago, when some companiespledged to rethink or withholdtheir donations from Republican lawmakers whovoted to overturnthe results of the 2020 election. While many of those companies later resumed their donations, Trump apparently kept a list of those who didn't and is reminding them thatthey'll only get richer once he's back in the White House. ""You guys made this amount of money last year and you're gonna make so much more now because of me,"" Trump told the representatives of one company, according to Axios. Trump is also apparently holding a grudge over the fact that some of the donors now knuckling under were nowhere to be found during his 2024 presidential campaign. One company's consultant told Axios that Trump was ""raking [a client and future donor] over the coals"" after they paused donations. ""When I needed you, where the fuck were you? You weren't with me and maybe you were with [Vice President Kamala Harris],"" Trump reportedly said. But he has made clear that his newfound treasure trove of cash won't go toward benefitting those who donated. A second Trump adviser put it plainly: ""He'll take your money and then tell you, 'I don't give a fuck what you want.' He did that during the campaign. ... He's going to do what he wants, what the base wants."" This hasn't stopped the donations from pouring in, however. Axios reported that some donors are holding out hope that getting back on Trump's good side—even if they don't get any tangible legislative rewards for their giving—is worth it. After all, getting on Trump's bad side is known to negatively affect companies,just look at Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Plus, in the words of one anonymous lobbyist who spoke with Axios, these companies don't want to ""get DOGE'd"" by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have threatened tocut an unspecified amountof federal spending once they're co-leading thetoothlessadvisory commission known as the Department of Government Efficiency. With all this money stockpiled—and the abilityto keep raking it in—Trump will surely use it to punish his enemies, reward those who are loyal to him, and help Republicans keep power in Washington, D.C., where they hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate. In life, and in politics especially,money is power. With this, Trump can continue his reign as de facto leader of the GOP for not only his next four years in the White House but also long afterward.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 14:00:19,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297105/-Why-is-Trump-stockpiling-so-much-cash
9 Trump inauguration promises that won't lower the price of your eggs,"After not putting his hand on the Bible as he took the oath of office, Donald Trump gave an extremely dark and lie-filledinaugural addresson Monday in which he rattled off a list of his priorities—none of which will lower prices for Americans, as he promised to do. In his speech, Trump bragged about hisnarrowvictory, whined that he's been ""challenged more than any president in our 250-year history,"" and ultimately declared that God himself saved Trump so he could ""make America great again""—a totally humble thing to say. He then went on to list his priorities, most of which were either immigration-related or meaningless gestures meant to hurt vulnerable populations or make him feel macho. In fact, after the official speech was over, Trump spoke to an overflow crowd of his supporters—who were kept out of the Capitol Rotunda where the speech took place so that the cadre ofbillionaire tech brosTrump pals around with could get front-row seats—telling them that his advisers really wanted him to talk more about inflation, but he refused. ""How many times can you say an apple has doubled in cost?"" Trumpsaid,in a rambling speech in which he went on to complain about his 2024 victory again and said he would have won California if it were not for fraud—a complete lie. In any event, here are the promises Trump made in his inaugural address that won't help your pocketbook and could actually make your finances worse: ""I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,"" Trump said, invoking the Nazi-esque language about immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border. Deploying troops to deal with immigrants at the border willcost taxpayers money, and likely won't make a difference as it islegalto seek asylum in the U.S. ""America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it,"" Trump declared. ""We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it."" Contrary to what Trump said, America is already producing a record amount of crude oil, and is currently the lead oil producer in the world for thesixth consecutive year. What's more, experts say his ""drill, baby, drill"" policy won't actually lower prices. ""This will likely have little to no impact on #gasprices or fuel prices in the short-term, as a President can de-regulate, but there is no direct action that can be issued requiring oil companies to raise production,"" Patrick De Haan, a gas prices expert,wrotein a post on X. ""I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,"" Trump said. ""For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues that will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources."" Of course, foreign countries do not pay tariffs. Companies in the United States that import goods pay the tariffs, and then they pass those added costs down to consumers, raising prices and causing inflation to soar. Hisnew tariff policywill be destructive to the economy, and your pocketbook. ""After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,"" Trump said. There's already a thing called the First Amendment that protects speech, so it's unlikely a toothless executive order will do anything more than give Trump a piece of paper to sign at hisbig boy desk. ""As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,"" Trump said. This declaration will literally do nothing to make your daily life better, and instead will only hurt transgender Americans, who are already at risk of beingtargets of violenceanddiscrimination. Trump wants to look macho by declaring he will unilaterally change the name of a major body of water. How will this help you, you ask? It won't. It's literally a meaningless gesture. It was such a dumb promise that Hillary Clinton was seen laughing out loud in the audience. ""We will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mt. McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs,"" Trump said. ""President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent."" Alaskans, where Denali is located,don't even want this, but that's not stopping Trump from using his Sharpie to sign an executive order to make him feel like he's accomplishing something. ""We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama's promise to us has been broken,"" Trump said. ""The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we're taking it back."" There's a lot to unpack here. First, American ships are being charged the same as other ships in the canal. And second,China is not operating the canal. Trump has been telling this lie for weeks, leading Panamanian President José Mulino todeclarepublicly, ""There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God. The world is free to visit the canal."" Trump eventhreatened to use military forceto take back the canal, which would violate Trump's other inaugural speech promise of not starting any wars. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pointed out that conflicting message after Trump's inaugural address. ""He pledged to be a president of peace and not start any new wars but also pledged to forcibly take another country's territory,"" Maddowsaid. ""And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars,"" Trump said, a line that really got co-President Elon Musk going. If this speech is any indication, the next four years are going to be so incredibly stupid. Just 1,461 days to go.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 22:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/20/2298007/-9-Trump-inauguration-promises-that-won-t-lower-the-price-of-your-eggs
DOGE makes its first cut as 'co-chair' Ramaswamy reportedly dumped,"Awkward entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamyalready appears to be outat the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, multiple media outletsreported, not even making it to Day 1 of the toothless advisory commission. According to CBS News, Ramaswamy is expected to depart the pretend department, after he pissed off Elon Musk, a fellow awkward rich dude who Donald Trumpjointly taskedwith leading the entity that's supposed to find ways to slash the federal budget. CBS News reported that Ramaswamy was lazy and hasn't been working on the project, leading to friction with Musk. ""Vivek has worn out his welcome,"" an unnamed ""person close to Trump""toldCBS. Rather than actually doing the work to find the $2 trillion in cuts to the budget that he and Musk promised to make, Ramaswamy has instead been trying to get himself a role as an elected official. He had reportedlywanted to be appointedto the Ohio Senate seat vacated by JD Vance, but the current Ohio governor snubbed him andchose someone else. Now, Ramaswamy has his sights set on Ohio's governorship, and could announce his candidacy for that by the end of the month, Fox Newsreported. There's nothing Ramaswamy—who ran a failed bid for president in 2024—likes more than losing elections, it seems. As for the future of DOGE, Musk has alreadyadmittedthat the commission, which is not a real department and has no actual power, likely won't even get to half of the $2 trillion in cuts he once promised. And the Washington Postreportedthat DOGE is expected to be sued by the public interest law firm National Security Counselors within minutes of Trump's swearing in. According to the Post's report: All in all, not a very auspicious start for the DOGE bros. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Musk and Ramaswamyhad said they would cut $2 billion from the budget. The number is actually $2 trillion.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 19:27:26,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/20/2297968/-DOGE-makes-its-first-cut-as-co-chair-Ramaswamy-reportedly-dumped
Meet the unlikely Democrats who could revive the weary party,"Democrats have a long four years ahead of them. Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential election loss finds the party in a wake of theories, finger-pointing, and hopeful ideas for how to reignite a fire in voters' bellies. Part of this quest starts with the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the effort to elect Democrats to positions at the federal, state, and local levels. In other words, the DNC amplifies the message of the Democratic Party as a whole. Following the resignation of DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, Democrats are seeking tofind a new leaderwho excels in areas where the party fell short. A main area in need of improvement: engaging disinterested or alreadyexhausted voters. On Tuesday night, the DNC chair candidatesmet with CHORUS, a teamof progressive online creators, for afirst-of-its-kind forumin an attempt to do just that—and according to the statistics, they succeeded. A real-time poll during the event showed that 85% of the people tuning into the livestream were watching a DNC forum for the first time The candidates vying for the chair position include:Wisconsin Democratic chair Ben Wikler; Minnesota party chair Ken Martin; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; 2022 Arkansas congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; self-help guru Marianne Williamson; New York state Sen. James Skoufis; and attorney Jason Paul. While most of these candidates might be unfamiliar to most Americans, the online creators who moderated the forum gave their collective millions of followers an opportunity to get to know them. As the chart above shows, a Civiqs poll of Democrats showed that 64% of respondents feel ""scared, depressed, or angry"" about ""the way things are going in the United States today."" Grappling with a growing number of weary and burnt-out voters following this last election cycle, the Democratic Party is looking toward creators as a way to inform, educate, and reengage the party base. Creator and political commentator Zack Kirk, known as theZacktiviston social media, told Daily Kos that he was shocked by how misinformed many people online are. ""I've been baffled and was blindsided by the lack of understanding [people have] around how government works,"" he told us. And as conservativeonline creators and podcastersrallied and enraged the right over the past four years, left-leaning creators such as Kirk realize more than ever the importance of educating and motivating their side's online community. This is where his own content comes in. Kirk—whose full-time job doesn't include politics and content creation—spends his free time thinking about how and where to best relate to his community. Identifying as someone who puts the ""well-being of people"" before politics, Kirk's style of delivering political news and commentary offers something that traditional media such as MSNBC typically does not: a solution. Instead of reporting on the doom and gloom of MAGA wins, Kirk intends to flip the narrative. ""[I will] continue to deliver information to my network, to my communities, that will give them ways of coping and surviving,"" he said, adding that he plans to ""uplift the stories that are being missed"" in the sea of Trump news. For those looking for reprieve and connection when scrolling on their phone, stories that aren't screaming of negative breaking news might serve as an avenue back into political engagement. Another benefit of these creator-led political discussions for the Democratic Party is the ability to highlight communities in America that may not always get air time in mainstream media. ""Raise your hand if you know who the 92% are,"" creator Elizabeth Booker-Houston asked the DNC chair candidates Tuesday night. The lawyer, professor, comedian, and content creator was referring to thepercentage of Black womenwho voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Notably, only one candidate raised their hand when asked the question. Telling the panel of candidates that ""Black women are exhausted"" and quipping that Baltimore is ""too Black and too scary for Republicans,"" Booker-Houston is but one example of a left-leaning creator who authentically appeals and relates to a base of Democratic voters sometimes viewed as forgotten. But as the countdown inches closer to Donald Trump's second inauguration, Democrats—and the DNC chair nominees—unanimously agree on one thing: The Democratic Party's approach isn't working anymore, and it's time to embrace new left-friendly media sources. If you ask Kirk, Democrats have their work cut out for them. ""We're at ground zero,"" he said. ""No one has emerged as a definitive voice of the Democratic Party or the resistance to what Trump is going to do. No one's giving a counter."" A vote for the new DNC chair is scheduled for Feb. 1, and while a front-runner hasn't emerged just yet, one thing is for sure—Democrats can't afford to ignore the power of influencers.",Daily Kos,2025-01-20 00:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/19/2297155/-Meet-the-unlikely-Democrats-who-could-revive-the-weary-party
What migration to red states could mean for the Democratic Party,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a significantpopulation shifthas been underway, led chiefly by millennials and Gen Z Americans who aremovingfrom urban to rural areas. This could spell trouble for the Democratic Party, which has historically depended on voters in dense and progressive cities and states. As thepopulationsin states like California, New York, and Illinois decline, these once-solidly blue states could face an existential crisis as they are no longer the reliable powerhouses they once were. Meanwhile, conservative southern states like Texas and Florida are gaining new residents. This could dramatically shift the balance of political power, making blue states less competitive and red states more influential. According to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, if these migration patterns continue through the 2030 Census, California will lose four Congressional seats and New York will lose two. In total, states that went to Kamala Harris in 2024 could lose a dozen House seats and Electoral College votes, making the path for Democrats even more difficult. The concept ofcritical mass theoryis that collective political action requires a ""critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body."" It's no secret that rural areas tend to be red, while urban areas are typically blue. The migration trend, while unsettling for Democrats, isn't all bad news. If it continues, the party could have an opportunity to reshape these growing, historically conservative regions into states in play. But this won't happen overnight. First, Democrats might experience a significant loss of voters in blue states as people migrate to red states. Only after reaching a ""critical mass"" of voters in these conservative areas will Democrats have the chance to make an impact. However, parties can't base their fundraising and strategies on wait-and-sees. Right now, Democrats are looking at North Carolina and, yes, even Texas, where there was a close Senate race in 2024—with Colin Allred losing by less than a million votes to Ted Cruz—to build a platform on the economic issues that got Donald Trump his populist base. As time passes and migration patterns continue, baby boomers will give way to a new generation of rural voters who Democrats could sweep up. But it would be a mistake to ignore the issues that impact the majority of Americansnow, like student debt, sky-high housing prices, the climate crisis, and expensive health care. There are many reasons why people migrate. The pandemic caused aboom in remote workthat, combined withrising rental costsin cities, made it easier for people to relocate to more affordable rural areas. Trends like ""cottage core"" and ""trad wife"" that have become popular among millennials and Gen Z have idealized homesteads and rural living. Some might argue that the great migration is simply a result of anoverworked,exhausted, anddisillusionedgeneration of Americans whowant to quitthe rat race. Migration could also be due, in part, to the drastic changes in cities as a result of the pandemic. What was once a bustling nightlife scene has given way toshuttered small businesses, leading to a more solitary lifestyle. Similarly, as rents increase, young people are priced out of homeownership, and wages don't keep up, people are opting to live in places where they can get more for their money. Democrats haven't achieved a significant victory in the South since former PresidentJimmy Carterin the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the GOP staked out the long game, successfully implementingits southern strategyand winning all of those states in 2024. Even before its defeat in November, the Democratic Party recalibrated, adhering to its loss of the South and instead focusing on trying to win the Midwest's ""Blue Wall""—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. But as the electorate has shifted, it's no longer enough to win the White House without the support of some southern states. How will the party that is redlining itself reclaim rural voters, especially ones in the South who've gone devout MAGA? And will these migration trends solidify Democrats' decline in traditionally blue states, or will they become an opportunity to shift the political landscape in red states? The answers are still unknown, but how the Democratic Party adapts to these population changes will determine where it goes from here.",Daily Kos,2025-01-19 16:00:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/19/2297351/-What-migration-to-red-states-could-mean-for-the-Democratic-Party
Explaining the Right: The imaginary scourge of noncitizen voting,"Republicans in multiple states are pushing for federal legislation to address noncitizen voting, something they insist is an urgent matter requiring intervention at the highest levels of the government. But the problem does not really exist and is a smokescreen for rules, regulations, and practices that help Republicans win elections. Earlier this week, 12 of the state chairs for the right-wing State Freedom Caucus Networksent a letterto congressional leaders pushing for passage of the ""Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act."" The law, proposed by Republicans, purports to close loopholes allowing for noncitizen voting. ""The states continue to face the prospect of a huge population of noncitizens illegally voting in our elections and potentially affecting the outcome,"" the letter alleges. ""We must close the loopholes that put the integrity of our elections at risk. We need the SAVE Act to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections."" This isfalse. First, it'salready illegalfor noncitizens to vote in federal elections. If a noncitizen even registers to vote, they could face up to five years in prison. Ina studyconducted by the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, researchers could find only 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting in the 2016 election, comprising 0.0001% of votes that were cast in those jurisdictions. That number includes onlypotentialnoncitizen votes—notcases that have been investigated and determined to be ineligible. Not only is noncitizen votingextremely rare, it's also not coordinated by any groups in a way to systematically control the outcomes of elections. Additionally, civil rights groupshave calledthe SAVE Act ""unnecessary and dangerous,"" and said it ""is intended to elicit irrational fear of the growing number of citizens of color."" But the issue is just one of the latest ways Donald Trump and other Republican officialsarefearmongeringaround immigration. Similarly, right-wing media outlets, like Fox News and Newsmax, havemade storiesabout the purported problem a staple of their programming. Promoting these lies creates an environment where voter-suppression laws and regulations can thrive. When these rules are in place, eligible voters have then beenbarred from voting, and frequently when election turnout is low,that has favoredthe political fortunes of the Republican Party (but it is not the case in every election). Noncitizen voting is also a convenient boogeyman for the right.Conservative ideasand candidates are often unpopular, but instead of confronting this lack of appeal, the right can simply blame noncitizens—a population they demonize anyway—for their loss. Trumpdid this in 2017, when he falsely claimed that his popular-vote loss to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was the fault of undocumented immigrants. Campaigning against an imaginary wave of noncitizen voting serves many purposes for the right: It rallies supporters against migrants, it pushes laws that help Republicans, and it excuses Republican losses in elections. The core issue is made up, but the effects are unfortunately very real.",Daily Kos,2025-01-19 00:00:15,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297485/-Explaining-the-Right-The-imaginary-scourge-of-noncitizen-voting
Here’s the moment Mark Zuckerberg gave away the game,"Like the rest of the tech billionaire class, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided to give up any pretense of ethics in order to cozy up to President-elect Donald Trump. ZuckerbergkilledMeta's fact checking andendedall of the company's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. In order to do some damage control—and to audition for the Trump administration's favor—Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan's podcast, which has become a forum for billionaires to act aggrieved as theytake control of the country. When Rogan asked Zuckerberg to elaborate on how he has become a victim of a politicized government, Zuckerberg rambled on. ""So we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like I think like the CFPB like, this, financial—I don't even know what it stands for. It's the ... it's the financial organization that Elizabeth Warren had set up. And, and it's basically, it's like, we're not a bank,"" he said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which started under theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, has beeninvestigating Metaover allegations that it misuses private data for financial gain. The idea that Zuckerberg doesn't know what the CFPB is or that it doesn't exclusively involve banks (having alsoinvestigatedApple, Amazon, Google, etc.) is incredibly disingenuous. He's either so outrageously dumb that shareholders must force him to leave the business, or he's lying on Rogan's show for a reason. ""They kind of found some theory they wanted to investigate. And it's like, okay, clearly they were trying really hard, right? To like, to like, find, find some theory, but it, like, I don't know. It just, it kind of, like, throughout the, the, the, the, the party and the government, there was just sort of, I don't know if it's, I don't know how this stuff works. I mean, I've never been in government,"" Zuckerberg told Rogan. Is the CEO of Meta talking about the CFPB's investigation? Or maybe he's talking about theupcoming anti-trust trialbetween Meta and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Since Trump's first term, Meta has been fighting to keep anti-trust laws from breaking up its control of Facebook and Instagram. Outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khantold CNBCthat she wasn't surprised companies like Meta are trying to ""get some type of sweetheart deal"" from the incoming Trump administration. While on Rogan's podcast, Zuckerberg cravenly appealed to the insecure and aggrieved male audience,telling Roganthat the ""corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,"" before arguing that ""masculine energy"" was lacking in the workforce today. ""It's one thing to say we want to be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it's another to basically say that 'masculinity is bad,'"" he said. According toThe New York Times, the ever-masculine Zuckerberg followed that up a few days later by throwing his former COO Sheryl Sandberg under the bus for Meta's previous DEI policies.

Trump and his goons are already bailing on mass deportation pledge,"Donald Trump's 2024 campaign emphasized two key promises far and beyond any others: to lower grocery costs—and inflation overall—and to enforce mass deportations of scary brown and Black immigrants (even those who are in the country legally). Already, Trump hasshrugged his shouldersat the first promise, saying there's little he can actually do to lower prices. ""Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,"" he said. Now Trump's ""Border Czar"" Tom Homan is also walking back his mass deportation promise. CNNreportedearlier this week that Homan has been privately telling Republican lawmakers that deporting millions of immigrants might be a tad ... impossible. ""We are not having a discussion about 20 million [deportations],"" Rep. Darrell Issa, Republican of California, told CNN. ""We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation."" The expectation, of course, is that the federal government has nowhere near enough manpower or funding to expel that many immigrants. In fact, the American Immigration Councilhas estimatedthat it would cost nearly $1 trillion (with a ""t"") to deport that many undocumented immigrants over a decade. Suffice it to say, this government isn't scaring up an extra $88 billion this year to get the ball rolling. Democrats might not even need the filibuster to stop such a monstrosity in the Senate. As I'vewritten before, the reality is that mass deportations only work with the assistance of local and state law enforcement. The U.S. Border Patrol only has 20,000 agents, 17,000 of whom patrol the border (that isn't about to stop, is it?). And as the CNN article cites, Homan said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has only 6,000 officers—not nearly enough to deport millions of people. As Trump's former Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgansaid in an interview with Stateline, ""It's not going to be successful, as long as we have sanctuary cities and states that refuse to allow local and state police departments to work with ICE."" That's all well and good in places like Texas and Florida, where 6.4% and 5% of the population is undocumented, respectively. While local authorities might love to help the feds raid cities like Houston, Dallas, and Orlando, there are still millions of undocumented immigrants in sanctuary states like California, Illinois, and New York. So while Trump could achieve some small-scale deportations, he doesn't have the resources for high-profile raids. Even in rural America, where farmers depend on the labor of undocumented immigrants, local politicians and industry groups (all Republicans, mind you) aresounding the alarm, warning of economic devastation if the feds—with or without local help—move in. So what is Trump to make of this? Xenophobia has been a key pillar in Trump's reelection, and his party has gleefully followed along. But this is also the same party that pretends (sometimes) to care about budget deficits and the national debt, which would explode with an additional $1 trillion in expenses. While most Republicans don't care about such things when they are in power, the razor-thin GOP margin in the House means it wouldn't take many of them to derail these efforts. And those aren't the only costs to deportation. ""It will cost a lot to deport. But guess what? It will also save a lot. And it'll be a net benefit,"" hard-right xenophobic Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona told CNN. There is a false yet religiously held belief in right-wing circles that undocumented immigrants are costing good, hardworking Americans billions in tax dollars. The reality is the exact opposite: Those immigrants pay payroll and income taxes on their earnings, yet they're ineligible for most public programs. ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2 to 6.8 percent,"" according to the American Immigration Council. ""It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare."" That's a one-way flow of money, with none of it coming back to undocumented workers. So what exactly are these ""savings"" that Biggs is talking about? I looked hard, and the best I could find isstuff like thisfrom Fox News: ""President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan will be a 'cost savings' for the American people, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, responding to a warning from the Wall Street Journal that carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in history could bear a hefty price tag. [The Biden administration] is paying for free airline tickets around the country, free hotel rooms at $500 bucks a night, free education, free medical care, and that's in perpetuity."" Note that they can't find math to support their theory that undocumented immigrants are costing taxpayers money, just that theenforcementof immigration laws is costing money. Well, that won't change no matter how many people are deported—people who, by the way,aren'tbeing given ""free airline tickets around the country"" or staying in any ""free hotel rooms."" So what now? Republicans hope that tough anti-immigration rhetoric leads to ""self-deportation,"" but the existence of sanctuary states complicates things. If anything, internal migration from hostile states like Texas and Florida to sanctuary states like California and Illinois is far more likely. Meanwhile, the demand for labor will be off the charts as thecharred toxic remainsof more than 10,000 homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and other structures in Los Angeles are cleaned up and rebuilt. The potential flow of immigrants from red states to blue ones won't just help the economies of those welcoming them with open arms, but it would also decimate local economies in hostile red states, driving up the costs of food, hospitality, and construction—among other things. Expelling or driving out millions of their residents could also alter thedemographicsthat have allowed Florida and Texas to gain up to eight congressional seats at the expense of mostly blue states. That might not be such a bad outcome after all.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 16:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297143/-Trump-and-his-goons-are-already-bailing-on-mass-deportation-pledge
Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of ""law and order,"" one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump's pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost ""patriots"" and ""hostages"" in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. ""If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned,"" he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump's actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio's caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump's action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading ""Camp Auschwitz,"" referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump's action. ""One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,"" Gonelltold HuffPost. ""It's a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It's a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again."" Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, ""This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump's pardons,writing, ""President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists."" One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that ""these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose."" The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.'s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""I don't think it's causing much controversy."" She later added, ""President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system."" Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 15:01:24,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298174/-Law-and-order-Trump-slammed-for-freeing-terrorists-and-Nazi-sympathizers
Trump's tiny inauguration is making MAGA morons lose their minds,"Donald TrumpannouncedFriday that his inaugurationwill be held indoorsdue to harsh weather concerns. Now, instead of hundreds of thousands of Trump voters gathering at the U.S. Capitol to watch their president begin his second term, they'll instead be ushered to the Capital One Arena about a mile away where they can watch from ... a jumbotron. ""We made all of the plans and all of the arrangements to come up and be a part of this event, and ... it's kind of a bummer,"" Jose Granado toldNBC News. We might as well stay at home and watch it on TV. I'm kind of disappointed, to be honest with you,"" Ken Robinson, who traveled from Oklahoma with his family, said. ""We came here to watch it in person. We don't really care to watch it on a jumbotron."" Traveling to watch the swearing in isn't cheap. Hotel rates around Washington, D.C., are around $500 per night the weekend leading up to Trump's inauguration. However, the Trump administration is handing out its condolences to supporters by allowing them to hold onto their now ""commemorative"" tickets. But it isn't just average MAGA supporters getting the short end of the stick. Some of Trump's wealthy donors have reportedly been cut from the in-person ceremony, given the limited number of seats in the rotunda. Instead, as The New York Times reporter Teddy Schleiferwrote, some of Trump's donors will be escorted to a suite at the Capitol One Arena. Of course, Trump's tech sugar daddies and burgeoningoligarchyhaveVIP seatingfor the inauguration, and all it took wasseveral millionsdonated to the convicted felon's inaugural fund. Looks like Trump's inauguration is only available for in-person viewing if you're a part of the White House or wealthy enough tobuy your way in. But it isn't just his everyday supporters who are taken aback by the news. Even MAGA talking heads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia questioned the decision. ""I have personally attended countless rallies where President Trump spoke in extreme weather conditions from cold to rain to heat,"" shewrote on X. ""Is there a security threat other than extreme cold temperatures? Not only for him but for the people?"" Even MAGA conspiracy loon Glenn Beck had his theories about why Trump made the call to move everything indoors. ""These guys are under such threat. This is 'Jason Bourne' stuff,"" hesaid. Beck went on to imply that, due to Trump's shakedown of the ""power structure"" of government, conditions during the inauguration might not be safe for him. It's unclear if he is implying that members of the U.S. government would target Trump. Trump's last-minute decision means thatmonths of security planninghave been scrapped. Instead, the Secret Service and other security officials have three days to prepare for the new plan. The last president to be sworn in indoors was Ronald Reagan, when temperatures dipped down to 7 degrees in 1985. But you'd think MAGA supporters would be prepared for D.C.'s January weather, given that many of themmade the tripfour years ago.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 01:01:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297520/-Trump-s-tiny-inauguration-is-making-MAGA-morons-lose-their-minds
Democrats demand tech bros explain cash being tossed at Trump,"Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado sentlettersto tech company CEOs at OpenAI, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Uber about their or their companies' million-dollar donations to Donald Trump's inaugural fund. In each letter, the senators remind the tech giants that their generous donations come at a suspicious time as their industry has ""come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition."" ""We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,"" the letter reads. Some of those big-money donations come from people like Amazon's Jeff Bezos, whose companyreportedly donated at least $1 millionto Trump's inauguration. But as Warren and Bennet explained in theletterto the Amazon CEO, his company ""is the subject of multiple ongoing regulatory actions, including multiple Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suits related to anticonsumer and anticompetitive practices, a Department of Justice (DOJ)."" Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi donated acombined $2 millionto Trump's inaugural fund. ""The company is the subject of an ongoing FTC investigation for predatory practices,"" Warren and Bennet wrote in their letter to him, referring to the recentinvestigationinto the ride-hailing company's subscription and cancelation policies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmandonated$1 million to Trump. And the senators' letter to him details how his company is under both an FTC investigation concerning itsconsumer practicesas well asone from the Securities and Exchange Commissionconcerning its investors. Googledonated $1 millionto Trump's fund, and CEO Sundar Pichai was reminded by Warren and Bennet that the search giant ""was found by a federal court to have an illegal monopoly over the online search market."" Google haspromised to appeal the ruling, and it will be up to Trump's Department of Justice to decide whether to contest its appeal. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gotits $1 million in early—after limiting political news on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2024 election. All this clearly seems done in order to ingratiate Zuckerberg and his company to Trump. Meta is facing aFTC antitrust lawsuit in April. According toDemocracy Now, Trump's inauguration committee has raised upward of $250 million. To put into perspective, before Trump's inaugural committee raised more than $100 million during his first go-round, the largest amount of money ever spent on an inauguration was President Barack Obama, who reportedly raised $50 million. Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the consumer-rights group Public Citizen, reports that much of that money has been donated by billionaires, such as the tech CEOs whom Warren and Bennet sent the letters to. Many of the CEOs who received letters from the senators areexpected to attend Trump's inaugurationon Monday, and have beengiven VIP status for the day. And it cost them only a drop in their buckets.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 00:00:16,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297500/-Democrats-demand-tech-bros-explain-cash-being-tossed-at-Trump
Trump’s family wastes no time profiting off of Daddy's second term,"Albania has given preliminary approval to Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a$1.4 billionluxury hotel complexon an abandoned military base. The deal raises eyebrows, given Trump will oversee foreign policy for Albania and has atrack recordofseeking revengewhen people or businesses don't do what he wants. The hotel will be built on a 111-acre section of the 2.2-square-mile island of Sazan, which can be reached by ferry from Albania's mainland. Ivanka Trump—who hassworn off politics—is apparently also working on the project. ""The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest in investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,"" a spokesman for Albania Prime Minister Edi Rama told The New York Times last year. Kushner's private equity company, Affinity Partners, was also given preliminary approval for a luxury hotel complex in Serbia, another country with vested interest in U.S. relations. While the Albanian government insists that its only motive behind approving the hotel is tourism, Albania and Serbia both havepending foreign policy matterswith the United States as theyattempt to jointhe European Union. The United States also has a vested interest inbolstering its relationshipwith Serbia to sway the country from supporting Russia. Kushner started Affinity Partners after he left hiscontroversial White House roleduring Trump's first term, during which he established relationships with the Middle East and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who provided Kushner's firm $2 billion from a sovereign wealth fund. Kushner's hotel venture is just one example of questionable business deals circling Trump's family leading up to his inauguration. Trump's real estate company met last week to discussreclaimingits former Washington, D.C., hotel, which has been owned by Hilton since the Trump family sold the lease rights in 2022 for $375 million. During Trump's first term, Democrats claimed that his financial stake violated a constitutional provision known as theForeign Emoluments Clause. Should the family buy back the hotel, this would revive concerns. The perks rolling in for Trump's family are hardly shocking considering his first term. For example, in 2018, Chinagranted 18 trademarksto companies tied to Ivanka and her father over a two-month span. Sixteen of those went to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, raising her total of trademarks in China at the time to 34 for products such as handbags and sunglasses. Trump's other children have alsobenefited immenselyfrom business,real-estatedeals, and other ventures since 2016.

Trump-loving tech bro reportedly set to run for Ohio governor,"Failed Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to run for governor of Ohio. The news comes shortly after he attacked American culture for purportedly celebrating ""mediocrity."" The Washington Post reportsthat multiple sources close to Ramaswamy say an announcement is soon to come and that the statement ""is drafted."" Ramaswamy was a candidate for the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2024 but attracted very little support. Hereceived only 0.4% of the votein the primaries and was awarded just three delegates (of the1,215 needed to win the nomination). By contrast, Donald Trump received 76% of the vote and over 2,000 delegates on his way to securing the nomination. Despite a reported behind-the-scenes push from Trump, Ramaswamywas passed overby Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who announced that Lt. Gov Jon Husted would be appointed to the Senate vacancy created bynow-formerSen. JD Vance, who was elected vice president. Currently, Ramaswamyis set to co-chairthe proposed Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk, an essentially powerless advisory commission created by Donald Trump. The two billionaires will purportedly use the group tocut government spendingonsocial programswhile also advocating for tax cuts for the wealthy. After being tapped to co-lead DOGE, Ramaswamy made his most recent controversial remarks. In December, Muskdefendedthe use of H-1B visas to bring in skilled immigrant labor, a practice that many anti-immigrant Republicans oppose, when Ramaswamy weighed in. ""Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,""he wrote. ""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers."" Ramaswamy went on to cite the media portrayal of several nerdy characters on 1990s sitcoms as evidence of his claim. The comments provoked the ire of many, including fellow failed Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley,who wrotein response, ""There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture."" When he isn't calling American culture mediocre, Ramaswamy has been afrequent promoterof debunked conspiracy theories. He claimed that the federal government was involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and called it an ""inside job."" Ramaswamy also alleged that the 2020 election wasstolen by ""big tech,""and theorized that the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged to help President Joe Biden win that year's presidential election. On policy matters, Ramaswamy previouslyexpressed supportfor former President George W. Bush'sfailed planto privatize Social Security. Even if Ramaswamy officially announces his gubernatorial run and receives the backing of MAGA-aligned voters, it is not a sure thing that he will secure the nomination, let alone win. In 2022, Trump-backing candidate Jim Renacciran againstDeWine but failed to unseat the incumbent governor, who was then reelected. Additionally, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost,an election denier, is alsorunning. Ohio has been a reliable state for Republicans, but it is unclear if they will back a gubernatorial candidate with such a negative take on the American work ethic.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 22:00:20,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297474/-Trump-loving-tech-bro-reportedly-set-to-run-for-Ohio-governor
Dog killer Noem pushes immigration and wildfire lies at Senate hearing,"Dog-killingSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem fearmongered about the threat immigrants pose to the United States and lied about the California wildfires during the confirmation hearing for hernominationto lead the Department of Homeland Security Friday. As head of DHS, Noem would be in charge of Customs and Border Patrol and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps respond to natural and manmade disasters. Her answers about how she would handle both of those areas should scare everyone. During the hearing, Noem lied that the U.S. border is ""open,"" andclaimedthat ""the No. 1 threat to our homeland security is the southern border."" Of course, the border is obviously not open. In fact, border crossings havedramatically declinedin recent months, achieving similar levels as those during Donald Trump's first term. What's more, the head of the FBI has actuallysaidthat homegrown extremists are the biggest terror threat, and thatChina's cyber programand its impact on U.S. infrastructure is a bigger danger to the United States than immigrants crossing the border. Aside from fearmongering about immigrants, Noem alsorefused to saywhether she'd withhold disaster relief if Trump asked her to—a relevant question as Trump and Republicans have said California should not receive financial assistance to help recover from the devastating fires. ""If President Trump were to say to you, 'We're going to withhold money from Connecticut or Michigan or any of the states, Iowa, because we don't like the governor or we don't like the politics of the state,' you would stand up to him and say, 'Mr. President, we need to allocate that money'?"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked Noem. She refused to respond, saying that she couldn't answer a hypothetical question. But it's not hypothetical, since Trumptried to do just thatduring his first term, when California was reeling from another wave of devastating wildfires. As Politicoreportedin October: ""I assume you agree, withholding disaster relief is a violation of duty and law,"" Blumenthal pressed Noam. ""Leadership has consequences,"" she said in a chilling response. Noem went on to lie about the response to California's wildfires, claiming that somehow Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is responsible for the devastating impacts of this natural disaster—echoing the baseless claims ofTrumpand other Republicans. ""I wish we would have had different leadership or a different governor in California,"" Noemsaid. However,firefighters saythat humanscould nothave stopped the fires that ravaged the state. ""Wildfires like this, driven by 70 to 100 mph winds, couldn't be 'put out' if every firefighter in the West were in Los Angeles,"" retired firefighter Riva Duncanwrotein an op-ed for MSNBC.

"Biden shows support for ERA, but does that actually mean anything?","President Joe BidenannouncedFriday that Americans should consider theEqual Rights Amendmentto be ""the law of the land."" However, the last-minute effort to enshrine the 28th Amendment into the Constitution is unlikely to actually go anywhere due to its legal hurdles. ""It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people,"" the White House statement said. ""In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex."" The amendment would need to be formally signed and certified by National Archivist Colleen Shogan in order to become law. According toNPR, supporters of the ERA are expected to protest in front of the National Archives office, urging Shogan's signature. She has previously stated that she will follow the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, which suggests that the courts or Congress must decide the amendment's fate. To lift the1982 deadlinefor ratification, Shogan said that further action is needed—with Republicans now controlling all three branches of government, prospects for that seem bleak. Supporters of the ERA, however, believe that the amendment should have become law of the land after Virginia ratified it, making it three-fourths of states to pass it. Because of the obscurity of how to proceed, the amendment is expected to either face a long legal battle or to simply die at the hands of a GOP-led Congress. A senior Biden administration official told CNN that the president is not taking executive action but is ""stating an opinion that it is ratified,"" which was one crucial hurdle Shogan said needed to be cleared before signing it. ""He is using his power of the presidency to make it clear that he believes—and he agrees with leading constitutional scholars and the American Bar Association—not that it should be, but it is the 28th Amendment of the Constitution,"" the official said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a leader in the ERA movement,posted on XFriday in support of ratification. ""President Biden's official notice to the nation today follows clearly established precedent dating back to President Adams in 1798. The ERA is a valid part of our Constitution,"" she said. If the ERA is signed by Shogan, it would enshrine protections for women and trans people who will be vulnerable during Donald Trump's second term. But for now, the odds of it moving forward seem slim.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 19:30:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297447/-Biden-shows-support-for-ERA-but-does-that-actually-mean-anything
Trump inauguration will be too frigid even for that coldhearted man,"Afraid of a little cold weather, Donald Trump will break with years of tradition tomove his inauguration ceremony indoors. He will deliver his address inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda before joining supporters at the nearby Capital One Arena. ""There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don't want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!),"" Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social. Apparently, now he cares about the safety of law enforcement at the Capitol, unlikefour years ago, when he allowed those law enforcement officers to be brutally beaten by his supporters who were, at his behest, trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory. Trump's swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for12 PM ET on Monday, when the temperature in Washington, D.C., is expected to be22 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with the wind chill around 8 degrees. That puts it close to the28 degree temperature and mid-teens wind chill during Barack Obama's first inauguration, in 2009, according to historical data from the National Weather Service. And Obama didn't chicken out and move the ceremony inside. Trump continued, ""This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!"" What's more, in 1961 when John F. Kennedy was sworn in, it snowed 8 inches and was also 22 degrees at 12 PM ET. Yet JFK still held his inauguration outside, withnearly 1 million peoplebraving those sub-freezing temperatures to watch his swearing-in. In fact, the last time an inauguration was held indoors was 1985, when the National Weather Service says temperatures in the District of Columbia were 7 degrees, with the wind child going as low as 20 below zero—far colder than what's expected on Trump's Inauguration Day. Holding the event indoors will make it so that Trump won't get to look out at a crowd of supporters as he delivers his inaugural address, which will probably be insanely dark and xenophobic. But maybe Trump prefers an indoor ceremony. After all, he can use it and the temperature as an excuse for why a paltry number of supporters show up. Trump is infamously obsessed with crowd sizes. He often lies about the number of people who attend his campaign rallies to say that more people showed up than actually did.

CNN reportedly hiding anchor who dares to call out Trump’s BS,"CNN reportedly plans to move anchor Jim Acosta, who has frequently fact checked and challenged Donald Trump's falsehoods, to a time slot with almost no viewers. As Status Newsreported, CNN's CEO Mark Thompson proposed that ""CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta"" be moved from the 10 AM ET time slot to midnight. ""They want to get rid of Acosta to throw a bone to Trump,"" a media executive told Status. ""Midnight is not a serious offer when his ratings are among the best on the network."" If CNN goes through with this plan, it will effectively sideline someone who has provided accurate reporting on the leader of the Republican Party. Just a few days after his 2017 inauguration, Trump lied about losing the popular vote in the 2016 election to Hillary Clinton due to votes from undocumented immigrants.Acostanotedat the time that the allegation was ""a falsehood, full stop."" Leading up to the 2024 election, when Republicans—led by Trump—continued to push lies about ""voter fraud"" in the 2020 election,Acostatoldthe chair of the Georgia Republican Party ""you're just lying"" when he repeated Trump's claims about the race. More recently,Trump claimedthat the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans was connected to immigration, citing afalse reportfrom Fox News. In an on-air discussion with a Republican strategist who pushed Trump's false claim,Acostanotedthat the attack was ""not connected"" to immigration. Trump has a long history of expressing contempt for Acosta, who was CNN's White House correspondent for much of Trump's first term, tasked with debunking Trump and his team. In a 2018 exchange, Acosta asked Trump about his claim that a migrant caravan from Mexico was an ""invasion,"" noting that the characterization was false. Trump responded by calling Acosta a ""rude, terrible person."" Trump supportershave echoedthis hostility. During a 2018 Trump rally, a crowd surrounded the reporter and yelled at him. Trump later shared video of the incident on his social media account. At the peak of the conflict between Acosta and Trump in 2018, the first Trump administrationpulledthe reporter's media credentials andmade up a false storyalleging that he put his hands on an intern. A federal judge later ordered for Acosta's pass to be restored. Back then, CNN had Acosta's back. But now, the network appears to be joining a chorus of corporate media—including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times—who arebending to Trump's will. Trump has expressed continual contempt for factual reporting, and hiding those who tell the truth about him is unlikely to stop during his second term.

Chaos among GOP lawmakers threatens Trump's agenda—already,"Yes, Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated for a second time, but we can take solace in the fact that his agenda is already on the rocks. Republican leaders in the House and Senatestillcan't agree on how to move forward with legislation to make good on Trump's promises. More than two months after Republicans won both chambers of Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are continuing to fight over whether to put Trump's destructive tax cuts for the rich and mass deportation agendain the same bill, or to split it into two. ""Right now, that teamwork isn't happening. Not by a long shot,"" Politicosaidof Johnson and Thune's relationship. If Republicans can't even agree on how to move forward, forget about how difficult it will be to select the budget cuts Republicans will need to make to pass the legislation. That's because Republicans want to accomplish Trump's agenda using budget reconciliation, which will allow them to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass the bill(s) with a simple majority—i.e., just Republican votes. Butbudget reconciliation has strict limitsaround how much legislation can affect the national debt. And it will require Republicans to make cuts from other programs to fund the tax cuts and deportations. And getting Republicans to agree on what to cut from the budget will be harder than herding feral cats. Theywon't be able to lose a single votein the House, given Republicans' extremely narrow majority. Among the cuts Republicans arefloatinginclude slashing subsidies middle-class Americans to purchase Affordable Care Act plans, cutting food assistance for the poorest Americans, and making cuts to Medicaid. Good luck getting every single House Republican—including vulnerable members in swing seats—to vote for cuts like that. Even worse for Johnson is his political capital is already waning in his caucus, which will make it harder for him to twist arms and get his lawmakers to vote for whatever awful legislation ultimately emerges. That's because Johnson pissed off many Republican lawmakers when he cowed to Trump andremovedpro-Ukraine Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. One unnamed House Republican told Fox News' Chad Pergram that Turner may not vote for things Johnson wants to pass as a result of his ouster. ""Mike's never going to vote for another fucking thing around here again,"" the unnamed House Republicansaid. ""He's mad."" What's more, as GOP leadership quarrels about whether to put Trump's agenda into one bill or two, Republicans are fighting over how to make the destructive legislation revenue neutral. Senate Republicans are rejecting a revenue generating proposal from House conservatives to raise the corporate tax rate, The Hillreported. ""Absolutely not,"" Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told The Hill, regarding that idea. Meanwhile, Democrats are watching with amusement as Republicans flail. ""With their narrow Republican margin, they can't pass anything close to what is being discussed by the speaker or by House Republicans,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffriessaidin a Jan. 14 interview on MSNBC.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 16:30:09,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297414/-Chaos-among-GOP-lawmakers-threatens-Trump-s-agenda-already
TikTok announces pro-Trump bash just as Supreme Court upholds ban,"TikTok has joinedthe paradeof tech companies lavishing money on the incoming Trump administration—though only TikTok faces exile from the American market on Sunday. The video social media platformwill sponsora pre-inauguration party for Donald Trump on Sunday that the company's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will reportedly attend. Pro-Trump influencers who used TikTok to promote him during the recent presidential campaign will be honored. The event is scheduled on the same day a recently passed law requires TikTok to be spun off from its Chinese owners or shut down U.S. operations—a lawupheld by the Supreme Courtin a rareunanimous opinionreleasedFriday. An official with the outgoing Biden administrationtold the Associated Pressthat the law will not be enforced in the time between taking effect Sunday and Trump's inauguration on Monday. This effectively leaves the fate of TikTok in Trump's hands, and his advisors have indicated that they also will not enforce the legislation. Legislation targeting the operations of a single company is extremely unusual behavior for the government. Yet the bill calling for the company's sale had bipartisan support in Congress, and President Joe Bidensigned it into lawon April 23. The law did not successfully pressure the Chinese government to sever connections to TikTok or parent company ByteDance, andover 170 million Americanscontinue to usethe service millions of times per day. Now, both Democrats and Republicanshave apparently changedtheir positions and are wrangling behind the scenes to give the company behind the wildly popular app a reprieve. While his new stancealigns with public opinion, Trump's about-face on TikTok is particularly notable since he was the first at the executive level to pursue government action against the company. In 2020,he issuedan executive order that required ByteDance to spin off the video service. In the order, Trump alleged there was ""credible evidence"" that TikTok ""might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."" It's likely not a coincidence that the order came at the height of Trump's reelection campaign and thatvideos mocking himwere popular on TikTok. Trumphas often pushedfor media critical of him to be silenced or shut down. Yet when his campaign finally opened an account on the platform and quickly amassed millions of followers, Trump's ""full flop"" on the platform—wherehe proudly braggedthat he was ""a big star""—took root. Following Trump's successful 2024 campaign, Facebook's parent companyMeta said they wouldget rid of fact checkers and follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk's X in allowing disinformation and bigoted content to circulate unchecked. With their sponsorship of the pro-Trump party, TikTok may be signaling they are also moving towards looking the other way in the face of more disinformation. ""Big Tech"" joining the Trump coalition—and being welcomed by Republicans—is a reversal from years and years ofthe right claiming(without evidence) that their voices were being silenced in new media. Nowadays, they are happy to take Big Tech's money and bend the laws in their favor—or in TikTok's case, pretend they don't exist.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 15:30:03,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297412/-TikTok-announces-pro-Trump-bash-just-as-Supreme-Court-upholds-ban
Democrats prepare to fight Trump’s Day 1 executive orders in the courts,"While Joe Biden's presidency comes to an end on Monday, Democrats aren't stepping down from the fight just yet, as they prepare to battle Donald Trump through the court system. The Democracy Forward Foundation, a prominent progressive legal group,announcedThursday that it will push back against Trump's dangerous agenda by targeting his executive orders, of which he haspromisedmore than 100 on ""day one."" Among Trump's potential executive orders is a ""shock and awe"" strategy ofmass deportations. ""We're confident this center will be a critical resource for opposing dangerous policies in Project 2025 and other harmful and unlawful conduct,"" Democracy Forward President and CEO SkyePerrymansaid in a statement. Launched in 2017, Democracy Forward is ramping up its four-year plan beginning on Inauguration Day. According to the report, it has already identified 200 potential executive orders that it will fight in the legal system as soon as Trump signs them into law. ""During his first term, Trump's executive orders made health care less accessible, banned travel based on the predominant religion in certain countries, and made it easier for corporations to pollute our communities,"" Perryman said. ""This time, the Trump-Vance administration is better organized, has four years of previous experience, and can rely on the policy and staffing infrastructure of Project 2025."" Biden administration officials will be joining Democracy Forward as senior counselors, including Karianne Jones, former litigation counsel for the Kamala Harris campaign; Mike Martinez, deputy general counsel at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; Dan McGrath, senior counsel at the Department of Labor; and Kevin Friedl, outgoing senior counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additionally, Department of Justice Executive Secretary Emily Ross will join Democratic Forward as deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Perryman. This is in line with what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumertold POLITICOin December about how Democrats plan to use the courts to combat Trump during his second term. ""I don't know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judiciary will be one of our strongest—if not our strongest—barrier[s] against what he does,"" he said. Democracy Forward will not only challenge the policies that Trump implements, but it will also aim to setlegal precedentsthat will limit the president's unchecked power in the long term.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 14:30:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297266/-Democrats-prepare-to-fight-Trump-s-Day-1-executive-orders-in-the-courts
Infamous Jew-hating racist Mel Gibson gets 'special' job from Trump,"Donald Trump is appointing three washed-up actors to serve as ""special ambassadors"" to Hollywood, including the notoriously racist and antisemitic Mel Gibson. ""It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,"" Trumpwrotein a Thursday post on Truth Social. ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!"" Choosing Gibson to serve as whateverthisis ... is certainly a choice. In 2004, Gibson's movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" waspanned as antisemiticfor depicting Jews as responsible for Jesus' crucifixion. Then in 2006, Gibsonwent on an antisemitic tiradeduring a drunk driving arrest in Los Angeles. According to a police report, ""Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about 'fucking Jews'. Gibson yelled out: 'The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Gibson then asked: 'Are you a Jew?'"" Gibson laterapologized, saying, ""I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith."" But as the saying goes:in vino veritas. Then in 2010,audio tapes were releasedin which Gibson was heard verbally abusingOksana Grigorieva,his then-girlfriend and the mother of one of his children. ""You look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of [N-words], it will be your fault,"" he screamed at her. Gibson also threatened her, saying on tape, ""I am going to come and burn the fucking house down ... but you will blow me first."" That Trump would choose someone so vile to serve his administration in any capacity at all is despicable. But it's also random. Maybe Trump thought of the ""Mad Max"" for this ridiculous made-up role because he saw Gibson's Jan. 10 appearance on Fox News, where he spread paranoid theories about the raging wildfires in Southern California. ""I can make all kinds of horrible theories up in my head, conspiracy theories and everything else,"" Gibson told fellow bigot Laura Ingraham. ""But it just seemed a little convenient that there was no water, and that the wind conditions were right and that there were people ready and willing and able to start fires, and are they commissioned to do so or are they just acting on their own volition?"" Gibson also appeared on podcast bro Joe Rogan's show, where heclaimedto know people with Stage 4 cancer who were cured after taking ivermectin, the horse deworming pill COVID deniers are bizarrely obsessed with.Ivermectin does not cure cancer. In a karmic twist, Gibson later revealed thathis Malibu home was burning downwhile he was yakking it up with Rogan in Texas. As for the other two men Trump appointed as ""special"" ambassadors, Voight is a vocal right-winger who haslong backed Trumpand bizarrelycalled for President Joe Biden's impeachment. And Stallone has also emerged as a MAGA minion, ridiculouslycomparingTrump to George Washington Appointing these three clowns to somehow tell Trump how to fix Hollywood feels more like the latest attack on California from thenotoriously fame-hungryincoming president. Trump has spent the past weekspreading disinformationabout the deadly wildfires that have ravaged homes and communities in the Los Angeles area.

Even Republicans aren’t happy about House speaker’s latest cave to Trump,"House Republicansare disapprovingof House Speaker Mike Johnson'sdecisiontoremoveRep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, from his position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Many believe this move was motivated by Donald Trump's eagerness to install a MAGA loyalist in the position, since the president-elect has long sought to fill congressional seats with those willing to kiss the ring. Though Johnson denied external pressure, Turner believes otherwise. In a phone interview with CBS reporter and ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan, Turner said that Johnson told him, ""You're fired. There are concerns from Mar-a-Lago."" Johnsondeniedthis claim. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnson said on Wednesday. Now, Republicans are voicing their concerns about Johnson bending the knee to Trump. ""We all have questions and concerns ... This came out of nowhere,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, said. Crenshaw's comments reflect the uncertainty and frustration that Republicans feel about the pressure to either fall in line with Trump or risk being demoted. ""I'm not happy with the decision. I think the vast majority of us are not happy with the decision,"" an anonymous House Republican told Axios. Other Republicans, like Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, are concerned that Johnson's decision will be harmful to the party's unity. ""It divides the conference, and I don't think that's good,"" he said, adding that ""most of us agree"" with Turner on issues like Ukraine. Turner has been astaunch supporterof Ukraine in its war against Russia, often pushing back against GOP colleagues who spread Russian propaganda. His strong advocacy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine has earned him praise from moderate Republicans, but it has also made him a target among what is now an empowered MAGA faction in Congress. While it's still unclear how his second administration will cozy up to Vladimir Putin, Trump has suggested that heplans to speakwith the Russian strongman shortly after his inauguration. During his first term, Trump had aclose relationshipwith Putin, and he even sent him COVID-19 tests in 2020 while U.S. citizens reeled from the virus. And since leaving office, Trump has had numerous private phone calls with him. Trump's long-standingbromancewith Putin—along with reportedlyidolizingdictators—has sparked accusations that Trump is sympathetic to autocrats and even perhaps has a desire to become one himself. But even as U.S. national security hangs in the balance, it seems Trump's adoration of authoritarian regimes is still not enough to break the GOP's obedience to Dear Leader.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 00:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297298/-Even-Republicans-aren-t-happy-about-House-speaker-s-latest-cave-to-Trump
Trump treasury nominee slammed for opposing minimum wage increase,"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump's nominee to besecretary of treasury, is being criticized for opposing an increase of the federal minimum wage at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Bessent was being questioned by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who noted to Bessent that the federal minimum wage has not been increased fromits current rate of $7.25per hour since 2009. ""You don't think we should change the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour?"" Sanders asked. Bessent replied, ""No, sir."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus,quickly responded, writing, ""Wrong. Working people deserve a raise. Raise the minimum wage."" The last time that legislation was passed to raise the federal wage was the 2007 Fair Minimum Wage Act. Thatlaw incrementally increasedthe wage from $5.15 in 2007 to $7.25 in 2009, as Sanders stated. Since then, no laws have increased the federal minimum wage. In the meantime, due to inflation, the real value of the minimum wagehas gone down. According to a2019 studyby the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually increase wages for more than 33.5 million people across the country, including over 6 million people living in poverty. According to hisfinancial disclosures, Bessent, a hedge fund managerwho donatedto Trump's campaign, is a billionaire. That is the normamong the figureswhom Trump has nominated to serve in his Cabinet and who are among his closest advisors. The average publicly known net worth of Trump's team is $67.7 billion as of early December, compared to theroughly $1.06 million net worthof the average American family. Despite their extraordinary wealth, key Trump allies, like billionaire Elon Musk (the richest person in the world, worthover $427 billion),havepushed for cutsto the social safety net that millions rely on. These same people, and especially Trump, favor keeping in place tax cuts that disproportionately help billionaires and large corporations.

Another MAGA loyalist eyes Florida governor’s race,"Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida has shared with potential donors and political big-wigs in the state that he intends to run for governor, making him the second MAGA loyalist to consider throwing his hat in the ring. ""He was in town [Tallahassee] meeting with all the folks you need to meet with. He told them he is in,"" a source who met with Donalds toldNBC News. ""It's the steps any candidate takes as they prepare to run for governor."" Donalds reportedly made similar remarks at a GOP meeting in Orlando this past weekend, according to the outlet. NBC News said it spoke with five sources familiar with Donalds' thinking and upcoming plans. While there have long been rumors that the Florida representative is angling to replace Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, this is the biggest sign yet that the Trump loyalist will likely leave his plum congressional seat in an attempt to be the Sunshine State's next top executive. When asked for comment, Donalds didn't deny the rumors but told NBC News he's focused on ""helping President Trump pass his America First Agenda."" A spokesperson for Donalds did not immediately respond to Daily Kos' request for comment. Should Donalds run, he might face some intriguing competition. Disgraced former Rep. Matt Gaetzis also toyingwith whether to run for the gubernatorial seat. In a statement to NBC News, Gaetz reiterated that he and his wife are still considering his next steps. Notably, this is not the first sign of Donalds' increased interest in running for Florida's governorship. Earlier this month, hehiredone alum of President-elect Donald Trump's 2016 campaign: Fabrizio, Lee & Associates. This company is led by Tony Fabrizio, who was Trump's lead pollster during his first campaign for the White House and has conducted polling for MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. NBC News also reports that Donalds is working with Brad Herold, who served as an advisor to DeSantis during his 2018 run, among others who have long worked to help boost MAGA-type Republicans. Trump will almost certainly try to sway the fast-approaching GOP primary for Florida's governor race. Last year, at a high-dollar fundraiser in New York,Trump asked Donaldspoint-blank whether he was planning to succeed DeSantis, whom Trump has had a ratherstormy professional relationshipwith. And let's not forget, Trump's influence can mean a lot in this race. After all, Trump'sendorsement of DeSantisin 2018 helped propel his candidacy. DeSantiswon that year's Republican primarywith 57% of the vote; his closest competitor, Adam Putnam, the state's former agriculture commissioner, received 37%. There's no sign, either, that Trump's grip on the party is slipping. Any Republican hoping to succeed in Florida politics likely needs to kiss the ring and earn Trump's approval; at the very least, they need to avoid getting on his bad side. Donalds, who is 46, rose to prominence during the tea party movement. Hewas elected toFlorida's House of Representatives in 2016. Then, in 2020, he won a seat in the U.S. House, representing Florida's 19th Congressional District. In his relatively short time in Congress, Donalds has become a close ally of Trump's. He was among the group of Republicans whovoted to overturnthe 2020 election results after Trump lost to Joe Biden, andwas endorsed for the House speakershipby far-right lawmakers who refused to back then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid in early 2023. Last year,it was rumoredthat Trump might tap Donalds as a running mate. That's not to say Donalds is a shoo-in to be Florida's next governor, should he decide to run. Beyond Gaetz, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson could jump in the race. At one point, it looked like the race to replace DeSantis might attract more candidates, but the field has narrowed. State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis isrunning to replaceGaetz in Congress (with Trump's blessing, of course), and state Attorney General Ashley Moody has just beenappointedto fill the Senate seat that Marco Rubio will vacate if he is confirmed as Trump's secretary of state, as is expected. There's no timeline set for Donalds' next steps. While he could, of course, leave Washington, D.C., early to start his bid, concerns about Republicans' slim margins in the House make that tricky to navigate. As NBC News pointed out, Donalds may make his next move more clear following the conclusion of Florida's two scheduled special elections, one of which reveals who Gaetz's replacement will be. Both electionswill take placeon April 1.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 22:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297251/-Another-MAGA-loyalist-eyes-Florida-governor-s-race
Democrats have one weird trick to release the rest of Jack Smith's report,"In alettersent Thursday morning, House Judiciary Committee Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop federal charges against Donald Trump's co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. In so doing, Garland would remove the only barrier preventing the release of the second volume of Jack Smith'sreporton alleged crimes committed by Trump. ""The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith's report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records,"" the letter reads. ""It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public,"" it goes on to say. ""As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump's co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira."" Last week, the DOJ released the first half of the report, which focused on Trump's ""unprecedented criminal effort"" to steal the 2020 election. Garland noted that he would not release the second volume of Smith's investigation since Trump's co-defendants' cases are still active. ""To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors,"" House Democrats argue in the letter. ""[T]hose concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report."" One alternative, with somesupport in Congress, would be for President Joe Biden to take advantage of the Supreme Court's ruling on ""absolute immunity"" for ""official acts"" by releasing the report in the name of national security. Judge Aileen Cannonagreed to allowthe DOJ to release the first volume of Smith's investigation, and she has nowscheduled a court hearingFriday to consider Garland's plan to share the second volume with ""some lawmakers.""

Other Democratic lawmakers who will play hooky that day include Reps.Jasmine Crockettof Texas,Ilhan Omarof Minnesota, andAyanna Pressleyof Massachusetts. News of Pelosi's pending absence was first reported byABC News. Pelosi's spokesperson didn't elaborate on why she won't make the pilgrimage to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,this go-around. Her absence may be because Pelosi is stillrecovering from hip surgeryshe underwent in Germany following a fall in December. It's also possible that, like most Democrats,she just hates Trump. No one would blame her if that were the case. The two have long had a tumultuous professional relationship. Since Trump's first administration, their disdain for one another has seemingly only increased. Pelosi famously spent the final days of Trump's first term trying tooust him from the Oval Officeafter the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Trump, for his part, spent much of his first termavoiding Pelosi, even as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged states and lawmakers attempted to work together to deliver aid. Since then, Trump has called Pelosi ""crazy,"" ""crooked,"" ""evil,"" and ""sick,"" among other abhorrent things. In November, he nearly called her a bitch during a campaign rally, though he stopped himself from saying the word outright. ""She's a bad person, evil. She's an evil, sick, crazy—"" Trump said ata rally in Michiganamid his 2024 campaign, sounding out the letter ""B"" but stopping just short of uttering the obscenity. ""It starts with a 'B,' but I won't say it. I wanna say it."" Pelosi's inauguration absence marks a break in tradition for the octogenarian. In addition toattendingTrump's first inauguration, in 2017, ABC News reports that Pelosi has gone to 11 presidential inaugural events. Senior leaders of both parties typically attend presidential inaugurations, regardless of the incoming president's party. But Trump has no room to complain about Pelosi's absence: Hefamously skippedPresident Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021. In reality, Trump probably won't notice that Pelosi's gone. He'll be too busy trying to impress his trio of tech-bro sugar daddies—Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—who have beenrewarded with plum seatsat the inauguration. (All three men alsodonated at least $1 millionto Trump's inaugural fund.) Meanwhile, while they will attend Monday's inauguration, former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama willskip Trump's inaugural luncheon. According to NBC News, both Obama and Clinton were invited but declined. Bush's office told the outlet that he never received an invite.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 19:30:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297278/-Nancy-Pelosi-will-skip-Trump-s-inauguration
House Republicans take first step in mass deportation scheme,"Donald Trump's Deputy Policy Chief, Stephen Miller,met Wednesday with membersof the House Republican Study Committee to begin planning for the mass deportation of immigrants. ""He talked about how the cost of immigration is costing this country and he used the example of if an illegal has four children they have the same rights and privileges to the gimmes that Americans do, health care, education, all of that,"" Rep. Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina,told the Daily Beast. Miller reportedly told the attendees to determine the funding needed to carry out Trump's deportation plan, which they are expected to include in a reconciliation bill that requires a simple majority to pass through Congress. This would allow the party to secure funding for mass deportations without any Democratic support, as long as there aren't many defectors within theslim Republican majoritiesin Congress. While the GOP reconciliation bill will include tax cuts for the wealthy and draconian changes to immigration policy, thereconciliation processwas originally used under Democratic administrations for more progressive policy items. Under President Barack Obama, reconciliation was used to pass health care reform in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Under President Joe Biden, it was used to pass theAmerican Rescue Planand theInflation Reduction Act. But now, Republicans are using the reconciliation process to move forward with Trump's immigration policy, which is likely informed by Miller'sracist history. Miller served as an aide to former Sen. Jeff Sessions during whichhe promotedwhite supremacist literature, objected to efforts to remove symbols honoring the pro-slavery Confederacy, and promoted racist immigration stories. During Trump's first term, Miller wasa key architectof the policy that separated immigrant families to supposedly dissuade border crossings. The policy led to the separation of children from their parents, anda reunification processthat is still ongoing under the Biden administration. Family separation wascondemnedacross the world by figures like Pope Francis. There is widespread concern about the mental and emotional harm that mass deportation is likely to cause for thousands of families, but experts have also warned that there will be a financial cost. A ""highly conservative""estimatefrom the American Immigration Council found that Trump's mass deportations would cost at least $315 billion. The council also projected that the amount of funding used for a 10-year deportation program could build more than 40,450 new elementary schools, construct 2.9 million new homes, pay college tuition for 8.9 million people, and provide brand new cars to more than 20.4 million people. Trump, Miller, and their Republican allies in Congress nonetheless seem locked in on foisting this extreme policy on the American public. Only time will tell how much it will cost us.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 18:30:01,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297254/-House-Republicans-take-first-step-in-mass-deportation-scheme
Trump mimics mug shot in official presidential portrait,"Donald Trump did his best to look as evil as humanly possible in his official presidential portrait, which wasreleased Thursdayahead of his inauguration on Monday. In the terrifying headshot, Trump, wearing a rare blue tie, appears to be scowling at the camera and squinting one eye closed, as if he's plotting something nefarious. His evil look is enhanced by the choice to light him from below creating creepy dark shadows on Trump's face, while also blowing out his signature bright orange makeup to a muted apricot hue. The photo also bears an uncanny resemblance to hisGeorgia mugshot, which he took after he wasindictedin Fulton County for his efforts to overturn his loss in the Peach State. Trump's right-wing cult members were a littletooexcited over the portrait. ""Dad is home,"" Charlie Kirkwrotein a not-at-all creepy post on X, along with the photo. Russian propagandistBenny Johnson was also super pumped about Trump's portrait. ""Trump really went with the mugshot ascetic [sic] with the new Presidential Portrait,"" Johnsonwrotein a post on X, misspelling ""aesthetic."" He added, ""Trump chose violence 🔥"" Trump himself seems to be super proud of the creepy image, releasing the photo in a news release titled ""Official Portraits Released — And They Go Hard ????"" Yes, that was actually the title of the release, question marks and all. Meanwhile, Vice President-elect JD Vance's official portrait shows him with his arms cheerfully crossed over a blue tie that's nearly identical to his boss', smiling just hard enough that there's no trace of his signaturenatural ""eyeliner.""

Trump releases enemies list,"Donald Trump has released a list of people he wants blacklisted from positions in his upcoming administration. The release of the list comes just a few weeks after Trump said he would not seek retribution against his detractors. In November, after his election win, TrumptoldFox News, ""I am not looking for retribution, grandstanding or to destroy people who treated me very unfairly, or even badly beyond comprehension."" But on Wednesday night,Trump wroteon his Truth Social platform, ""In order to save time, money, and effort, it would be helpful if you would not send, or recommend to us, people who worked with, or are endorsed by, Americans for No Prosperity (headed by Charles Koch), 'Dumb as a Rock' John Bolton, 'Birdbrain' Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, disloyal Warmongers Dick Cheney, and his Psycho daughter, Liz, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, General(?) Mark Milley, James Mattis, Mark Yesper, or any of the other people suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, more commonly known as TDS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" While some of the people and groups on Trump's list are merely fellow travelers within the conservative movement who have disagreed with him (the right-wing Americans for Prosperity group) or who ran against him (failed presidential candidate Nikki Haley), many of them are figures who warned that Trump would engage infascistic behaviorduring a second term. Beforeretiring, Army Gen.

Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming served on the bipartisan committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol led by Trump supporters hoping to overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden.

House speaker demotes Ohio Republican who won’t ‘bend the knee’ to Trump,"Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio was unceremoniously ousted as chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, after Donald Trump ordered the pro-Ukraine lawmaker's removal, according to CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" hostMargaret Brennan. Turner has been avocal critic of Russiaand a supporter of Ukraine. He's evencriticized his own GOP colleaguesforspreading Russian propaganda. ""We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,"" Turner said in April. Being pro-Ukraine is untenable for Trump, who is buddies with violent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Putin worked to help get Trump elected in 2016 by running an unprecedented propaganda campaign. And now that Trump won again, Politicoreportedthat Putin hopes the U.S. will stop sending money and weapons to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. ""​​One person who'll clearly be pleased Mike Turner's been dumped as House Intelligence chair: Vladimir Putin,"" Republican Bill Kristol, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and his own party in recent years,wrotein a post on X. Trump hasrefused to saywhether he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia in the war Russia started. But he has made it clear that he wants Ukraine tomake concessions to Russia, which attacked the country unprovoked, in order to end the war. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who removed Turner as committee chair, claims Trump had nothing to do with the decision to remove Turner. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnsonsaid, adding, ""The intelligence community and everything related to [the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence], it needs a fresh start. And that's what this is about. Nothing else."" It's not yet clear who will be the new chair of the committee, which has oversight of the U.S. intelligence community and is privy to the nation's top secrets. In 2017, during Trump's first term, the committee was led byPutin stoogeDevin Nunes, who worked to thwart the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee,told reportershe's ""enormously concerned"" over Turner's removal since Turner wasn't one to ""bend the knee"" to Trump.

Trump's attorney general pick won't admit Biden won 2020 election,"Election denier Pam Bondi, Donald Trump'spickto lead the Department of Justice, refused multiple times at herWednesday confirmation hearingto say that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Sens.Dick Durbinof Illinois andMazie Hironoof Hawaii separately asked the former Florida attorney general if she believed Biden won the election—and Bondi refused to answer both times. When Durbin asked, Bondi dodged. ""President Biden is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power,"" Bondi said. Of course, the transition of power was anything but ""peaceful,"" as Trump incited a violent mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block certification of Biden's win. When Hirono asked Bondi, ""Who won the 2020 presidential election?"" Bondi gave the same canned answer. ""Joe Biden is the president of the United States,"" Bondi said robotically. The Hawaii lawmaker was unimpressed by that response. ""You cannot say who won the 2020 election,"" Hirono said. ""It's disturbing that you can't give voice to that fact."" Sen. Alex Padilla of California asked Bondi for evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which she has continued to lie about for years following Trump's loss to Biden. But Bondirefusedto give any concrete evidence. ""Do you have any evidence of election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election, yes or no? It's a yes or no question,"" Padilla said. In response, Bondi gave condolences to Padilla for the fires in California and refused to give a yes or no response about whether she had evidence of fraud. Bondi was among the dozens of Trump campaign officials and surrogates who lied about voter fraud in the 2020 election in a failed quest to help Trump remain in power. She specifically focused on Pennsylvania, which Bondi falsely claimed Trump won. ""We are not going anywhere until they declare that we won Pennsylvania,"" Bondisaidduring a Fox News appearance in 2020. In fact, Bondi helped organize the infamous news conference in Philadelphia that was supposed to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel but instead was mistakenly held atFour Seasons Total Landscapingafter the inept campaign booked the wrong venue. Bondi didn't speak that day, but was seen ""helping other staff to rearrange the company's landscaping equipment to make way for a podium"" before the event began,accordingto The Washington Post. It's no surprise that Bondi refused to say Biden won. Trumpdemands total loyaltyfrom his Cabinet picks, and admitting that Biden was the victor goes against Trump's narcissistic delusion that he didn't lose in 2020. But it's terrifying that Republican senators are set to confirm an attorney general who not only can't admit basic reality, but will readily lie to stroke Trump's fragile ego.",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 01:01:02,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297102/-Trump-s-attorney-general-pick-won-t-admit-Biden-won-2020-election
Trump tries to take full credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal,"Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war after more than 15 months of fighting, according tothe U.S. and Qatar. The destruction and violence resulted in the deaths ofat least 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, while thousands morehave been injured. But amid the news, President-elect Donald Trump made the historic deal about himself and tried to take sole credit for it—all before President Joe Biden's administration hadheld a news briefingon the matter. ""WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,"" Trump posted to hisTruth Socialplatform. ""THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!"" In asecond post, Trump added, ""This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies."" Of course, the ceasefire effort was put into motion by Biden and has been carried out while he is president. The deal reached by negotiatorsis broadly the sameasthe one Biden proposed last May, which the president noted in astatement, saying, ""I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council."" Additionally, on Monday, Jake Sullivan, the Biden White House's national security adviser, said that a deal was imminent and that he ""coordinated very closely"" with the incoming Trump team to ""present a united message"" and ""get this deal done as fast as possible."" The deal stillneeds to be approvedby the Israeli cabinet, which isexpected to happen on Thursday. If approved as expected, the ceasefire will go into effect on Sunday. That said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid late on Wednesdaythat final details are still being worked out. If approved, the deal will allow for an exchange and release of all the remaining living Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel would also release some jailed Palestinians and allow for increased humanitarian aid in Gaza. In addition, during the plan's first 42 days, ""Israeli forces will withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas,"" according toABC News, and eventually, there will be a ""permanent cessation of military operations."" The final phase of the plan would see the two sides exchange remains for identification. At that time, the reconstruction of Gaza would begin, ""with compensation for all affected individuals under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar and the U.N.,"" according to ABC News. Notably, last September, Netanyahurejectedthe Biden administration's claim that a ceasefire plan was nearly finished. Since then, of course, the U.S. has elected a new president, suggesting that Netanyahu is far more prepared to bend a knee to the United States now than he was when Democrats controlled Washington, D.C. It's alsolikelythat he wanted to harm Democrats' chances at winning the presidency since the continuing conflict in Gaza was seen asa bad issue for them. Last week, Trump warned reporters that ""all hell"" would break loose if Hamas did not release the hostages by his Jan. 20 inauguration. It's possible that the pressure of Trump's threat shook Netanyahu, who has long shownfealtyto the president-elect despite Trump famouslyaccusing him of disloyalty. Of course, Trump is not currently president, so it makes sense that Biden is pushing back on giving the president-elect too much credit. When a reporter asked on Wednesday who gets credit for the deal, him or Trump, Biden responded, ""Is that a joke?"" Unsurprisingly, Trump's allies are lapping up his lies that the president-elect was singularly responsible for brokering this deal. ""HISTORY: President Trump has ended the war against Israel before he even took the oath of office,"" Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenepostedto social media.

Trump pushes DOGE dork to fill Vance's vacant Senate seat in Ohio,"Donald Trump isreportedly pushingfailed presidential candidate and billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to take JD Vance's soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat in Ohio. According to the Washington Post, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to take the position if offered by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who will make the appointment for the vacated seat once Vance is sworn in as vice president. The outlet also reports that Ramaswamy was planning to run for Ohio governor in 2026. If Ramaswamy assumed the position, Ohio would be represented by a senator whose history is checkered with promoting debunked conspiracy theories. During his unsuccessful presidential campaign,Ramaswamy saidthat the Jan. 6 insurrection of the U.S. Capitol looked like it was an ""inside job,"" amplifying a conservative conspiracy that it was undertaken by shadowy forces within the government. ""Why am I the only person on this stage, at least, who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?"" Ramaswamy asked his fellow Republican candidates during a December 2023 debate. Healso postedon social media on the anniversary of the insurrection, writing ""Happy Entrapment Day,"" a nod to thedebunkedright-wing conspiracy theory that federal agents staged the event to entrap Trump supporters. Trump's Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth,has espousedsimilar beliefs. Ramaswamyhas also claimedthat the racist ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory, which argues that increased immigration from Mexico is a plan to replace white people with Latinx people, is ""a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform."" He also promoted thefalsehoodthat the 2020 election was ""stolen by Big Tech."" Perhaps the most absurd conspiracy that Ramaswamy has embracedis his theorythat the result of the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs and that it would be connected to a future endorsement of President Joe Biden from Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. When he's not promoting conspiracies, Ramaswamy has embraced unpopular conservative policy ideas, like privatizing Social Security. In avideofor AARP, Ramaswamy endorsedthe failed proposalfrom former President George W. Bush to allow partial privatization of the popular pension program by investing funds in the stock market. Along with Elon Musk, Ramaswamy iscurrently co-chairingthe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-governmental pressure group created by Trump. DOGE representatives have reportedly beenharassing federal workersin an effort to undermine federal spending. And recently, RamaswamydenigratedU.S. culture in a lengthypost on Xclaiming that ""American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long."" ""A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from 'Boy Meets World,' or Zach & Slater over Screech in 'Saved by the Bell,' or 'Stefan' over Steve Urkel in 'Family Matters,' will not produce the best engineers,"" he wrote.

Even Fox News can't spin how much Greenlanders don't want to join US,"Well, this is awkward. A reporter from right-wing propaganda outlet Fox News headed to Greenland to see if its residents were as pumped about the idea of the country becoming part of the United States as Donald Trump and his brain-dead MAGA cult are. But the reporter did not encounter scores of Trump fans who want the country to be taken over by the U.S. Instead, the reporter said that ""most"" of the people she spoke to were against Trump's plan to acquire the territory. ""I hate it,"" one Greenlander told Fox News of Trump's proposal. ""I want to stick with Danish ... government,"" another person interviewed by Fox said. (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.) Trump has had a bizarre fixation with annexing Greenland since at least2019, when he first saber-rattled about buying the island. He had gone quiet about the idea until after he won the 2024 election. And now, once again, he is saying that the U.S. should take control of Greenland, going as far as saying hemay use military forceto acquire the land. Earlier in January, Trump sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to the country to try to build support among the people for a U.S. acquisition. But Greenlandic politicians described Jr.'s visit as astaged public-relations stunt. In fact, a Danish media outletreportedthat the pro-Trump folks whom Trump Jr. featured in photos he posted of his visit included unhoused people who wereoffered free lunchin exchange for wearing MAGA gear. ""They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,""Tom Amtoft, a Greenland resident, told the Danish outlet, according to Google's translation of the comment. Trump alsoposteda video of a man in Greenland wearing MAGA gear, saying, ""I am hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.'"" But apparently unbeknownst to Trump, the man in the video is a convicted drug trafficker,according toa Danish media outlet. Ultimately, officials from bothGreenlandand Denmark officials say the arctic territory will not become part of the US. ""Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,"" Greenland's prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede,said in a statement. And even Fox News can't propagandize that fact.

AG nominee is still covering up Trump’s Georgia election fraud efforts,"Former Florida Attorney General and Trump lawyer Pam Bondi is lying her way through Wednesday's Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general. When Sen. Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked if she ""heard the recording of President Trump on January 2, 2021, when he urged the secretary of state of Georgia to, quote, 'find 11,780 votes' and declare him the winner of that state,"" Bondi denied ever hearing it. ""No. I've heard about it through clips, but no, no, Senator, I've not heard it,"" she said. ""What was your reaction to President Trump making that call?"" Durbin pressed. ""I have, I would have to listen to the tape, Senator,"" Bondi responded.

Trump set to start second term with underwater approval rating,"As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office for a second time, he claims to have a ""massive"" mandate to enact his destructive agenda. But new polling shows that's far from the truth. ANPR/PBS News/Marist College pollreleased Wednesday shows that just 44% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 49% view him unfavorably. That's nearly identical to the 45% approval rating Trump has inCiviqs' tracking poll. The fact that Trump is viewed unfavorably before he even takes office is a warning sign for his tenure. The start of a presidential term is usually when a president is at their high-water mark of approval. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, 51% of registered voters approved of the job he was doing on the transition, according to anNPR/PBS News/Marist College pollat the time. In the first two months after Barack Obama was sworn in as president, around 60% of Americans approved of the job he was doing, according to538's historical polling average. And when he was sworn in again four years later, his approval rating was around 53%. The NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll has other warning signs for Trump. Just 31% of Americans say thetariff policyTrump plans to enact would help the economy. That should be a flashing red warning light for Trump, showing that Americans will likely blame him if those tariffs cause prices toskyrocket, as economists expect. What's more, 62% of Americans oppose Trump's plan to pardon people who either pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for their role in the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It's not just Trump who is unpopular among voters. Trump's Cabinet nominees are also underwater. Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, has just a 19% approval rating in the NPR/PBS News/Marist College survey. And the survey was conducted before Hegseth's confirmation hearing, when Democratic senatorslaid barethe nominee's abhorrent behavior of alleged sexual assault, womanizing, on-the-job drinking, and misogynistic remarks. Twenty-six percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hegseth, with the remaining 55% not knowing who he is or having no opinion of him. However, Trump's co-president, Elon Musk, is broadly unpopular. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable view of him, while 46% view him unfavorably, according to the poll. That's also a warning sign for Trump, who is allowing Musk to hog the spotlight and even letting the awkward billionaireoccupy an officein the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next door to the White House. Ultimately, while it's awful that Trump will be sworn in for a second time, polling suggests that he will have no honeymoon phase and that backlash to his agenda could be a serious problem for Republicans in the 2026 midterms.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 20:00:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297068/-Trump-won-the-popular-vote-but-that-doesn-t-mean-Americans-like-him

Watters' and Di Paolo's comments echo longtimeconservative complaintsthat President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democrats are too ""woke,"" meaning they have embraced diversity. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the performers were in fact diverse. Lady Gaga—who was blonde at the time—sangthe national anthem, Jennifer Lopezalso performed, and so didGarth Brooks—a straight white man. Watters has spent years at Fox espousing racist and misogynistic comments, and the network expanded his platform whenhe receivedhis primetime show in 2023, replacing the extremelybigotedTucker Carlson. During the recent presidential campaign, Watterslobbed multiple sexistand racist attacks at Harris, who made history as the first woman of color to secure a major party's nomination. ""She's just like your typical girl's girl that talks behind everybody's back and then says nice things to your face. She's just not at the level of what you would think would be a president,"" he ranted. In another instance, Watters called Harris a ""frightened woman too insecure to tell us who she is"" and claimed the media supported her because ""they love a Black woman taking on a white man."" Fox has beenall in for Trump—and racism—for years, and with comments like Watters', there's no sign the network will stop any time soon.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 19:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297080/-Fox-News-host-celebrates-lack-of-diverse-inauguration-performers
Biden spends final days in office tackling another important crisis,"In one of his final moves in office, President Joe Biden is aiming to eliminate some bureaucratic hurdles that have historically forced homeowners and renters into expensive mortgages and sky-high rental rates. On Tuesday, the Biden administrationunveileda $100 million grant program from the Department of Housing and Urban Development aimed at helping local communities identify and remove barriers to the production and preservation of affordable housing. ""The United States faces a shortfall of millions of affordable homes that has driven up home prices and rents and has made finding a quality and affordable home out of reach for too many Americans,"" the White House statement said. The grant will remove red tape and modernize local permitting procedures to facilitate the construction of new housing, finance the construction of new homes for renting and owning, and repair and revitalize existing buildings. New plans will be developedacross 14 states, including in the cities of San Francisco, California; Austin, Texas; Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and St. Louis, Missouri. The White House also approved the first residential transit-oriented development (TOD) loan under the Department of Transportation's lending programs. The new initiative will fund the creation of more than 300 new housing units near Florida's Boca Raton Tri-Rail Station, which is expected to generate an annual $2 million in land lease revenue for the commuter rail system. This would help ensure that public transportation is accessible to people living in affordable housing, removing a potential barrier to employment. Housing experts from platforms like Zillowargue thatthe lack of housing supply is one of the main driving forces behind the soaring costs that have prohibited millions of Americans from entering the housing market. For many,skyrocketing rents and home pricescombined withstagnant wageshave made it nearly impossible to save for a down payment, locking an entire generation out of homeownership. Biden's push to address the housing shortage is an extension of his 2022Housing Supply Action Plan, which aimed to reverse years of underbuilding and stimulate housing growth by offering incentives to state and local governments. For many Americans, the dream of homeownership has been squashed by the harsh reality of rising rents and unaffordable home prices. The pandemic-era boom in the housing market only exacerbated these trends, leaving many feeling like homeownership is an impossibility. During the2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presented vastly different visions for tackling the housing crisis. Harris proposed a bold plan to offer $25,000 in down-payment assistance and to expand the supply of housing—focusing on practical steps to help people get into homes. Trump, on the other hand, was far less detailed. He suggested that curbing immigration could somehow ease housing costs. This was widely debunked, as immigration does not significantly impact housing prices. He also called for lowering mortgage rates, whichcurrently sit ataround 7.25% for a 30-year fixed loan. Though it remains unclear how he planned to achieve that, as the president is independent of the Federal Reserve, which dictates rates. Biden's latest move is part of a series of sweeping policy decisions made during his final months in office, including signing a record number ofcommutations,cutting billionsin student loan debt,protecting landby designating two new national monuments, andbanning medical debtfrom impacting credit scores. As Biden moves forward with his efforts to ease the housing crunch, he seems to understand that boosting the housing supply and cutting through bureaucratic red tape are two crucial steps in making housing more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. Time will only tell if Trump is on the same page.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 18:00:04,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2296959/-Biden-spends-final-days-in-office-easing-the-housing-crisis
GOP senator ditches skepticism and backs Pete Hegseth to lead Pentagon,"Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa announced late Tuesday that she'd vote in favor of President-elect Donald Trump's utterly unqualified pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth—a move that suggests the former Fox News host has a high chance of being confirmed. During an appearance on anIowa radio showon Tuesday, Ernst said she believed that Hegseth adequately answered all her questions during his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon, and I think we're at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,"" Ernstsaid. ""I will be supporting President Trump's pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth."" Ernst's support is a huge boon for Hegseth's odds, practically ensuring he'll lead the Pentagon in Trump's incoming administration. Assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, Hegseth can afford to lose just three Republican senators. And while some in the GOP, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, stillhaven't said how they'll vote, Tuesday's confirmation hearing demonstrated thatmany are on board with Hegsethand are willing to give hisabhorrent alleged behaviora pass. Part of what makes Ernst's raving endorsement notable is her history as a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor whopreviously raised concernsover Hegseth's ability to lead the Pentagon. In December, she cited unease over Hegseth's past opposition to women serving in combat roles, though hewalked this backduring Tuesday's hearing. It was also unclear how Ernst, who has crusaded for years to address sexual misconduct in the military, would respond to allegations that Hegseth raped a woman in 2017. (Hegseth maintains that theencounter was consensual.) Perhaps Ernst can stomach Hegseth's nomination because sheintentionally distanced herselffrom some of the worst charges against him. According to new reporting from The New Yorker, Ernst declined an invitation to meet with the woman whom Hegseth paid to settle that 2017 sexual assault claim. Or maybe Ernst simply bowed to outsized pressure from the GOP base. After meeting with Hegseth in December and voicing doubts about whether she'd vote in his favor, she was relentlessly bullied by hardcore MAGA adherents. Not only did some of Trump's most ardent supportersrun adsin Ernst's home state of Iowa, but they alsoquestioned her conservative bona fideson social media. Mega-billionaire Elon Musk also pledged tobankroll primary challengesto Republicans who went against the president-elect. It appears that threats to primary Ernst worked. Following another December meeting with Hegseth, Ernstsignaled more opennessto his nomination. Thispressurevery likely helped change Ernst's tone on Hegseth. Notably, on Tuesday, asDemocrats slammed the defense nomineeover his alleged drinking problem and past comments toward women, Ernsttossed him softballs. ""As secretary of defense, will you appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response?"" she asked. ""Senator, as we have discussed, yes I will,"" Hegseth responded. Ernst is up forreelection in 2026in a statethat went for Trumpby more than 13 percentage points in November. Given that, it's likely she would've been targeted by MAGA followers had she not kowtowed to the president-elect and refused to back Hegseth. That type of politicking might work for the likes of Collins or even Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who isalso on the fenceabout confirming Hegseth, but not the bulk of Senate Republicans who need Trump's base of loyal Republicans to retain their positions in Congress. Ernst's onetime arms-length attitude toward Hegseth signaled that some Senate Republicans would attempt to maintain independence under a second Trump administration, but the Iowan's changed tune suggests that for Republican lawmakers, Trump is still king.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 17:00:11,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297074/-GOP-senator-ditches-skepticism-and-backs-Pete-Hegseth-to-lead-Pentagon
Nancy Mace threatens Jasmine Crockett during House proceeding,"During a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace threatened to fight Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett after she called out Mace for anti-transgender bigotry. Crockett was attempting to get the committee to reinstate its subcommittee on civil rights when she took note of Mace's recent anti-trans rhetoric andpromotion of billsmeant to restrict transgender rights. ""Somebody's campaign coffers really are struggling right now. So [Mace] gonna keep saying 'trans, trans, trans' so that people will feel threatened, and child, listen—"" Crockett said. Mace interjected, saying, ""I am no child, do not call me a child, I am no child,"" then told Crockett, ""If you want to take it outside, we can do that."" Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost objected to the call for violence, but Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican, ruled that the threat could merely have meant going outside to ""have a cup of coffee or perhaps a beer."" Following the incident,Mace postedabout it on social media at least a dozen times but claimed that her response to Crockett was not about instigating a fight. ""Please explain to me how the same damn Karen that called Cap[itol] Police on a child who shook her hand wanted to act like she wanted to fight me?!""Crockett wrote. ""Republicans incite violence from the highest levels of government & ALSO claim to be the party of law & order. The two cannot be true! Do yourself a favor, decide to require better of your electeds. Last I checked, threatening members in a committee room doesn't exactly reduce the cost of eggs."" Mace has been widely criticized forpushing House Republicanleadership to adopt a rule that prevents transgender members of the House from using a restroom corresponding to their gender identity. The adoption of the rule followed the successful election of Rep. Sarah McBride, the first (and so far only) openly transgender member of Congress. After being criticized for her bigoted stance, Mace has spent months attacking transgender people. A recent fundraising text for Maceallegedthat a ""Trans Mob"" wanted to kill her. The comment from Crockett comes as the Republican-led Housepassed legislationto ban transgender girls from participating in girls' sports at schools that receive funding from the federal government. The bill also changes federal law to say ""sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth."" Republicans pushed the bill through—only two Democrats supported it, and no Republicans opposed it—even as concerns have been raised that it would empower predators. ""The House Republican Child Predator Empowerment Act does not promote fairness and safety in sports,"" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffrieswrote. ""It will unleash horrific child predators on girls and young women throughout America. Unacceptable."" Frostnotedthat if the Republican bill became law, it would allow young children to be subjected to invasive questions about their genitals from strangers and that inspections could occurwithout parents present. ""We must protect children. This bill is disgusting and puts every girl in this country at risk,"" he wrote. Republicans,led by Donald Trump, have attacked transgender rights as a unifying rallying cry for bigots to support the party's candidates at the polls.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 16:00:24,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297061/-Notorious-GOP-bigot-tries-to-pick-literal-fight-with-Texas-Democrat
Trump's tech sugar daddies bestowed VIP seats for Inauguration Day,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, and oh-so-""masculine"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be very special guests at Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. An official involved with the event planningconfirmed to NBC Newsthat three of the United States' wealthiest men will be seated together on the platform as theconvicted felontakes the oath of office. The tech bros will be cozied up right next to Trump's Cabinet nominees and other prominent elected officials. Given the billionaire trio'sseven-figure donationsto the inaugural fund, this naked display of favoritism on Trump's big day doesn't come as a surprise. As Daily Kos previously reported, a bunch of tech moguls have lined up tokiss Trump's ring, offering sizable donations ahead of his second term. But as the three stooges kiss up to the incoming president and throw money at his feet, Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos also share something else in common: personal interests to protect. Online shopping mogul Bezos has alarge stake in defense contractswith his aerospace company Blue Origin—and he also has some trouble ahead with the Federal Trade Commission, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Amazon founder in 2023. The case made headlines last year when the government agency accused Bezos of concealing evidence by using the disappearing messaging service Signal amid the ongoing lawsuit. Despite multiple attempts by Amazon to get the lawsuit thrown out, the hearing is set to go ahead inOctober 2026. And while Bezos butted heads with Trump in the past, it's clear he knows having Trump on his side this time around can only benefit him. As for Musk, the wealthiest man in the world has multiple investments hinging on his blossoming relationship with Trump—not to mention that Trump's win aloneboosted Musk's(and other billionaires') wealth. Of course, Musk alreadyhas his own Trump-backed vanity projectto keep him and fellow tech bro billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy busy during the next four years: the very unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, which claims it will cut spending by $2 trillion. Zuckerberg also has some concerns about his empire that having a friendship with Trump might alleviate. The Meta owner is set togo to trial with the FTCin April over an antitrust lawsuit regarding his purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg allegedly purchased the apps at an exorbitant price in order to push out any possible competitors. The social media scion seems to be playing up his MAGA support in light of the new administration. As previously reported, Zuckerberg has called off the use ofindependent fact-checkerson Facebook, altered thehateful conduct policyto allow harassment of women and the LGBTQ+ community, announced that content moderation efforts willmove to the famously unbiased Texas, and is dismantling his company'sDEI initiatives. To really drive home his ass-kissing, Zuck is alsoreportedlycohosting a black-tie Inauguration Day reception for his new bestie. Billionaire oligarchs aside, Trump appears to be pulling out all the stops for his big day, booking country music singer Carrie Underwood to sing ""America the Beautiful"" as well. But given the incoming president's obsession withcrowd sizesand big introductions, Trump wasn't satisfied with a simple inauguration ceremony. The Republican will also be hosting three inauguration balls following the morning ceremony:the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball, and the Starlight Ball. Trump will also throw a so-calledVictory Rallyin D.C.'s Capital One Arena the night before. Given the millions of dollars that billionaires have lavished on his inaugural fund, the guy can certainly afford to throw multiple ego-stroking celebrations.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 15:00:17,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2296980/-Trump-s-tech-sugar-daddies-bestowed-VIP-seats-for-Inauguration-Day
'Blueprint for suffering': Democrat trashes GOP's heartless budget,"Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico brought some thunder to the House floor on Tuesday. With Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful"" tax cut for the wealthy teetering on the edge of failure, Stansbury made it clear where the Democratic Party and theAmerican people stand. ""I rise today to oppose this so-called budget resolution, which is one of the greatest heists in American history, as they loot the Treasury to give permanent tax breaks to billionaires at the expense of millions of Americans,"" Stansbury said. ""We're talking about cuts to health care, Medicaid, Medicare."" ""These cuts are cruel. They are unnecessary. They are undemocratic. And they will blow a hole through our deficit spending by $4 trillion,"" she continued. ""Because this is not a budget resolution. This is a blueprint for suffering."" Trump and the Republican Party are trying to cut taxes for the wealthy by cutting hundreds of billions from Medicaid and the social safety net. And their attempts to paint this as a kind ofcostsavingshas failed everycredible metricapplied to it. Stansbury pulled no punches, calling out Musk and co.'s willingness to cause American families' suffering in their desire for control. ""It's about power and greed. And the GOP is enabling them,"" she said. ""So we will not sit down and do it. We will not support this budget resolution, and we will not give them one single vote.""

Team assigned to help DOGE gives middle finger instead,"Nearly two dozen federal technology workers just walked out the door rather than bow to billionaire Elon Musk, who they say is set on running the government into the ground with chaos and cronyism. On Tuesday, 21 engineers, data scientists, and product managers who worked for what was once known as theUnited States Digital Servicesubmitted a mass resignation letter in response to Musk's Department of Government Efficiency interloping in federal jobs and agencies. In the joint letter, obtained by theAssociated Press, staffers from the USDS wrote, ""We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans' sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services. We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE's actions."" They also alluded to nameless DOGE bros wearing White House visitor badges infiltrating their office and grilling the nonpartisan staffers. The staffers told reporters these young men were rife with technological inefficiency, fandom for Musk, and ideological partisanship. ""Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,"" the staffers wrote. ""This process created significant security risks."" This follows the layoffs of 40 USDS staffers earlier in February. After Musk's initial layoffs, 65 USDS employees remained—a third of whom just resigned. USDS wasestablishedby former President Barack Obama in 2014, after hischaotic rolloutof the federalhealth care website, Healthcare.gov, proved to be clunky and slow. Since then, theagencyhas made the site efficient, helping Americans sign up for health care. It has also worked to improve services for veterans, assisted the government in purchasing updated technology, and created a free tax portal. Meanwhile, the White House is covering for Musk,claimingthat he has nothing to do with the DOGE firings. When he isn't sending micromanagingemailsthreatening federal workers to list five things they did that week or be fired, he's brandishing bedazzledchainsawsat CPAC conference, shouting, ""This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy."" Since being sworn in, Trump has given Musk full reign to use DOGE to illegally accesssensitive dataon private citizens. He has also dismantled federal agencies like theUnited States Agency for International Developmentandlaid offthousandsof federal employees in the name of ""efficiency."" As federal employees have been the target in Trump's first month in office, some,joinedby congressional Democrats, stood outside in Washington's wintery streets to protest outside their agencies. Others, like USDS staffers, are taking other means of protest by bowing out of an administration they see as unable to do right by the American people. ""We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,"" the USDS employees wrote. ""However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.""",Daily Kos,2025-02-25 20:30:14,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/25/2306173/-Team-assigned-to-help-DOGE-gives-middle-finger-instead
