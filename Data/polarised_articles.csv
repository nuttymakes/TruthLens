The UK grooming gang scandal is a Galileo moment,"This article contains graphicdescriptions of a sort that we would not normally publish but which, in this case, are in the public interest to do so. THERE IS a simple reason that the UK’s grooming gangs scandal is so difficult for liberally minded people to wrap their minds around, and that reason is that the scandal is exactly what ‘the far right’ says it is: Mass, religiously and racially aggravated, rape of thousands of young white working class British girls by Muslim men from mostly Pakistani immigrant backgrounds, on an industrial and organised scale. Every racially aggravating factor you could imagine is present. First, there is substantial evidence that the young girls in question were targetedbecausethey were white. In these communities of Pakistani Muslim rapists, hardly any of the victims were Pakistani Muslim women. Second, the scale of the depravity and violence makes it clear that in many – if not a clear majority – of cases, the abuse was more than just about sex. It was about domination, enslavement, and humiliation. If you doubt me on this point, just readthis 2013 sentencing reportthat did the rounds on X (formerly twitter) in recent days. There’s a quote from it later in this article that sums up the kind of thing you’ll find in there. Third, there is overwhelming evidence that in many cases the abuse was covered up by the authorities and then downplayed by the media right across Britain because it was more ideologically convenient to ignore the mass rape of children than it was to confront the fact that a substantial section of the British Pakistani community harboured (and indeed still harbours) violently sexist and racist attitudes towards white non-muslim women in particular. The implications of that idea wereand aresimply too great for the liberal mind to contemplate its admission. If multiculturalism has a foundational myth, that myth is that all cultures are compatible with each other and that they can always peacefully and harmoniously co-exist in an open and democratic society. The British grooming gangs scandal shatters that myth. The United Kingdom, like most western democracies, is now a feminist society. Women have equal rights in law, and cultural and sexual politics have shifted dramatically over the past fifty years in favour of women. Pakistan remains a deeply entrenched patriarchal society where religious attitudes towards women, and particularly towards men’s right to access women sexually, dominate. Throw in multiculturalism and tolerance and ‘community cohesion’ as major values, and then mix in hard-line Muslim attitudes towards ‘kuffar’ women and women who show more of their flesh than a burkha permits, and the UK gets the mass rape of young white girls by Pakistani Muslim men who believe themselves to have both a cultural and a religious right to use those girls as they see fit. When liberally minded people critique the Catholic church, they often cite the imprisonment in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII of Galileo Galilei, as a result of the latter’s insistence that the earth is round and revolves around the Sun. When that story is recounted, it is presented as a morality tale about how the Roman Catholic Church is anti-science and anti-progress. But it is a human story at heart: Galileo presented evidence that shattered more than a millennium of religious certainty. Faced with evidence, Urban could either publicly accept that a thousand years of teaching had been wrong – risking people askingwhat elsewas wrong – or he could preserve the authority of the Church and silence the heretic. He chose to silence the heretic. The problem, if that analogy wasn’t clear enough for you, is that the UK’s grooming scandal shatters decades of liberal teaching about multiculturalism and might be expected to force people to admit that they might have been wrong. Given the choice between having that discussion on the one hand and writing off all those who raise it as heretics who need silencing on the other, modern British liberals have chosen the path of Urban. Thus, Tommy Robinson is a household name in Britain (and indeed Ireland) for his alleged ‘islamophobia’ while most of us have never heard the name of the man who branded his initials onto a 13-year-old girl, using red hot metal, on the sensitive skin next to her anal passage. His name is Mohammed Karrar. Here is some more of what he did to that child, in the words of the judge who sentenced him: ‘You, Mohammed Karrar, prepared her for gang anal rape by using a pump to expand her anal passage. You subjected her to a gang rape by five or six men (count 30). At one point she had four men inside her. A red ball was placed in her mouth to keep her quiet. Not only were you both involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of GH, you also used her for your own self-gratification. You both raped her when she was under 13. When she was very young, although it is not clear whether she was under 13, you both raped her at the same time (oral and vaginal/anal). It happened on more than one occasion.’ Of course, the grooming scandal (which should really be called what it is – a mass rape scandal) is not the only evidence that the UK has an enormous multiculturalism problem linked primarily to the Islamic religion. A2017 investigationby the Guardian revealed that the UK has between 30 and 90 ‘sharia councils’ in operation, which perform the essential functions of courts, granting divorces, regulating marital disputes, and operating as a parallel legal system. The Guardian is a liberal newspaper, but even it had to report that: ‘In December, the Casey Review by Dame Louise Casey into integration included claims that sharia councils “supported the values of extremists, condoned wife-beating, ignored marital rape and allowed forced marriages”.’ This is not, to be clear, a British problem. It is a Pakistani cultural and Muslim religious problem that is taking place in the United Kingdom. What’s more, the whole scandal underlines a fact that sends shivers down liberal spines: that elements of Pakistani culture and the Islamic faith pose a real and existential threat to women living in liberal democratic societies. If the state wishes to prevent threats to women (as the liberal state insists it does) and Pakistani culture and elements of the Islamic faith are threats to women, suddenly the conversations become – of necessity – very uncomfortable. Which is why liberal Britain is so desperate to avoid having them. For this cowardice liberalism in Britain and the wider west deserves nothing but contempt, scorn, and condemnation. A generation of ‘progressive’ political leaders of both parties in Britain from the 1970s onwards have consistently prioritised ‘community relations’ over the safety of their own little girls. Young women were allowed to be treated like human filth, while the entire apparatus of the state looked the other way lest it be accused of racism. All the while, towns like Rotherham and Oldham have been permitted to be turned into bastardised versions of Multan, Pakistan. I will leave you with this story, from 2017. It took place in the aforementioned Multan. A young girl was raped by a boy from her village. The victim had a brother. The perpetrator had a sister. The victim’s brother was summoned before the village council and told that justice had been arranged: To avenge the rape of his sister, he would be presented with the rapist’s younger sister – a 16 year old girl – andtold to rape her in turn. This is the culture that Britain has imported. It is the culture that dominates vast swathes of Northern England. The state, and progressives, having admitted it to their country, have a duty to quash it entirely. Racism and community sensitivity be damned.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-uk-grooming-gang-scandal-is-a-galileo-moment/
The progressives' contempt for the white working class,"THERE is a time to be angry. There is a time when it is a sin not to be angry. This is such a time. I have served in the armed forces. I have been a prison chaplain. I have been a minister in one of the roughest parts of Glasgow. I am not naive. Yet I was unable to finish readingthe details of the atrocitiescommitted by a mainly Pakistani Muslim rape gang on white girls. some of them pre-teen. These vile acts were committedprior to 2013yet have came to light last week. Why were they hidden? I think we know the answer. The great Dutch theologian, church leader and prime minister Abraham Kuyper never lost sight of thekleine mensen, the little people. He knew that the supposedly insignificant working-class people were ignored by the main parties and needed protecting. Our secular progressive elites have no interest in or concern for the ordinary working-class people of Britain. When a nation abandons the Bible, the most vulnerable pay the heaviest price. These were not grooming gangs: dogs are groomed. These were paedophile rape and torture gangs. Neither was this confined to Rochdale; paedophile rape gangs have been operatingin towns and cities throughout the UK.Poor white girlsfrom broken homeswere viewed as legitimate targets for rape and exploitation by men from a faith known for its disdain of women. This happened with the complicity of those charged with protecting children. Ina case from Bradforda 15-year-old girl was placed as a foster child in the family of her rapist and made to marry her abuser in an Islamic ceremony with her social worker present. During this period she was forced to convert to Islam and treated as a domestic slave. Mainly Pakistani Muslims preyed upon poor, vulnerable white girls. They were pimped out to others across Britain. Police and social services were so scared of being called racist or Islamophobic they did nothing to protect the girls or arrest the perpetrators. Sometimes they were orderedto do nothing.One girl claimsto have been raped by 150 men; this began when she was 13. Some girlswere murdered. The depth of the contempt the white progressive managerial class has for the white working class is all too evident; their oikophobia is rampant. The primary responsibility for these horrific acts belongs to the mostly Pakistani Muslim perpetrators. Yet it was the weakness and systemic failures of those with responsibility for protecting their own girls which should make us angriest. For them progressive ideology, especially immigration and multiculturalism, was so important that it was worthwhile sacrificing tens of thousands of working-class white girls. Ultimate responsibility lies with our politicians. These politicians are keen on punishing hate crimes. If there was ever a hate crime it was when groups of mainly Pakistani Muslims targeted vulnerable white girls on racial and religious grounds for industrial-scale rape and torture. These hate crimes were ignored. These horrific crimes would not have been allowed to continue unabated if our politicians had not prioritised multiculturalism and vote gathering, a combination of progressive ideology and moral corruption. The white girls were simply the wrong victims, their suffering got in the way of the progressive narrative. If it had been Asian girls the story might have been different. This scandal touchedthe whole of Britain, yet the currentLabour government refusesto hold a national inquiry, asLaura Perrins wrote inTCWyesterday.It is to be left to local authorities with limited resources to investigate these crimes. One doesn’t need to be cynical to askwho is being protectedand which voting bloc appeased. It does the Conservative Party little good to try to assume the high moral ground and call for a national inquiry. They have just emerged from 14 years in power when they did nothing. The police would not have ignored these crimes without strong political backing and instruction. A law enforcement officer came to the conclusion that a 12-year-old who told police she hadsex with five adultshad done so in a ‘100 per cent consensual [way] in every incident’. Thankfully, he was overruled. Therewas the time when a 13-year-oldwas found half-naked and drunk in a house with a group of seven adult Pakistani men. It was the girl who was arrested, charged and eventually convicted of being drunk and disorderly. The men were not even questioned, never mind arrested. By way of contrast, fathers who attempted to rescue their underage daughters from the houses in which they were being held and rapedwere arrested. From the copper on the beat to the highest-ranking officer, not one police officer has been disciplined or lost their job and pension. The same police who turned a blind eye to these crimes are still policing us. There has been a mass dereliction of duty amongst the media who pride themselves on ‘speaking truth to power’. With a few brave exceptions, such asAndrew Norfolkof theTimesandCharlie Petersof GB News, they have chosen to ignore the elephant in the room. Our progressive elite are so out of touch with the people of Britain they can only see through woke spectacles.Dr Ella Cockbainof University College Londonwrote in 2013that she was concerned that the existence of child abusing networks run by South Asian men was ‘fuelling racist rhetoric’. She was so blind to reality thatshe opined: ‘It can seem that the greatest effrontery about grooming is not the abuse of children but the interracial sex itself.’ The progressives simply cannot grasp how deeply they hold their fellow countrymen and women in contempt. They cannot possibly admit that they look down on the white working class. After all, being liberal-progressives they are the good guys. They are the enlightened. They are the moral arbiters. They are the ones who understand the whole picture. There is a certain parable about specks of sawdust and planks of wood which springs to mind (Matthew 7:3-5). Professor Alexis Jay, who conducted an inquiry into the mass rapes in Rochdale, wrote: ‘The authorities involved have a great deal to answer for.’ To date no police officer has been disciplined, no social work director sacked, no politician held to account. While unwilling to protect the most vulnerable in society, the progressive managerial class are more than willing to protect their own. This societal calamity was papered over. That is no longer the case. The mass rape of white British girls is the most egregious example of the high-handed disdain the progressive powers that be have for the indigenous working class.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-08T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/progressive-contempt-for-the-white-working-class/
How dare Starmer reject a public inquiry into Muslim grooming gangs?,"SIR KEIR Starmer claims that politicians who are calling for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs are‘jumping on a bandwagon of the far right’. In a press conference this morning (about the NHS, obviously, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, obviously) the Prime Minister not only rejected calls for a full public inquiry into the grooming scandal, or more accurately the Muslim child rape, trafficking and prostitution scandal, he also insulted politicians who believe such an inquiry is needed. It was a disgusting slur against anyone who has problems with thesystematic brutalisation of 11-year-old girls. To quote Sir Keir in full: ‘It is something about the nature of our politics because once we lose the anchor that truth matters in the robust debate we must have, then we are on a very slippery slope and when politicians, and I mean politicians, who sat in government for many years are casual about honesty, decency, truth and the rule of law, calling for inquiries because they want to jump on a bandwagon of the far right, then that affects politics because a robust debate can only be based on the true facts and that is why this is actually an important point about our politics, not about what anybody may or may not say on Twitter.’ A few things. First, it is noteworthy that this press conference was not about the child gang rape scandal but about the NHS, which in itself tells you all you need to know. As I have said before, there are very few subjects that get the lectern treatment: Far Right Thugs get the lectern treatment, the NHS gets the lectern treatment. How and why young white girls were raped and brutalised by gangs of Muslim men while authorities stood by is not worthy of the lectern treatment.This tells you all you need to know about Labour’s political priorities. Second, how dare he? How very dare he say that calling for a proper statutory inquiry into the biggest scandal in British history, namely Muslim gangs of men raping, trafficking and prostituting thousands of white working-class girls, some as young as 11, around the country, while police forces looked the other way, is ‘jumping on the band wagon of the far right’. Yes, there have been inquiries before. There was theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse by Professor Alexis Jay, but that was a much broader inquiry into sexual abuse by the Catholic church, Anglican church and others. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an inquiry in 2014 after it was revealed that at least 1,400 girls in the South Yorkshire town were abused between 1997 and 2013. TheTimesreported: ‘An eight-year investigation into multiple police failings during the Rotherham sex grooming scandal was condemned as a disgrace after its final report revealed that no officers have been dismissed . . . The IOPC’s resulting Operation Linden investigation examined 265 allegations against 47 police officers by 51 complainants, most of them abuse survivors. It upheld 43 of the complaints and ruled that 14 officers “had a case to answer” for misconduct or gross misconduct.’ One unnamed officer was said to have told the mother of an exploited childthat it was a ‘fashion accessory’ for Rotherham girls to have an ‘older Asian boyfriend’ and that she would ‘grow out of it’. And there were other local council inquiries and safeguarding reviews. But as Sir Keir Starmer well knows – he is a human rights lawyer who normally cannot get enough of inquiries – this is very different from an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 where people are called to give evidence under oath. Starmer says that ‘robust debate can only be based on the true facts’. Ok then, genius, order an inquiry into the rape gangs, and any possible misconduct by police officers under the Inquiries Act 2005 and we will get to the facts. As a bonus, all your human rights lawyer buddies will be quids in for years. Why is Starmer dragging his feet over a public inquiry? As a rule, politicians normally can’t wait to order an inquiry. They demand inquiries over anything. We have the current ridiculous UK Covid-19 Inquiry which will tell us at the end of it all that we should have locked down harder and earlier. There is an Undercover Policing Inquiry. There is the Dawn Sturgess Inquiry, ‘an independent Inquiry into the circumstances ofDawn Sturgess’s deathin Salisbury on 8 July 2018’. There is theIndependent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan‘to investigate the “deliberate detention operations” conducted by the British armed forces in Afghanistan between the period of mid-2010 to mid-2013 to determine whether any of the circumstances around any unlawful killings were covered up at any stage’. This is to name just a few. But for some reason, for some unknown reason, Sir Keir Starmer is refusing to hold a 2005 Act public inquiry into the sodomising and rape of working-class white girls. They are not worthy of this human rights lawyer’s time and attention, it seems. Don’t you know there is a Far Right Thug out there tweeting something mean? You know as well as I do that the Old Bill will be down on them quicker than you can say ‘Mind how you go’ to a Muslim rapist who is receiving a sex act from a minor in his car. (Yes, that happened.) No, nothing to see here, says Starmer, we have had all the itty bitty inquiries into these pesky white girls and their abuse that we need. (My words, not his, just to be clear.) Starmer said, in full: ‘There have been a lot of reviews including localised reviews, including into Oldham for example, the mayor of Manchester did his review, and the Jay report was intended to look at the different types of exploitation that went on. It was a comprehensive review . . . This doesn’t need more consultation. It doesn’t need more research. It just needs action.’ Don’t play me for a fool. Sir Keir Starmer KC knows better than anyone that none of these inquiries are the same as a 2005 inquiry with proper terms of reference, focusing on Muslim rape gangs and any possible police corruption, with the power to call witnesses who must give evidence under oath. Starmer doesn’t want an inquiry because he knows awkward things come out in inquiries. Facts. Truth. Logic. And often liberal beliefs can be slayed. No one is going to push Diversity is our Strength, or say that Britain has experienced an ‘integration miracle’, in the words of that half-wit Fraser Nelson, after such an inquiry, I reckon. No British Prime Minister wants to start unravelling the myth of integration or asking some tough questions about the Islamic faith. That could lead to the kind of facts and truth a Prime Minister could do without, thanks very much. The girls who were raped, sodomised, tortured and brutalised by Muslim rape gangs deserve a public inquiry. It is disgraceful that Starmer is refusing to order one. And it is disgusting to label those who call for one as ‘far right’. It seems that the only time a human right lawyer rejects a public inquiry is when it is about Muslim grooming gangs.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-06T14:01:02+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-dare-starmer-reject-a-public-inquiry-into-muslim-grooming-gangs/
Welcome to the year of the 'Quad-demic',"WHEN I WAS a child, we had ‘outbreaks’ of diseases. Living very close to Aberdeen, I miraculously survived the famous (only if you lived near Aberdeen)typhoid outbreak of 1964, which hospitalised hundreds of people. The only thing it killed, temporarily, was the corned beef trade, as the outbreak was traced to a tin of the popularFray Bentos product. Life soon returned to normal, as did the consumption of tinned meats. That was the first and last ‘outbreak’ that I can recall. Almost anything that more than a couple of folks have caught since has been named an ‘epidemic’. That sounded much more threatening, until it was superseded by the term ‘pandemic’, which seems to be the ubiquitous phrase for anything that used to be an epidemic. Trying to distinguish an epidemic from a pandemic is a fruitless task. The definitions seem to differ depending on where you look and, for all intents and purposes, are interchangeable. The problem for the public health brigade is that, clearly, neither term instils sufficient fear into the population, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 fiasco. Admittedly, they rode high for a time. However, very few people, for example, still wear face masks, apart from a few fainthearts, virtue signallers, and those once again mandated by theirNHS employers. Enthusiasm is waning for covid vaccines. Nevertheless, they must be given credit for their tenacity; they simply don’t give up. In their efforts to paralyse us with fear, pepper the joy of the festive season with a little misery and turn our minds towards the perpetual worship of the NHS, we now have a new category of killer to cope with: the ‘quad-demic’. In case you are interested, this is an allegedly lethal cocktail of ‘flu, Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus’. The quad-demic didn’t seem to do the trick, as the irresponsible British public celebrated the birth of Jesus, visited their families and partied like it was 1999. The outcome? According toNHS England, this has resulted in a ‘tidal wave’ of flu and, in a week, a 70 per cent increase in hospital cases. On New Year’s Eve, clearly concerned that we were not listening, the quad-demic has been upgraded with the epithet of‘terrifying’. How do we know this? Apparently,over a quarter of British people, or at least those gullible enough to take a test, have tested positive for influenza. This does not take into account any false positives, which plague this kind of testing, and it does not report how many of these people were symptomatic. In other words, such testing statistics are virtually meaningless. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS National Medical Director, said that the worst of the tidal wave was on its way. There have been almost4500 flu patients every day, with 211 people in critical care. Therefore, 0.0078% of the population is hospitalised with flu and 0.00037% is in critical care. Expressed like that, the tidal wave seems more like a puddle in a car park. So, why the fuss? Obviously, it is to do with pressure on the NHS which, above all, must be ‘saved’. The usual guilt-inducing measures are employed to imply that it is all our fault, thus it has been reported that the surge in infections will continue to pick up pace in the coming days as a result of more people socialising indoors over the Christmas and the New Year period. Mask-wearing is encouraged, social distancing rears its ugly head and our old favourite lockdown-style measures have been recommended by virologist from the University of Warwick, Professor Lawrence Young. Laughably, it is recommended that you isolate yourself if you have the flu. In my experience, as flu is a near-death experience, the last thing you would want to do is move, eat, drink or speak. Of course, like Covid-19, all things are not equal with flu. It tends not to strike people down in the prime of their lives; the NHS is not overwhelmed with athletes and extreme sports enthusiasts. People in general good health, while not immune to flu, tend to pull through. The usual suspects arethe most vulnerable: I am the last person to play down the severity of flu. I have had it and, as I write, my son, his wife and two of my daughters, both nurses, have it. It is a horrible infection which I sincerely hope to avoid. However,as explained by Dr Clare Craig, flu is not spread asymptomatically, therefore a person testing positive, who has no flu-like symptoms, poses minimal danger to others. Moreover, the flu virus is airborne, meaning that it quickly spreads after a few people with symptoms have it. To cut a long story short, there is very little that anyone can do either to stop it spreading or, once it is spreading, to avoid encountering it. Most people who do encounter the influenza virus will never know it, as their immune systems will deal with it. Attempts by our public health masters to terrify us into submission with the latest ‘demic’ are just that: attempts to terrify us. Given that they know the above facts as well as we do, and that measures such as face masks and lockdowns are futile, we can only speculate about their motives. If only there was a vaccine!",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-04T15:05:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-quad-demic-christmas-blown-out-of-proportion-and-a-happy-new-year/
How Labour is seizing more control over our children,"NEVER underestimate Labour and their determination to wrest any final vestige of authority and concomitant responsibility from parents and endow it on the oh-so-caring state. Labour’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill has its Second Reading tomorrow and given Labour’s thumping majority it will be voted through. Even Sky News’s reporting of it has been mildly critical. A few days ago it led with‘Parents of the most vulnerable children will lose their right to home education’. This is to understate it. It is a further assault on parents’ freedom from the state regarding the upbringing and education of their children, transferring even more powers from parents to the state – a process started by Tony Blair when he decided to centralise, control and regulate families by a programme which merged protection services and child care with the education system. All parents became potential abusers while abusing parents carried on being ignored. In fact it has failed abysmally to protect children. Now Labour are doubling down on failure with the last bastion of parental authority and autonomy from the state, home schooling, threatened. So never mind how bullied your child is or how much you object to a school’s sex education, gender identity teaching or ‘trans’ policy, or how bad the educational ethos and standards are, your power to take your child out of school is to be heavily circumscribed. I have to apologise on behalf ofTCWfor being asleep at the wheel on this one and letting it slide, despite the formidable Rabbi Asher Gratt keeping me copied in on his almost one-man battle with the Government and his various exchanges with Labour bigwigs over his understandable concerns (as well as to the worse than dismissive responses that he has received). As Rabbi Gratt has pointed out repeatedly, ironically the Bill will undermine the very things you might have supposed the DIE minorities mantra stands for: the rights of minorities, cultural diversity and religious pluralism. In fact it never did. Diversity in ‘multiculti’ state education means one thing and that’s what the woke choose it to mean – as an example, to celebrate Diwali but ban Christmas nativity plays in favour of ‘Winterval’. Demoting Christianity in schools despite its being the country’s religion for nearly two thousand years. The bottom line, however,as Rabbi Gratt detailed last month, is that this Bill is the most repressive and authoritarian of assaults on parents. The most repressive since Tony Blair instigated the nationalisation of children when he merged child protection services with the education system andput every child’s ID into a national computer database in order to monitor their use of services. Of course this did nothing to stop child abuse and neglect, rather it treated all parent as potential abusers. What this Bill (planned under the last Conservative Governments) will once again introduce under the guise of child protection is a nationwide register of all children not attending school, a unique identification number for each child akin to a National Insurance number, and, most disturbingly, a requirement for parents to seek council permission to educate their own children at home if a child is under a child protection plan. It is nothing less than the state seizing control over our children, Gratt says: ‘Under these draconian measures, the government assumes control over children’s education in ways that have never before been seen in the UK. Parents will be forced to “register” their children like property and submit to the authority of local councils to determine whether their education is “suitable”. The Bill not only criminalises conscientious parents who seek to provide an education aligned with their religious or philosophical beliefs, but it also sets a dangerous precedent for the erosion of fundamental civil liberties.’ Ironically again, the Bill appears to be in direct violation of parents’ rights as enshrined in Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees parents the right to educate their children in accordance with their own religious and philosophical beliefs. Perhaps the most shocking measure is the introduction of a unique identifier for every child in England, a ‘child-tracking number’ which will be used across services to monitor and log the child’s every movement, akin to a social credit system. Gratt cites civil liberties groups calling this provision ‘deeply chilling’ and reminiscent of surveillance measures seen in authoritarian regimes. The government claims that these measures are necessary for ‘child protection’. Critics argue it is state overreach on an unimaginable scale. Rabbi Gratt is far from alone in his concerns. The activist education groupEducational Freedom are concerned that the right to home educate is seriously at risk, pointing to the Children’s Commissioner’s chilling explanation of the purpose of the register: ‘If we get proper registers and we have our local authorities taking their responsibilities seriously to engage with these families, we may find that we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be.’ Furthermore they point out that if you choose to home educate you now ‘have to demonstrate your home environment is safe even if your education provision is top notch’. So it proposes in effect to circumvent other legislation to remove parental responsibility by the back door. What constitutes ‘safe’ in a home? Their other concern is that it does nothing to support parents to protect their children ‘when the school environment is enabling them to be harmed’. As Gratt points out in his article, for decades parents in the UK have been able to educate their children at home without interference, ‘a right that is rooted in centuries of common law. It is not just that if a child is under a child protection plan that the parents must seek council permission to continue home education, the measure effectively treats all home parents as suspects under constant surveillance, undermining the presumption of parental competence and good faith’. Both Gratt and Educational Freedom believe the Bill has profound consequences for vulnerable families, particularly those dealing with medical or special educational needs (SEN) children: ‘By forcing parents to seek permission from council authorities, this Bill threatens to reduce the flexibility and personalisation that home education provides for children with complex needs.’ This is nothing less than a surveillance state in disguise. As Gratt says, it is not about education quality, but about control, ‘something you expect in authoritarian regimes, not in a democratic society’.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-07T13:42:16+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/how-labour-is-seizing-more-control-over-our-children/
Multiculturalism slays Rotherham's young girls,"Warnings, published in this article all the way back in 2014, of the dangers and consequences of multiculturalism, have been there for all to see. AsLaura Perrins so cogently arguedlast week,establishment elites have ignored them.Which is why, for the record, we decided David’s spot on critique was too important to be allowed to moulder in the archive. IT’S ALMOST beyond parody, but the motto of Rotherham Council emblazoned on all its communications to the outside world that it is a metropolitan borough ‘where everyone matters’. The grubby, right-on fingerprints of NewLabour’s approach to ‘public relations’ are all over the phrase. Let’s put the abuse figure into context. According to the local Children’s Safeguarding Board2012-3 annual reportthere are 62,000 children in the area. 49% of the total are girls, so that means almost one in 20 of local girls was subject to abuse. Actually the percentage is slightly higher because the figures also cover the 16-18 age bracket. Alexis Jay– a prominent social worker in Scotland at the highest levels – minces no words in hertotally shocking report.  What was being wickedly perpetrated on these vulnerable girls should have been glaringly obvious to all the relevant public-purse agencies from police to social services. But individually and collectively, they did nothing.- other than frequently to pour scorn on those who tried to report their torment. And the reason? Obviously in such complex cause and effect, there were many, but, to me, one paragraph leaps out beyond all others in the Jay report. It’s this: ‘By far the majority of perpetrators were described as ‘Asian’ by victims, yet throughout the entire period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem, which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction from their managers not to do so.’ In other words – untold, incalculable human misery has been caused because the authorities that should have cared about human welfare and bringing to justice these Asian gangs thought it was far more important not be seen as racist. As I write these words, I am incandescent with rage that this is happening in Britain. How can it be that those alleged public servants paid vast sums and provided with lavish pensions to protect the vulnerable  could so blatantly prioritise issues of race above dealing with the unspeakable crimes detailed in the report? Already the sound of wriggling off the multiple hooks in the report can be heard. True, the leader of Rotherham Council has resigned, and true Ms Jay says there have been recent improvements in children’s safeguarding. But elsewhere, the signs are that former children’s minister Tim Loughton’s demand that everyone involved in this horrendous scandal should resign are being ignored. With total brass neck effrontery, the police commissioner involved has apologised it happened on his watch, but says he will carry on. And on past form he will. It was Rotherham Council, let us not forget, which in 2012 became embroiled in another major scandal centred on racism, when its social services department decided that two perfectly loving and qualified adults could not continue to provide foster care for Eastern European children because they were members of UKIP. The woman at the centre of that scandal was Joyce Thacker, Rotherham’s strategic director of children’s and young people’s services. Back then, she defended the decision. Her position was that anyone opposed to uncontrolled Eastern European immigration could not be a loving parent. Two years on, she is still in post, and now there is irrefutable evidence from the Jay report that the decision was not taken in isolation – those responsible for children’s services and protection in Rotherham (they are listed on p38-9 of the Safeguarding Board’s annual report) –  seemingly put fears about being branded racist ahead of  the wellbeing of children. Multiculturalism was the mantra of New Labour when it was elected in 1997, the year when this catalogue of abuse began. What’s massively clear from its pages – and the lesson we must all now digest – is that this creed of political correctness has introduced a vicious cancer into our public institutions and into the mindset of our public servants. Yes, racism is a poison. But the pursuit of multiculturalism leads to consequences that are far, far worse.",The Conservative Woman,2025-01-05T01:18:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-multiculturalism-slays-rotherhams-young-girls/
Fraser Nelson turns a blind eye to broken Britain,"IN WHAT I can only assume was a final act of revenge on theTelegraphbefore moving to theTimes,Fraser Nelson served up one of the worst pieces written by any journalist anywhere on Planet Earth in 2024. This includes Justine McCarthy and Fintan O’Toole at theIrish Times. On Boxing Day or St Stephen’s Day, depending on which side of the Irish Sea you are reading this, Nelson gave us this gem: ‘Britain’s integration miracle is a beacon of hope amid instability. Keir Starmer talks doom and gloom, but this is an amazing country – never more so than now.’ If that headline left you dreading what was to come, your instincts were correct. Nelson informs us: ‘For decades, the British Crime Survey has gauged how many crimes have taken place, reported or not. It shows assault and neighbourhood crime down by 50 per cent over 15 years, bicycle theft down by 60 per cent over 15 years and criminal damage down by 75 per cent. Some crimes (snatch thefts,knife crimes)are rising, but in the context of a stunning overall decline. Our immigrant population has almost doubled while our crime rate has halved.’ (My emphasis.) I don’t think there is a single person in Britain who believes the streets are safer. Not a single one. Knife crime is indeed on the increase although Fraser Nelson seems to skip over this fact. Also, which would you prefer, a decrease in bicycle theft or an increase in knife crime? Would you prefer criminal damage (a minor offence against property) to decrease but knife crime increase? No, of course not. Most people would like to see knife crime decrease but it has been increasing in Britain. Much hangs on that termknife crime. It can include anything from murder with a knife, manslaughter to stabbing in the form of either GBH or ABH. In the year that saw the son of Rwandan immigrants accused of stabbing to death three schoolgirls in Southport (not the Welsh Christian choirboy the media first went with) I don’t know how anyone could write that Britain has seen an ‘integration miracle’. Sure ‘knife crime’ has increased, just ask the parents of Bebe King, aged six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, who never made it to Christmas 2024 ‘because of integration’ or something. In fact, on Christmas Day itself two women were stabbed to death. TheTimesreported: ‘A man has appeared in court charged with two counts of murder after two women died on Christmas Day following a knife attack. Jazwell Brown, 49, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, appeared at High Wycombe magistrates’ court on Saturday. Joanne Pearson, 38, and Teohna Grant, 24, died after an altercation at a flat in Bletchley.Both women were from Milton Keynes.’ Somehow, after a year that saw the torture and killing of ten-year-old Sara Sharif at the hands of her Pakistani father, Fraser Nelson was able to type the following: ‘But we seem to have attracted immigrants who, by and large, are prone to integrate and strengthen the social fabric. The secret sauce is our concept of Britishness, which is not about ethnicity or religion but a way of life with global appeal. It’s a set of values that anyone can adopt.’ A set of values that includes a two-tier criminal justice system that is very accommodating to certain groups of criminals.Just ask the girls of Rochdale or the mother of Sara Sharif. Then we had this: ‘This is not to deny the existence of serious problems, or jihadist nutcases. But the British experience is defined by smaller, less spectacular things that seldom make the news. A reminder came on Christmas Day, when Liverpool FC’s Mohamed Salah, perhaps the best footballer in the Premier League, posted a picture of his family in matching pyjamas under a Christmas tree. He does this every year: to annoy the trolls who fume that, as an observant Muslim and captain of Egypt’s national team, he should not be joining Yuletide festivities. As his picture gently shows, such petty sectarianism is just not the British way.’ So, all is OK in Blighty. There is no issue with Islamic extremism. Proof of this is some millionaire Muslim footballer who likes to put the whole family in Christmas-themed jim-jams. So, those who have an issue with acid attacks, slaughtered schoolgirls, or tortured ten-year-olds are the deluded ones. Not the journalist who writes this kind of stuff. Nelson continues: ‘To understand the long-term prospects of a country, look at its birth rates. Italy has just recorded its lowest ever . . . Britain is the only major European country not heading for a working-age population decline.’ Now this sentence is another way of cooking the books. Britain has experienced a fertility crash the same as the rest of Europe, concealed only by immigration. Let’s look at Britain’s birth rates. They have been below replacement level for years and 2024 saw births outstripped by deaths for the first time in 50 years.Go on though, Fraser, tell me again about the cause for optimism. The underlying assumption seems to be that we can just import more workers, who somehow stay forever young and never get old themselves. It’s a plan, not a very good one, but a plan. Nelson then talks about the lack of far-right groups in Britain (someone should inform Starmer of that) and finishes with: ‘This is an amazing country – never more so than now. It may be an act of defiance to say it in this era of Starmer miserabilism, but we really do have more reasons than ever to wish each other a Happy New Year.’ Look, I understand if you have had too much port over Christmas and you are writing your final column for a paper which has done doom and gloom better than any all year. Sure, you want to end on a high, but the truth is that Britainwasan amazing country;it was until the governing elites, including Conservative governments, trashed it with out-of-control immigration numbers. Tory governments also permitted woke beliefs to infect every institution that matters including the police, and oversaw a collapse in law and order and the rise of a two-tier criminal justice system. The tax burden is the highest it has been since the war. Yes, it was a great country, I enjoyed living there for 20 years but some of the above is the reason why I moved the whole family back to Ireland over a year ago.The decline has been hard to watch. What annoys me about Fraser Nelson’s article is that he is conservative royalty. He is part of the conservative media establishment in the UK. If he doesn’t speak up for the ordinary British man and woman who are not on board with the elite trashing of their country, defeat is inevitable. Journalists such as Nelson should be speaking up and defending the unique cultural character of Britain. Sure, immigrants can integrate but the scale of immigration in recent years will make this next to impossible and many have utterly failed to integrate. Media elites in the UK who declare that there is nothing to see here other than some footballer wearing a very fetching pair of pyjamas is not just bad journalism, it is an insult to those who have seen their country given away and have no power to stop it. It is a betrayal. Badly done by Fraser Nelson, badly done.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-30T01:21:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/nelson-turns-a-blind-eye-to-broken-britain/
Major study confirms covid jab harms mental health,"A STUDY of millions of citizens shows that covid vaccination ‘significantly increased’ the risks for depression, anxiety, various stress disorders and sleep problems. The same study showed the vaccinations ‘significantly decreased’ the risk for developing bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Two South Koreanuniversities randomly selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (KNHIS) claims database more than two million (2,154,189) Seoul citizens aged 20 and older who had received two doses of covid vaccines, and 350,983 unvaccinated subjects. Researchers excluded any with a history of schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, dissociative, stress related, somatoform (SSD) or psychosomatic disorders (these are mental health conditions where people experience physical symptoms in response to psychological distress), sleep, eating and sexual disorders. This meant excluding almost half a million in the vaccinated group (435,390) and 42,629 in the unvaccinated group. The final number was 1,718,999 vaccinated subjects and 308,354 non-vaccinated subjects. Post covid infection mental health issues had been studied extensively but not post covid vaccination mental adverse events. This study redressed the balance, and the researchers concluded: ‘Our population-based cohort study provides robust evidence for psychiatric adverse events (AEs) after covid-19 vaccinations. Furthermore, our study provided risks of psychiatric AEs according to vaccine type, revealing that the psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders) with increased risks due to covid-19 vaccination showed the highest risk in the case of heterogeneous vaccination.’ Heterogenous vaccination means a combination of vaccine types, for example Pfizer combined with AstraZeneca. Study flowchart The results were published in the respected journalNatureand produced by scientists from Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital and Ewha Womans University Hospital. Scientists assessed 10,000 psychiatric adverse events over one and two weeks, then at one month and three months, and concluded that: ‘Covid-19 vaccination increased the risks of depression, anxiety, dissociative, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, and sleep disorders while reducing the incidence and risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.’ It had no effect on sexual disorders or eating disorders, they said. They added: ‘Our findings suggested that the relationship between covid-19 vaccination and mental illness may be underestimated along with the complexity of its impact on mental health.’ The paper contained no case studies but there are many published, like this one from Indian scientists at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. A pro-vaccine, 18-year-old female student with no history of psychiatric problems, physical illness or substance abuse, and no family history of mental illness, was taken to accident and emergency (A&E) after reacting to her covid vaccination. Family members described her behaviour as bizarre and her conversation confused. Within three hours of receiving a Covishield, India’s version of the AstraZeneca vaccination, she developed a high fever and diarrhoea. Neither improved with medication. She then became dizzy and disorientated and fell. Her fever subsided the following day, but she developed anxiety, insomnia and petit-mal seizures where she would stare into space. Over the next four days she was irritable, incoherent, and suffered delusions – she felt persecuted and experienced hallucinations with gods and demons. She tried to run away from home. At their wits end, her family took her back to A&E. Before being vaccinated, she had no history of seizures, delusions or depression and was on no medication. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and had not had covid. Doctors gave her a battery of blood and urine tests that showed no abnormalities or provided any other explanation for her sudden-onset mental health issues. A 31-year-old Hispanic male who worked as an office manager, was studied by scientists at Stony Brook University, New York. He had no history of mental illness or physical illness but was taken to A&E by police, exhibiting ‘erratic and bizarre behaviour’. He told nursing staff he was clairvoyant, was talking to dead people and could hear people drumming outside his house. He also heard the constant voice of a co-worker who he believed was his girlfriend although in reality, he was not in a relationship with her. He presented as anxious and guarded and was described by medical staff as ‘superficial and grandiose.’ His symptoms began after receiving his first mRNA covid-19 vaccine and worsened after his second dose.Both patients are said to have recovered after treatment. Psychosis has been reported after existing vaccines like rabies, yellow fever, smallpox, typhoid and flu. The award-winning BBC foreign correspondentMalcolm Brabantwas in his fifties when he described how he descended into madness after a routine yellow fever vaccine in 2011. He became unwell within hours of receiving the jab and said he endured ‘two years of unimaginable mental torment’ – he was unrecognisable to his family and friends. He heard voices urging him to kill, believed he was the Messiah come to save the world while at the same time believing he was Lucifer. He was convinced that dead relatives urged him to drink his urine or eat his own excrement or brush his teeth with a lavatory brush. He recovered after several years but not before he was given electroconvulsive therapy and attempted suicide. Sanofi-Pasteur manufactured the yellow fever vaccine he received and although admit to reports of side-effects including mental disorders, said they were ‘rare’ and unlikely to have caused Brabant’s psychosis. What mechanism can cause mental health issues to appear post-vaccination? There is limited data, but reports indicate that mental health issues could be caused by autoimmune encephalitis – inflammation of the brain caused by the body’s immune system attacking healthy brain cells. The Stony Brook University researchers said that the disease covid-19 was also linked with psychotic symptoms and that 42 cases had been reported by January 2021. They hypothesised that covid-19 triggered a powerful immune response which resulted in a cytokine storm that could increase the risk of psychosis. University of Oxfordresearchers produced the graph below illustrating the increase in mental health outcomes after covid infection. Their study, also published inNature,said that the unvaccinated had an increased risk of developing psychosis rather than a decreased risk. Fear was a huge factor during covid, and the Indian researchers recognised that lockdowns, social distancing, financial insecurity, the fear of getting infected and future uncertainty, contributed to mental health issues. There is no doubt that existing conditions like anxiety, depression, grief, obsessive compulsive disorder, and psychosis worsened as the psyops surrounding the pandemic increased. However, pandemic onset mental health issues should largely have resolved in the vaccinated who would have been relieved they were protected and looked forward to ‘getting back to normal’. Those who were vaccinated were sure that vaccines were the answer to their problems and would not be the cause of new ones. For that reason alone, the South Korean study is compelling. It showed that mental health issues increased in the vaccinated, rather than decreased as would be expected. It also showed that the unvaccinated, despite being branded granny killers and refuseniks, and under intense psyop pressure to conform, did not develop the same mental health issues.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-16T09:18:30+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/major-study-confirms-covid-jab-harms-mental-health/
"Why was Sara’s sadistic, murderous father not stopped? We all know why","MR Justice Cavanagh excused the jury inthe Sara Sharif murder trialfrom further jury service for life. This isn’t a regular occurrence. He did so because of the horrific evidence that they had to hear during the eight-week trial.The judge told the jury: ‘I know a murder trial is always stressful and traumatic but this case almost above any other has been extremely stressful and traumatic. You have performed your duty magnificently. I’m acutely aware the evidence you had to sit through has been very distressing and you wouldn’t be human if you didn’t find it upsetting.’ Yesterday Mr Justic Cavanagh jailed Sara’s 43-year-old father Urfan Sharif for a minimum of 40 years and her stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, for 33 years for the ten-year-old’s murder. Sharif’s brother Faisal Malik, 29, who was found guilty of causing or allowing Sara’s death was sentenced to 16 years. What you must understand about the tragedy of Sara is not just that she was murdered in the most brutal and sadistic fashion possible. She was also tortured for her short life before her evil father finally ended her time on earth. In a trial of many horrifying details, surely this admission by Urfan Sharif in the witness box was the worst. Something that if you were a juror would stay with you until the end of your days. ‘In a shocking admission to the court which left jurors open-mouthed, Sharif admitted to throttling her with his bare hands and battering her with a cricket bat, metal pole and mobile phone,even whacking her in the stomach as she lay dying.’ If you saw someone do this to a dog, you would rightly conclude they were monsters. Now imagine doing it to a ten-year-old girl. This was the final sadistic assault on Sara at home in Woking, Surrey, by the person who was supposed to protect her. ‘The schoolgirl suffered dozens of serious wounds including human bite marks and iron burns, as well as multiple fractures and a traumatic brain injury.’ There will be the usual reviews and inquiries. But let’s cut to the chase. This time it wasn’t the fault of the social workerswho from my reading of things intervened and raised alarms time and again. The police were involved, social services were involved, teachers made complaints. And every single one was ignored. The problem was no one with any actual power was willing to stand up to Urfan Sharif. There were two critical points in the short life of Sara Sharif where if different decisions were made, this little girl might not have been tortured to death. The first goes back to before she was born. ‘The local authority brought care proceedings for the children seven days before Sara was born. In a case summary of care proceedings, solicitors for Surrey County council said social workers had concerns regarding the care provided by Sharif and [Sara’s mother, Olga] Domin and that children were not adequately supervised.’ After her birth, Sara spent a week with her mother in hospital before being taken into foster care. She was made subject to a child protection plan. Her parents were allowed to see her three times a week. Urfan Sharif had already been arrested on suspicion of attacking three women including Olga Domin, as well as hitting and biting two children. Police stated there was not enough evidence to charge Sharif despite each woman’s similar claims. At the hearing just after Sara was born a report to the family court concluded: ‘Whilst the guardian is satisfied that there may be reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm . . . the advantages of the children remaining at home should [be] weighed against the potential harm to the children of removal, particularly to Sara as a newborn child, before we have a full assessment and understanding of these children and their parents’ ability to meet their individual needs.’ The guardian is an independent person appointed by the court to give advice. This person found that the test to remove a child, namely that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the children are likely to suffer significant harm, was fulfilled. But then they go on to hedge their bets and talk of the potential harm of removing Sara as a newborn. What absolute nonsense is this? The family were already known to the authorities for violence including serious domestic abuse. The advantages to Sara in remaining in that family were that she was tortured for ten years and then brutally murdered by her father and stepmother. What is more infuriating is that newborn babies are the easiest ones to place for adoption – couples want them. But no, the family court left her in the care of her mother and sadistic father. The worst decision was yet to come. The father and mother separated and now Urfan Sharif was with Beinash Batool. Asthe Telegraph reports:‘The Family Court gave Sara Sharif’s killer father shared custody of his daughter despite knowing he had been accused of abusing her siblings for years. In October 2019, almost four years before Sara was killed, the couple had been awarded shared custody of her by the Family Court. ‘Sara’s mother, who has learning difficulties, had given her consent for the children to be looked after by Batool and Sharif. Allegations of abuse and neglect had been made against both Ms Domin and Sharif at the time. This decision amounted to the death sentence of Sara Sharif.’ Or asthe Times reports,after a history of allegations of abuse being made, ‘Sharif applies to Guildford family court for custody of Sara. Sara had made a claim of abuse by Domin and Surrey council supported returning her to her father. Sharif is given custody of Sara.’ And that was that. I hope that the family judge has a very happy Christmas indeed. I understand it can be hard to keep up, between the child protection plans, and the allegations of domestic violence, and the allegation of abuse by three different women against Urfan Sharif, and the allegations of burning children. For instance, in 2015 there was the following allegation. ‘Sharif is reported to social services for waving a knife around at home in what he says was a “zombie” game. Social workers note that Sharif hit and kicked Domin at home and the pair threaten to kill each other.’ Do not be confused between this hearing at that family court, and the test to be satisfied, and who said what about whom. Let’s just keep this simple. If Urfan Sharif was called John Smith or Gregg Wallace and had this kind of history, I do not believe he would have been awarded custody of his daughter Sara in 2019. But because his name is Urfan Sharif he can do whatever the hell he wants, especially to women and children, and no one says stop. Other women, such as social workers or teachers, might try to stop him, but they are ignored. These men from Pakistan come over to Britain on a nonsense study visa or work visa or whatever it is,and they do whatever the hell they like. They can rape their way through Rotherham and Oxford, and no one says stop. They can traffic working-class white girls and rape them for years on end and no one says stop. They can threaten to set them on fire, or lock them in cages, and it will take years for the police to take action. Years. And they can import their first cousin from their village in Pakistan to marry them, and that’s fine too. There’s no push-back until now, and when a scientist conducts research into how damaging cousin-marriage is, it gets memory-holed. We all know why Sara Sharif, trapped in the family home after a family court judge awarded her abusive and sadistic father custody of her tiny body, ‘was the victim of repeated beatings and scaldings, forced to leave school and carry out laundry chores for her stepmother while wearing a hijab to obscure her growing number of bruises and wounds’. We all know why ‘a post-mortem examination revealed the horrific nature of Sara’s death. Sara had endured 71 recent injuries, which included bleeding on her brain, multiple bruises on her lungs, a rare broken hyoid bone in her neck, and a large area of ulceration across her buttocks from an iron burn. Human bite marks were present across her body, with the evidence indicating that she had been hooded, beaten and restrained while scalding water had been poured over her ankles.’ This happened because Diversity is our Strength. We would not want to upset the multi-culti apple cart, would we? Wouldn’t want to point out that there can be vast cultural differences between immigrants. That would be racist. Even writing this might make me a Far-Right Thug.Remember it is much more important to sentence English grandfathers to entirely disproportionate sentences for Far-Right Thuggery than it is to charge and jail domestic abusers from Pakistan. Domestic abusers who treat women like trash. I don’t know about you but I really have had enough of this Diversity is our Strength derangement syndrome. I’d settle for the basic principle that everyone is equal before the law, so that if you are accused of extremely serious offences, you are charged and tried, not awarded custody of your daughter who you go on to torture and murder. So, TCW reader, save yourself the hassle of reading the case review: I can tell you what will be in it. Chances missed. He was clever and manipulative. Blah blah blah. You know why Urfan Sharif got away with it for so long. I know why he got away with it for so long. And so do those who had multiple chances to save Sara Sharif from a life and death of unrelenting cruelty, barbarity and sadism. Shame on them. Sara Sharif. Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon her. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace.Amen. (By the way, for the hard of learning, do not bother telling me I never write on white child murders as nothing could be further from the truth. I wrote about those twohereandhere. But we are stuck with our native child killers. So I don’t see why we have to import more.)",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:22:00+00:00,Democracy in Decay,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-was-saras-sadistic-murderous-father-not-stopped-we-all-know-why/
Stories from the illegal migrant frontline,"DESPITE what this inept and impotent Labour government will tell you, illegal economic migrants (to describe them as ‘irregular’ is a total misnomer, since they ‘regularly’ arrive here) continue to enter the UK via the Kent, Sussex and Essex coast. Meanwhile, as the Tories did before, the Labour government continue to lie about and obfuscate the actual figures arriving. Yes, they are head counting those being disembarked at Dover docks. But they are not, however, acknowledging the regular sightings by locals on the Kent coast of those coming in by the ‘back door’. Many people think illegal landings occur only by ‘water taxi’, via the RNLI and Border Force, but this is a fallacy. Dinghy-loads of illegal migrant men are regularly seen around Dungeness in Kent, and on other stretches of the 440 miles of Kent and Sussex coastline, much of which is remote. And yet these invaders (let’s call them what they are, for they will attempt if possible to come in under the radar, and they also dispose of their identity papers whilst crossing) have the effrontery to enter quite openly, even near to the houses that dot the coast. They then proceed to run across gardens and fields, many to pre-arranged (by GPS) waiting vehicles, usually driven by ‘associates’ already installed here. Dungeness, where in recent years I have taken many photos of illegal migrant landings, is an amazing area comprising 12 square miles of deserted cuspate foreland – the open country around it affording cover and a good escape route for migrants entering by this back door. Landings by lifeboat here have become infrequent; stopped by the authorities in 2023 because of the presence of a number of citizens and freelance and Press Association journalists. The inept Tory government didn’t want them recorded. Nowadays, these occur only in extenuating circumstances, for example if someone on board is suffering from hypothermia, Dungeness being the nearest landfall for an ambulance. The fact, however, that it is a beach and Crown Property has meant people line  me could carry on legally filming theunaccompaniedlandings of non-taxied individuals coming ashore illegally. On these occasions, often overnight or in the early hours of the morning, most present were local people, like me. A number of us have access to marine traffic apps and gadgetry that can monitor transponder messages between lifeboats and Border Force, and so we knew when a landing was imminent. we have watched how, without the aid of Border Force or the RNLI, these illegals arriving by stealth and disappear unmonitored into the Kent and Sussex landscapes. It is a recurring problem – their dinghies float back into the Channel on the outgoing tide, causing danger and nuisance to other Channel traffic. Besides being a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Dungeness is home to a large power station in the process of being decommissioned, an airport, and an Army firing range – three obviously major security risks, all of them having been compromised in the past. For example, during a raid on the airport in August 2023‘crucial evidence about people-smuggling operations in the Channel was stolen’. Back in October 2020 at nearby Lydd Ranges a powerful nine-metre speedboat made landfall on the MoD beach in the middle of a target-practice session,which had to be halted. The following photographs, all taken by me, depict the general demeanour of migrant men when they arrive in the ‘Land of Plenty’, clad in their designer gear and armed with new mobile phones and new SIM cards programmed with lists of freebies available to them – and where to get them! You will notice in these images a distinct lack of women and children, although we do see them occasionally; the children are often screaming in fear, and I witnessed one particular horror of a toddler who came in on a lifeboat full of men, none of whom were related to him – his screams and the terror on his little face will live with me forever. Take time to look closely at these pictures – I leave it to you to decide whether these individuals are from war-torn or famine-stricken countries – also whether they deserve to be fed, clothed and housed by the British taxpayer whilst our elderly freeze in their homes and ex-servicemen lay their heads for the night in shop doorways. August 2022 This is of Katie Sweetingham, a Care4Calais volunteer handing out bulk-bought tracksuits to the new arrivals, who are mostly clad in designer clothing from North Face, Gucci and Prada. Sheonce told a French newspaper, ‘Obviously, it’s my priority to supervise them even before their arrival, to make them disappear from the sight of citizens and the media.’ (use Google Translate) August 2022 A French SIM-card frame discarded by a migrant. Supplied by charities in Calais with new SIM cards, pre-programmed with details of where to get benefits (and often new phones), migrants discard old SIM cards overboard during crossings, along with old smartphones, because they are likely to contain incriminating information about their journeys. Some wash up on the shore. March 2020 The sparse landscape of Dungeness with the power station and old lighthouse in the distance, perfect landmarks for those wishing to enter ‘under the radar’. Dungeness is about 21 miles from Cap Gris-Nez in Northern France. October 2023 An arrival at Dungeness showing all-male passengers. October 2023 A young girl (employed by a security company) passes by, provoking a reaction from the all-male illegal incomers. On this particular day only she, another girl colleague and one man were present. There were no police there to make arrests. The two girls were instructed to go to the men and ask them if they were carrying knives, scissors, or other weapons. I witnessed this. October 2023 Smiling faces of men safe in the expectation of warm beds and three meals a day plus extra spending money. No sign of destitution, hunger, or illness – and no sign of the gratitude or humility shown by genuine refugees – which refugees should surely include women and children. October 2023 As early as 2019 these posters had become evident around the area, although they are not seen so much now, despite the coast still being an open target for illegal incomers. Around 4.30am in June 2022 The boat has to be trailered up the sloping beach as the tide is out. May 2022: This is a landing in the early hours. This time children were evident. Highly dangerous by day and worse by night in poor visibility, given large vessels are active around the clock. Recently a two-year-old was trampled to death in a dinghy during a night crossing. Several children have died during crossings – possibly some we don’t know about. May 2022 The illegal migrants are shown here in their waterproofs (which I believe are reused) issued – I was told by a Border Force officer – by the government. Even before the migrants set foot on dry land, this whole exercise has cost thousands of pounds and, sometimes, lives. October 2023: Migrant men, arrogance evident on their faces, as they pass me to board the air-conditioned coach hired to ferry them to the processing centre and thence to hotel accommodation. I am not sure what the gesture on the right means, but they have been seen giving the one-fingered ISIS salute.

The climate scaremongers: Met Office fiddles the figures over Storm Darragh,"THE Met Office is gaslighting us. Last weekend Storm Darragh swept through the country, the Met Office leading the charge with the headline‘Storm Darragh brings 90mph gusts and heavy rain’. The media faithfully followed suit with similarly apocalyptic claims, which probably came as a surprise to most people who thought it was just a typical spell of wet and windy weather. After all, winds that strong are truly exceptional, the sort that swept across large swathes of the country during the Burns Day storm in 1990. So where did these 90mph winds actually occur? The Met Office were quick to tell us!  What the Met Office forgot to tell you was that all of these are in extremely exposed locations, and are far from typical of the country at large. Berry Head, for instance, is on the top of cliffs near Brixham, Devon, next to a lighthouse station and on an Iron Age hilltop fort. Capel Curig is high in the middle of Snowdonia, and Aberdaron is on another clifftop on the Llyn Peninsula. If you want representative wind speeds, you certainly don’t measure them in places like these, any more than you would use the temperature on the Centre Court of Wimbledon. In meteorological terms, they are meaningless. Their only purpose is to generate headlines. And sure enough, wind speeds in places where people actually live were considerably lower. At Exeter Airport, for instance, just along the coast from Berry Head, gusts reached 58mph at most. In Rhyl, the area where the storm hit hardest, winds hit 60mph. Very windy, yes – but no more than the sort of weather we get every winter. To put Storm Darragh into perspective, Aberdaron holds the record for gusts in North Wales – 112mph in 1997. Darragh by contrast brought winds of 92mph there. If you check back through the Met Office archives, you can see that they never used to report on exposed locations such as these when reporting the weather. They knew that wind speeds there had no relevance. Indeed, it cannot be pure coincidence that their weather stations at Berry Head, Capel Curig, Aberdaron and Pembrey Sands were all opened in 1993. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that these and others, such as the Needles on the Isle of Wight, were introduced around this time to inflate wind speeds for purposes of propaganda. We know that in recent years the Met Office has been busy setting up new temperature stations which are so poorly sited that they can read up to 5C too high. The transparent purpose is to be able to advertise higher temperatures. It is also now equally apparent that they are misrepresenting wind speeds for reasons of propaganda as well. There is a serious side to all this. In the past, people accepted that weather like this was normal. As a consequence, they were prepared and took sensible precautions when a storm was on its way. Nowadays, many have been conditioned to believe that the gales seen this week are exceptional. As a result, they are unprepared and panic. Stormy weather 100 years ago WITHOUT wishing to labour the point, it is no coincidence that we had the same bad weather exactly 100 years ago, as the Met Office’s Monthly Weather Report for December 1924 reveals. (They used to be called ‘Weather Reports’, but in 2001 the Met Office started calling them ‘Monthly Climate Summaries’, proving that they don’t understand the difference between WEATHER and CLIMATE!) You could of course look up virtually any year and you would find windy weather like this at some time in winter.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-13T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-met-office-fiddles-the-figures-over-storm-darragh/
Electric armoured vehicles? Net zero chance of that,"THERE have been several noises in the recent past about ‘decarbonising’ warfare. For instance, in 2021 the then chief of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston,set a target for British military aircraft to hit net-zero carbon by 2040. Another example is the plan set out in 2020 by the US military to have electric armoured vehicles, reported inPopular Mechanics under the heading ‘The Electric Vehicle Revolution Is Finally Hitting the US Army’. Now it is reported that in the UK‘Ministers are forging ahead with plans to use electric vehicles (EVs) for combat on the battlefield despite warnings from military grandees that they could put the Armed Forces at risk’. Let’s take a look at the facts of the matter. First, aChallenger 2 tank weighs 64 tonnes and carries around 1,600 litres of fuel (16 MWh energy) weighing 1.3 tonnes and is expected to have a range of 300 miles. As a rough guide, let us use theTesla S long-range car: 2,100 kg weight, 100 kWh/544 Kg battery pack and a 300 miles range. By extrapolation, the Challenger tank will need a 3 MWh (64*0.1/2.1) battery weighing 17 tonnes. A Tesla Supercharger at 250 kW will take 12 hours to charge it. Anyway, where and how will it be charged in a combat zone?! Similarly, alight armoured vehicle (L-ATV) weighs 4,667 kg, with a range of 300 miles and has dimensions of 6.2m length, 2.5m width. Again, compared with the Tesla S, the L-ATV will need a battery of at least 220 kWh (100*4667/2100) capacity. Under ‘peak sun’,modern solar panels can produce 300 W per square metre. So, if the L-ATV has to be charged by solar energy, it has to be parked under ‘peak sun’ for about 48 hours to charge the battery, even if its entire top surface is covered by solar panels (220/[0.3 × 6.2 × 2.5]). It is also to be hoped that no rocks will be thrown at it by miscreants on the battlefield! Themaximum take-off weight (MTOW) of a Eurofighter (Typhoon) aircraft is 21,000 kg and it carries 4,000 kg of fuel with an energy content of 49 MWh. A battery pack with the same energy content would weigh around 13 times the MTOW of the aircraft, assuming a battery pack energy density of 5.44 kg/kWh, taking Tesla S as the guide. It is to be remembered that there are hardly any efficiency gains from running jet engines on batteries. It should be obvious that using electric vehicles for combat on the battlefield is a very silly idea. The reason appears to be that the government has pledged to put net zero goals at the centre of its defence industrial strategy. Astonishingly, a government source has said that ‘new and emerging technologies can support decarbonisation efforts and improve battlefield capability, reducing the supply chain vulnerability of liquid fuel and also reducing the heat signature and noise of vehicles on the battlefield’. Never mind that it will clearly erode battlefield capability and increase supply chain vulnerability. For instance, will an adequate charging infrastructure be first established in the field before any battle is fought? People with common sense in the military have already called it a‘crazy endeavour’and recognise this as nothing more than virtue signalling by the MoD. It is a pity a lot of money will be wasted on such idiotic ideas in pursuit of ‘net zero’.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-18T01:59:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/electric-armoured-vehicles-net-zero-chance-of-that/
War on Microbes: The murky agenda behind the covid ‘pandemic’,"THE biodefense mafia don’t really care whether zoonosis (a disease passed from animals to humans) or a lab leak was to blame for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They just want you to believe there was a pandemic and restrict causation to one of those two options. It’s a false binary. Either explanation is a win for them because what they’re really doing is setting an elephant trap. The objective is to perpetuate the ‘War on Microbes’, a taxpayer-subsidised pharma racket in which finding or inventing viruses in order pre-emptively to invent countermeasure vaccines can continue ad infinitum. Either excuse serves their purpose. On December 4, 2024, the House of Representatives sub-committee on the Coronavirus Pandemicreleased a 557-page report, ‘After-Action Review on the Covid-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and a Path Forward’. Its finding? ‘A lab leak is the most likely origin scenario, that the Chinese Communist Party was conducting dangerous research, and this type of dangerous research was notionally supported by the NIH [US National Institutes of Health],’ said Chairman Brad Wenstrup. The conclusion was perhaps no surprise as Wenstrup, a podiatrist and US Army reservist who served in Iraq in 2005, was in 2021 amongst the first outside Dr Robert Kadlec’s biodefense clique to push for a lab leak investigation. What the US now euphemistically calls ‘gain of function’ work used to be called bioweapons research. Kadlec invoked the right for the US to do it in 2003, justifying it as defensive threat detection work.  However for the countermeasure part to be legal under international law, it needs an illegal act by another state to respond to, so someone else needs to be doing it too. Funding Chinese government research into zoonotic viruses is perhaps a second elephant trap as it sets up future scapegoats. For the pharma companies it’s a win-win too. The US War on Microbes business model calls for outsourcing of vaccine development projects to private companies whose development costs are completely underwritten by the government, whose own researchers get a small kickback in the form of royalty payments while Pharma gets to keep most of the profits from the commercialised product. It’s a merger of state and corporate interests. Left to a free enterprise model, we wouldn’t be where we are because there is no viable commercial market for these War on Microbes vaccines. News coverage on the committee report has largely focused on speculation that perjury charges could be brought against former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) chief Dr Anthony Fauci and some of his subordinates who the Committee believed gave misleading testimony. Dr Peter Daszak, the Chief Executive of EcoHealth Alliance, who were the conduit for US funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for the bat coronavirus research the committee believes caused the pandemic, was accused of obstructing the committee’s work. It wants them barred from receiving any future US government funding. Charges against Daszak and Fauci would be popular as there is an appetite for bringing someone to account. The prospect of perjury investigations and criminal charges or government funding bans stirs up waters already muddied by Dr Kadlec himself through his Senate Investigation. It doesn’t matter if aerosolised bioweapons really work or if biodefense spending is necessary,all that our very own Colonel Jack D Ripper wantsis for there to be a widespread belief that human bodily fluids can be polluted by viruses so that the firehose of Manhattan Project for Biodefense funding to his corporate chums continues without interruption. The biodefense mafia are playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. So to anyone wise to the elephant trap, the House sub-committee report which affirms the need to ‘Predict, Prepare, Protect, Prevent’ makes depressing reading. It’s a prescription for more of the same. Wenstrup and his committee believe that pandemics will continue to be recurring events, that Covid-19 was ‘novel’, that it emerged from a Chinese lab and killed millions, that Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute vaccines was a tremendous success which should be repeated in the future and finally that there was a cover-up which involved Chinese and American officials. First of all, at least five years of planning went into bringing us the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or rather the Manhattan Project for Biodefense. It began outside government as a response to the October 2014 US government funding pause on gain-of-function research on SARS and MERS coronaviruses and influenza viruses. Dr Kadlec, the architect of 21stcentury US biodefense policy, was the key driver of this plan. In a2009 interview published in the journalBiosecurity and Bioterrorismhe explained his preoccupation with stopping exotic pandemics, saying: ‘The view I have is deeply rooted in the military, but medical in nature.’ Within a month of the gain-of-function research moratorium which was an existential threat to Kadlec’s threat detection-based rationale for funding gain-of function research and vaccine countermeasure development projects, Kadlec organised a biodefense study breakfast in Washington DC. ByDecember 8 he had set up his Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefensewhose report was the basis for President Trump’s 2018 Biodefense Policy. Kadlec was also chair of the National Academies Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness to Catastrophic Events, organisers of a March 2015 workshop onEnabling Rapid Response and Sustained Capability Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk of Emerging Infectious Diseases. It was chaired by his old friend Dr Richard Hatchett, the Chief Medical Officer at BARDA (the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority). The keynote speaker was Dr Jeremy Farrar, then the newly installed director of the Wellcome Trust. Dr Daszakwas there too, on a panel discussingChallenges and Opportunities in Responding to Coronaviruses; Past and Present. The opportunity to be exploited was that coronaviruses cause the common cold, but could be made to be sound frightening enough that people might take a vaccine if one were to exist. The report published after the workshop records an unnamed person suggesting a ‘Manhattan Project for Biodefense’ was needed. By mid-2015 Farrar drafted the proposal for what was to become the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the vehicle used as a hedge against any future US domestic gain-of-function moratorium and which offshores US government biodefense vaccine projects to commercial partners. CEPI is now led by Dr Hatchett. Dr Barney Graham of the National Institute of Health and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Vaccine Research Centre, who had beenresearching the similarities between RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and SARS coronavirus since 2006, proposed the prototype pathogen approach under which research into vaccines for one virus could be rapidly repurposed into vaccines for a similar virus. SARS and MERS vaccine development research in the US went underground and under the radar as RSV vaccine research. Graham’s RSV patent was licensed to developers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 2020. On January 10, 2020, when the genome sequence for the Wuhan coronavirus was released,Dr Vincent Munster, the Chief of the National Institutes of Health’s Virus Ecology Unit,sent Dr Ralph Baric an emailabout the ‘novel’ coronavirus saying, ‘Perfect! Right between your favourite viruses :-)’ It was no surprise: it landed where he put it when he wrote the gain-of-function section of the EcoHealth Alliance’s now-notorious Defuse Proposal which the pandemic sub-committee said had been split up and funded by Fauci after DARPA declined to do so in 2018. Far safer for it to have been civilian rather than military funded. Of course the NIAID knew about the Manhattan Project for Biodefense – it issued Dr Baric with a task order (HHSN272201700036I) on September 15, 2019 to assess the efficacy of candidate coronavirus vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in mouse models. That’s how it happened that Dr Baric was sent the Moderna NIAID jointly-owned mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates on December 16, 2019 before anyone was aware of a Wuhan flu. No one on the sub-committee questioned him about this. Dr Kadlec, the Assistant Secretary of Response (ASPR) who ran the US response to SARS-CoV-2, activated the US government disaster leadership group on January 3, 2020 (source Paul Mango’s bookOperation Warp Speed), a mere three days after China notified the WHO that it had 17 cases of an unknown pneumonia. No one had died yet. DARPA then notified the research teams participating in their four-year Pandemic Prevention Project which began in February 2018 that the‘novel’ coronavirus was the next test(see last page).  And Kadlec saidhis office spent 18 months planning a joint exercisewith the Japanese Ministry of Health on how to repatriate Americans from Japan in the event of a disaster or emergency. It just happened to have been scheduled for March 2020 but was brought forward a month to evacuate theDiamond Princess. How fortuitous, or more likely, how convenient. The Committee report also ignores the important but overlooked reasons why there was such an emphasis on the SARS-CoV-2 virus being ‘novel’. The original SARS first emerged in 2002 during Gro Harlem Brundtland’s tenure as Director General of the World Health Organization.The hyperbolic press releaseclaimed it still threatened the world but had been contained in five months. The Centers for Disease Control held a patent on it. Ten years later, the purportedly deadlier Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia. Between 2013 and 2015 there were ten failed attempts to have the WHO declare a PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) over MERS.A conflict of interest declaration for the WHO Emergency Committeesays that researchers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands filed a patent on MERS coronavirus. Intellectual property rights is the first reason the 2020 virus needed to be novel. The second is to avoid the WHO Emergencies Committee declining to issue a PHEIC for an 11th time. Even so, in January 2020 WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had to ask three times before the committee obliged. Wasn’t it lucky that, as Dr Munster pointed out, a novel coronavirus that fell between a bat coronavirus and the SARS virus the CDC held a patent on emerged out of China ‘just in time’ for the mystery virus phase of DARPA’s P3 project, when ‘just in case’ coronavirus vaccines that licensed US government patents were being cooked up?",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/war-on-microbes-the-murky-agenda-behind-the-covid-pandemic/
This methane nonsense is a nasty protection racket,"DAIRY farmer Jamie Blackett was quite right to point out there ismuch nonsense written about flatulent cows and climate change. It’s a great shame he didn’t use hisTelegrapharticle to dispel it. Rather he amplified and tried to justify the nonsense, while gaslighting those who question the need to feed any synthetic enzymes to cows as promulgating ‘febrile conspiracy theories’. I expected better of him. At least he admits that he has skin in the game because he sells his milk to Arla, who announced they are going to ‘trial’, on 30 British dairy farms, feeding the synthetic enzyme inhibitor Bovaer, 3-nitrooxypropanol, to cows to reduce their methane emissions. This is but the latest aspect of the lunacy being imposed on an unwilling people to ‘tackle climate change to save the planet’. Feeding unnecessary chemicals to cows is a monstrous scam justified by the ‘drive to net zero’. It needs to be shouted from the rooftops at every opportunity that the whole wicked business has nothing to do with the climate, cows’ health or the production of milk and meat. It’s part of the greatest grab of wealth in history from the mass of ordinary people to a few stupendously rich internationalist oligarchs, aided by our own government, who aim to control – if they don’t already – the whole world. This methane-curbing nonsense is nothing more than a horribly clever protection racket, based on the fantasy of anthropogenic global warming. How is it a protection racket? Reduced to its essence, it involves farmers being forced to give the stuff to their livestock or else they will suffer the consequences of refusal. The last government (and it is vain to hope this one will be any better) was talking about making it mandatory to give the chemical to all cows by 2030. (What is the magic in 2030? Every repressive measure the state is going to impose on us has a deadline of 2030.) Let’s consider a few facts that might show this racket for what it is. First, there is no evidence that the natural emission of methane from ruminants (or decomposition of vegetation in marshes or burning oil and gas) has the slightest effect on the temperature of the earth. Methane is a trace gas which comprises roughly 0.000193 per cent of the atmosphere – about 1,930 parts perbillion.It breaks down to its constituent parts of carbon and hydrogen over an estimated 7-10 years. The other bogeyman, CO₂, without which life would not exist, is about 0.04 per cent or 430 parts per million. It’s interesting to compare the number of cattle in the US in 2024 – 87million – with the number of ruminants that grazed the grasslands of the continent before the white man got going there in the 1800s. The best estimate is that there were 60million bison, 45million antelope, 60million deer and elk, 2million bighorn sheep and a million moose. Roughly speaking, there were twice as many ruminants 250 years ago as there are cattle today. One wonders what happened to all that methane they must have created over centuries, while at the same time their grazing and dung made the plains of the Midwest some of the deepest and most fertile soils in the world. It is proposed, at least to start with, that only dairy cows in ‘zero grazing’ indoor systems are to be given this synthetic substance, because all their feed is brought to them rationed. Apparently cows that go out to pasture will not be given it – yet – because it has to be fed regularly, in measured amounts. According to DEFRA’s figures for June 2024 there were just under 5million cattle in England, of which 1.1million were dairy cows (down by about 30 per cent in 30 years). It is not clear what proportion of these was kept indoors all year round, but it is estimated that fewer than 20 per cent of dairy cows are housed permanently. The makers of this substance, a Swiss company, dsm-firmenich (they’re so woke they’ve dispensed with capital letters) claim that feeding ¼ teaspoon a day to each cow will reduce its methane emissions by 30 per cent. (Apparently the US sellers of the stuff, Elanco, recommend a tablespoon a day.) So let’s assume there are roughly 200,000 cows kept inside, in Britain, all year round and they’re all fed Bovaer; methane emissions from the national herd will be reduced by 30 per cent of 4 per cent of the national herd – that is by 1.2 per cent. It’s hard to find out exactly what this chemical will cost, but it’s somewhere between £50 and £100 per cow per year. The makers claim the cost will be reduced by half in 2025 when a new manufacturing plant in Scotland starts making the chemical. If there is no financial benefit from increased milk yield or health of the cows and there are concerns over the testing and safety of the substance, why would a farmer bother with it? And how would it be paid for? Not by selling dairy produce. Rather, farmers will become part of the ‘self-sustaining carbon inset market’. In other words, they will be sucked into a fantasy world trading in ‘carbon credits’. The amount of CO2e – a new catch-all formula for all ‘greenhouse gas emissions’ which includes methane, carbon dioxide and anything else considered to contribute to ‘global warming’ – not produced by the cows will be calculated by a third-party ‘expert’. The expert can’t measure the amount of gasnotproduced, but will verify the amount of Bovaer being fed, from which the amount of gas not being produced can be estimated and expressed in metric tonnes. This will be sold, through a company operating a ‘carbon insetting marketplace’, to big corporations to allow them to carry on as before. The money (less commission) will be paid to the farmer who has caused his cows not to produce whatever weight of gas the third-party expert certifies they aren’t producing. The rest of the cost of feeding Bovaer is expected to come from state subsidies to the farmer. Why is the government encouraging – even mandating – the feeding of this chemical to the national herd? Ah, well, apart from the endless profits for the pharmaceutical company that will undoubtedly burgeon down the years, our government has signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement and it needs every little help it can get – even making up some fanciful reduction in ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions to bring the UK closer to ‘net zero’ by 2050. Even if we accept the warmists’ claim that we have to mess about with the digestion of the world’s cows, what’s the point when saving the planet means that much of what makes life worth living will be destroyed to avoid something that might happen a century from now? It makes no sense to anyone capable of thinking. Blackett is wrong to say thateveryonewants farmers to feed this chemical to their cows to reduce their flatulence. Increasing numbers of people are waking up to the whole climate scam; the wind is changing, and judging by the public’s reaction to Arla’s announcement, causing sales of their products, particularly Lurpak and Anchor butter, to plummet, farmers would be well advised to resist this enforced medication of their cows.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-17T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-methane-nonsense-is-a-nasty-protection-racket/
Why NHS staff are shunning the vaccines,"NHS staff are boycotting covid and flu vaccinations while the government is busy promoting them to the public in a television and radio campaign. Concerned by the low uptake in the health service, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has appealed to healthcare practitioners to get jabbed. This season, only 14 per cent of NHS workers took covid jabs and only a quarter received flu vaccines. TheNHS saythis is because hospital staff are busy and have no time. Official figures tell a different story as NHS staff are taking double the days off sick post-covid vaccine rollout than they have since 2009. Unusually, in 2020, absences rocketed in the summer months; absence is traditionally low between May and November. Covid vaccines were offered to front-line staff from December 2020, a sharp rise in absences began in March 2021, three months into the rollout, when seasonal illness is traditionally waning. Sick days have doubled from the baseline of 3.75 per cent to 6.75 per cent, the highest since 2009, and have not dropped back to 2019 numbers which were between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent. Even during peak pandemic months, absences ranged between 4.75 per cent in February 2020 to 6.10 per cent in May 2020. One NHS doctor, who did not want to be named, said adverse reactions in staff and patients are contributing to ‘vaccine hesitance’. She said: ‘We have all noticed the adverse effects in our patients. Many of us have become vaccine hesitant after seeing the debilitating health issues our patients are now dealing with, and those we are dealing with ourselves. No health professional that I have spoken to wants any more boosters. ‘The type of reactions we see range from local allergic reactions to a whole switch-on of histamine systems, such as POTS and MCAS.’ Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), characterised by dizziness, is a blood circulation disorder which causes an abnormal increase in heart rate when standing up, while mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) causes allergy symptoms in multiple systems. Officially, the government recommends thecovid jabto care-home residents, all adults 65 and over, babies from six months and adults up to 64 in clinical risk groups.Fluvaccination is recommended to all ages including babies from six months. The ads fail to define these cohorts and feature the elderly, pregnant women, men, and children under 12 despite official figures showing that covid and flu pose minimal risks to them. Deaths are likely to occur in children and teenagers only if they have co-morbidities. The graph below is from the officialGreen Book, which provides the latest vaccination information to healthcare staff, and shows there have been just nine covid deaths in the six-month-to-19-year-old age ranges, and deaths only escalate in the over-60s. Every death is a tragedy, but a death caused by vaccinating a healthy individual is doubly so. Our drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says 90 per cent of adverse reactions go unreported, but even so, is busy recording stark, serious adverse event (SAE) figures. By the beginning of June this year, healthcare professionals and the public had reported nearly 3,000 deaths (2,707) related to covid vaccination since December 2020. Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and unknown brands of mono and bivalent covid vaccines have been available in the UK. MHRA summaries are culled from Yellow Card reports, last issued in the week ending June 2, 2024. Overall, 1 in 111 people injected experienced a Yellow Card adverse event (assuming one person submits only one report) while 1 in 148 people injected experienced an adverse event classified as serious; 1 in 180 reports were associated with a fatality. Over 1.5million adverse events had been reported (1,586,411) by then, involving half a million people (486,634); 75 per cent of reactions were considered serious. The MHRA defines serious as ‘life-threatening, prolonged hospitalisation, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or congenital abnormality or birth defect’. Although the AstraZeneca vaccine has been unavailable since August 2022, it accounts for the highest number of total reactions at 885,374, compared with Pfizer’s mono and bivalent jabs, 533,038. By now, most people have come into contact with covid. Those who contracted it enjoy natural immunity although the Green Book tells doctors that natural immunity wanes after one year. That is still double the immunity offered by vaccines which wanes aftersix months. In September 2020, nine months into the covid pandemic and before a vaccine was available, Oxford University issued apress releasestating that ‘researchers found that natural infections with covid-19 produced a robust T cell response, including inducing T cell memory to potentially fight future infections’. Basically, this means that T cells help the immune system protect the body from serious infection, which is what healthcare experts claim vaccines do. Oxford’s results were published in the journalNature Immunology. GPs boast a slightly higher uptake of both jabs than other healthcare professionals, but still only 23.6 per cent for covid and 42 per cent for flu, the highest uptake being in the South West of England. Doctors’ surgeries in England were confused as the Green Book omitted GPs and frontline staff as being eligible for autumn covid boosters. The confusion stemmed from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s (JCVI) decision not to continue to recommend covid vaccination for front-line health and care staff in favour of ‘local occupational health solutions’ – or managing the risk. Officialstatisticsdo not support panic and expensive, multi-million-pound ad campaigns paid for by the taxpayer. The national flu and covid-19 surveillance report for week 48, November 28, said that although ‘influenza activity increased’ it had reached only ‘low activity levels’. Covid was at ‘baseline levels’ , and remained stable, while respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was at ‘medium’ levels with increases in most age groups. RSV was practically unheard of until a vaccine was produced this year. England’s Chief Medical Officer SirChris Whittyis urging people to get their flu vaccines despite the fact that infections halved between 2022/23 and 2023/24, with no indication they will be worse in 2024/25. Meanwhile, the respected independent, non-profit organisation the Cochrane Collaboration, who analyse clinical trials for healthcare interventions, found influenza vaccination offered little benefit. There are more than 200 viruses that can cause influenza and influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Symptoms include fever, headache, joint and muscle aches and pains, cough and runny nose. Doctors cannot distinguish between influenza and ILI without laboratory tests because both last for only a few days and rarely cause serious illness or death. Cochrane’s stabilised review of 20 years’ worth of papers (stabilised meaning there is no new evidence to contradict findings) discovered that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine is oversold to all age groups and that only 2 per cent of adults get flu. Dr Tom Jefferson, lead author of the Cochrane review and Associate Tutor at Oxford University, said: ‘Influenza vaccines are about marketing and not science. We have few trials, and masses of very poor-quality observational evidence.’ After analysing 25studies conducted over a single influenza season in North America, South America and Europe, between 1969 and 2009, it found the vaccine reduced the chance of getting laboratory-confirmed influenza from 23 cases out of 1,000 (2.3 per cent) to nine cases out of 1,000 (0.9 per cent) in healthy adults. Around one per cent of people who contract covid die with it. Most who die have co-morbidities.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:21:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-nhs-staff-are-shunning-the-vaccines/
Why report the mass rape of white schoolgirls when you can pick on Gregg Wallace?,"WELL done to the insurgent group led by Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, a former al-Qaeda commander, who not only ended Bashar al-Assad’s 24-year rule over Syria but also finally removed Gregg Wallace from the front pages. Although I suspect Wallace is still generating quite a few think/opinion pieces. If you hadn’t heard of Gregg Wallace before, a greengrocer made good and a judge on the BBC’s MasterChef, you certainly will have after last week. It was revealed by our media and ‘middle-class women of a certain age’ that Wallace was allegedly a bit of a sex pest on the set. Now, I have no time for such behaviour, I am not defending it and social conservatives have no business defending it either. This is stating the obvious, which I didhere. So, one more time; women deserve to be treated with decency, respect and professionalism at work (or indeed at home). Having stated this obvious fact it is now time to state another obvious fact, namely that the media coverage about this minor workplace issue has been totally and utterly disproportionate to the wrong committed. That a story which in most workplaces would be dealt with by the ladies in Human Resources should generate the headlines it did, and in particular the ‘think pieces’, tells us once again a universal truth about Britain: some victims count, and some victims don’t.And what is glaringly obvious here is that if you are a middle-class woman of a certain age working in the media you count; if you are a white working-class teenage girl in Rotherham or Oxford you do not. You are seen as trash by the police and sacrificial victims on the altar of Diversity is our Strength by the political establishment. Therefore should you have your entire childhood stolen and your adulthood ruined because you are brutally and repeatedly raped and dehumanised by gangs of Asian/Muslim grooming men, so be it. If you are a middle-class media woman of a certain age and you are sexually harassed on the set of MasterChef, it is literally, quite literally, hold the front page. Polly Vernon was giventwo entire pagesto tell us all how she was harassed over the years at work (the stealth boast). I don’t remember a single girl of the thousands who were brutalised in English towns being given this much space to tell us their stories. And don’t bother dismissing this as ‘what-aboutery’. What about, what aboutery? What-aboutery – very much like the lectern issue I talked about before – tells you all you need to know about the media’s priorities. Not every story can make the front page or even page 10. The stories that do make the paper and the broadcast media are seen by our media to be more important than those that don’t. I am not being conspiratorial; I have no time for such nonsense. It is a straightforward matter of priorities. We all have priorities. My children are my priority, my neighbour’s children, although very nice, are not. Middle-class media women are a priority; raped and abused working-class girls are not. It’s that simple. The other reason Gregg Wallace dominated the front pages is because he is the perfect villain: a white working-class geezer done good. So the media will go after him. But if you are an Asian man who treats white working-class girls as trash, something to be raped, passed around to other Asian men, urinated on and kept in a cage, you are rarely exposed as the child rapist and child trafficker that you are. This would jeopardise the sacred mantra of Diversity is our Strength. So it gets buried for decades until it becomes so obvious that someone somewhere has to say stop. TCW has spoken about the Rotherham scandal before. I did sohereandhereandhere. Indeed, even when cases came to trial, the abuse of these girls continued: ‘When cases did eventually reach court, GMP left the young victims to be harassed and intimidated by the men who had previously abused them, sometimes at gunpoint.’ Also, police took no action in the case of a 15-year-old who gave birth to a child of her ‘pimp’. Amazingly I don’t remember many headlines about raped girls being threatened at gunpoint by their abusers when their criminal cases eventually came to court. I am sure there is some white working-class man doing something inappropriate at work somewhere which deserves much more attention. Another example of the abuse that went on was: ‘One child told GMP that her abusers kept girls in cages and “made them bark like a dog or dress like a baby” but took no action once she left Greater Manchester and was put in care elsewhere.’ Lovely. The latest case that involved the brutal abuse of white girls by mostly Asian men came during the American Presidential election, so some lack of coverage was to be expected, but I don’t recall any serious coverage at all. Like so many other cases,it sank like a stone. A West Yorkshire Police press release said: ‘Two men have been convicted and jailed for sexually abusing young girls in Calderdale, bringing the total to 22. Legal restrictions and appeals against convictions meant we were unable to share the outcomes until today. The convictions follow an investigation launched in 2016 following reports of repeated sexual abuse of a vulnerable young girl between 2002 and 2006, starting when she was 13 years old.’   Two days earlier a press statement said: ‘Twenty men have been jailed for more than 219 years combined after being found guilty of raping and abusing young girls. Through a series of individual investigations and trials, the men were found to have sexually abused and exploited four girls between the ages of 12 and 16 in Calderdale.’ I put ‘Calderdale’ into the Times search engine, and found that they reported the casehere. In fairness to the Times, they have been better at covering this scandal than others but if you put ‘Gregg Wallace’ into their search engine those results go on for pages and pages. It’s ridiculous.The Times said juries had heard details of ‘absolutely shocking offending’, in which victims were treated as ‘defenceless commodities to be abused and traded at whim’. Detective Chief Inspector Oliver Coates of West Yorkshire police, said the men had committed ‘appalling sexual abuse on a scale which can barely be believed’. We should ask ourselves why this abuse could barely be believed. Because the media and some police officers (not necessarily this one) turned a blind eye to such abuse for decades. Nothing was permitted to challenge the sacred belief that Diversity is our Strength or Immigration Built Britain. That’s why you hardly ever get a mugshot of Malik Quadeer, 67, who was found guilty of five counts of rape and jailed for 22 years, or Shahzad Nowaz, 45, who was found guilty of rape and making threats to kill and sentenced to 11 years, on the front page. It is much easier to slap Gregg Wallace on there for making ‘inappropriate comments’.There we have it: some issues deserve the lectern treatment (Far Right Thuggery), and some issues don’t (rape of thousands of girls in towns mainly in the north of England). Some victims count (middle-class women of a certain age who work in the media), and some victims don’t (white working-class girls in Rotherham). The disgustingly disproportionate media focus on the alleged wrongdoing of Gregg Wallace, compared with the confirmed and brutal criminality of, say, Shahzad Nowaz of Halifax, tells us yet again how the mainstream media operate, namely in a ruthless and immoral fashion always designed to protect the Big Lie, that there are no downsides to mass immigration. The girls of Rotherham and Oxford would beg to differ.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-report-the-mass-rape-of-white-schoolgirls-when-you-can-pick-on-gregg-wallace/
"Debunked – the great Diversity, Equity and Inclusion myth","MOST thinking people come to realise that positive discrimination doesn’t work. As a twenty-something idealist I was much impressed by President Lyndon Johnson’s Project Headstart educational programme which began with the earliest years of ‘deprived’ children’s lives. Twenty years later,when I looked up the research againI found most of the programme’s advantages had been wiped out by age 11 and virtually all by 20. It was a complete waste of time and money. It certainly had little chance of compensating for a dramatic culture shift towards fatherlessness, particularly amongst blacks, from the 1960s onwards.  (By 1988 60 per cent of black children were born to unmarried mothers compared with just 33 per cent in 1960.) Louise Casey’s (‘services’-based) interventions worked no better here. But the problem with socialist thinking is that when one intervention doesn’t work they think they need more. When that doesn’t work they take it as evidence of deep ‘structural’ or internalised discrimination that can only be ‘made up for’ by quotas. So they give up on educational standards and instead simply select and promote on identity characteristics. That is where we are at. Today ensuring full diversity, equality and inclusion is the top goal of education, the judiciary, banks and business. Forget profit or efficiency. The NHS is but one example where DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) trumps its prior (or what should be its prior) purpose, patient care. Lazy people will still think DEI policies mean well and therefore at least must be a good thing for a decent, fairer, kinder society and happier people in general. Well no, not even that. Dr Colin Wright, an evolutionary biology PhD and Manhattan Institute Fellow and the CEO/Editor-in-Chief ofReality’s Last Stand, has blown a hole through this final myth too. ‘In a stunning series of events,’ hereports in his latest substack, ‘two leading media organisations – theNew York Timesand Bloomberg – abruptly shelved their coverage of agroundbreaking studythat raises serious concerns about the psychological impacts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) pedagogy.’ In the unreported studies, ‘Through carefully controlled experiments, the researchers demonstrated that exposure to anti-oppressive (i.e. anti-racist) rhetoric – common in many DEI initiatives – consistently amplified perceptions of bias where none existed. Participants were more likely to see prejudice in neutral scenarios and to support punitive actions against imagined offenders.’ These effects were not marginal: ‘Hostility and punitive tendencies increased by double-digit percentages across multiple measures (and) perhaps most troubling, the study revealed a chilling convergence with authoritarian attitudes, suggesting that such training is fostering not empathy, but coercion and control.’ Thestudy, conducted by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) in collaboration with Rutgers University, found that ‘certain DEI practices could induce hostility, increase authoritarian tendencies, and foster agreement with extreme rhetoric’. Given the billions of dollars invested annually in such initiatives, Wright argues that ‘the public has a right to know if such programs – heralded as effective moral solutions to bigotry and hate – might instead be fueling the very problems they claim to solve’. The implications of these findings cannot be downplayed, he argues: ‘DEI programs have become a fixture in workplaces, schools, and universities across the United States, with a 2023 Pew Research Centerreportindicating that more than half of US workers have attended some form of DEI training. Institutions collectively spend approximately$8billionannually on these initiatives, yet the NCRI study underscores how little scrutiny they receive. While proponents of DEI argue that these programs are essential to achieving equity and dismantling systemic oppression, the NCRI’s data suggests that such efforts may actually be deepening divisions and cultivating hostility.’ We have exactly the same problem here in the UK with programmes which are equally divisive and politically motivated but can be counterproductive –all paid for by us. An estimate based onFreedom of Information requests to 6,000 public authorities cites the existence of approximately 10,000 public DEI jobs at a cost of £557million a year to the UK taxpayer. Why would we be paying that money to make people more resentful and more likely to bully?

"Marvel at Trump's resurgent America, weep for Starmer's desolate Britain","WE are about to witness a unique political experiment. We have two English-speaking countries which have just held elections and now both are about to implement completely opposing sets of policies. We’ll be able to see which of these two countries has the right policies for the wellbeing of its citizens and which is driving its citizens into a dystopian hell of impoverishment, political oppression and unstoppable decline. OK, not much suspense there. I imagine you all know the answer. But let’s still take a moment to compare the political decisions of the US and UK. Here a few of the key policy areas: Climate change Energy Immigration Taxation and public spending Free speech Health These are just a few of the main differences between Trump’s America and Starmer’s Britain which I can quickly think of. No doubt there will be many others I haven’t mentioned. But perhaps the greatest tragedy is that, due to the Labour Party’s oft-expressed loathing for Trump, Starmer will work to alienate Trump’s revived and successful America, giving him an excuse to take Britain closer to the failing, over-regulated, high-energy-cost, free-speech-suppressing European Union.

"Exit June Raine, pursued by bare-faced lies","DR JUNE Raine, the career drug safety expert who has headed the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the last fiveyears, is stepping down. She’s led a regulatory revolution which has, she proudly says, turned the agency from a watchdog into an enabler. There’s no news yet on what she’s doing next: perhaps a pharma sinecure awaits as a reward. So long, Dame June. You won’t be missed. You’ve been a disaster. Your legacy is the still unfolding calamity of the mRNA gene therapies that masquerade as vaccines. When the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA ‘medical countermeasure’ was authorised on December 2, 2020, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following closely behind, you shamelessly told the public ‘Your safety comes first’. Tell that to the families of Lisa Shaw, Dr Stephen Wright or the 75 others whose death certificates officially state the covid vaccines caused their deaths. All-cause excess death figures have risen since the covid vaccine roll out suggesting the real death toll due to these gene-therapy vaccines’ unknown long-term effects is much higher. In an unfortunate oversight, the announcement of the MHRA’s authorisation for use of the Pfizer/BioNTech product was made on the 59thanniversary of thewithdrawal from the UK market of thalidomide by its UK distributors. Thalidomide’s history as the very first landmark drug safety event was well known to you, Dame June. Prescribed under the brand name Distaval for morning sickness and, oh the irony, to treat pneumonia and flu, it was tested in animals but not in humans before being placed on the market. It was advertised saying ‘Distaval can be given completely safely to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child’. Five years and 10,000 babies later, 2,000 of whom were born in the UK, everyone could see from the catastrophic birth defects this wasn’t true. Dr Frances Kelsey of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)saved Americans from the thalidomide disaster. Kelsey repeatedly asked for more safety data when 60 days was the norm for drugs to be authorised for use. The MHRA’s slogan is ‘putting patients first’ which on your watch was interpreted to mean speeding up the time it takes to review marketing applications so that drugs reach patients faster. You, Dame June, are no Frances Kelsey. Dame Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, lavished praise on you at a2022 Medics Day event at Somerville, your old Oxford College, saying: ‘The reason why the UK was the first to approve the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is because of June and the way she led the regulatory body here in the UK in a way that has never been led in any regulatory body anywhere in the world. And that is a phenomenal achievement.’ You proudly expanded, saying: ‘We tore up the rule book and we allowed [covid vaccine] companies to immediately start overlapping trials and large-scale manufacture being prepared at risk. We did not know if any would be effective . . . But you can see the layers of parallel working that went on. That can never be turned back now.’ Safety surveillance wasn’t an afterthought. The MHRA was planning for it even before the Phase 3 trials were under way. ‘We began in the middle of June – six months ahead of time – 2020, to start to prepare what safety surveillance we would need,’ said Raine. ‘Kate [Bingham] at that point had thought that once the purchase had been made, the approval had been signed, “home and dry” and what I was able to share with you [Kate] was we only really learn about benefit-risk in clinical use and we knew that there would be a vast influx of reports of side effects. No effective medicine or vaccine is without them.’ The inversion of benefit-risk was no slip of the tongue. The MHRA, our most Orwellian of government agencies, acts as a ‘pro-innovation’ industry enabler which in practice means the risks of rapidly assessed medicinal products or the new ‘platforms’ such as mRNA falls entirely on patients while the benefits accrue disproportionately to pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders as revenues and profits. It is apparent now that launching the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) pandemic prevention mRNA countermeasure platform was the singular objective of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. At the very first meeting of the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)to discuss Covid-19 vaccines on May 7, 2020, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the Department of Health Deputy Chief Medical Officer, told members that ‘a vaccine was of paramount importance’. The next minute he helpfully told them there was the potential for RNA vaccine manufacture to provide a million doses in a single batch. At that juncture, Moderna and BioNTech combined and over the course of a decade, had injected a thousand or so trial volunteers with their mRNA products. All of BioNTech’s pre-2020 trial volunteers were cancer patients which inherently limits the availability of long-term safety data. Nonetheless the scale-up potential was tremendous even for an infectious disease such as Covid-19 which Public Health England downgraded from a ‘high consequence infectious disease’ on March 19, 2020, two days before Boris Johnson ordered the first national lockdown after Dominic Cummings and his Red Teampushed the panic button. Those same JCVI minutes state that the MHRA would ‘help manage any concerns about vaccine safety’. It has certainly done that. The UK public were told that ‘no corners have been cut whatsoever’ in its authorisation of BNT162b2, which they were reassured had been tested in more than 40,000 people. What they weren’t told by the MHRA was that to manufacture a million doses in a single batch, the manufacturing process was changed and although the upscale product was injected into a token sample of volunteers, the MHRA never saw any of the data. A planned cross-over safety study wasn’t due to be published until February 2021 but was never done and as none of the data from volunteers dosed with Process 2 product was available on November 14, 2020, the data cut-off date for the final analysis, it was simply left out. The MHRA made its authorisation decision based on data for a similar product tested in the trial, but had no insight into the actual product which it authorised on a comparability basis, meaning it permitted the use of a product untested in humans in any meaningful way. To produce a million doses a batch, genetically modified E-coli bacteria are used to produce the RNA by fermentation. It introduces another safety problem, a dirty little secret. E-coli also produces endotoxin, which is more dangerous than sarin gas. Itkills around 950,000 people a year globally, often making the news in the United States where there are alarmingly frequent recalls of hamburger meat due to E-coli contamination,including a major one on November 21, 2024. InJuly 2021 the MHRA hired Dr Alison Cave as its Chief Safety Officer. Biochemist Dr Geoff Pain, who is foremost in warning about the endotoxin-linked harms of mRNA vaccines,points out that Dr Cave has significant expertise in endotoxin-induced myocarditis. This is the known ‘rare’ safety concern the MHRA is managing but it’s not the only one. In 2022, possibly prompted by Dr Cave, the MHRA decided that the 549,357 Yellow Card reports on covid vaccines were skewing the ‘disproportionality’ statistical analysis it uses to detect safety signals.A report was made to the Commission on Human Medicinesabout this decision which retired Ministry of Defence safety expert Nick Huntobtained after a protracted battle with the Information Commissioner’s Office. The nine-page report contained three redactions – the name and email address of the assessor and a single digit on a table of outlier safety signals. The redacted number was for ‘necrotic lymphadenopathy’ reports relating to Tozinameran, which is the name of the mRNA active substance in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It can be caused by endotoxin and is a cancer-linked safety-signal. Endotoxin (also referred to as lipopolysaccharide or LPS) has long been known to act as an adjuvant, leading Dr Pain and others to question whether its presence in both the BioNTech and the Moderna vaccines is intentional. TheJCVI Covid-19 sub-committee minutes for November 30, 2020end with the committee asking the question whether lymphadenopathy is an mRNA-associated event. In December 2020, the World Health Organization Sage committeereporton the Pfizer/BioNTech covid vaccine, listed lymphadenopathy as a potential adverse event of special interest as some clinical trial participants dosed with the Process 1 version had ongoing lymphadenopathy. When the booster trial results were published in 2021 there was a 13-fold increase in lymphadenopathy incidence (0.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent) between the original trial of Process 1 product and the booster trial in which volunteers were dosed with the Process 2 upscale product. The MHRA said it was a cumulative effect caused by the third dose while ignoring the issue of the product switch. It also ignored the real-world evidence in the Yellow Card data base that confirmed the lymphadenopathy problem and which Dr Raine told her Somerville audience was the only way benefit-risk could truly be assessed. In days to come, your name, June Raine, will inextricably be linked with mRNA as Frances Kelsey’s is with thalidomide. History records Kelsey as a heroine. It won’t be so kind to you. May you live out your days in ignominy.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-06T01:17:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/exit-june-raine-pursued-by-bare-faced-lies/
"From 1991, a prescient warning about the globalist agenda","AS A student of International Relations in the early 1970s I had no idea of the depths of my ignorance. The motto of myalma mater, the London School of Economics, is ‘rerum cognoscere causas’, an abbreviation of Virgil’s phrase ‘Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas’,meaning‘Fortunate, who was able to know the causes of things’, or as Dryden interpreted it in his study of Virgil, ‘Happy the Man who, studying Nature’s Laws, Thro’ known Effects can trace the secret Cause.’ I was ignorant and unhappy because I could not ‘trace the secret cause’. Recent events and the ocean of information now freely available have given me a greater understanding of the reasons for the growing dystopia. A significant source has been John Coleman’s book,The Conspirators’ Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of 300. Coleman’s research, published in November 1991, led him to believe that a small number of powerful individuals are acting through various agencies to implement their goals to consolidate their power and wealth. The culprits he exposed are mostly familiar: the United Nations, the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements, the Club of Rome, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tavistock Institute, Starmer’s Trilateral Commission, Lammy’s Bilderberg Group, Freemasons, Bolsheviks, and other messianic, eugenicist people and organisations to which we can add theKissinger/Schwab atrocity, the World Economic Forum. Coleman included the following amongst the goals of the conspirators. Many of them have been successful whilst others have morphed and been moulded by circumstance. ‘A New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their control.’ ‘The utter destruction of national identity and national pride.’ ‘The destruction of religion and more, especially the Christian religion.’ As promoted by Justin Welby and Jorge Mario Bergoglio. ‘The control of every individual through means of mind control.’ International media is controlled by only five or six corporations. The CIA and British intelligence agencies have a long history of news manipulation. ‘Legalisation of drugs and pornography.’ The proliferation of porn sites on the internet has accompanied the legalisation of various dangerous drugs in the US and elsewhere. ‘Limited wars in the advanced countries [to cause] the deaths of 3billion people.’ Coleman added that ‘some of the more important members of the Committee of 300 are also members of Nato’. ‘To introduce new cults.’ Coleman wrote that the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and others were constructs of the Tavistock Instituteof Human Relations. In his bookWeird Scenes inside the Canyon,David McGowan describes similar initiatives by the US government to manipulate the youth. The latest incarnation of this cultism is Taylor Swift mania. ‘The population of the United States to be reduced by 100million by the year 2050.’ As abortions are encouraged at increasingly late stages and death pods await the infirm and depressed, theLancetdeclares that‘by 2050, over three-quarters (155 of 204) of countries will not have high enough fertility rates to sustain population size over time; this will increase to 97 per cent of countries (198 of 204) by 2100’. ‘To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another.’ Aids, Financial Crisis, Covid-19, Ukraine, Middle East, Mass Immigration, Disease X . . . ‘To give the fullest support to supra-national organisations such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.’ The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all UN member states in 2015 provides an excuse for their totalitarian ambitions. ‘Penetrate and subvert all governments.’ As we wait, more in hope than expectation, that Donald Trump will reveal the full Wexner/Epstein story, it is likely that many have been compromised elsewhere such as at Yale’s Skull and Bones Society, the Bohemian Grove meetings, the Sean Combs parties, the Franklin Scandal, etc, etc. ‘Take control of education in America with the intent and purpose of completely destroying it.’ Donald Trump has promised to dismantle the Department of Education believing that for the past 45 years it has been ‘indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial sexual and political material’. Romans 8:25-27 tells us that ‘it is plain to anyone with eyes to see that at the present time all created life groans in a sort of universal travail.’ In considering Sir Keir Starmer’s recent meetings with both BlackRock and Gates it is also plain to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear that the conspirators are emboldened and keen to flaunt their control. While we can hope that the change of the guard in the White House will confound the knavish tricks of the conspirators, Coleman also warns: ‘Any strong leader who suddenly appears to rescue the nation must be regarded with the utmost suspicion.’",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-09T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/from-1991-a-prescient-warning-about-the-globalist-agenda/
"Beware, Sir Keir, this petition is the tip of the iceberg","TCW readers will be aware of the petition on the UK Government and Parliament website calling for another general election. Some will have been amused and many may have signed it as a protest statement or as therapy. At 6pm last evening, the petition had attracted 2,973,970 signatures and by the time Parliament debates it on January 6 – appropriately enough the Feast of the Epiphany – the odds are that the tally will have exceeded 3million and be heading inexorably towards the next milestone (on which topic more below). It’s truly amazing how many horrors the Starmer administration has managed to spawn in less than half a year. One of the earliest was the revival of a high-ranking position which has had no incumbent since the early fourteenth century. After the post had been vacant for hundreds of years it was a surprise to see Lord Alli take up the mantle of Keeper of the Wardrobe. This fount of unsolicited generosity not only ensured that the Prime Minister was bespectacled and bedizened as befits a world leader, but the Keeper’s largesse provided bountifully for Lady Starmer and much of the new Front Bench as well. It’s not the money involved here that matters so much. It’s the sense that for the anointed there can be nothing wrong in accepting free gear costing thousands of pounds that leaves voters with the sense that these people wouldn’t recognise their own venality unless it grew horns and stared back at them from their mirror. The objective here is not to draw up a ledger of the missteps and wrongdoings of this ill-starred administration because it has already run out of steam and the chickens will soon come home to roost. For instance, what will Bridget Phillipson’s imposition of VAT on private school fees do other than harm children and schools in both state and private education? Even the progressive Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) reckons that the net revenue raised will be trivial when allowing for the extra funding needed in the state sector to accommodate the influx of formerly privately educated children. What’s the point of this other than pure spite? What will be the overall devastation wreaked upon the British economy by quondam (until rumbled) economist Rachel Reeves? The wealthy are leaving the country, businesses are battening down the hatches and wages and employment opportunities are contracting sharply. The unspoken guiding principle in both cases is that the public sector should be rewarded with pay rises while the private sector is punished, plucked and bullied. Whenever, as now, Sir Keir Starmer senses that his reputation needs burnishing he issues a fresh set of policy statements, targets and roadmaps designed to give an impression that as he wallows about in a mess of his own creation his focus is firmly fixed on the business of government and the sunny uplands that somehow await. Credit is due to the team atGuido Fawkeswho produced a diagramlast week showing how the wooden slogans of Starmer-speak succeed one another in cascades of vacuity. The mish-mash of three foundations, five missions, six first steps, six milestones and seven pillars were never meant to be taken seriously. Neither are they even aspirational. These are the kinds of things that an idealistic sixth-former might mock up on a whiteboard with no thought to the practicalities of implementation. But one current milestone is interesting and it’s not one of Keir Starmer’s. It’s the one of the ‘Call a General Election’ petition nearing the three million mark. Clearly the petition could have no practical effect but its message should have given the government pause for thought. Elected with a huge majority not on the basis of a popular prospectus but to punish the Tories for 14 years of stasis and broken promises, Labour might have begun its period in government cautiously and with some humility in order to work towards consent if not consensus. But no: such promises as were made in the run-up to July’s election have been trashed and other policies such as the abolition of the winter fuel allowance for many pensioners came out of nowhere. Moreover thegovernment’s response to the petitionposted on December 6 is far from conciliatory and more than anything expresses annoyance at the presumption of the troublesome signatories. The language is predictably wooden with three mentions of ‘foundations’ in the first three paragraphs. The petulant tone is accompanied by clumsy inclusivity language as in ‘The Prime Minister can call a general election at a time of their choosing’. The Deputy Prime Minister was interviewed by Trevor Phillips on Sunday television, arguing simultaneously that many more affordable houses were needed for ‘working people’ but that there was already an abundance of housing available for immigrants. Is Angela Rayner making up policy on the hoof? Airbnb renters beware! There’s only so much of this kind of thing that people will take before their dissatisfaction finds forms of expression and at a scale that are less easily ignored than a petition.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-10T01:16:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/beware-sir-keir-beware-this-petition-is-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/
The BlackRock connection and a nightmare for farmers,"THE current intriguing question is what could the US multinational investment behemoth BlackRock (‘BRK’) possibly have in common with a left-wing British elected government? Founded in 1988, BRK, with assets in excess of $11.5trillion, is active in enterprise risk management, a fixed-income institutional asset manager which has frequently been heavily censured for supporting extraction of fossil fuels, the international arms trade and a slew of human rights abuses. According toThe Canary last month:‘Just days ago, climate groups Friends of the Earth US and Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) submitted a complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Their complaint alleges that BlackRock have been directly contributing to environmental and human rights abuses around the world through its investments in agribusiness. ‘The complaint lays out how BlackRock has invested in companies that are destroying rainforests, and with them eradicating sorely needed biodiversity. The asset management company are also accused of human rights abuses in what Friends of the Earth call “an epidemic of violence”.’ Why, we would have to wonder, should such an amoral capitalist adventurer be welcomed so gushingly into the very heart of Downing Street? ‘I’m determined to deliver growth, create wealth and put more money in people’s pockets,’ thePrime Minister wrote on November 21.‘This can only be achieved by working in partnership with leading businesses, like BlackRock, to capitalise on the UK’s position as a world leading hub for investment.’ This, apparently, is nothing new. Ethan Stone ofopenDemocracy wrote:‘On 21 November in Downing Street, senior executives from BlackRock, one of the world’s most controversial companies, sat down opposite Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves. The government’s laser-focus on private investment as the key means of driving economic growth has inevitably led to a reliance on the world’s big money machines, like BlackRock.’What price socialism? St Jeremy the Unlamented of Islington would surely disapprove.This is a relationship that Labour developed in opposition and which has become even cosier since the party entered government, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink making a star turn at Labour’s investment summit last month and posing for pictures with the PM when Starmer visited New York in September. Senior BlackRock figures were there, too, when No 10 held a summer reception for business leaders. Should we be worried? Yes. We should be very worried indeed.With their most recent Budget, Labour have raised a chorus of anger and alarm from the farming community. They have proposed that from April 2026, inheritance tax (IHT) relief for business and agricultural assets will be capped at £1million, a new reduced rate of 20 per cent being charged above that (rather than the standard 40 per cent rate). Tax due can be paid by interest-free annual instalments spread over ten years. Now, what might this have to do with BRK? According toDaniel Priestley of Dent Global who tweeted on November 22, possibly quite a lot. Watch out British Farmers, This is  how@Keir_Starmer's new best buddies at BlackRock are going to screw you over in 7 steps …1. They will start buying up small plots of agricultural land at double the normal price. They will issue a directive to all of their energy… While it must be said this is wholly speculative, the idea alone should send shivers not just down farmers’ spines but every one of us. At the outset BRK will unobtrusively begin scooping up parcels of farming land but paying way above the odds. In concert, they’ll direct all their energy companies to secure land for carbon capture. Their cohorts will appear to bid against each other thus pushing the cost of land up to levels no farmer, needing a return on investment, can hope to compete with. For some sellers this must seem like a welcome boom. It’s not.A net effect will be to push agricultural land values to new and wholly false levels. So, when a farmer dies and his estate is assessed for IHT, the asset will suddenly, in HMRC terms, be worth far more than before. The heirs will have no viable means of paying the tax: ‘In swoops a BlackRock subsidiary with a “Agri Debt Finance Tax Relief” product to lend them 20 per cent of the “value” of their farm so they can pay the taxes’.No free lunches here. Any borrowing will come loaded with restrictive terms, say that the farm shall henceforth be run in a particular way, that the new farmer will be tied into BRK products, plant, software etc, a set of conditions that steer the target farm towards an ‘interface with the larger conglomerate’. So, tomorrow’s UK kulaks will be forcibly collectivised. Not by Uncle Joe and his Chekists but by their capitalist equivalent. Ask any Ukrainian how that process played out.Many farms will fail. No worries, BRK or its stooges will already have a contractual right to buy up the assets that precludes sale by auction. Now this may be tricky as the farmer’s clearers probably have first call and the preferred creditors will have to be dealt with. But, hey, even if BRK has to buy at auction, they’ll still be getting a bargain. Economies of scale will facilitate increasing profitability. Priestley suggests, perhaps a step too far, that government could arrange with BRK to utilise illegal immigrants as farm labour.Too Orwellian perhaps?

Syria's Islamist coup could destroy one of the world's oldest Christian communities,"ISLAMIST rebels have taken Damascus and the regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen. The world rejoices and there are street celebrations by exiled Syrians in the major cities of the West. Politicians includingSir Keir Starmerwelcome the fall of Assad’s ‘barbaric regime’ as a ‘very good thing for the Syrian people’. And the Christians of Syria flee. Since the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, 90 per cent of Christians have abandoned Aleppo, the country’s second largest city. Will the remaining 10 per cent remain to welcome their jihadi ‘liberators’? What centuries of Islamic oppression was unable to do, the civil war managed and the overthrow of the Assad regime will probably complete: the destruction of one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. It was on the road to Damascus that Saul, the persecutor of Christians, met the risen Christ and became Paul, the greatest of missionaries and theologians who wrote much of the New Testament. It was in the then Syrian city of Antioch (present day Antakya, in Turkey) that followers of The Way were first called Christians. Syria produced many of the saints and fathers of the early church such as Ephrem the Syrian and Eusebius of Caesarea. Two thousand years of Christianity in Syria may soon be coming to an end. TheCatholic Archbishop of Aleppohas described this as the end of Christianity’s presence in the city. ‘We are really tired,’ he said. ‘We are really exhausted, and we are also finished, in every sense.’ Speaking of the armed groups who have taken over he said, ‘The Christians of Aleppo will be convinced that they cannot stay. That it is over for them. In Aleppo they are trying to bring about the end of the rich, magnificent and unique history of the Christians of Aleppo.’ Christians suffered just as much under Assad’s rule as the other citizens of Syria and had no affection for the president. They aligned themselves with the regime not through choice but out of necessity, to save themselves from being slaughtered by the radical Muslim jihadis. Now that the jihadis are in control of the country the Christians of Syria are in a perilous situation. Speaking of the ‘rebels’ who have overthrown Assad, the Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II said, ‘So, let there be no doubt: they are anti-Christian. They call us infidels. Many believe that it’s their duty to slaughter us in order to offer a sacrifice to their god.’ As the jihadis advanced through the country, many Christians fled the villages and cities in their path. They sought refuge in the formerly government-controlled ‘Valley of Christians’ or Wadi al-Nasara. The community in the Valley responded by opening their homes, churches and community halls to offer shelter and support to the displaced. Now that the Valley has fallen under jihadi control following the collapse of the Assad government, the lives of the Christians there are in jeopardy. The mainstream media refers to the jihadis as ‘moderate rebels’ when they are neither moderate nor rebels. These militants want a theocratic country ruled by sharia law. When the terrorist groupHay’at Tahrir al-Sham(Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant; HTS) launched their attack on the Aleppo Governorate in north-western Syria, theycapturedandkilleddozens of Syrian Army soldiers, and promised mass executions and beheadingsin front of TV cameras.Videosof jihadistsabductingKurdish women have surfaced on social media. While we can be glad that Assad has fallen, we should not forget HTS is a jihadist group with origins in Al Qaeda and ISIS, including the remnants of the group led by the late Abu Musab al Zarqawi, a Palestinian Jordanian known as the ‘sheikh of the slaughterers’. These are no democracy-loving liberals: wherever they have had authority, they have inflicted abuse. We should be under no illusion that everything in Syria is going to be transformed for the good, that freedom of speech and action will be established. HTS aim to establish a theocracy. The situation if anything is going to be worse for all of Syria’s citizens and especially for the minorities: Alawites, Kurds and Christians. Since the violent Muslim conquest of Syria in AD 634-638, generation after generation of Syria’s Christians have been oppressed and despised by the Muslim majority. When Muslims treat Jews and Christians as equals they are being unfaithful to the teachings of their holy book. The Koran clearly teaches that Jews and Christians should have second-class status. A look across to Islamic North Africa and the Middle East would bear this out. It is difficult to find any instances in the Arab Islamic world of Christians living in harmony and peace under Islamic rule. Egypt has a large Christian population which existed long before the creation of Islam, yet the Coptic Christians live as second-class citizens in their own country. Still those who govern us continue to welcome into our countries the kind of people who have destroyed the Christian minorities in their own lands. Islamists can persecute, murder and drive out ancient Christian communities, and you won’t hear a word from our tolerant Western governments. We should try to be respectful and compassionate, but not at the cost of naively closing our eyes to the realities faced by Christians in Muslim-dominated countries. It is possible for governments to show concern about the situation facing Christians in Muslim-dominated lands. Hungary has its ownstate secretary to assist persecuted Christians. The much-maligned Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán recently met Syrian Orthodox Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II and pledged continued support for Christians in need. How will the UK government react to the plight of Syria’s Christians? Will there be speeches from the front bench in their defence, will they be welcomed here and given accommodation and support as they try to rebuild their lives: or will they be ignored and left to the mercies of the jihadis? Given the Labour Party’s reliance on the Muslim vote there is little doubt which stance the Starmer government will take.

Covid didn’t cause the surge in excess deaths — the 'pandemic' response did,"MOST excess deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic can be linked to biological stress brought on by coordinated and large-scale mandates and medical assaults — ranging from lockdowns to vaccination to denial of antibiotics and antivirals — according toa paperreleased Monday by excess mortality researcherDenis Rancourt PhD. The theory that the novel virus and its variants spread globally, causing cascading pandemics and massive numbers of related deaths, cannot account for the actual patterns of excess death worldwide during the 2020-2023covidperiod, Rancourt argues. That narrative has been used to justify permanent vaccination campaigns to repeatedly boost national immunity against new variants. However, it can’t explain what caused 31millionglobal excess deathsduring the  pandemic period according to Rancourt, a lead scientist for 20-plus years at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Instead, he argues excess deaths between 2020-2023 can largely be attributed to illnesses including certain types of bacterial pneumonia, also known asaspirationpneumonia, that were often misdiagnosed on death certificates as covid. He says such illnesses typically occur when biological stress affects the immune system making people more susceptible to infections that come from the microbes and parasites in their own bodies, a phenomenon more common among the elderly and immunocompromised. Rancourt concludes: ‘Within the present state of knowledge, it is possible that the declared covid pandemic (2020-2023) was entirely caused by the coordinated and largescalemandates, measures, so-called responses, and medical assaults including testing, diagnostic bias, isolation, denial of treatment (especially antibiotics for pneumonia), mechanical ventilation, sedation, experimental and improper treatments, and vaccination.’ If that is the case, Rancourt says, the medical establishment has ‘vastly underestimated and largely disregarded’ the impact of biological — including psychological — stress on health and mortality. Rancourt also suggests that this theory of stress-induced mortality could account for ‘all pandemics within recorded history’ because most have occurred amid major societal and environmental crises. The paper builds on extensive research into covidpandemic-related all-cause mortalityby Rancourt and his colleagues at the Canadian nonprofitCorrelation Research in the Public Interestover the last several years. It is published on the organisation’s website. Rancourt and his colleagueshave argued that key characteristics of excess mortality during the pandemic period contradict the argument that the covid virus was responsible for that mortality. For example, excess mortality varied significantly from country to country, but didn’t cross jurisdictional borders — so there wasn’t evidence that a virus with consistent virulence was spreading from one place to another. Rancourt also noted that none of the excess mortality peaks preceded theWorld Health Organization’s announcementon March 11, 2020, that covid was a global pandemic. Instead,excess mortality peaksfollowed vaccine and booster rollouts in many countries. Citing US data,Rancourt found strong evidencethat respiratory infections were the primary condition associated with excess all-cause mortality. However those deaths may have been designated on death certificates as covid, when the primary cause of death was actually something else, he wrote. For example, Rancourt and colleagues previously found that more than half of the deaths attributed to covid likely included co-occurring bacterial pneumonia. They concluded thatPCR testing schemesled to many bacterial pneumonia infections being misdiagnosed as covid during a time when key treatments such as antibiotics andivermectinwere withdrawn. Research shows that social and environmental stressors are a major determinant ofhealth, including death, according to Rancourt. Psychological stress and social isolation have particularly strong associations with respiratory infections and their severity, as does age. Rancourt toldThe Defenderthat the massive socio-economic disruptions associated with the pandemic subjected societies worldwide to major stressors. Recent studies on mice showed that even a single episode ofrestraint and immobilisation stresscould lead to severe immunosuppression, leaving them vulnerable to bacterial infections. The study suggested that confinement in humans could produce similar effects, Rancourt wrote. Disruptions included lockdowns, which increased social isolation, and deprived people of incomes and limited mobility. Fear-driven propaganda terrorised people, and those who resisted mainstream narratives about the virus andvaccinesexperienced aggression and marginalisation. Hospitals and medical providers imposed aggressive and experimental medical interventions on some people, including the systematic use ofventilators,experimental treatment protocolsandpalliative carefor those who were severely ill. Others were denied access to medications like ivermectin or antibiotics. Rancourt also pointed to temporal correlations betweenvaccine and booster rolloutsand increases in excess all-cause mortality in every country with sufficient data. It is highly unlikely that the vaccine-mortality associations are coincidental, he wrote. He toldThe Defenderthis spike could be due tovaccine toxicityitself. Or, he said, the vaccine rollouts could have corresponded with other aggressive medical or health interventions. Combining the covid vaccines withother vaccines, and the stress of coercive vaccination, could have weakened people’s immune systems. It is also possible that multiple factors were at play, he said. Rancourt believes the most compelling explanation for most excess deaths — namely the surges in respiratory deaths often associated with the excess deaths — is that a combination of different social, political and medically induced stressors led to widespread aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia, which doesn’t require person-to-person transmission, is a dominant cause of death among the elderly, particularly in care homes and hospitals. Treatment requires proper diagnosis and the administration of antibiotics. Risk factors include immunosuppression, and several pandemic-related factors, including denial of antibiotics, ventilation, overuse of sedatives and hypnotics, tube feeding, depression, and disruptions to the digestive system caused by interventions. If this is correct, Rancourt said, the primary cause of death contributing to spikes in all-cause mortality was ‘covid-period mandates and measures’ that made people susceptible to these illnesses.

A book to destroy faith in doctors for ever,"Worth A Shot? Secrets of the Clinical Trial Participant Who Inspired a Global Movement – Brianne Dressen’s Storyby Caroline Pover* TALES of abuse are harrowing, but a hundred times worse when the perpetrators are governments. This book is brutally honest about our inadequate and ignorant medical profession, state-sponsored covid vaccine injury, suicide, despair and the fight for justice. Governments, social media and mainstream media committed terrible abuses with monumental efforts to keep those disabled and bereaved by covid vaccines apart. They needed support, and solutions for chronic conditions developed post vaccine such as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), transverse myelitis and post-vaccine neuropathy. Gaslit by the medical profession, victims such as pre-school teacher Brianne Dressen (AstraZeneca), retired gastroenterologist Dr Danice Hertz (Pfizer), dental hygienist Kristi Hobbs (also Pfizer), triathlete Candace Hayden (Moderna) and orthopaedic surgeon Dr Joel Wallskog (also Moderna), describe how they determined to expose those abuses. What they discovered destroyed their faith in doctors and drug regulatory agencies for ever. Without first-hand experience, none would have believed their government could disown them because ‘doing the right thing’ went wrong. As they unpeeled layers of the onion to work out why no one in authority would help, they found terrible conflicts of interest. For example, Dr Peter Marks, director of the Centre for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency responsible for ensuring efficacy and safety of all pharmaceuticals, oversaw covid vaccine development and approval, monitored post-marketing safetyandpromoted the jabs to the public. To counteract vaccine hesitancy to the warp-speed experimental shots, in a Q&A webinar Marks co-opted NFL football stars to persuade fans and other players to get jabbed. Trainee psychotherapist Sheryl Reuttgers, who’d had a severe neurological reaction to the Moderna vaccine, joined the Zoom, typing in: ‘What do you think about vaccine injuries?’ and ‘What about the NIH [US National Institutes of Health] studying vaccine harms?’ Her questions were erased while Marks told young, able-bodied athletes that the worst reaction to expect was some mild myocarditis and a trip to the ER. ‘But you’d recover with some Tylenol and rest,’ he said. Injury affected whole families, not just the injured. Brianne was suicidal for six months post-injury and although she tried to keep a smile on her face, the effect on her children Hannah, six, and Cooper, eight, was clear. Hannah wrote little love notes that she pushed under the door to the bedroom she was supposed to stay out of. They said, ‘I love my mommy!’ or ‘You are the BEST mommy in the whole world!’ surrounded by hearts. Cooper became angry and afraid, refusing to go to school. He needed to know where his mother was at all times. Social media, not the medical profession, became a lifeline to the injured, especially those confined to bed and to one room 24/7 looking for support. It was where they shared information about treatments, experimenting with anything that might help. But it became a source of frustration when they were heavily shadow-banned by Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. When Mark Zuckerberg shut down all but one Facebook group sharing vaccine injury stories, there was a new suicide. The woman had been posting cries for help on her private page for months, growing angrier and angrier as algorithms dramatically reduced her visibility. It’s no surprise thatWorth a Shotis dedicated to ‘all those injured by the Covid vaccine, those we have lost because of it, and all who love them’. Meanwhile, governments still have these injurious jabs in their wellness schedules, and their hands over their ears. *Award-winning British author and entrepreneurCaroline Poveris chair of trustees forUKCVFamily, a charity set up to support the vaccine injured in England and Wales.

Staggering ignorance that scuppered sterling and the stock exchange,"IN THE Chancellor’s recent Budget and her speech at the Mansion House she extolled the importance of economic growth. On this we agree. However, in my short time in Parliament I have come to realise that the economic ignorance, lack of suitability or any business experience of anyone in the Labour Party (and indeed most Tories) as well as a failure to grasp the basic demands of economic growth is ubiquitous. The current generation are staggeringly ill-informed. The Blairite years successfully obstructed any economic growth and progress with swathes of unnecessary legislation, sowing all manner of future minefields of obstruction, obfuscation and confusion that we and future generations are now floundering in. Blairite legislation has put the State in charge. No one has had the courage to challenge this self-serving status quo which is so deeply entrenched that it comfortably ignores changing elected governments. The current political incumbents are the children of this former era. They don’t question because they don’t know how, they don’t have any references or experience of sensible economic behaviour. If the readily accepted personal bribes offered to senior party members are a guide, they don’t understand right from wrong either, and simply ignore any criticism. If their behaviour is not questioned by the State, it must be acceptable. That other MPs and the electorate can simply be ignored is reminiscent of the relationship between Roman Emperors of the first century AD and the Praetorian Guard with the people. These students of socialism believe that spending money on the state is somehow ‘investment’. As Elon Musk recently said, ‘All government spending is taxation.’ This is not to say that spending on infrastructure and essential services is not important and that local economies will not benefit from projects, but it must be seen for what it is: spending taxpayers’ money. National economic growth must be driven by the private sector. GDP includes both the state and private sectors; the shrinking value of the private sector in the UK has not been subject to any real scrutiny for many years. Because the private sector has to contribute so much in taxation, we need metrics to gauge its robustness to do so. We should also be able to compare our private sector internationally. The capitalisation of the stock market is not comprehensive in terms of the value of business activity in the private sector, but major trends are a useful gauge of its health. Our private sector and our currency exchange rates better illustrate the scale of the UK’s demise. The UK entry level capital market is the AIM with a capitalisation of roughly $50billion. In the US the NASDAQ is over $20trillion. In 2023 the UK market capitalisation was roughly $2.8trillion, the US market was about $100trillion. These numbers are rough, but they illustrate how far behind the UK private sector lags. Apple’s valuation is greater than the entire FTSE 100. This differential was nowhere near as marked in the 1990s as it is now, so why has this gulf opened? State regulation has succeeded in asphyxiating our capital market; it has destroyed confidence with the imposition of ever-evolving obstruction iterations of regulated firms, entrepreneurs and investors with red tape under their wide-ranging and conveniently loose interpretations of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and its EU cousin MIFID I and II before Brexit. EU regulation has persistently endeavoured to obstruct equity markets because capital in Europe is delivered mainly and traditionally by bank lending, not by flotation on stock markets such as the London Stock Exchange. This matters in the UK because firms quoted on the LSE generate wealth and employment, pay pensions and make tax contributions. In short, they grow the economy. Anglo-Saxon markets such as London and New York are traditionally stock markets that provide major capital funding to larger quoted corporate constituents. Our government has utterly destroyed our competitive position partly because we have allowed our main capital market funding tradition to be crippled by FSMA and EU regulation, and no one says a word – perhaps because they don’t understand? In 2007 the USD/GBP exchange rate was nearer 2. It reflects what the market thinks of the UK. At the time of the recent election, it was 1.30 and this week it was 1.26. Oil is priced in USD and we have to have it. As debt dramatically increases post Budget and economic mismanagement continues, expect it to fall further to a point where alarm bells ring, No 10 will be on the phone to the independent Bank of England and UK interest rates will have to rise to avoid importing inflation and catastrophe. The new US administration will strengthen the USD further to the point where they will want to weaken their currency to make it competitive so they will cut interest rates which will make the US economy even stronger. Expect USD/GBP parity during this Parliament. You may have noticed that Norwich City, the nearest big football club to my Great Yarmouth constituency, like other clubs is now majority-owned by Americans. In the case of Norwich City they want to get the club back into the Premier League in the next five years. The club is a cheap way to get access to one of our remaining (but increasingly rare) successful global brands, the Premier League. It attracts hundreds of millions of viewers, particularly in Asia, and is a source of immense soft power. Let’s hope the Canaries make it before the Government’s proposed regulation destroys another British success as it has our financial markets. Be in no doubt we are in serious trouble, so at the Mansion House last month the supposedly independent non-political Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey surprisingly announced that we should build bridges with the EU to promote economic growth, no doubt just before it is hit with US trade tariffs. He also said that the US ‘has a better story to tell’, almost as though they are out of our league. The Chancellor, who, judging by the Budget, hasn’t a clue about the real muddle the country is in, feebly announced changes to the Financial Conduct Authority’s senior management regime and an investigation into promoting growth with the regulators in the spring. The FCA will no doubt engage full self-serving mode and run rings round her. The only way that our financial markets can get back on their feet for future generations is the repeal of FSMA 2000 and abolition of the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), neither of which has made any meaningful contribution to the UK economy. Regulation, or more likely just the law, is needed to ensure market participants act as principal or agent, identify clients and counterparties and identify and manage conflicts of interest. If this country does not wake up and start working properly and responsibly, Reform’s majority that will take power in 2029 will be dealing with the IMF as well as with the delivery of its Great Repeal Bill.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-04T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/staggering-ignorance-that-scuppered-sterling-and-the-stock-exchange/
Oxbridge and the cancellation of kindness,"A WEEK or so agoI wrote a piece discussing the tragic suicide of Oxford student Alexander Rogers in January. I wrote: ‘Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn’t happy about. As pertheTimes,“She had expressed ‘discomfort’ about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the ‘allegations’. They told him they believed he had ‘messed up’, that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later. ‘Rogers had appeared “distraught after this conversation”. He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation . . . ‘The coroner looking into Alexander’s death explained how the isolation at the college worked. “The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] ‘pile-on’ might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual. ‘In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a “pile-on” and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape.’ TheTimeshas done a follow-up andspoken to some students who enjoyed that most coveted experience, an undergraduate degree at Oxbridge. Cambridge graduate Ceci Browning, 23, said, ‘It is the paradox of my generation. We are supposedly the most tolerant and liberal, the most concerned with getting it right, and yet when one of our comrades slips up and falls out of step, they become the enemy. We cut friends and acquaintances from our lives on the basis of second-hand information about something deemed morally iffy that they may or may not have done, but we are also all perpetually afraid that precisely the same thing could happen to us.’ She also said: ‘The other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness. A policy of “one strike and you’re out”. Being a social justice warrior is no longer about being anti-government or anticapitalism, like the heralded student activism of the 20th century. Now, it’s anti-exoneration. Prisoners – those committed for more minor crimes, anyway – eventually get released and rehabilitated. But if you’re cancelled at university, you’re cancelled for ever.’ So, this is what middle-class parents bankrupt themselves for by sending their children to independent school (fees now have VAT) in the ultimate hope of getting into Oxbridge. In addition to enduring the inevitable hot-housing, the incredible pressure of navigating the Oxbridge entry system (interview, exam and A-levels) which will take a mental toll even on the best and brightest, your reward is: walking on eggshells for three or four years, living in the fear of being cancelled, or confirmed social ostracism. In fact the risk is so terrifying around sexual intimacy that the young men barely bother. ‘We’re quite scared of any sexual encounters with girls in case we get something wrong. Being honest, sex is quite hard to get right,’ one studying at Glasgow told theTimes. ‘And if you don’t, it feels like the jeopardy is so high it’s almost not worth the risk.’ Look, I understand the attraction of an Oxbridge degree (stealth boast incoming). I did a master’s at Darwin College, Cambridge, tutored for a term at Worcester College, Oxford, and worked and lived in Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. And sure, the architecture alone means that if you get to study at one of these colleges, you have won the lotto in life. For undergraduates the settings are 2/3 students to one tutor. Even in the best London universities a tutorial is about 10 to 15 students in a class (I did this also at UCL). You don’t even get this at the Ivy League universities in the US. Yes, it is an amazing experience to study at Oxbridge. Or at least it should be, but with all this cancel culture you wonder if is it still worthwhile. It is probably true that there are similar brutal cancellations and unkindness at most elite UK universities, a veritable competition in cruelty, all in the name of kindness. Haven’t the young people suffered enough? Didn’t they have to go through lockdown, and will graduate with huge debts? And what is worse is that at the end of it all, they don’t even have a chance to make true friends, to enjoy the loyal understanding of a mate should they make a mistake. I am not saying that a true friend must condone everything a wayward friend does. True charity requires that you tell your friend if they have done wrong, to themselves or to others. But that doesn’t mean you just abandon them. That doesn’t mean you just toss them aside into a desert of loneliness and encourage others to do the same. I find it truly frightening that young men and women could behave like this. It is far more terrifying than the risk of drink or drugs to your child. Those things can ruin your child’s body; being cancelled, being placed firmly outside the circle, will destroy their soul. What I found most depressing in theTimesarticle was the observation by Ms Browning that ‘the other thing that defined the culture was a lack of forgiveness’. Ah, such is the joy of the post-Christian age. What progress! Not for this generation the idea that ‘let he who is without sin cast the first stone’. Sure, these students, the elite, could bang out a 2,000-word essay on the rule of law, but they’d struggle to explain why the father forgave his returning prodigal son. Most of these Oxbridge graduates will survive their university years and go on to become professionally successful. That’s what having an Oxbridge degree gives you. We can only hope they learn about the importance of forgiveness, charity, loyalty and simple kindness as they move into public life, shaping policies we ourselves will have to live by.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-03T01:20:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/oxbridge-and-the-cancellation-of-kindness/
MSM silence as health coalition urges governments: Stop the jabs now,"ON MONDAY November 25 an international group of politicians, leading medical and other professionals, supported by Professor Francis Boyle, author of the US ‘Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorist Act of 1989’, wrote to the heads of state of ten European countries, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, calling for a suspension of modified mRNA vaccines citing serious health concerns. Ireland joined the call later in the week. The indefatigable retired paediatrician Ros Jones once more has been a leading light in organising it. As the newly formed North Group they sent the letter as a ‘notice of extreme concern’ regarding excessive levels of residual DNA identified in Australian vaccine samples that confirmed similar findings from France, Germany, Canada, and the USA. Their notice warned that the introduction of foreign DNA into cells via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) may damage human DNA leading to genomic instability, cancer and other extremely serious conditions. It also pointed out that: ● It was a lottery as to which batch a person received and the side effects – including death – they experienced. ● Vaccines were never tested for their ability to block transmission. Medical product regulators, as well as government agencies, misled the public when coercing them into accepting the products. ● Multiple independent analyses show that modified mRNA vaccines contain variable but alarmingly high levels of residual DNA. All these issues, the long list of international signatories agree, are grounds for extreme concern regarding risks to human health and potential for genetic damage that were never accounted for scientifically in the authorisation process of the novel mRNA vaccines.

UK supermarkets join Lurpak maker's trial of methane-reducing chemical in cows,"LAST WEEK the Danish-based dairy foods giant Arla announced a collaboration with three UK supermarkets, Tesco, Aldi and Morrisons, to trial Bovaer, a feed additive, aiming to reduce methane emissions. The following is a transcript of the video commentary on the social media announcement: ‘The latest innovation we’re looking at is Bovaer. Bovaer is a feed additive developed by Dutch company DSM that allows farmers to reduce enteric methane emissions from our dairy herds. Enteric methane being what the cows produce during their natural digestive process. Today, we’ve been working with Arla and DSM as part of the Bovaer set-up process, learning about what’s involved and how we can make the pilot as successful as possible. ‘So the reason we are quite excited about Bovaer, it’s not just some fairy dust that somebody thinks might make some improvements but it’s been really rigorously and extensively tested. Trials like these are really important to help reduce our carbon footprint.’ Arla Foods is a major player in the UK dairy market. It supplies milk to retailers and produces brands such as Lurpak, Anchor, Cravendale, Lactofree and Castello. Bovaer is a product owned by Netherlands-based DSM-Firmenich, a company whose work ‘supports the development of a more sustainable global animal production industry’ and is part of the fake-food and synthetic biology sector. It has been authorised for use in more than 50 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the US and EU countries. It was authorised in the UK in April this year. DSM’swebsitestates: ‘Bovaer® contributes to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of beef and dairy products. Just a quarter teaspoon per cow per day reduces methane emissions from dairy cattle by 30 per cent and up to 45 per cent for beef cattle, on average.’ According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, livestock produce12 per centof global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Efforts to combat ‘climate change’ have long focused on livestock. In January 2023, Bill Gates’s investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV) led a $12million seed funding round intoRumin8, a rival Australian start-up focused on developing feed supplements to reduce methane emissions from livestock. Arla’s announcement caused quite a stir on social media with many accounts calling for a boycott of their products. 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) is the active ingredient in Bovaer. Other ingredients include silicon dioxide and propylene glycol. 3-NOP inhibits the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase in the rumen (the first stomach compartment in ruminant animals), preventing the final step in methane production. It has been claimed that the additive has no side effects. However, while looking through some of the available reports, certain anomalies stand out. A letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) letter addressed to Elanco US, Inc, (which has an agreement with DSM-Firmenich to market Bovaer), states: ‘Bovaer® 10 is an article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal, and thereforeit is a drug.However, the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has considered whether it intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to certain requirements applicable to animal drugs for Bovaer® 10 – including requirements regarding new animal drug approval, pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practice, adverse event reporting, labeling, drug establishment registration and drug product listing.CVM has considered whether refraining from enforcement of these requirements at this time would be appropriate based on whether Bovaer® 10 poses a low risk to humans and animals and whether the data show that the product has the intended effect. Based on a review of your data and the characteristics of your product, FDA has no questions at this time regarding whether Bovaer® 10 will achieve its intended effect and is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals under the conditions of its intended use.’ The FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) seems to be sending mixed messages. Although Bovaer is officially classified as a drug, the CVM appears to have decided not to enforce certain drug regulations, including the obligation for adverse event reporting. This decision is based on the belief that Bovaer ‘is expected to pose low risk to humans or animals’. Paradoxically, the letter includes an attachment with the following troubling statements. Turning to thesafety assessment reportfor Bovaer, prepared by the UK’s Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland (FSS), which was reviewed by the Animal Feed and Feed Additives Joint Expert Group (AFFAJEG) and the Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF). According to ACAF: ‘the additive can be considered safe for consumers’ yet this conclusion is seemingly contradicted by the statement: ‘The additive should be considered corrosive to the eyes, a skin irritant and potentially harmful by inhalation.’ Notably, the assessment states: ‘In their first evaluation, members observed thatno analysis was performed on the final product to screen for dioxins and heavy metals.‘ This was followed by a request made by AFFAJEG for the applicant to provide an analysis of impurities in the final product. In the two tolerance studies presented in DSM’s application in relation to safety for the target species: ‘Study 1 used only 4 cows per group, which were given 0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg 3-NOP/kg feed DM for 90 days.The highest dose showed a reduced intake of feed and a reduced heart weight.’ Study 2 was larger and used 20 cows per group ‘which were given doses of 3-NOP of 0, 80, 100, or 200 mg/kg feed DM for 56 days’. At the highest dose (the 200 mg dose group), negative results were identified which included ‘decreased ovary size, decreased serum activities of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and reduced feed and water intake.’ The report went on: ‘The decrease in ovarian size was not accompanied by histopathological change and it was concluded that it should not be considered an adverse effect of the study at the 200 mg/kg dose . . .The Group concluded that the additive could be considered safe at a dose of 200 mg/kg and that a margin of tolerance of 2 could be established.’ In relation to safety studies for the consumer, a two-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats showed ‘mesenchymal cell tumours were reported in 4 out of 49 femalesat the top dose of 300 mg/kg bw/day of 3-NOP given orally. Based on these results, theoriginal study report concluded there was evidence of carcinogenicity in female rats.‘ Curiously, this conclusion was changed after an independent group was brought in to ‘reanalyse the study’s slides’. This group concluded that ‘mesenchymal cell tumours were present in 3 out of 49 femalesat the top dose group, which wasno longer statistically significantlydifferent from the control group’. The AFFAJEG concluded that at the higher dose levels (300 mg/kg/day in females), the additive has the potential to cause mesenchymal cell hyperplasia and benign tumours. However, due to the ‘absence of malignant tumours and genotoxicity, it was concluded that the additive is not carcinogenic at the recommended inclusion rate and benign tumours occurred only above the NOAEL [the no observed adverse effect level, the greatest concentration or amount of a substance at which no detectable adverse effects occur in an exposed population]’. In the genotoxocity studies testing whether 3-NOP is toxic to genes, it was noted ‘that positive results occurred in Chinese hamster V79 cells, with negative results in a study using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and an equivocal result in a study using TK6 cells’. Positive results indicate that the substance tested has the potential to cause genetic damage. In a second study, the results were negative except for males dosed at the top dose and sacrificed at 24 hours, in which micronuclei were statistically significantly increasedcompared to the negative control. Alarmingly, the report went on to state: ‘Based on the OECD guidance on establishing the biological relevance of a result in this assay, which is neither clearly positive nor clearly negative, AFFAJEG members recognised the requirement for external expert judgement. An external consultant, contracted by the applicant [DSM],concluded that the apparent increase in micronuclei may have been an artifact due to the Giemsa-based stain that was used, to which Group experts agreed. The Group concluded that 3-NOP is non-genotoxic in vivo.” This raises alarm bells considering it was an external consultant paid by the applicant (DSM) who attributed another cause for the increase in micronuclei – the stain used – not 3-NOP, the active ingredient in DSM’s product Bovaer.

UPDATE 4.30pm: Marks & Spencer also use Bovaer TCWreader Hermien Dyer who wrote to Marks & Spencer received this reply: Dear Hermien DyerThank you for taking the time to contact Stuart Machin [the firm’s CEO]. As a member of the Executive Team, I am responding on his behalf. We’d like to reassure you that health and welfare of our cows is our number one priority, so that we can offer our customers the highest welfare, highest quality milk on the market. The cows in our M&S Select Farm Milk Pool are cared for by farmers we know and trust to meet the highest animal welfare standards. The cows in our milk pool are pasture grazed and, in poor weather, they are fed a forage-based diet designed to meet their nutritional needs. Our British Select Farmers add Bovaer, a feed supplement made from corn fermentation derivatives and mineral salts, which prevents the digestive enzymes from forming methane and is naturally broken down in the cow’s stomachs. There is absolutely no harm to the cow and no impact on the milk in any way. Bovaer has been extensively studied around the world and it’s been proven that it’s safe for cows, farmers and consumers. This initiative is one part of how we are taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions and become a net zero business by 2040. Thank you again for taking the time to write.

Still time to pull back from slippery suicide slope,"MPs have voted forKim Leadbeater’s Assisted Dying Billon its second reading. Despite all the warnings from around the world, a majority voted for the Labour MP’s private member’s Bill to legalise what should more properly be called assisted suicide, but which would most likely have received much less support if it had not relied on cosy euphemisms for what is essentially the State helping dying people to kill themselves. Indeed, such proposals are so shrouded in fluffy phrases that many think ‘assisted dying’ means merely helping patients to have a more comfortable natural death. Most likely this explains why a majority of the public have appeared to support such a measure – although, tellingly, that majority tends to shrink as the manifold problems are highlighted in detailed discussion. But perhaps for this reason, when opponents raise the practical and ethical problems of this ‘compassionate’, ‘autonomous’, ‘de-lifing’ process – the danger of ‘slippery slopes’ – they are accused of‘scaremongering’. However, that term might be more usefully directed at the practice of scaring vulnerable individuals into believing they will ‘die in agony’ if they do not have the choice that means the end of all choice. And in all this discussion there has been a strange, one might almost say eerie, silence about‘ordinary’ suicides, which are known to increase in number in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is legal. Indeed, despite the well-known fact that suggestion plays a significant role in suicide ideation, the constant talk about deliberate death being an answer to suffering may well move people who are not ‘dying anyway’, but are suicidally inclined, to take that final, fatal step.But we are meant to believe ‘assisted dying’ is not suicide, therefore instead of engaging in ‘suicide prevention’ we must engage in suicide promotion. As for ‘slippery slopes’,Ms Leadbeater’s Bill itself resembles a slope growing more slippery by the day: while stressing its ‘strict safeguards’, she herself has hinted at its broader application – even acknowledging that being a ‘burden’ on others could be a legitimate reason for seeking ‘assisted dying’: ‘I know I wouldn’t want to be a burden to people, I can say that to you now in the clear light of day. But that’s very different to people saying, I’m doing this because I feel like I’m being a burden.’ As for ‘safeguards’,the ban on assisting suicide could be seen as the ‘safeguard’that allowed Parliament to decriminalise suicide in 1961. It has taken a while, but finally, in 2024, we have ‘come the long way round’ to dismantling that particular safeguard – arguably the most important. And among all the reasons why the Leadbeater Bill is so risky is that noted byformer Chief Coroner Thomas Teague.Hesaysthe bill is unsafe for the very fact that it removes the statutory duty to investigate suicides. You do need even have to ponder that for 30 seconds to compute the implications. Unlike in other jurisdictions that legalised ‘assisted dying’ with out any evidence from other countries and now find themselves a long way down the slippery slope, our politicians have no excuse. Most seem to have decided to ignore the red flags from abroad, voting in favour of the Bill for ideological reasons instead of heeding the evil practical consequences and swerving at the last minute. This puts one in mind of lemmings, but in this case it will likely not be them who end up plunging over the cliff – rather it will be the weakest and most vulnerable in society. With the legal guardrails torn down, there will be no protection – nothing to defend them from the siren call of suicide. As Conservative MP Danny Kruger, previously chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Dying Well,concluded in his speech during the debate on the Second Reading: ‘I’m talking about the people who lack agency: the people who know what it is to be excluded from power, to have decisions made for them by bigwigs in distant offices speaking a language they don’t understand . . . Not the ones who write to us campaigning for a change in the law, but the people who come to our surgeries with their lives in tatters, or who the police and social workers tell us about, the people with complex needs. What are the safeguards for them? I will tell you. We are the safeguards. This place. This Parliament. You and me. We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm, and yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.’ It is highly appropriate that this Bill should have passed its second reading on ‘Black Friday’, but there is still time to raise our voices in warning against this disaster waiting to happen, while we still can command our voices – enabling our long island story to have a happy ending, rather than history recording that ‘they all died unhappily ever after’.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-01T01:16:00+00:00,Features,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/still-time-to-pull-back-from-slippery-suicide-slope/
This sneaky assisted-suicide Bill strikes against decency and genuine choice,"‘The Rubicon is a very small stream, but on the other side of it is a very different world, a worse world, with a very different idea of human value’ –Danny Kruger MP. THE BILL to legalise state-assisted suicide has been passed at its second reading in the Commons by 330 votes to 275.The legislative momentum suggests that, subject to further scrutiny and amendment, the Bill will eventually become an Act of law. Parliamentary procedure is always glacial. We should take little comfort in this. The principle that life is sacred was itself euthanised on Friday, and that happened quickly enough. The Establishment patsy Kim Leadbeater introduced her Bill before morning coffee. It was voted through by afternoon tea.From her performance, which included a forced apology for misleading the House, you’d be forgiven for concluding she hadn’t had time to read it. And yes, I’m going to call this ‘assisted suicide’and not ‘assisted dying’because I think it fair that those who are effecting this change should be held to account for it. If the harpy avatars of the latest statist death cult are ‘offended’ by my choiceof language, that’s excellent. It is an obligation arising from charity to give offence to those who are keen to take it. You’d think they’d be careful with the rehearsed pearl-clutching, come to think of it. The sponsors of the Bill insist that the legal ‘safeguards’ are robust and crystal clear. This is not convincing when at the same time they presume to be able to change the meaning of words by fiat. A quick comment on those safeguards. Their ostensible purpose is to prevent the practical application of a subsequent Act from being expanded in scope beyond the clearly stated provisions of that Act. Their real function, of course, is to act as markers for the future attention of activist lawyers. The ‘safeguards’ are like a Mafia kiss: intended to hide malicious intent with insincere reassurance. The Bill which was voted through on Friday embeds not immutable protections so much as mechanisms of useful ambiguity. Useful, that is, for those who are greasing the slippery slope. What makes an illness terminal? Why limit the prognosis to six months? Why not eighteen? Who counts as a ‘person of good standing’? Will the local traffic warden do? Etc. Parliamentary supporters of this legislation have a stated aim, one which sounds laudable. They wish to give back ‘choice’ to those people robbed of it by illness and circumstance. A person in great pain, and with no hope of remission from that pain, who has been failed by end-of-life care, or for whom palliative relief is ineffective, is owed by society this much at least: to be able to choose to die instead. That argument has an almost irresistible emotional force, and that is why as anargumentwe must be wary of it. It is so obvious to us that freedom is a good thing that we rarely ask what this axiomatically good thing is. Which is the better view of personal freedom: that it is just the ‘right’ to do as we wish? Or that it is more than this: that it is the ability to do what weought? It seems to me that those who think the state should have this role in terminating the life of a person need to answer two questions: ‘what is the state?’ and ‘what is a person?’ So far, they’ve failed to address either. We can assess the nature and role of the UK state by looking at how it discharged its duty of care during lockdown, when it showed its commitment to citizen autonomy by cancelling it and by mind-screwing us with prepared strategies of disguised coercion. In addition, it attempted to force us to undergo untested medical interventions which probably killed or maimed a significant number of those whose trust it so casually abused. And the Establishment view of the human person, as assumed by the ghastly midwit metaphysics of Kim Leadbeater, is that we are atomised calculating machines, who navigate the complexities of life in a sort of vacuum, insulated from the wider social consequences of the ‘choices’ it is our ‘right’ to make. Suffering is an unwanted but essential ingredient in a life worth living. That statement is obnoxious to the secular mind because that mind makes no room for the possibility of redemption through spiritual and physical pain. Yet it is a trivial truth to a mind which has been gifted the grace of faith. Where Leadbeateret alsee the suffering person as a burden, some of us see him as an opportunity for love. The philosopher Wittgenstein remarked that death is not an event in life, that we do not live to experience it. There are some things, he suggested, that are true but not statable. When we talk about the ethics of end-of-life care, we are operating at the very limits of what can be said. When you bring the state into that discussion you also grant admission to the cost-benefit fetishism that comprises the only language it understands. Its worldview is utilitarian, and utilitarianism is only capable of identifying and amplifying those features of a situation which are morally irrelevant. There used to be a way of doing these things, one which involved the tacit ‘nod and a wink’. This was the way of kindness, responsive to the urgencies of the moment and in no need of the crude intrusions of state machinery. It was not perfect but to borrow from Danny Kruger’s excellent reply to Leadbeater, it kept us onthisside of the Rubicon. A final point on those speeches. Diane Abbott was superb in articulating the point mentioned above: that not all coercion is obvious, and that state-enabled killing will exploit the unspoken but real anxieties of the most vulnerable. It was a ray of light on a very dark day.",The Conservative Woman,2024-12-02T01:22:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/this-ghastly-assisted-suicide-bill-strikes-against-decency-and-genuine-choice/
COP29 reveals itself as the great fraud it always was,"WHATEVER perceptions have been conjured up in the past by the annual mega-junket that is the UN’s Conference Of the Parties on climate change, there can be no doubt this year’s COP29 descended into farce and ridicule. The puzzle is why it has taken so long for the vested interests who attend to begin to admit what it is – a massive stunt designed to fool the public into policies they would never otherwise support. The gathering of the world’s climate politicians, zealots, hustlers and grifters in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan – of all places – has finally tipped some, like Al Gore, over the edge because it sought to avoid discussing oil and gas production while secretly discussing sponsorship opportunities from oil and gas producers. The cult of Net Zero has its own Wizard of Oz resident in Azerbaijan, and the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the fraud being played on those believing the charade. Prior to its opening, Elnur Soltanov, Azerbaijan’s deputy energy minister and chief executive of COP29, was filmed by the campaign group Global Witness agreeing at the climate summit to facilitate oil or gas deals. It had posed undercover as a non-existent Hong Kong-based energy investment company willing to sponsor the event if it helped facilitate investment opportunities with Azerbaijan’s state energy firm, Socar. Mr Soltanov said he was open to discussions, including deals on oil and gas, and a few weeks later he emailed the Hong Kong front offering to help bring together the parties to a potential deal. The latest junket of cant and hypocrisy which generates its own vast emissions had already been off to a bad start when in its planning the Azerbaijan government of President Ilham Aliyev declared the event ‘The COP of Peace’. It was not so much a lack of self-awareness from the warmongering hosts as a laughable attempt at Orwellian newspeak, equivalent to framing North Korea as the land of feasting or Cuba as the destination of choice for a Pink Floyd light-show. It had been only a year before, in September 2023, that Azerbaijan military forces invaded the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, displacing 100,000 ethnic Armenians and making many others political prisoners, including several ministers of the former Armenian government of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan is an autocratic petrostate ruled with an iron fist by Ilham Aliyev, who took over from his father as president in 2003, following which he appointed his wife as vice-president. For context, Azerbaijan scored only seven out of 100 in Freedom House’s 2024 human-rights index – by comparison North Korea scored 3, Cuba 12, Russia 13 and the UK 91. In contrast Armenia scored 54. After Europe announced it was abandoning Russian gas because of Putin’s war in Ukraine, the European Parliament approved sanctions against President Aliyev and other Azeri government officials over their offensive against the Armenians – but the European Commission refused to implement them. Instead, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen flew to Baku, hailing the country as ‘a crucial energy partner’. The reason became obvious when the Financial Times and Sunday Times reported Azerbaijan had increased imports of Russian gas specifically to meet commitments made to EU countries looking for ‘non-Russian’ sources of gas in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. For many the sanctions were a pretence all along. All this bodes ill for mainly Christian Armenia, landlocked and of no strategic significance, sandwiched between Turkey to the west and Azerbaijan to the east – with Iran at the southern end of the Caspian Sea and Russia to the northern shore. Since the end of the Cold War and its escape from Soviet rule Armenia has been on a journey, pivoting toward the West and looking for friends. Unfortunately, so long as politicians in the UK, Europe and the US are happy to cavort with despots throwing their petrodollars around, Armenia will find doors repeatedly closing. If Western leaders had any interest in COP29 becoming a ‘COP of Peace’ they would have insisted President Aliyev sign a peace deal with Armenia in advance of the summit and release the remaining Armenian prisoners of war and political hostages held in Baku. But our Western leaders would rather posture on peace while closing their own energy-intensive industries and exporting those jobs to China and India while importing competitors’ products dependent on new coal-powered power stations – currently opening in China at the rate of two a week. The hour before dawn is always the darkest and coldest, the saying goes, so it is no surprise to find the UK, irrespective of the incumbent Government party, still charging ahead looking for a world leadership role at COP29. With Ed Miliband bringing a fresh dogmatic zeal to UK Net Zero initiatives, the consequent stupendous waste of public funds was highlighted by the Daily Mail revealing the UK had 470 expenses-paid delegates at the Baku beano, compared to 405 from the US, 437 from Italy, 325 from Germany and 115 from France. With sweet irony, COP29 coincided with the stunning victory of the climate realist Donald Trump as 47th President of the United States, giving focus to a crisis of confidence among those in the West driving toward Net Zero. Even before this seismic electoral turning point the number of academics willing to challenge the settled science of anthropogenic global warning has been rising. Hopefully COP29 will be recognised as different from the past summits because its curtain has been pulled back to reveal all the double dealing and empty rhetoric about ‘peace’ and the climate ‘crisis’. If that strengthens the resolve of Donald Trump to admonish Western democracies for killing their own industries to the benefit of autocratic powers we’ll have at least something to thank it for. Whatever one thinks about the role of man in creating a climate catastrophe, the West’s pursuit of Net Zero economies will achieve no impact against Asia’s drive to accelerate its use of carbon-reliant energy and industrial output. COP29 is no festival of peace, but neither will it save the planet from a climate ‘crisis’ – what it may well do is help reveal what a self-serving circus the Conference of the Parties has always been. Could the return of Trump and the hypocrisy of COP29 make 2024 the year the West finally wakes up to its climate self-delusion? Let us hope it is the beginning of a new dawn.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-23T01:17:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/cop29-reveals-itself-as-the-great-fraud-it-always-was/
David Keighley was right. Everything he warned about hate crime has come to pass,"IT WAS a full seven years ago on October 17, 2017, that David Keighley warned on these pages of the latest of Theresa May’s ‘victim’ obsessions – hate crime. Elevating hate crime was part of her Tory ‘detoxifying’ programme – aka her full-scale shift of the party (and the then Government) towards progressive left woke thinking and culture, an appeasement that her colleagues shamefully ‘sucked up’. Fromrace audits(into 130 aspects of life no less) to transgenderism, whichshe and her Equalities Ministers promoted, to hate crime, May pushed a poisonous rhetoric driven by the ideology of identity politics. Her Government’sNational Hate Crime Awareness Weekthat October, was a full-scale effort, David reported at the time. It involved the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups(many in receipt of government grants). Centre stage in that campaign, of course, was the BBC: ‘True to form’, David wrote, the BBC ‘produced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote, of course – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over on This Week,the BBC then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that “the white race” is “the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth”.’ But for an email from David responding to Janice Davis’s article, ‘What’s the real reason they are going after Allison Pearson?‘ on Wednesday, reminding me of it, I might have forgotten where this all began and who was responsible. Yes, it was a Conservative Government that facilitated the hate crime process as part of its then anti-Brexit propaganda manoeuvres. This was when the selective hate crime culture we are now locked in kicked off. Today, and once more with the full backing of the BBC, he noted, the Labour Government is intensifying its attack on dissenters from its Islamist/communist and DEI missions. In fact not a week passes without theBBC fuelling this dystopian cultureor encouragingso called ‘victims’ to press their complaintsin what can only be described as a targeted tyranny. As David said to me in his email, almost everything he warned about ‘has now come to pass in spades’. How right he is. And it should surely be obvious to all but the dimmest that although, as Suella Braverman says, ‘the subjective nature of non-crime hate incidents makes them unworkable‘, Labour’s Politburo simply doesn’t care. In fact the subjectivity and irrationality is the point. Hate crime can be targeted politically well suiting a Government determined to ‘crack down’ on ‘Islamophobia’. Any hope for Braverman’s attempt to rescind any of the hate crime legislation died with Labour’s return to power. Yvette Cooper in true Pol Pot style is only interested in policelogging hate crimes more efficiently, lumping anti-semitism with the artificialIslamophobiaconstruct as though they were morally and ontologically equivalent. They are not. Below is David’s spot-on,full original article.It should make salutary reading for former and current Tory voters. *** EYES and ears open, everyone, and anti-prejudice antennae out! It’snational hate crime awareness week. This is a full-scale effort, involving the Crown Prosecution Service, police forces, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice, andsundry anti-race hate groups, many of which are taxpayer-funded, to tell us that we are all miserable sinners. ‘Hate’ in this context covers such crimes generally – against the disabled, religions, different sexual orientations, and race – but the principal focus is on race because the bulk of such crimes (78 per cent, according to latest Home Office data) fall into this category. Centre stage in this campaign, of course, is the BBC. True to form, last week itproduced aPanoramaprogrammein which sinister Brit thugs – fired up by the Brexit vote – were attacking anyone from the EU they could find.Over onThis Week, they then gave a platform to a transgender person who declared that ‘the white race’ is ‘the most violent and oppressive force of nature on earth’. Aiding the Corporation?Step forward Superintendent Paul Giannasi OBE, the National Hate Crimes Coordinator, who runs for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) the portal for reporting hate crime. No, he is not a secret member of UKIP. Rather,he is part of a Facebook group called ‘We Love Europe’, and boy, does he. Mr Giannasi believes that the Brexit vote was a change ‘unwanted and unexpected’, an ‘expression of the tyranny of democracy’ which was ‘caused by political arrogance, thirst for power, idiotic fears, prejudice, bigotry and incredible stupidity’. And let’s not forget the special contribution of Hillary Rodham Clinton. On a book-plug visit, she was given oodles of BBC airtime to reject Brexit. Nasty populist Nigel Farage, she claimed,duped the British people with the ‘big lie’about topics such as immigration – and then went on to sabotage her own election as US President. In fact the BBC declared war on Brexit, using race hate claims as a main weapon, over a year ago. It was among the most avid in reporting an alleged ‘spike’ in such offences after June 23 (of which more later) and thenwrongly claimed on August 31that the death of a Polish man in Harlow was a ‘frenzied’ murder triggered by post-Brexit race hate. The message from all the agencies involved is clear. Bigoted white people are smashing skulls, wreaking havoc, subverting the democratic process, and their populist prejudices against other nationalities and other races are forcing the UK to abandon globalism and leave the EU. But what is the truth about ‘race hate’? Everything about the way it is framed and reported should send alarm bells about the veracity of any figures involved. First, it’s almost certainly the easiest crime on the statute book to register because, uniquely, alleged incidents are recorded by the police on a self-report basis via their specially-established website,True Vision(run by Supt Giannasi). All a ‘victim’ has to do is register the ‘crime’ – and hey presto, it’s in the stats. At a time when –as theSunreported this week– police forces are working flat-out to limit ‘by hundreds of thousands’ the number of recorded burglaries, shop thefts, and even minor assault charges, they are simultaneously transferring their efforts to the ‘hate crime’ domain.The key supporters of the Stop Hate UK charity, for example, include a clutch of police forces. Second, the definition of a ‘hate crime’ is unusually loose. Such an offence is deemed to have been committed if the victim, or any witness of the incident, thinks they have been subjected to ‘hate’. This ease of reporting has been accompanied by a mushrooming of associated interest groups,spearheaded by the government’s primary service provider, Capita, and this has no doubt contributed to the rising volume of ‘race hate’ claims. This ‘increase’ was trumpeted yet again this week in theannual hate crime figuresreleased by the Home Office, up to the end of March. True to form, theBBC’s report of the statisticsis accompanied by a picture of one of the sinister-looking Pole-hating thugs it had trawled Britain to find for its specialPanoramaedition. These statistics show that there has indeed been a rise in recorded hate crime, from 62,518 in 2015-16 to 80,393 in 2016-17. But in the context of the lax self-report procedures, what does this prove? Does it reflect a rise in actual incidents? Or perhaps far more likely – in tandem with the vast amounts of money being spent in this arena, combined with publicity from the BBC, and the Remain faction generally – simply that there is increased awareness that such ‘crimes’ can be reported? Whatever the reason, Amber Rudd’s Home Office was keen to stress the alleged ‘spike’ in race attacks and crimes after June 23 last year because of the Brexit vote. But drill down deeper into the report, and it quickly emerges that this, too, must be treated with a great pinch of salt because it is, to quote the report, based only on ‘anecdotal evidence’. These figures fail another vital acid test. The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for bringing hate crimes to court andmade clear in its annual report, also published this week, that this is a major priority. What do the stats show? Well, in the last year – despite everything noted above – the number of hate crime prosecutions fell by almost 1,000 over the previous year to 14,480. In other words, the number of so-called hate crimes with sufficient evidence to go to court is in sharp decline, despite all the resources and efforts being expended. On that basis, of the 80,000 race hate ‘crimes’ reported toTrue Vision, only about 18 per cent will be tested in court. And the reaction?This BBC reportemphasises in great detail the rise in number of recorded ‘crimes’, does not enumerate the fall in prosecutions, and has a long sequence about a Muslim ‘victim’ who concludes: ‘I really think it’s important for us to report, no matter what.’ Of course.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/david-keighley-was-right-everything-he-warned-about-hate-crime-has-come-to-pass/
The climate scaremongers: BBC admits it lied about vanishing polar bears ,"IN AUGUST, the BBC published anews itemabout a Canadian worker killed by two polar bears. The article claimed: ‘There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government. The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.’ No doubt in BBC-world they actually believe that polar bears are dying out. It is, after all, an article of faith for the global warming cult. However, far from declining, the world’s population of polar bears has tripled since the 1960s, thanks to the ban on hunting in 1973.  The BBC have now formally upheld the complaint I submitted at the time, and have posted this on theirComplaints Page: Complaint A reader challenged a statement in this article which claimed that the global population of polar bears was in decline.  The ECU [Executive Complaints Unit] considered whether it met the standards of due accuracy set out in the BBC Editorial Guidelines. Outcome The article reported on the death of a worker who was attacked by two polar bears in Canada’s northern Nunavut territory.  It said such attacks are rare and continued as follows: ‘There are about 17,000 polar bears living in the country – making up around two-thirds of the global population of the species, according to the Canadian government.  The species is in decline, and scientists attribute it to the loss of sea ice caused by global warming – leading to shrinking of their hunting and breeding grounds.’ Research carried out by the ECU confirmed scientists agree climate change will cause a reduction in sea ice, which is likely to have a long-term detrimental effect on polar bears and overall population numbers. There are also considerable challenges in obtaining reliable data. However evidence from the Canadian Wildlife Service and the Polar Bear specialist group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature appears to suggest numbers are stable overall at present and not in decline as stated. Upheld Further action The finding was reported to the Board of BBC News and discussed with the editorial team concerned. UK climate has changed little in recent years THE Global Warming Policy Foundation has just published my annual review of UK weather trends, based on official data. As in previous years, it finds no evidence that our weather is becoming more extreme, or that, as the Met Office recently claimed, ‘the UK’s climate continues to change’. The report’s findings include: • Following a rise in temperatures in the 1990s and early 2000s, average temperatures have barely increased since 2007. • A Met Office study in 2006 found strong evidence that this earlier rise was linked to increased sunshine, possibly the result of reduced air pollution thanks to the Clean Air Acts of the 1960s and 70s. (The report has since been buried). • The number of days with extreme temperatures has actually fallen since the 1970s, with fewer extreme cold days outnumbering more hot ones. • Average annual rainfall in England and Wales has increased since the 1960s, but is at similar levels to other periods pre-1960. • Summers are not becoming drier, as consistently projected by the Met Office. • Rainfall is not growing more extreme, whether on an annual, monthly or daily basis. • Sea levels around Britain are gradually rising at the same rate they were a century ago. • Wind storms have been declining in both frequency and intensity since the 1990s. Britain’s weather is notoriously volatile, and can change dramatically from year to year. Any underlying, long-term changes are dwarfed by natural variability. The full report can bedownloaded here. But it is worth taking a quick look at a few of the charts. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words! First, temperatures. We can see that temperatures have been rising since the 17th Century, long before ‘global warming’. It is also worth noting that winter has seen the biggest increase. In contrast summer temperatures have barely risen since the 1700s: Secondly, rainfall. As noted above, we are currently going through a wetter than average period, but no wetter than other periods, such as the 1870s and 1920s. The second chart also dispels the myth that rainfall is becoming more extreme. Finally, sea levels. We are constantly told that sea levels are rising so fast that cities will be under water by the end of the century. The actual data tell a different story. Around Britain’s coasts, seas have been rising at less than 2mm a year, just as they have been since the Little Ice Age ended in the late 19th century.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-22T01:15:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-bbc-admits-it-lied-about-vanishing-polar-bears/
A vaccine volunteer’s heartrending chronicle of a life destroyed,"A WOMAN who suffered a severe adverse reaction during Oxford- AstraZeneca’s covid vaccine trial was so badly injured that it was four months before she could walk again. Within an hour of receiving the jab she developed paraesthesia, an autoimmune condition that attacks the nerves. It left her in excruciating pain, unable to eat, and so sensitive to light and noise that she was confined to a darkened room with sunglasses and earplugs. A mother of two young children, Brianne Dressen, from Utah, USA, considered suicide to stop the pain, a common reaction in the vaccine-injured community. Her husband Dr Brian Dressen, who has a PhD in chemistry, and children Cooper and Hannah kept her going, although at one time even a cuddle from them was too painful. For months, Mrs Dressen, who received the trial vaccine in November 2020, could not bear anything moving near her or touching her body, and the children were instructed to stay out of the spare room where she spent her days and slept. Hannah came in one day, curled around her mother promising, ‘Mommy, I won’t speak. I’ll be less wiggly. Please let me lie here next to you. Just for a bit. I’ll be good. I miss you.’ Mrs Dressen was 39 then, a preschool teacher who ran her own nursery school. She had no choice but to text her husband to ask him to retrieve their daughter. Despite her best efforts, Hannah was too young to stay still, and her chatter felt like ‘a knife cutting through my brain; the feeling of her snuggling up to me was too much,’ Mrs Dressen said. Hannah was six when her mother was vaccine-injured, and her brother Cooper was eight. Now ten and 12, they no longer remember a time that their mother was not ill. Mrs Dressen, now 43, who is unable to work and permanently disabled, said: ‘This has been incredibly traumatic for them, and they wear my pain in their hearts. You can see it in their faces and hear it in the things they say. They try and be strong and happy for me and I try and be strong and happy for them, but it’s not easy. This time of year, they say, “Mom, I really want you to be better by Christmas.” Or “I think I’m done with you being sick, I’m ready for you to be better”.’ Before Oxford-AstraZeneca destroyed their lives the Dressen family were immersed in their close-knit community. When lockdowns hit, they focused on helping others cope with the grim isolation and fear, and spent hours painting animal faces on small rocks to cheer people up. Mrs Dressen said: ‘We would go around the neighbourhood and place the pet rocks somewhere on people’s front yards, ring doorbells and run away, smiling at the thought of our friends finding these cute little gifts.’ Before she was injured, Mrs Dressen was active and sporty. She hiked, snowboarded, swam, and climbed mountains with her  husband, now 47. Her older sister, an obstetrician who was on the front line during covid, recounted a story which made Mrs Dressen  determined to do her bit. A woman pregnant with twins was admitted to her hospital. She was miscarrying and haemorrhaging, with clots in her placenta caused by covid. While Mrs Dressen’s sister saved the mother, the premature twins were dying with no one to hold them. Most healthcare workers were told to stay home during the pandemic leaving only emergency cover. There was a frantic hunt to find any staff who could cuddle the twins as their lives ebbed away. This tragedy had a profound effect on Mrs Dressen, who had always believed in vaccination. When Facebook published a form asking for volunteers to test AstraZeneca’s new covid jab, she immediately applied. The form was simple and asked for her name, profession, location and contact details and she was invited to participate subject to health checks, which she passed. Later, Mrs Dressen joined thousands of the vaccine-injured in one of many Facebook support groups that popped up globally. The groups were lifelines for those struggling with injury and desperately seeking information for any effective treatment. In June 2021, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his team deleted all but one of the groups after Senator Ron Johnson hosted a vaccine-injured press conference in Milwaukee, despite the fact Johnson made it clear in his opening remarks that all attendees were pro-vaccine. They had all taken the shots. Mrs Dressen developed more and more symptoms that doctors are unable to explain. Tinnitus accompanied by excruciating loud screeching. Insomnia. Nausea, worse than either of her two pregnancies. She lost control of her bladder and developed constipation. She struggled to eat and lost 20lb while her legs turned to jelly and she could barely walk. Her heart became erratic, alternating between slowing to an alarmingly low rate that made her feel faint, then speeding up in a way that had never happened while she was doing sports. Doctors were ‘baffled’. Electric shocks surged through her body causing constant unbearable pain. Most days, she felt she was being electrocuted from head to toe. Only strong painkillers such as benzodiazepines, gabapentin or pregabalins helped. But the medication made her completely incoherent. As a trial participant, Mrs Dressen was reassured that if anything went wrong, AstraZeneca – whose trial was suspended temporarily because of serious side effects – would provide full support and pay for any doctors’ bills. This is clearly written in the consent form and a reason she signed, despite misgivings. She was also told if she became ill, the study doctor and AstraZeneca would arrange treatment. AstraZeneca had an insurance policy that would cover all costs. Side effects were mostly referred to as ‘mild’ or ‘moderate’, with a few considered ‘severe’. Most appeared within 48 hours of the injection but resolved within seven days, she was told. A sore arm, chills, headache, and fatigue were common. Not so common was a decrease in infection-fighting and/or clot-forming blood cells, reactions acknowledged as having occurred. In the consent form Mrs Dressen read that in animal trials, monkeys developed antibody dependent enhancement, meaning that they had a worse covid infection post-vaccine, but the trial investigator who went through the consent form with her told her this had not been verified. Some serious ‘rare’ reactions were flagged; these included anaphylaxis, which trial staff were trained to handle, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Its symptoms were not listed but include muscle weakness and tingling in the limbs or upper body. GBS could lead to paralysis or death, she discovered. Mrs Dressen had not heard of GBS so assumed it was really rare, but it was something that made her hesitate. She planned to go home and think whether she really wanted to go ahead but at the trial centre in Salt Lake County, after taking her medical history and blood samples, she was told she could receive the experimental vaccination there and then. Despite feeling uneasy, Mrs Dressen thought it would be worth it if she could help prevent more people suffering like the poor mother who lost her twins. The purpose of the trial was never to see if the vaccine would prevent people catching covid, it was to check that they would not become dangerously ill with it. Mrs Dressen received her shot on November 4, 2020. By then, 5,000 people had received at least one dose, and 30 people had received a second. Her severe adverse reaction (SAE) began within the hour. The independent trial centre, 40 minutes from her home, which Mrs Dressen describes as shabby and run-down, acted as middleman between trial participants and AstraZeneca. She called them the morning after she was vaccinated and filled in her symptoms in an app they provided. For 48 hours she heard nothing back. They finally rang and told her a neurologist should check to see if she had any underlying conditions but they did not offer to pay. The neurologist found nothing. The trial centre alerted AstraZeneca who never contacted Mrs Dressen or offered any help, breaking the terms of their contract. The family quickly realised they were on their own and Dr Dressen began researching papers on vaccine injury to find answers and help for his wife. Despite 60 appointments with doctors, four visits to ER, and one hospital admission, all in year one, which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, AstraZeneca offered Mrs Dressen just $590 to cover her expenses, and that was only after her story broke in local media. When a national news story ran, she was offered a $1,250 payment that they said would absolve the company of any future liability. Mrs Dressen refused and, as she faces crippling medical bills for life, had no choice but to sue AstraZeneca for breach of contract. Because of America’s National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which indemnifies vaccine manufacturers, she was unable to claim injury compensation despite being diagnosed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with post-vaccine neuropathy. The Department of Health and Human Services run a taxpayer-funded vaccine injury compensation scheme which rejects around 98 per cent of all claims. Mrs Dressen has applied and says the calls she has had with them so far are already preparing her for rejection. In May 2024, she filed a lawsuit against AstraZeneca claiming breach of contract and failure to provide medical care. Mrs Dressen won this month but the company have appealed citing the 1986 Act, claiming no liability. Mrs Dressen has made some recovery but maintaining her health is a daily battle and she says her injury is progressive. ‘I taught myself acceptance therapy to deal with that,’ she said. Her message to Oxford University’s Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert, who co-developed the vaccine with the Oxford Vaccine Group and AstraZeneca, is: ‘I wish you could have been there when my life was ripped away from me, and I wish that you were there for the tens of thousands who came after me.’ AstraZeneca did not respond to requests for comment.

"Muslim rioters rampage with police blessing: Today Amsterdam, tomorrow Britain?","ISRAEL is on the front line in the fight against the Islamists. But now we share that front line. The Islamists go first for the Saturday people and then the Sunday people. The violent organised mass attack by Muslims –mostly Moroccans with an admixture of assorted non-Moroccan Arabs as well as Turks– against Jewish and Israeli fans of the Maccabi Tel Aviv football club in Amsterdam two weeks ago is another expression of the anti-Israel/anti-Semitic sentiment infecting our own country, using the Israel/Palestine issue as the ‘acceptable’ excuse for anti-Semitic hatred and rage. So too was the weekend’s violent Palestinian protest in Montreal. Emboldened by the Canadian Prime Minister’s announcement that he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu for alleged war crimes (therebysidingwith Iran and opposing the United States), the protesters descended intoviolence and anarchy, chanting for Israel’s demise, threatening a new Holocaust of Jews, and throwing Hitler salutes at bystanding Jews. It left Montreal’s Jewish community shaken and fearful for their safety; their leaders comparing it to historical anti-Semitic attacks. Amsterdamwas a planned attack, with rioters travelling from outside the city to join in. The full-scale violence began after the match, co-ordinated by Muslim taxi drivers who had mapped out the hotels where the Maccabi supporters were staying, and gave a running commentary on the locations of the Maccabi supporters during the attacks. There arereports of police collusion and participation in the attacks. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is a former Dutch politician, has talked about the takeover of Amsterdam’s internal security apparatus: ‘Today, a large part of the Amsterdam police force is made up of second-generation migrants from North Africa and the Middle East.’ One of the fans who was attacked said: ‘The Dutch chief of police says officers are human being[s] and they can enforce the law however they want. He gave a legal right to the police not to protect us.’  Regarding the Muslim attackers, he added: ‘They want to apply the Sharia law all over Europe.They will kill us, you, everyone. We know this, and Europe needs to as well.’ The Israeli government sent planes to the Netherlands to take Israeli citizens home. Local Jews organised transport to the airport as taxis were not deemed safe for Israelis. Around the same time as the Amsterdam attacks, Belgian police arrested six suspects who were allegedly planning an Amsterdam-inspired ‘Jew hunt’ in Antwerp, andteenagers in a Jewish youth football team were attacked by a knife-wielding pro-Palestine mob in Berlin– ‘hunted down’ by Arab youths. The Berlin police chief hasadmitted Berlin is not safe for ‘openly gay’ or Jewish people: ‘Unfortunately, there are certain neighbourhoods where the majority of people are of Arab descent, who also have sympathies for terrorist groups.’ How many police chiefs in the UK would openly admit to such ‘no-go’ zones here, or that dozens of Sharia courts are allowed to operate freely and give out ‘Islamic’ judgments to Muslims living in UK communities? Internationally, inflammatory pronouncements such as that from UNICEF that the Israeli UNRWA ban ‘means a new way has been found to kill children’, or the announcement thatCanada is reaching out to ‘allies’ in its quest to recognise a Palestinian state, can only give further encouragement to jihadists.The UN has voted to stop Israel defending certain parts of its own territory,and to force it to withdraw entirely from key areas that serve to make its country defendable against its enemies and direct attack. The thinking appears to be that Israel should not be allowed to fight back. Perversely October 7 was the trigger that released this new anti-Semitic onslaught against all Jewry, and all those who stand in defence of Israel and its legitimate place in history, in what must be one of the most egregious act of victim-blaming in history. In March this year I wrote:‘How much longer will it be before I will need to go to Israel to look a Jew in the eye, because there are none left in the UK?’As the year has progressed, I have seen nothing to change that view. Indeed, after the installation of the Labour government of Two-Tier Keir Starmer and election of several independent Muslim Vote MPs, my fear increased. Now, with the Prime Minister Starmer’s shocking backing for the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli PM Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, it has doubled. It can but give direct encouragement to Hamas in particular and Islamist ambitions in general. UK politicians have also given credence to the lie that Israel is now the unwarranted aggressor in its conflict with Hamas,recently voting at the UN Security Councilto impose a ceasefire on Israel (vetoed by the US) with no dependent clause for Hamas to release the hostages it kidnapped on October 7. This is despite clear evidence that theformer head of UNRWA repeatedly met and expressed unity with Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders and let them influence UNRWA operations; that UNRWA employees took part in the October 7 atrocities; and despite that Hamas-originatedinflated casualty numbers and Israel deliberately starving Gazansare based onon liesand propaganda – in a word, faked. What happened in Amsterdam on November 7 and in Montreal this weekend is a warning of what could come to Britain in the not-too-distant future. Is this what we want in this country? Do we stand aside as Israel-haters continue to pack our streets, populate social media with anti-Semitic and hate-inciting bile, and whose representatives sit in Parliament and local councils and undermine police neutrality? At the start of the Second World War the Dutch Jewish population was around 150,000. Three-quarters of them were murdered in Hitler’s extermination programme. The current core Jewish population is 30,000. The new Nazis of fashionable anti-Semitism – the fundamental Islamists in our midst, the woke, the intellectually deceived, and the purely ignorant – act as though they would like to continue the work of 1930s and 1940s Nazis across Europe and in the UK. For UK and European Jews, surely all roads must now lead to Israel. But where do the rest of us go, once the Saturday people have departed, and it’s the turn of the Sunday people?",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:18:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/muslim-rioters-rampage-with-police-blessing-today-amsterdam-tomorrow-britain/
"A warning shot writ large, but Putin won't attack the West","After a long period of steady grind, the tempo of the war in Ukraine has turned up several notches over the past week. Russian advances have continued in the Donbass, and the salient in the Kursk region (the 250 -square-mile  area anchored by the town of Sudzha), as I predicted inmy last article, is being slowly but surely strangled. Ukrainehas lost more than 40 per cent of the territory it seized in Russia’s Kursk region, France 24 reported on Saturday. The hot news, however, is the granting of permission by Britain for the use of ATACMS long-range missiles, which itself requires US permission because of access to targeting systems, and by the US for the use ofStorm Shadows. Why has this come about now? I suggest three main reasons. First, the Biden administration is trying its best to queer Donald Trump’s pitch by so irritating the Russians that any diplomatic intervention after January will fail. Secondly, and perhaps I am giving more credit than is deserved, there is a desire to shape a future peace deal by halting Ukraine’s slow defeat and putting Zelensky in a viable negotiating position. Third, from the point of view of Sir Keir Starmer, he is simply obeying his masters in the EU Commission and the WEF who for years have been desperate for a war with Russia, since the Russians despise them and all their works. Russia’s response was the launch of anOreshnik (‘Hazel’) intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM)on the town of Dnipro. (This has been wrongly reported as an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it is not.) The missile has aspeed above Mach 10, making interception difficult, and is capable of carrying a nuclear payload. Because of this, the standard procedures were activated through the National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center,by the Russians, 30 minutes before the launch to warn the US and NATO. There must have been something of a frisson for a minute or two when this was received because of its nuclear capability, but this was soon allayed when Dnipro failed to disappear in a mushroom cloud. Instead of a nuke, the missile was armed with multiple conventional warheads – six warheads each with six sub-munitions – capable of causing considerable but not catastrophic damage. It was, therefore, a warning shot writ very large. If the Ukrainians employ long-range weapons, it must expect that the same weapons will be used against them. What was behind this response? Putin knows, of course, that come January and the inauguration of President Trump the scenery will shift but before that, the Democrats and Starmer will do all they can to increase tensions. All he has to do is wait them out. However, there is bound to have been internal pressure on him to remind the West just who they are dealing with. The attack was followed by an announcement thatlarge-scale production of the missile will go ahead. Of course, one might say with some justification that Putin cannot really complain about foreign equipment being used against him by his enemy, when he is using Chinese, Iranian and North Korean equipment – and manpower. For this reason, as well as the need to wait Biden out, it is most unlikely that the Russians would attack US or British units and personnel on the ground – and they are there in Ukraine right now. Nor will any attack be launched against Nato territory unless Nato or one of its members initiated an attack. Nor is a first-use nuclear attack at all likely. Putin does not need to do this and in any case, why raise the stakes that high when you are winning? So, does this mean, as some writers are claiming, that the West is on a path which will inevitably lead to war with Russia? I would suggest not. First, history tells us that there is no such thing as inevitability. Secondly, no direct action can take place without US involvement. This will not happen. Biden does not control Congress, whose support he would need for such a move. More importantly, the Joint Chiefs’ principles, laid down at the start of hostilities, remain in place: that the war would be confined to the territory of Ukraine, that Ukraine would be given all material support required to defend itself, that the cohesion of Nato would be maintained and that there would be no direct US or Nato intervention. Added to this is the undoubted fact that public opinion throughout the West has shifted towards the need to end the war, in spite of what warmongers at governmental level may say. This extends to some governments too –in particular Hungary. The final improbability is that, aside from the US, no Nato nation is in a position to take the field against Russia with more than a few battalion-group sized battlegroups. Consider our own country: the Army is down to 85,000 regulars – probably fewer than that – of whom only about one-third are combat troops. The front-line tank fleet is a mere 140, the Warrior upgrade has been abandoned, the field artillery belongs on the Antiques Roadshow and air defence is absent. Logistic stocks have been denuded by supplying Ukraine and not replenished. Collective training standards are low and the vehicle fleet is in bad shape because of the lunatic programme of ‘whole fleet management’. The RAF is down to 12 combat squadrons. No doubt many officers and soldiers would do their best, but the remarks byRob Magowan, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, that if the British Army ‘was asked to fight tonight, it would fight tonight’are both untrue and disloyal – untrue because thefacts speak against him, and because the Secretary of State for Defence has already made the position clear; and disloyal because if he had the best interests of the country at heart, he would be telling politicians in no uncertain terms that their neglect over decades has brought the defence of our country to its knees.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-26T01:23:00+00:00,Editor's Pick,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/a-warning-shot-writ-large-but-putin-wont-attack-the-west/
My choice as world leader of the century? Netanyahu,"NOW THAT we are nearly a quarter of the way through the 21stcentury, it is interesting to speculate on who is the best world leader so far. With the advantage of hindsight, we can clearly recognise the great world leaders of the last century. In no particular order my list would include Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt, Konrad Adenauer, Yoshida Shigeru, Charles de Gaulle, Lee Kuan Yew, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping. These are the figures who put the world together again after the ravages of world war and socialism. Now for the runners and riders for my vote for best world leader of the 21stcentury. But first, a quick comment on the utterly useless. Some heralded Angela Merkel as an ‘Iron’ lady with a handbag – a woman in the Thatcher mould. There was no handbag. Instead, she carried a stiletto with which to knife her political rivals. An ace at political manoeuvre, Merkel’s energy and immigration policies have led to Germany’s current economic and social demoralisation. President Barack Obama was the standard-bearer of an evil totalitarian woke cult which has swept the world over the last decade. Instead of using his office to heal racial divisions, he stirred them up by provably false accusations of institutional racism. As a result, the corrupt and divisive Black Lives Matter movement was set in motion. Obama’s equally ghastly woke apostles were New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and Canada’s Justin Trudeau. Obama also aligned himself with the globalist interests of corporate America in taking a ‘just-get-over-it’ attitude to the workers of middle America. His foreign policy failures included a soft, ‘kick-the-can-down-the-road’ sort of nuclear deal with Iran. In Asia Obama was asleep at the wheel in failing to push back China’s military takeover of the South China Sea. All the while Obama and his wife Michelle exuded a repellent, narcissistic moral superiority. Xi Jinping also makes the bad leader list. Having established a personalisation of power not seen since Mao Zedong, Xi’s overly aggressive and ham-fisted attempt to bend Southeast Asia to his will in taking over the South China Sea as well as his bullying behaviour towards Taiwan has alienated the world. If Chinese leadership has been downright bad, the leaders of France have simply disappointed. Both Nicolas Sarkozy and Emmanuel Macron rode into office with pledges to reform the bloated state apparatus. They both failed utterly. Between their presidencies, Francois Hollande, the unlikely lothario, proved to be an inept windbag. But neither has British leadership got much to boast about. Prime Minister Tony Blair left a legacy of fake dossiers on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction which he used to justify what turned out to be a disastrous intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. His successor, Gordon Brown, gave every appearance of being a paranoid sociopath, and spent so much government funding in a failed attempt to get himself re-elected that his Chief Secretary to the Treasury left a note for his successor saying, ‘I’m afraid there is no money’. David Cameron ran away from his duty to implement the result of the referendum that he called on membership of the European Union. Sadly, thereafter the Conservative Party elected a trio of inept leaders: Theresa May, an overpromoted nonentity, Boris Johnson, a brilliant campaigner who was, as one of his many mistresses said to me recently, ‘completely unsuited to be a prime minister’, and Liz Truss, an inflexible monomaniac who self-destructed within days of taking office. So, who does that leave to claim the mantle of being the 21stcentury’s greatest leader? Narendra Modi would be on my shortlist. He is halfway toward a restructuring of an Indian economy that was built on the socialist legacy of Nehru’s Congress Party. Donald Trump’s current legacy is similarly half finished. Leaving aside his economic reforms, a highlight was the Abraham Accords, a reconciliation of Israel with the Arab states; it was a diplomatic triumph for which any other president would have won the Nobel Peace Prize. Viktor Orban is another leader of note; he has brilliantly developed his country’s economy and refused to kowtow to the socialist euro-elite. Judging by his performance in Davos, where he denounced the globalist elite to its face, Argentine president Javier Milei may well become South America’s Orban. Collectively the leaders of Switzerland, largely faceless to the world’s media, deserve recognition for running the most democratic and best managed country in Europe. However, my prize for world leader of the 21stcentury must go to Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, Israel’s leader for 16 of the last 27 years. This may come as a surprise to some, given the pervasive opprobrium that is heaped upon him by the liberal global media. Donald Trump apart, he is arguably the most reviled leader of his generation. Some of the criticism may be fair. He is arrogant, self-serving and narcissistic – typical political characteristics. Above all he is anti-left and anti-Palestinian, qualities that are inimical to a Western, and indeed Jewish, liberal elite which despises him. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, head of investment bank NM Rothschild, referred to him as ‘that appalling man’. Over the last few years Netanyahu has attracted further opprobrium by his government’s attempt to bring to heel a Supreme Court which, since the presidency of Aharon Barak in the 1990s, has become increasingly leftist and politicised, granting to itself the power to cancel laws and putting itself above the sovereignty of the elected Knesset. Netanyahu has also been heavily criticised for the failure of Israeli security to prevent Hamas’s gruesome attack on October 7. But surely opposition figures such as Benny Gantz or Naftali Bennett would have been similarly blindsided? It should be noted that nobody called for the resignation of F D Roosevelt after the failure of US intelligence in preventing Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Now let’s look at Netanyahu’s greatest success, one that is almost entirely overlooked by western media. More than anyone Netanyahu is responsible for Israel’s economic miracle which has made his country the world’s 13thwealthiest: GDP per capita has increased from US$17,000 to $58,200 since 2003. When Netanyahu became prime minister for the first time in 1996, Israel was a sclerotic socialist economy. In 2003 the public sector accounted for half of Israel’s GDP. This was anathema to Bibi who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology then worked for Boston Consulting Group. Apart from learning capitalism first-hand in the US, he took on board the libertarian values of Ayn Rand after reading her seminal novelThe Fountainheadon the recommendation of Yoni, his older brother. (Yoni Netanyahu was later killed by Palestinian terrorists while leading Israel’s special forces to liberate Jewish hostages at Entebbe Airport.) Taking a leaf out of Margaret Thatcher’s book, Netanyahu deregulated Israel’s foreign exchange controls which limited citizens to taking just $7,000 out of the country. To the shock of leftist economists, there was no capital flight. Instead, a floating exchange rate brought international funds flooding into Israel. There followed a highly successful privatisation programme, budgetary discipline and tax cuts. The government budget was curtailed, but not at the expense of infrastructure investment. This included a programme to increase the number of science and maths graduates by 50 per cent, laying the foundation for Tel Aviv to become the world’s third-most important tech hub. Netanyahu’s most important contribution to global leadership has been not in the realm of economics but global security. More than any other world leader he has stood steadfast in refusal to countenance a Palestinian state, whose component parts are currently run by terrorist groups, Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Neither of these groups will ever accept Israel’s existence. Netanyahu has always recognised that a two-state solution would exacerbate, not resolve, the region’s instability. The October 7 massacre of Jews demonstrated the accuracy of his understanding of the real nature of Hamas – an unreformable Jihadi death cult that is a menace not only to Israel but also the world. We should therefore be grateful for Netanyahu’s determination to destroy Hamas. Its demise would be a defeat for global Jihadism as important as the eradication of Al Qaeda and Isis. Failure would simply encourage a global Jihadist movement which is already embedded and emboldened in many Western countries. Netanyahu’s steadfast leadership in countering Palestinian terrorism is a beacon of hope in the world’s worst neighbourhood. This alone should win him our vote as the greatest world leader of his generation.

"Badenoch should listen to Clarkson, and learn","AT AN awards ceremony in 2004, Jeremy Clarkson decided to punch Piers Morgan in the head. We cannot say that this was Clarkson’s finest hour for the simple reason that he went one better and hit him again. As is the way of the English, the two subsequently became good friends. I mention this partly because it’s funny, partly in tribute to the recently departed street pugilistJohn Prescott,and partly because, as Mike Graham points out, Clarkson is a man this government really does not want to take on. Clarkson is a man whose talents go beyond the ability to handle himself. One of these is an ability bordering on genius to identify and trigger that class of people we call ‘perennially irritating’. He was working that magic again last week when he put in a bravura performance at the farmers’ rally. This took place in what used to be London. Clarkson brilliantly gave voice to the anxieties of farmers over the government’s announcement that Starmer’s commitment to agricultural exceptionalism was just something you say to groups of farmers before a general election. And what he really meant to say was that when in office he would dump on the farming community by scrapping Agricultural Property Relief. The BBC, and other representatives of the rentierlatteclasses were typically (and one suspects synthetically) outraged that a celebrity farmer should use his celebrity to talk about, well, farming. The usual suspects said their usual things and accused Clarkson of being a ‘tax dodger’ – as if that is a bad thing to be in a country where the government is as obnoxiously rapacious as the current shower. Now, doubtless only the necromancers who practise the dark arts of predictive economics are sufficiently well placed to spreadsheet the consequences of government reform in this area. And like Rachel Reeves, I am no economist. But the issues raised by this latest Treasuryvolte faceare not so much economic as moral,and any discussion of them must therefore range beyond the specific case of farming. A last testament is a bridge which links the dead to the living. It is a codified recognition of intergenerational affections and obligations. It is one of the practical requirements for Edmund Burke’s stable social order in which contracts exist not only between people who are here now but extend backwards in time to those who were here once and forward to those who are yet to be. It is improper for Rachel Reeves, or her possibly imminent successor, to act the part of troll on the farther side of that bridge, ready to shake down the beneficiaries of that legally formalised private intention. Inheritance tax is morally obnoxious whenever it is enforced. The government’s current embarrassment results from a failure to predict that farmers would be especially sensitive to this injustice. These are creative and intellectually nimble people, remember, and are wise to the hamfisted and ignorant intrusions of the state, irritations invariably effected by politicians who assume that what appears on their dinner plate is createdex nihiloby those wonderful people at Waitrose. Sir Roger Scruton was of less combustible temperament than Jeremy Clarkson, but like him he came to farming relatively late, having bought a smallholding in Wiltshire (not far from where I write this). Scruton was an activist as well as a thinker, and from this rural base he wrote of the need for conservatism, and its representative writers and defenders, to recapture a ‘spirit of place’; to affirm (in the language of David Goodhart) that it might be better to be a resident ofsomewherethan a citizen ofanywhere. My friend, the philosopher Ferenc Horcher, writing about Scruton’s conservatism remarks that: ‘[Scruton] claims that politics as we know it depends on settlement, admitting the need of human beings to be connected to a place and an appreciation of the customs of that place and its inhabitants.’ * Conservatism speaks to this need for settlement, or at least it ought to. And philosophers of conservatism should be sympathetic to the tradition of farming and reinsert it as an essential reference point in the conservative case. To farm a piece of land is actively to reassert a commitment tothis territory. Farming places value in neighbourliness, valorises family, and encourages an unsentimental and therefore genuine attitude towards domestic, working and other animals. It inculcates a realistic respect for our environment (without resorting to the Gaia idolatry of the net zero fanatics) and acknowledges thatthis placeis a gift which needs stewardship and therefore conservation. The farmer is attuned to seasonality and the cycles of the earth and therefore sees time and its passing through a lens which makes the ‘deadlines’ of politicians appear ridiculous. Just before she became this year’s Leader of the Opposition, Kemi Badenoch wrote the preface to a pamphlet outlining a way forward for her unhappy party. The document is detailed in terms of policy, or as detailed as could be expected following her party’s recent reversals. I suggest she ditches it. Her job is not to persuade the electorate with policy proposals. It is to capture its imagination with an idea. That idea should be the prosecution of the environmental case, as exemplified by the plight of our farmers. Conservatives need to reclaim the argument when it comes to conservation, to promote the local over the global, and to revivify Scruton’s ‘spirit of place’. The case for the environment should be removed from those whom Danny Kruger refers to as ‘climate eschatologists’, and brought back home to where it belongs: at the centre of conservative philosophy. Such is my unsolicited advice for Mrs Badenoch: political success is usually found in the articulation and repetition of a simple vision, one which enlists the sympathies of the least loud yet most wise. The last week has given her an opportunity to bring back genuine conservatism, because the traditions of the farm are active instantiations of conservative values, properly described. She could even count on the unwitting support of Ed Miliband, whose vindictiveness if fully implemented will see us back in the Dark Ages, but without the good bits. *See Ferenc Horcher’s excellentArt and Politics in Roger Scruton’s Conservative Philosophy.Scruton’s account of setting up his farm is the subject of his intellectual memoirNews from Somewhere.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-25T01:20:00+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/badenoch-should-listen-to-clarkson-and-learn/
The farm raid that mobilised Amish behind Bad Orange Man,"The catastrophic failure of the Democrats in the recent USA election which resulted in the triumph of the Bad Orange Man has had a fallout of comic proportions. Many conservatives have been metaphorically ‘bathing in liberal tears’ as the realisation hits the wokerati that what was unimaginable has happened. Social media has been full of progressive women shaving their heads and wearing blue bracelets in order to identify the ideologically pure with whom they can sit and commiserate now that they have entered into the realms of ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’. Some have gone so far as to swear off sex for the next four years, which at least has the upside that there might be fewer abortions. It is entertaining to speculate on the emotional wellbeing of all the Hollywood celebrities who are waking up to the harsh reality that ordinary Americans don’t care about their political opinions and have rejected their electoral advice and instructions, for which it emerges the Harris campaign paid them handsomely. Questions are being asked about when all the celebrities who vowed they were going to leave the USA in the event of a Trump victory are actually going to up sticks. That one has an easy answer. Never. They will still be around in 2028 when it will be J D Vance’s turn to usher in the right-wing apocalypse which will destroy democracy, instal a dictatorship and force them to leave the USA. Of more interest are the reasons being given for the Trump victory. Voting patterns are being assessed and fault apportioned. It seems that Black men in large numbers have voted against their own best interests, as have Latinos, Indians and even Native Americans. Minority groups have seen a swing towards Republicans and away from woke. Who would have thought that labelling Republicans as white supremacists, Nazis, fascists and Trump as ‘literally Hitler’ would have no effect whatsoever? Progressives are scratching their heads and muttering, ‘They’re not doing what we tell them to do. It’s almost as though these people believe they can think for themselves.’ Prior to the electionPew Research Centrefound that 82% of white evangelical Protestants, 61% of white Catholics and 58% of white non-evangelical Protestants backed Trump, while Harris was backed by 86% of Black Protestants, 85% of atheists, 78% of agnostics, 65% of Hispanic Catholics and 65% of Jewish voters. Although it is early to say it would appear that this is what happened on 5thNovember. Progressives know why white male evangelicals voted overwhelmingly for Trump. It’s nothing to do with the economy or the woke insanity distorting American life: it’s obviously because they are racist, misogynist white supremacists who could never bring themselves to vote for a woman of colour. If white female evangelicals voted for Trump it indicates they have been conditioned by the patriarchy to vote against their own best interests. In all the hullabaloo over election analysis and attempting to find reasons for defeat other than the fact that Harris and Walz were terrible candidates, there is one group who have slipped below the radar, the Amish. The Amish are a conservative Anabaptist Christian community who have resolutely turned their back on modern technology. They are renowned for their self-sufficiency, the simplicity of their lifestyle, and plain dress. They much prefer face-to-face communication to telephones and don’t use television, preferring to spend time together as a family. Fleeing persecution in 18thcentury Europe, they arrived in the New World where William Penn offered them refuge in Pennsylvania. Due to their work ethic and emphasis on family ties the community boomed over the years. It is estimated that of the 400,000 Amish in America 92,000 live in Pennsylvania. The largest of the swing states with 19 votes in the electoral college, after going Democrat in 2020, it swung Trump’s way 2024. It was not the Amish vote which pushed Trump over the line, but it exemplifies why many did vote for Trump. The Amish like to keep themselves to themselves and their political involvement is usually minimal. Their stance changed this year largely due to a government raid on the Bird-in-Hand farm of Amish farmer Amos Miller. Pennsylvania’s Department of Agriculture found that Miller didn’t have a permit to sell milk in the state, despite the fact that he and his family had been selling milk for generations. Agents from the Department of Agriculture raided his farm and seized much of his food and dairy products. In the ensuing case, Miller was banned from selling milk in Pennsylvania, with the case ongoing. The case was seen by the Amish community as government tyranny and helped mobilise them against the party of Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat. The Republicans grasped their opportunity and initiated a serious registration drive, the first in Amish history, and the Amish responded by voting for Trump in‘unprecedented numbers’. What was viewed as an overzealous government was rejected by the Amish who responded by voting for Donald Trump, whose Republican party favours less government intervention in the life of the people. ‘That was the impetus for them to say, “We need to participate”,’ a source said of Amish voters. ‘This is about neighbours helping neighbours.’ The Amish are people of high moral principle, who value family life and who view gambling as a sin. Yet they voted for the much-married, casino-owning Donald Trump. They are not hypocrites, they are simply people who want to get on with their own lives without being badgered by an overweening government which thinks it knows best about everything. For the Democrats, as other progressives, it is all about control. From pronouns, DEI, required quotas, to mandatory speech and enforced gender ideology, Democrats demand the right to control what people say and do. Let us hope they and other progressives have learned that ordinary people do not like to be controlled by power hungry ideologues and they will rebel, even Christians.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-17T01:17:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/you-must-be-bad-if-even-the-amish-are-up-in-arms/
Anatomy of Trump’s triumph,"GO on, admit it. Don’t be shy. Did you feel the joy in the late evening and early hours of  November 5-6? How about the vibe? Democrats failed to feel either as the garbage deplorables took out the trash and made a bonfire of the dumpster bin. The diversity hire can now retire and feel the sadness of adversity instead. Donald Trump’s 312-226 landslide victory in the Electoral College is not a repudiation of democracy but a triumphant affirmation of its liberating power. He lost thepopular votein 2016 by three million votes (two per cent) and in 2020 by 7 million (four per cent). This time he won the popular vote bythree million(76-73) and two per cent (50.1-48.1) – his first victory in the number of ballots and in securing an absolute majority. About 90 percent of over 3,000 counties across the nation shifted to the right. Trump won in 2016 with a winning coalition of disaffected working-class whites. More than half of workers are living paycheck-to-paycheck, the purchasing power of which has been falling with high inflation. Contrary to the American dream of intergenerational progress, many young people have a worse standard of living than their parents. While consolidating that voting base, the more sweeping triumph this year was helped considerably by substantial inroads into ethnic groups traditionally aligned with Democrats. Trump described his diverse and inclusive coalition as a ‘beautiful,’ ‘historical realignment’ in his victory speech on the night. Harris refused to give a concession speech until the day after. In anNBC exit poll, Trump won 57 per cent of white and 55 per cent of male voters, retaining his hold on these groups. In anAP exit poll, he won 20 per cent of the black vote, up from 8 in 2016 and 13 in 2020. Harris’s 80 per cent black vote is a ten-point drop from Joe Biden’s four years ago. In addition, he also won the support of 46 per cent of Latinos, 39 per cent of Asian-Americans, 54 per cent of ‘Other,’ 45 per cent of women, and 43 per cent of 18–to-29-year-olds. Hence the prospect of a major new realignment of American politics. There are important lessons in all this for centre-right parties across the West: authentic conservatism attracts more voters than it repels. Trump’s success in creating a multi-ethnic winning coalition indicates that voting trends may be coalescing, with previously segmented cohorts normalising and starting to vote more as Americans and less as ethnics. Thus in anAP analysis, the economy and jobs rated as the top issues for voters overall, for blacks and Latinos, and for the youth. Phrases such as the Latino, black or Asian-American vote are increasingly meaningless. What once were voting blocs are fragmenting into individuals with agency. This can only be good for the long-term health of American democracy, contrary to the hysterical warnings of its imminent collapse should Trump win. In the history books, 2016 might be described as a dress rehearsal for the real deal in 2024. Trump won back the White House and delivered Congress on his coattails, with a net gain of four Senate and 1-2 House seats. Plus he will have a favourable balance of justices on the Supreme Court. All this will be crucial in confronting the expected challenges from Resistance 2.0, aka swamp dwellers protesting at the swamp drainage scheme. So will the lessons internalised from the experience of 2016–20, including the choice of top personnel who understand and are committed to the Trump agenda. Progressives once again went into meltdown. Writing inThe Globe and Mailin reliably woke Canada, Andrew Coyne solemnly describes Trump as ‘manifestly, palpably, incontrovertibly unfit for public office, not only in his own character and abilities, but for what he represents, including his attacks on the rule of law, basic freedoms and democracy itself’. His take on the outcome? ‘Sometimes the people get it wrong.’ He echoed the instant reaction from Jill Filipovic that ‘this election was not an indictment’ of Harris but ‘an indictment of America.’ At least oneGuardiancolumnist gets it. John Harris concluded that the ‘simple, inescapable message’ from Trump’s victory is that ‘many people despise the left’ with progressives seen as ‘one judgmental, “woke” mass.’ Harris goes on to note that support for border security and enforcement was higher among blacks and Hispanics than among white progressives. So too for statements that ‘America is the greatest country in the world’ where ‘most people can make it if they work hard,’ again contradicting the core tenets of critical race theory. The fact that Trump’s 14-point advantage amongvoters without college degreesflips into a 13-point loss among the college-educated indicates the source of the luxury beliefs. This in a tough economic environment in which, in a survey last year, 39 per cent of Americans admitted to havingskipped mealsto keep up with housing payments. Trump was authentic and Harris inauthentic, intellectually shallow, morally vacuous, and prone to mistaking platitudes as policy pronouncements. Harris held a celebrity-studded rally in Philadelphia on November 4. At his own overlapping rally in Pittsburgh, Trump said: ‘We don’t need a star because we have policy.’ She recruited Republican reject Liz Cheney whose surname remains toxic among true-blue Democrats. He won over disillusioned Democrats Robert F Kennedy, Jr (nominated to be Secretary of Health and Human Services) and Tulsi Gabbard (the new Director of National Intelligence) along with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy (co-chairs of a new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE). Her only sales pitch was ‘I am not Trump. I am not Biden.’ This was delivered with an accompaniment of trademark word salads, infamous cackles and a baffling array of accents to suit every audience. Trump dodged bullets, Harris dodged questions. He had a record to defend, she had one to airbrush. Democrats voted for the party, not Harris. MAGA people voted for Trump more than the party. Harris neither explained and defended the last four years nor articulated a vision for the next four. All she did was to attack Trump. He closed with the simple yet powerful question: Are you better off now than then? They replied: Diversity hire, you are fired. Trump won, Harris lost, and the progressive governance elite was humiliated. The biggest losers of the night were A-list celebrities and the legacy media. EvenTaylor Swift’s hometownof Reading, PA went with Trump. She might be a fashion influencer but is no more an opinion influencer and thought leader than I am a fashion influencer. The centre ground of the political information complex has shifted from legacy to online alternative and podcast media. As Kimberly Strassel put it in theWall Street Journal, it was ‘a landslide against the media’ (think CBS editing a word salad answer from Harris into a crisper sound bite but refusing to publish the full transcript). Echoing the ‘quadfecta’ of the GOP capture of the Presidency, Senate, House, and popular vote, the MSM too suffered a quadruple calamity. Their preferred candidate lost. Their already dented credibility was torn to shreds. Echoing the George Costanza strategy inSeinfeld,some voters did the opposite of what the media hacks told them, echoing last year’s Voice referendum in Australia. Also like the Voice, Harris’s massive spending advantage merely reinforced the perception that she was the candidate of the wealthy few and he of the more numerous little guys. Ironically, the media helped shrink-wrap the Democrats in the DC bubble so they never woke up to just how cut off they’d become from the concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations of everyday Americans. Reduced to a party of, by, and for elites, they mistook the noise of shouty inner-city activists for the voice of Middle America. The voters gave the tiresome snobs (elites) and scolds (culture warriors) a big ‘FU’ in return, just like with the Voice down under. There isn’t just one US presidential election but 50 simultaneous but separate ones in every state, each with its own rules and processes. Similarly, there isn’t one unified and cohesive electorate but several distinct voting cohorts. As alluded to above, the Trump-led Republicans deepened their appeal among white working-class Americans but also broadened it to peel away once-solid support for the Democrats among specific cohorts and bring them inside the Republican tent. This was particularly true of but not limited to the immigrant ethnic groups. According to aForbes analysis, Harris’s six-point lead over Trump among Latinos was a steep drop from the 33 and 38-point margins for Biden and Clinton in 2020/2016. In Starr County in south Texas with a 97 per cent Latino population which hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1892 and which Clinton won by 79 points in 2016, Trump won 58 per cent of the votes this time round. In Queens County, NY, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse counties in the US, theneedle moved 20 points towards Trumpfrom 2020. For all the brouhaha over an insult comedian’s off-colour Puerto Rican joke, even heavily Puerto Rican Osceola, FL, whichBidencarried by nearly 14 points, flipped to Trump. Clearly, voters were not moved much by Harris’s appeal to gender and minorities. Having failed to read the room, CNN’sexit pollshows that the Democrats have shrunk into the party of college-educated, high-income (above $100,000), whites and single women. None of the four main attack lines against Trump – a convicted felon, a racist, a misogynist, a wannabe Hitler who will destroy American democracy – resonated with these demographics. The first was viewed as the result of anti-democratic lawfare. The second was contradicted by the evidence of their own lying eyes with people such as Nikki Haley, Ramaswamy, Gabbard (raised a Hindu), Kash Patel, and Bobby Jindal inside the GOP fold. Ditto the third with Haley, Gabbard, Susie Wiles (Trump’s new chief of staff, plus Elise Stefanik and Kristi Noem among his other early top picks), his public support for Kellyanne Conway, and his emphatic support for women’s rights against trans extremism. The fourth flew in the face of their direct experience of the records of Trump and Biden-Harris and their own judgment on which of the respective two records was the greater violation of democratic norms. TheCNN exit pollconfirmed that voters perceived democracy to be threatened almost evenly by Harris and Trump. The established immigrant populations see economic downsides to having newer immigrant workers come in and compete for jobs. They also object to unlimited immigration on cultural grounds, having become proud of their American citizenship. They may even become more vociferous defenders of Americanism than whites who can trace their ancestry in the US further back but are racked with guilt over historical sins such as  slavery and racism. They fault the Democrats on immigration, culture wars, and pronouns, and net zero obsession and costs be damned. Their optimistic vision for America is one based on promoting nationhood, national identity, American culture, secure borders, a history of many accomplishments to be proud of and celebrated, social conservatism, the prosperity of people who actually live in the country, and a better life for their kids. In a surreal bait-and-switch tactic, the Democrats campaigned heavily on the fear that Trump, a closet Hitler, would begin to establish a dictatorship from Day One. This is from the party that overturned the democratic choice of 14million voters to dump Biden and impose a DEI pick for the ultimate job, even though she failed to win a single delegate in 2020 and did not contest the party primary this year. She knew it, Americans knew it, the world knew it. Everyone also knew that the Democrats had lied about Biden’s cognitive health for four years and then, after replacing him, lied about Harris’s fitness for office. They treated voters with open contempt and they’ve returned the favour. When the machine came after Trump in a scorched earth campaign of total lawfare, blacks and immigrants from countries where state harassment is routine related to him. This is disturbingly reminiscent to many immigrants, including Indians, of the VIP culture in their home countries which they fled in search of a better future for themselves and their descendants in the land of opportunity and the free. The Democrats mostly refused to accept the legitimacy of Trump’s victory in 2016 and worked assiduously to undermine his presidency with guerrilla tactics and the Russia collusion hoax. Fifty-one former senior intelligence officials ran election interference against Trump in 2020 with knowingly false declarations on the Hunter Biden laptop story as classic Russian disinformation. They spied on his campaign, impeached him twice, arrested him, and tried to bankrupt, incarcerate, and throw him off the ballot. He was twice the target of assassination attempts and famously rose up from one with defiant fist pumps of ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’ He absorbed all the punches and just kept coming back at them. This was the mother of all overkills. Those pushing it sounded more like demented rage addicts than serious contenders for high political office. In the end, the only verdict that matters was delivered by the jury of all American voters. The charge that Trump is an existential threat to American democracy was also totally contradicted by Harris’s concession speech on the 6th: We lost this battle, she said, but the fight goes on and we will win the next time. And then she appealed for kindness towards the person she had been trashing for the past 100 days as a racist and sexist second coming of Hitler. Immigration has long been argued to bring multiple benefits of economic stimulus and growth, replenished gene pool, enriched cultural diversity, exposure to the world’s diverse range of scrumptious cuisine, and so on. In the US, Republicans tolerated illegal immigrants as a large pool of cheap labour and Democrats as a large bloc of reliable long-term votes. But in recent times mass and illegal immigration in particular have tipped the balance away from net benefits to harms, including net lifetime drain on public finances and stressed out public infrastructure. This is more so for the working classes than the elites. This has put many settled liberal assumptions under scrutiny. For example, it is true that liberalism embraces multiculturalism. But actual and growing evidence in many Western democracies clearly indicates that not all multicultural groups embrace the core assumptions and values of liberalism, including tolerance for diversity of faiths, beliefs, and practices. The resulting fractures of civic culture, social cohesion, and political stability have heavily qualified the experience of shared citizenship. By reversing Trump’s efforts to control the southern border and opening it wide to floods of illegal aliens on Harris’ watch as the border czar, the Democrats left her candidacy hostage to fortune and have paid the price. Exit polls showedimmigration and the economyas the voters’ top two concerns and Trump – with a tough message on immigration, border enforcement, and mass deportations – won on these with 90 and 80 per cent support. The progressive cultural crusade is quintessentially Western, irrelevant, and repugnant to many non-Westerners. They don’t subscribe to white privilege and guilt, don’t believe masculinity is toxic and all women should be believed automatically when making serious allegations of sexual assault that devastate not just the man but his whole family, don’t support affirmative action for blacks, women, and transgender, don’t obsess over personal pronouns, and don’t lie in bed terrified of being cooked alive by global boiling. They were horrified at the very thought, in the name of promoting trans rights, of males invading female spaces involving their daughters, from sporting competitions to changing rooms, showers, toilets, and schoolchildren on overnight camping trips. Trump’s disdain for these progressive pieties quite appeals to them. The distortion of policy priorities by the Democrats on climate catastrophism and trans extremism moved the needle of voter sentiment from opposed to angry. Most migrant minorities would favour a return to the progressive centrism of equal opportunity and fairness, not the cultural Marxist nostrum of identity-driven equitable outcomes. While Trump-Vance spoke to people’s concerns on inflation, jobs, energy security, mass illegal immigration, and crime, Harris-Walz identified with boutique ideas around race and gender. Trump’s counterattack on transgender rights more than offset abortion – sorry, reproductive rights – as an issue for women in general and for non-white men and women in particular. In a Gallup Poll last year,69 per centof Americans backed restricting sporting teams to biological sex and not based on gender self-identity. Harris suffered a fall of three points from men and two points from women voters; Trumpgained three points from both. How could this be: Isn’t he misogyny incarnate? The Biden-Harris administration was responsible for the most grievous assault on the sacrosanct principles of bodily integrity and ‘My Body, My Choice’ with its vaccine mandates. But when the Supreme Court struck downRoe v Wadein June 2022, they suddenly rediscovered their passion for the same principles and launched an all-out attack on the threat to abortion from another Trump term. Yet, in a report published in May 2024 by Guttmacher Institute, a research organisation that supports access to abortion, the total number of abortions in the US was1,037,000 in 2023, the first full year after the court decision. According to CDC data, this was a 64 per centjump from 625,978 in 2021before the court decision (possibly depressed during shutdowns) and thehighest in a decade. Most people want neither harshly restrictive access to abortions nor the removal of all restrictions until birth. But most people don’t feel comfortable discussing it, believing it to be an intensely personal choice. The topic doesn’t align with the joy vibe and there’s something unsettling about any national leader who campaigns against bringing children into the world. About a third of American women are pro-life. Even among pro-choice women, the majority don’t back abortion all the way to full term. Trump sided with the Supreme Court that it’s a state-level political issue, not one for the federal judiciary to adjudicate. He explicitly ruled out taking any further action and promised to veto any national ban on abortion. In the end, the much-trumpetedgender gap worked to Trump’s net advantage. Men broke for him 55-42 and women for Harris 53-45, giving Trump a five-point net gain. The issue didn’t even excite the young. About 39 per cent of young women and 42 per cent of young men identified jobs and the economy as their top issue, while 17 per cent and 8 per cent picked abortion. Trump won 40 per cent of the votes of female under-30s, up by seven points. Harris won the under-30s overall by 52-46, but fell back from Biden’s margin by 19 points. He won amongunder-30men by 14 per cent, a 29-point swing from 2020. The Democrats spent$175million on TV adsacross the country to hammer their message on abortion – more than on any other issue. Republicans spent$123millionattacking trans athletes. One ad featured footage of Harris from the 2019 primaries saying she supported taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgery for illegal immigrants and transgender prison inmates. The tagline: ‘Kamala’s For They/Them. President Trump is for you’ was exceptionally effective. TheNew York Timesreported on November 7 on an analysis by Future Forward, a pro-Harris super PAC, that that one single ad shifted the race by astunning 2.7 per centtowards Trump. Culture warriors have captured and occupied the commanding heights of state and public institutions, including most of the print and electronic legacy media, from which to coerce and harass critics and dissenters into compliance through an expansive abuse of administrative power by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner is a good example and I wonder how much harm this American import has caused to Australia’s critical relationship with the incoming administration by picking a fight with Musk (which she lost) who will wield a powerful influence on Trump. For reasons that should be self-evident, I am more familiar with Indo-American than with other groups’ sentiments. The comments that follow draw on many conversations over time with colleagues, friends, and relations in the US. Unlike the low depression hanging over many Western capitals led by people yet to outgrow student politics, in heavily polluted Delhi the Modi government will be pleased to see the House of Orange restored to the White House. At a function in Mumbai on November 10, in response to a question from the audience on the implications of Trump 2.0 for India, Foreign Minister SJaishankar remarked(at around 25 minutes) that ‘a lot of countries are nervous about the US . . . We are not one of them.’ He said that Modi’s call of congratulations was among the first three that Trump took from foreign leaders. The rise in India’s global profile has coincided with the rise into public prominence of many people of Indian origin living in the West, none more so than in the US. There are5.2million Indo-Americans, over half of them of voting age. They have been a historically solid Democratic voting cohort. Their high-income worth, educational qualifications, professional occupations and political engagement give them a role that belies their small numbers. It’s worth remembering that small numbers can tip the outcomes in just a handful of states to determine the overall winner. There are over700,000 Indians in the seven swing states. In 2016, 84 per cent of Indo-Americans voted for Hillary Clinton, falling to 68 per cent for Biden in 2020. Harris’s share fell again to 60 per cent, despite her mother being Indian. Support for Trump was 31 per cent, up from 22 in 2020. Many Indo-Americans had to wait years for a green card while working in tech, starting companies, paying taxes, but unable to claim Social Security benefits until they became citizens. Immigration as a fairness issue has turned many into Trump voters, especially when they see undocumented immigrants committing crimes and accessing social benefits funded in part by their taxes. They resent Democrats pandering to grifters who contribute little to society or the economy and forgiving debts incurred by students of the many victimhood and grievance degrees. Coming from a country that was invaded, conquered, colonised, and ruled for a thousand years by Islamic and British invaders then partitioned, they are bewildered at being maligned as White Adjacent for their success through education and work ethic because this contradicts the narrative of oppressed minorities. They fought all the way to the Supreme Court against discriminatory admissions by the nation’s elite universities. They have lived experience of the onerous burden of the parasitical regulatory state. The reasons why Indo-Americans have begun switching to Trump’s Republican Party offer important clues on Trump’s appeal to other Asian-Americans, Latinos, and blacks. This should attract the interest of campaign strategists of centre-right parties across Western democracies, including Australia, on how to fight and win culture wars and defend cultural centrism in order to win elections in a rapidly evolving political landscape where traditional partisanship is in freefall and new alignments are coalescing around class- and family-based values and concerns.

The billions upon billions wasted on useless face masks,"IN A RECENTtweet, Reform MP Rupert Lowe said: ‘I’ve been digging around. How much PPE (personal protective equipment), paid for by the taxpayer, has been destroyed? 1,049,700 pallets, which cost us £8.644billion . . . so grim.’ Grim indeed, Mr Lowe. The Labour Party’s disastrous recent Budget was predicated on the need to fill a ‘£22billion black hole’. It’s a shame such hard-nosed fiscal prudence was not on display during the covid saga, when the same Labour Party egged on the obscene squandering of resources with all the restraint of a drunken sailor. We know that somewhere in the region of £400billion of UK taxpayer money has been spent on ‘combating’ Covid-19, a figure that, according to a piece published by the BBC in March 2022, equates to roughly£6,000 per person. We also know that of this eye-watering figure, huge sums have been wasted through incompetence, sharp practice and fraud. Regarding the latter, a year into the ‘crisis’ theBMJwere reporting that one in five government contracts had signs of possiblecorruptionand Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferies’s detailed analysis across all categories of government covid-related spending concluded that about 10 per cent of the total was outrightfraudulent. That’s around £40billion, almost double the Chancellor’s supposed ‘black hole’. But on top of this tale of inefficiency, hasty action, backhanded deals given to politicians’ mates and criminal activity, one aspect of the sorry mess has yet to receive sufficient attention. That is the amount of money spent on precautions that were completely unnecessary: on measures that didn’t – and don’t – work, principal amongst which was the use of face masks as part of personal protection. In early April 2020 the UK Government and devolved administrations were in a tizzy. Previous pandemic planning had been binned and an entirely new strategy was being spun. As a result, politicians, their advisers and civil servants were in the grip of a frenetic process to develop guidelines for PPE. ThesePPE guidelinesfocused on the protection of workers in the health and social care sectors. Given that for other workers and settings there was, according to information in the Government’s possession, ‘very little scientific evidence of widespread benefit from PPE’, this didn’t make sense. But when did anything that happened during the time of coronamania add up? So official ‘guidance’ was that, within health and social care settings, masks and other PPE worked and were necessary; while in all other places ‘good hand hygiene and social distancing’ was considered sufficient. Illogical and ridiculous or not, politicians were determined to find PPE for so-called ‘front-line workers’. Unfortunately, despite being warned in2016of a need for active management, the PPE stockpile set up in 2009 was short of the ‘life-saving [sic] FFP3 respirator masks’, with more than two-thirds of the 33million stored items beingunaccounted for. By the start of May 2020, scrambling to cover their failures in planning and to neutralise thenegative PRthey were receiving, ministers and health officials and panjandrums had set up a centralised PPE procurementsystemwhich looked like this: The PPE procurementprocess Looking at this diagram, an observer is struck by at least two things: first, the apparent simplicity of the new procurement design; second, the designers’ supposed belief that something as sprawling and complex as the entire health and social care organisation supply and fulfilment system in the UK could be boiled down to a schema that fits a single page. One is left asking the obvious question that, if, during a supposed global health crisis of previously unencountered, and deadly, proportions, it would be possible to centralise NHS procurement this easily, and in the shortest of timeframes, why had it never been done before? Of course, the answer is that, as with many plans to change byzantine and deeply engrained systems, it isn’t as easy to do in practice as it looks in theory. What seemed smart to politicians, civil servants and their highly paidconsultantswhen viewed on a whiteboard in Downing Street didn’t hold as much water when implemented in the real world. While the new system worked, after a fashion, there were numerous examples of where it fell flat on its face, the most obvious strategic flaw in the system being that by acting in a panic and forcing all buying through a single funnel, the cost of PPE wasinflatedhugely. In these circumstances, even the supine state-controlled media have been able to spot the egregious wastage resulting from poor procurement practices, for examplehere,hereandhere. Additionally, the National Audit Office’s (NAO) ‘Investigation into the management of PPE contracts’ report,publishedearlier this year, identified many areas of concern, concluding by quoting the Department of Health and Social Care which had said it ‘expects fraud and error to be between 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent of PPE expenditure’ and that it continues to manage an estimated contract risk of £2.7billion. And what of face masks specifically? In line with the general theme of bureaucratic fumbling and ineptitude, we’ve seen exampleshere,hereandhereof masks that, for a variety of reasons, were unusable. Further,knowingthat they do nothing useful to stop transmission and instead introduce additional harms means that we also know that every pound spent on them has been a wasted one, creating misery into the bargain. And a lot of masks were bought. As early as April 2020, when individual NHS Trusts were responsible for their own procurement, staff were getting through‘tens of millions’of masks every week. Overall, from the start of the pandemic, we know, courtesy of the NAO’s report, that in total 37.2billion masks, gowns, gloves and so forth were purchased at a cost of £14.6billion by government – of which, official sourcesconfirmed, only about half were distributed. It is difficult to specify exactly the proportion of that number which is made up by face coverings. What we do know, from the underlying data to be foundhere, is that the value of contracts awarded by government bodies for masks was at least £5billion in 2020 alone. This money, spent on the useless masks, would have funded the first-year salaries of at least 151,000 additional nurses, or given all existing nurses a 30 per cent bonus payment. Instead, the jump to assume that which was known not to have worked previously had undergone a magical transformation meant that this opportunity to reward those most affected ‘on the front lines’ went begging. Perhaps the political optics just didn’t look good enough? Would it be any different the next time a ‘global pandemic’ arises? If, when confronted by theevidenceagainst masking, theresponsesupplied by NHS England’s then Chief Nurse and national lead for infection control, Dame Ruth May, is anything to go by, probably not. We can expect more of the same. Which, given the spectacular growth of 223 per cent in the protective face maskmarketduring 2020 and the predicted future Compound Annual Growth Rate of 9 per cent over the next seven years, is perhaps not surprising. After all, who could turn down all that easily made ‘government’ money? Other problems with the system have been highlighted: first by NHS procurement heads who criticised supply-chainperformance; and second in an answer to a written parliamentary question which revealed that storing PPE was costing the taxpayer £770,000 perday! We should also mention Tory peer Baroness Michelle Mone and her relationship and connections to a company, ‘PPE Medpro’, involved in supplying sub-standard PPE to the Government. In particular, interest in the press has focused on Mone’s role and rewards as ‘middle woman’ in the grubby affair. The matter, comprehensively and succinctly documentedhere, which centres on a £200million deal to supply gowns to the Department of Health and Social Care, first saw the light of day in 2020, and through a succession of denials followed by admissions evolved into a scandal which saw the Baroness step away from the House of Lords and given a restraining order freezing assets worth £75million. Now the subject of an investigation by the National Crime Agency, the case shone a harsh light on the matter of the Government’s ‘VIP lane system’ which featured a fast-track email box which allowed MPs to send on offers of PPE from suppliers, but led to the government being criticised for giving preferential treatment to companies with political contacts. Another disgrace dates from June of this year and news that from a deal worth £1.78billion cut in 2020 for face masks, respirators, eye protection and aprons, 1.57billion items valued at £1.4billion will‘never be used’. Of these items, around 750million had already been burned, with another 825million likely to face the same fate. Unlike the stock purchased through the PPE Medpro deal, the PPE was considered viable, but simply ‘overpurchased’ by those tasked with procuring supplies. A former government procurement adviser quoted by the BBC revealingly explained that ‘I think the procurement people did what many of us would have done and slightly panicked to get the stuff in, or at least get the contracts in and hope the stuff arrived later’, adding in a moment of candour that ‘it was almost as though price didn’t matter’. So far as it is possible to know, as a result of this waste of money, no one has lost their job. This seems a good place to stop and weigh the two explanations as to how unaccountable civil servants and posturing politicians were able to pour billions of pounds of our cash down the PPE drain. Take your pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence? Or, just maybe, both.r pick: sharp practice or wilful incompetence?

No chance for the ‘far right’ in Starmer’s left-wing justice system,"THE Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson gave an interview to theSunday Timeswhich was a very interesting read indeed. It started with his desire to get more rapists convicted. These alleged rapists were playing the system by pleading not guilty, and how very dare they do that. I thought we had a presumption of innocence here in the UK, but that is causing problems for the DPP. According to the article, ‘Suspected rapists are seeking to evade justice by deliberately pleading not guilty and waiting for victims to drop out of long-delayed trials, the country’s top prosecutor has warned. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said defendants were “taking advantage” of delays in the criminal justice system and “hoping that something will come up” to cause a case to collapse.’ The article continues: ‘Ten per cent of victims of rape and other serious sexual offences withdraw their support after charges have been brought, he said. Many more do so while police investigate their complaints. Typically, it can take two years to investigate a rape case and another two years to bring it to trial, Parkinson said. “I think that’s outrageous. We see too many victims — usually women — withdrawing their co-operation because of the delay and also because they don’t feel sufficiently supported”.’ A few things on this. First, and most obviously, everyone including those accused of rape has a right to plead not guilty and exercise the right to a trial by jury. I think it is bad form for the DPP to be out there implying that defendants who enter a not guilty plea and maintain that plea until trial are somehow trying to ‘evade justice’. Surely, it is justice, a trial by jury, that they seek and are entitled to. The DPP is disgracefully casting aspersions on defendants who have entered not guilty pleas to the very serious charge of rape and are awaiting trial as is their legal right. It is hardly the defendant’s fault that the criminal justice system has been so trashed, starting with New Labour and continuing with successive Tory administrations, that trials take so long to come to court. Some of these defendants will be remanded in custody until trial, so they suffer as much as the complainant. It is not their responsibility that ‘a record backlog of 71,000 cases are awaiting trial in the nation’s crown courts, up from 38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic’. Justice denied is another legacy of the ruinous lockdown. Secondly, and this should not need to be said to the DPP, perhaps the reason why complainants withdraw their evidence is because they are lying and they made a false allegation. It is for the jury to determine the truth – not the DPP who feels under pressure to raise the conviction rate for rape. With various improvements to the system, the DPP ‘hopes the moves will encourage suspects to plead guilty at their first court hearing, making them eligible for a reduced sentence’. In reality, even for those defendants who are guilty, what person would plead guilty to such a serious offence at the first opportunity even with a reduced sentence? If defendants are ‘taking advantage’ it is because successive governments have given them the advantage, due to treating barristers like trash, outrageous court delays and systemic underfunding. Such is the DPP’s dodgy view on rape trials. I tell you what group of people did plead guilty at the first opportunity, the Far-Right Thugs (herein after referred to as FRT). Stephen Parkinson was asked about this too. TheSunday Timessaid: ‘The biggest challenge faced by Parkinson in the past year has been the riots that engulfed Britain after the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport in July.’ Parkinson denied that the response from the CPS, which led to more than 740 people being charged, was ‘draconian’. This was in some ways a national crisis. It was important to show people that if they committed criminal conduct, they would be dealt with swiftly and effectively, he said, adding that the majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty. How true this was. The majority of those who were charged pleaded guilty at the first opportunity in the magistrates’ court. And I have been asking myself just why this was the case. The grandfather Peter Lynch who committed suicide in prison should not have pleaded guilty to violent disorder,in my honest and former defence lawyer opinion. Having read what I could in the reports and accepting I was not in court at the time, I am left wondering just why did he plead to violent disorder, a serious offence, when his part was minimal? His offence really was abusing a police officer, but as it was part of an overall incident of violent disorder, by pleading guilty Mr Lynch was on the hook for the entire incident which turned very serious. Despite having pleaded guilty Mr Lynch was denied a suspended sentence when any reasonable judge could see that he was vulnerable. But Mr Lynch is too dead to object now. They wanted to teach him a lesson, and I’ll say they did so. There are other cases out there where the sentence at least looks disproportionate. But what has troubled me in the last few weeks is just what happened on those first appearances in the magistrates’ court. Of course, it didn’t help that the Prime Minister himself was dragging out the old lectern saying justice would be done, and done swiftly, which intensified an already febrile atmosphere. That was surely the point. And the FRT were given legal advice and ultimately how they plead is entirely their own decision. But all the time people admit offences of which they are not necessarily guilty. Further, even if on the facts the FRT were guilty of the offence I am left thinking that if this was a left-wing cause, many would have entered not guilty pleas. This is because left-wing lawyers are well-organised and the word goes out – don’t rush into anything. Wait until we have given you advice and you have considered all your options. This is all perfectly ethical, and indeed effective. It is downright admirable. My only regret is that this is not what happened with the FRT. Things can change in trial by jury, the light that shows that freedom lives. These FRT, having taken advice and decided to plead not guilty are perfectly entitled to tell the jury how they honestly felt on the day, how it came to be that they were suddenly far-right thugs. ‘Yes, I was angry. Sure I shouldn’t have done what I did but I was furious. I thought of those three girls being stabbed to death and my anger got the better of me. I’m just angry that we have been ignored about immigration for years and years. That my country, my home town, has been changed beyond recognition and no one seems to care. The politicians ignore us time and again – I tried to vote for change but change never comes. So, I got angry. Etc etc.’ This goes before the jury. To convict in a jury trial you need ten of the 12 jurors to say yes, he was guilty. They can return a not guilty verdicteven if the defendant admits the offence in court.It happens all the time and is called jury nullification or jury equity depending on your view. Ten from twelve. I’ll take those odds and any decent defence lawyer should have been willing to take those odds. Now it may be the case that the FRT are getting some decent legal advice now. But the reason they all pleaded guilty is that there are simply not enough right-wing lawyers out there who are as organised and as motivated as their left-wing colleagues. This is the problem with right-wing people – they are in the City, doing commercial stuff with commercial people or whatever the heck it is they do all day. Where they are not is in the law. But plenty of talented left-wing people are, and they look after their own and play for keeps. The right-wingers are not in the arts, crafting well-told and beautiful stories of the human condition from a conservative point of view. But the lefties are influencing the culture day in and day out. Heck, even in the media there are not enough true conservatives, otherwise this piece would have appeared in theDaily Mailor theTelegraph. They would have been asking, what really happened to the FRT in court? So here I am. There we have it. The suspected rapists know how to play the system and will plead not guilty, and hope the trial never happens. Far-right ‘thugs’ on violent disorder charges, or tweeting while angry charges, were just falling over themselves to plead guilty, and receive obviously disproportionate sentences. I am not blaming their lawyers who were there at the time at all. But it might be worth asking just why this happened.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-19T01:17:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/why-the-law-is-stacked-against-right-thinkers/
What’s the real reason they’re going after Allison Pearson?,"EVER since Allison Pearson wrote about her personal experience of the UK’s ‘two-tier justice system’ in herTelegraph article of November 12, the media in Britain and abroad have been deluged with outrage and condemnation. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has had to intervene after warnings that the current Hate Crime laws were being exploited to stifle free speech. Starmer has recommended that the police focus on tackling violent crime and burglaries instead of questioning people over their social media posts.This is in line with public opinion, but appears to be the opposite of what goes on. The Chief Constable of Essex Police, Ben-Julian Harrington, who sent two of his officers to Allison Pearson’s house on Remembrance Sunday morning, actively encourages public complaints under the Malicious Communications Act (1988). Not content with making sure people know what a hate crime is, he provides blow-by-blow instructions on how to report them on itswebsite. An accompanying booklet called ‘Stop the Hate’ all but suggests it is a public duty to be an informer. With such egging on it’s not so surprising to find that his force received more than 30,000 such complaints in three years between 2019 (9,203), 2020 (10,163) and 2021 (11,069), or that they chose to investigate 29,109 of them.If this is how the force has been wasting its time and resources, no wonder it can’t manage to send an emergency response to all 999 calls about drug dealing, as has been admitted. Neil Gregory, a substitute member of the Essex Police, Fire and Crime Panel, has accused it of ‘an obsession with diversity, neglect of crime, and institutional incompetence and dysfunction on an epic scale’. So is the Pearson response sheer incompetence, or quite deliberate and altogether more menacing? Though the police inquiry is already a year long, and has involved the Met, Essex and Sussex police, it was only last week that the Non Crime Hate Incident (NCHI) accusation was made. Later statements suggested actual criminality, under section 17 of the Public Order Act 1986, but were subsequently denied by Essex.No one seems entirely sure, especially at the Home Office. Crime or Non-Crime? This matters.Julie Bindel reported being visited by police over such an incident in 2019. She too was denied any information about the accusation, and so refused point-blank to attend for interview. But a criminal charge is altogether different, removing any voluntary element. Was this why Essex Police set up a ‘gold group’ to deal with the X post? These are normally set up to deal with major crimes such as terrorist attacks, to ‘support the management of an effective response to the identified matter’. But for a post on X? By Friday, things took an interesting turn.Vikram Dodd, police and crime correspondent of the Guardian, claimed they had ‘found’ details of the incident. A photograph posted several months ago during tensions over policing the Gaza protests showed a group of people of colour with a flag, and three police officers. Pearson’s caption read: ‘How dare they? Invited to pose with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday, police refused. Look at this lot, smiling with the Jew haters.’ It turned out Pearson was wrong when she implied the Muslims in the photograph were Hamas supporters, and quickly deleted the post. But the Guardian endorsed the complainant’s view that she had been racist and inflammatory. They also knew the complainant’s identity – not a Muslim but a person of colour with training in criminal law. It’s the timing of the accusation that stands out, because it followed very closely on the first anniversary of the October 7 massacre. Since 2023, there have been huge demonstrations by pro-Palestinian activists almost weekly in central London, always ‘lightly’ policed with few arrests, in spite of blatantly anti-Semitic banners and chanting ‘From the River to the Sea’, leading many to consider the police show a pro-Hamas bias. On October 7 this year, Pearson bravely published a deeply shocking report in the Telegraph. She had interviewed survivors, soldiers, bereaved parents and the mothers of hostages. Its headline, ‘Not one girl could be shown to her parents’, says it all. She wanted to record the heroism of the victims and the true depravity of the Hamas attack on innocent civilians and stated that she believed the struggle between Israel and Hamas was ‘no mere fight over territory, but a struggle between civilisation and barbarism’. With a Labour government now in Westminster, Pearson’s words were unlikely to go down well with their supporters, including a significant number of Muslim MPs, mayors, senior officials and academics, and other sympathetic communities throughout the country. Not least readers of the Guardian. So how was it that the Guardian, alone among the MSM, was privy to detailed information about the ‘incident’, details which Pearson herself was not entitled to know? Could there have been a leak, or even a deliberate tip-off, to strengthen further the government’s diversity agenda and appease its pro-Palestine voters? And from how high up might it have come? Was it intended to shift the narrative away from sympathising with the sentiments of Pearson’s shocking report, and back to exposing her as a racist Islamophobe? Could it even have been meant to turn the public’s attention away from the disastrous October Budget? We have no way of knowing, but it would follow a recognisable pattern of appeasement towards anti-Israel activists, notably from the police, at the same time as anti-Semitism is rising massively, andoffensive anti-Jewish tweets are not considered ‘offensive enough’ to warrant attention. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is now tasked with reviewing the logging of NCHIs, and wishes to reverse the downgrading recommended by her predecessors. She wants incidents relating to anti-Semitism and Islamophobia to be logged consistently, to avoid any escalation into violence. But her proposals inspire little confidence – the usual ‘focusing on vetting procedures’ and ‘holding forces to account on key metrics’, etc. What she needs to do is refocus her police forces on to real crimes, of which there is no shortage – knifings, shootings, drugs gang violence, burglaries, street muggings, even shoplifting, all of which are of great concern to the public. She would also do well to ensure that applying the Equality Act 2010, which affords special protection to minority groups, is managed fairly and proportionately when dealing with hate crimes against Jews and Christians. Any more failure to rebalance what many perceive as preferential treatment for some religions over others, or even for illegal migrants over upstanding citizens, will result in the Starmer government’s ratings sinking even lower than they already are.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-20T01:19:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/whats-the-real-reason-theyre-going-after-allison-pearson/
Health warrior RFK Jr faces coalition of formidable enemies   ,"ROBERT F Kennedy Junior (RFK Jr) is a popular figure in these pages and deservedly so. He’s been a warrior for truth over the excesses of the covid regime in the United States. He committed what the health promotion fanatics would consider the mortal sin of questioning the vaccine strategy. He continues to demand access to data which will show conclusively what every reader of TCW already knows, that the covid vaccines are unsafe. Now, as promised,he has been nominatedby President-elect Donald Trump to the position of Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In that position – provided the Senate do the right thing and not block his nomination – he will have a major influence on US health strategy over the next four years and has already been advising Trump. Despite a Republican majority, RFK Jr, who suspended his campaign to back Trump, is not universally popular. As opponents try to pressure the Senate, he’s likely to have opprobrium heaped on him. If recent reports are anything to go by, every opportunity will be taken to portray him as evil, conspiratorial or mad. As the fact sinks in that the prevailing narrative about public health in the USA – a narrative to which the terminally woke and politically deranged adhere – will no longer dominate the agenda, lockdown fanatics, mask maniacs, covid-vaccine enthusiasts and vested Pharma interests, among others, will do their damnedest to block him. Former Vice President, Mike Pence, has started the call,urging Republicans to reject him. To secure confirmation as HHS Secretary, RFK Jr. needs 50 Senate votes, with J.D. Vance casting a tie-breaking vote if necessary. With enemies like Pence the fact of 53 Republicans in the next Senate is far from a shoo-in. The ‘Leftstream media’, as the editor of TCW recently dubbed them, have for months been laying the groundwork for this eventuality. TheNew York Timesreported that RFK Jr kept ravens as pets, relishing the opportunity to make a play on the otherwise quite respectable collective noun ‘conspiracy of ravens’. TheLos Angeles Timesreported on the ‘unbearable weirdness’ of RFK Jr. Over here theDaily Mailclaims he was a cocaine dealer at university. Speculation about separation from his actress wife (a rubbishy report a month ago in something calledPeople) was taken up by theMail, which reported they ‘looked tense’ at the recentAl Smith Charity dinner, and that he has had multiple affairs with women in the ‘anti-vax’ movement. Yesterday following the announcement of his promotion, the papers did not miss a trick in their campaign to discredit and demonise him. First wastheMail’sreport that the news had sent the stock market into meltdown, followed almost immediately by a gleeful list of‘the most outrageous health claims peddled by the US’ new anti-vaxxer health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr: From ‘chemicals could make you trans’ to the ‘dead worm’ in his brain’. The hystericalGuardiancondemned him as ‘a clear and present danger’ None of these reports look at his evidence based analysis of America’s health crisis – the dramatic and alarming rise in chronic disease – that he has beenspeaking and lecturing on. Maybe theDaily Death(sorry,Mail) will find it has overplayed its hand asexcess deathsmount here and as its ‘not so woke’ readership wake up to the ‘health’ industry’s role in wrecking worldwide economies and lives during the covid regime.  No wonder that its most powerful cabals are sweating under their collars right now. RJK Jr has advised he would aim to sack around 600 workers in the National Institute of Health (NIH) and replace them with 600 new workers. Recommending swift action before Trump is inaugurated, he said ‘we want to have those people in place on January 20 so that, on January 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH, and 600 people are going to leave’. He also said ‘entire departments’ of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‘have to go’. Many were behind or part of the global agenda of fear regarding health, perpetuated for their own gain in terms of power and profit. A prime example is our favourite source of poor information on health, the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, who are clearly concerned at the prospect of RFK Jr with his hands on the health portfolio. Their daily newsletter (Global Health Now) of November 7 carried a ‘gift article’ from theNew York Timeswhich, in tone meant to be gobsmacking, was designed to put the boot in. Not only, it claimed, had RFK Jr peddled all sorts of ‘misinformation about vaccines’ but also he was a lawyer with ‘no medical or public-health degrees’. Indeed, he has neither medical nor public-health degrees, but he is a well-educated and effective lawyer who has been studying, and successfully suing large corporations for the addition of, harmful food additives. For example, he successfully sued the agricultural giant Monsanto for the use of a carcinogenic herbicide which found its way into the food chain. In a recent video he explains the provenance and dangers of the common food dye tartrazine, already banned in some countries but still found in sweets designed for consumption by children. This is a man who clearly cares about the health of individuals and the nation, in contrast to recent incumbents, in particular Anthony Fauci, who served the needs of Big Pharma from which many suspect he, in turn, profited. Regarding the covid years, RFK Jr’s ‘expertise’ is not insignificant. He researched and wrote a book onAnthony Fauci, formerly Chief Medical Advisor to the President of United States and long term Director of The National Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases, and his links with Bill Gates and Big Pharma. He also exposed, in aNew York Timesbestseller, the cover-up of the development of bioweapons in Wuhan. RFK Jr does his homework and is unafraid to ask inconvenient questions the likes of Fauci, Gates, the NIH and the FDA do not want asked. And, unlike them, he seems to care about the health of the American people. Is expertise, of the professional qualifications sort, specific to a political portfolio an absolute requirement? In fact a case could be made that they are a hindrance, especially for a health portfolio, since health professionals are educated and trained to think in particular ways, akin to brainwashing. They adhere with religious fervour to well-established tropes, especially regarding public health. Few will speak out when they see something wrong, and the hell of cancellation, professional investigation and possible loss of career and income awaits those who do. We have the covid years to prove the point. The medical and nursing professions largely sang from the same hymn sheet. Inculcated with vaccine ideology, almost to a man and woman, they jumped on the bandwagon in the face of evidence from the outset the vaccines were ineffective and in the face of subsequent evidence they were clearly dangerous. So dangerous, in fact, that the US state of Idaho banned them. A fresh, albeit ‘unqualified’, pair of eyes with a perspective uncluttered by prior assumptions is exactly what is required to steer health policy. After all, whether experts on health or not, the non-medically qualified majority of the population are consumers of what Big Pharma inflicts on them. Are our interests best served, therefore, by qualified and probably brainwashed health professionals or by well-educated and influential figures like RFK Jr, unafraid to speak their minds and ask the awkward questions? Of course, now RFK Jr has been nominated for the health portfolio he will, if the appointment stands, be judged by his actions. For example, he has promised to stop the fluoridation of tap water across the US; it will be interesting to see if he can achieve that. He has long referred to this additive, purportedly used to promote dental health, as toxic, and there is research on the lowering of IQ in children to support this. In contrast to the opprobrium heaped on RFK Jr and the likelihood of more now he is appointed, take the case of Gates. The UK Prime Minister, barely in office, has already met the man and described as ‘great’ their time together. The PM’s immediate predecessor exuded enthusiasm about meeting Gates during his unmemorable time at Number 10. Everyone, it seems, wants to meet Gates to seek his advice on all manner of things such as poverty (what would he know about that?), climate change and, indeed, vaccines. If his lack of qualifications (of which he has none) are ever referred to it is with awe that someone who dropped out of university could achieve so much. The fact there is such opposition to RFK Jr being involved in decisions about health has nothing to do with his lack of qualifications. That is the reddest of herrings. It is simply down to the fact he is not ‘on message’ with any of the left-leaning liberal agenda and opposes intrusive public-health interventions. Gates, on the other hand, is ‘on message’ – the global vaccine message he has so assiduously pushed, promoted and profited by – and that makes a world of difference for him. Unfortunately, it makes the world a worse place for us.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:19:00+00:00,Stateside,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/health-warrior-rfk-jr-faces-coalition-of-formidable-enemies/
"So cruel, so vulnerable – the Daycare Generation","THE LAST few days in the life of Alexander Rogers must have been consumed by darkness and loneliness. On the outside he was privileged: he was one of those white, heterosexual males we hear so much about, a good-looking third-year materials science student at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Unfortunately for Alexander, he lived in 2024. Alexander had a sexual encounter with a woman. Pretty standard stuff for a 20-year-old at Oxford, you might think. A young man finding his way in life. But something happened that the young woman wasn’t happy about. As pertheTimes,‘She had expressed “discomfort” about the encounter and soon after Rogers had a meeting with friends to discuss the “allegations”. They told him they believed he had “messed up”, that they needed space from him and that they would check up on him a couple of weeks later.’ Rogers had appeared ‘distraught after this conversation’. He entered the Thames from Donnington Bridge in Oxford a day or two after his interrogation. Emergency services retrieved his body from the water and found he had suffered a head trauma. You can only imagine what his parents went through when they picked up the phone. What they felt when they had to identify his body. The ostracism inflicted on Alexander was certainly effective. It was swift but not justice. At the inquest, coroner Nicholas Graham found that on the balance of probabilities this culture of exclusion did not contribute to Alexander’s decision to take his own life. But he added: ‘It is certainly possible that such a culture influenced the actions of Alexander’s peers in forming the judgments that they did; it is also possible that Alexander felt that – because of this culture – there was no way of getting back into the social group that obviously meant so much to him once he had been excluded. What I cannot say is that this was probable.’ In fact, this culture of exclusion and isolation was found by the coroner to be widespread and so dangerous that he has spoken out against it. Graham, the area coroner for Oxfordshire, has written to the Department for Education with concerns that ‘exclusionary behaviour’ is becoming commonplace on campuses. He called on ministers to take action, warning that future deaths could result if the issue was not addressed. ‘There is concern that social ostracism has become normalised within student communities, with individuals viewing it as an expected and accepted response to certain allegations or behaviours,’ Graham wrote. ‘This normalisation hinders the development of healthy and supportive social environments.’ Why would these students, the younger brothers and sisters of the Millennials, who pride themselves so much on being kind, on being ‘awake to social injustices’, who will have grown up with circle time, star of the week, and buddy systems engage in such a brutal culture of isolation? The fact that young men are engaging in behaviour that was once considered mostly female behaviour – the bitching, the exclusion, the social isolation in sum, mean girls behaviour – is frightening and telling. Previously, disputes like this might have been settled with a fist fight. Instead of settling these issues like men, the coroner explained how the isolation works: He wrote: ‘The evidence . . . was that students could rush to judgment without knowledge of all the facts, could shun those accused, and [a] “pile-on” might occur, where a group would form a negative view about another individual.’ In other words, judgment is swift, there is no due process, no right of appeal, and the punishment is brutal, a “pile-on” and shunning. Alexander was trapped in Oxford, where colleges are designed to facilitate collaboration and intimate exchanges. There was no escape. The fact that Alexander took his life a mere two days after his friends told him he was now firmly on the outside and that they ‘would check up on him a couple of weeks later’ is evidence of how devastating this behaviour is. They didn’t give him a badge to wear – perhaps a scarlet letter – but they didn’t have to. The word will have gone out. Alexander Rogers was persona non grata. A modern leper. I wonder how many of these Oxford friends took up the chance to check up on him at his funeral? Why did his friends engage in this behaviour, so clearly unethical, so obviously cruel? Why did no one speak up on his behalf? Did not a single friend say, this seems a bit harsh, or let’s refer it to the college authorities? I suspect they were all too terrified of each other, that they would be next, they would be the one on the outside. Again, it demonstrates how brutal and effective woke social exclusion is. It is also worth asking why Alexander was so sensitive to this exclusion. This woke generation, who pride themselves on kindness while cutting their friends off at the legs, and those who suffer at their hands, are unique in their actions and responses. They are uniquely vulnerable and insecure. They are too peer-oriented because they have been denied a secure attachment when they were young. And they have been denied that attachment because this is the daycare generation grown up. We are seeing the results of this daycare experiment now, 20 years on. I say this not to add to the devastating loss of Alexander’s family. But it is worth thinking about. I have reason to believe one of my own children is insecurely attached, although I tried my best, so I am not judging. But as we seem so firmly on this path, with the government funding institutional care of very young babies to the tune of millions, it is worth asking what you are going to get at the end of it. I believe we are ending up with insecure young adults too attached to peer groups that will turn on each other on a dime, with terrible results. This isn’t pure speculation; it is a conclusion I have come to after reading two books by Dr Gabor Maté,Scattered MindsandThe Myth of Normal. Maté says that one of his sons, now an adult, said ‘as a teenager I was consumed by what my friends thought of me, how much they liked me, what it took to fit in with their expectation’. Maté concludes: ‘Of course, his peer orientation was not about his peers per se; it was a natural outcome of his parents’ lack of availability as emotionally attuned adults in his early years.’ Maté makes clear in this book and another,Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers, is that this is not about teenagers moving away from their parents to form an independent and authentic self. That is natural. Instead, with this generation the move away from the parents towards peers is a false independence. They do not have a chance to develop their own identity. They are crippled by what their peers think of them. And if they think badly, if they put you in the colony marked ‘you messed up and took advantage of a woman’, you can only imagine the damage, the shattering of the internal self to a young man. It’s the kind of thing that makes you jump into the river to end it all. A total rejection by those whose opinion you care about the most: your friends. As Maté states, ‘As a rule, immature peers are constitutionally incapable of accepting each other “as is”; or holding space for the vulnerable experience of emotion, let alone its open expression; or relieving one another’s stressed states; or celebrating or even tolerating temperamental differences. Left to its own callow devices, the peer group can offer only acceptance that is highly conditional and thus insecure, often demanding self-suppression and conformity in place of true individuality.’ The Tories decided on a massive expansion of childcare for babies as young as nine months. We atTCWhave always objected to this government policy and on further reflection I believe things will only get worse unless we understand the damage we are inflicting on our children in their hundreds of thousands. There are the rare cases where children are subject to serious abuse in crèches, and then there are all the other toddlers left bewildered and unable to find comfort and love as they compete for attention with other confused toddlers. Friends from home, those who grew up with Alex in Salisbury, said he ‘was undeniably caring. He would fill up a room with his laughs and smiles and brought so much joy to us all. A man that lived life to the full, who gave us our favourite stories and memories and whom we miss deeply’.Another friend, Olivia O’Donnell, who completed the Salisbury Plain Half Marathon in his memory, said: ‘To this day, I cannot fathom this loss, and I will forever love him with all my heart. Alex spread joy and held the brightest smile in the room. The laughter he spread will never leave us, but at 20 years old, he was taken from us far before his time.’ We can only hope that Alexander Rogers finds the peace and love in death that he was unable to find in his young adult life.

Killing freedom under the banner of public health,"WEIGHT loss injections were recently proposed by the Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting as an incentive to get unemployed people suffering from weight-related health issues back into work. Fat chance that Streeting’s drug ordinance will solve social ills. (It is more likely to createnew medical ones.) Streeting’s comments (downplayed of course as with all the other lies of the last four years) have further highlighted the clear political motivations behind the ominous direction of the UK healthcare system. From 2020, we have seen an implosion of citizen rights and responsibilities, from enforced lockdowns, social distancing and covid wardens on the street, right up to ‘jabs for jobs’. All this has been justified under the banner of public health. During the 1950s, the American sociologistTalcott Parsonswas the first to explore the relationship between citizenship and health, coining the phrase ‘the sick role’. Revisiting Emile Durkheim’s earlier sociological theory ofstructural functionalismand the idea that all elements of society ultimately contribute to social order, Parsons aimed to demonstrate this in a unique way. He argued that ill-health highlights what happens when societal roles are suspended and people withdraw from their everyday duties. Parsons suggested that the sick role is as much about the resulting social and cultural responses which occur as it is about the incapacitating conditions themselves. Whenever we opt out of our designated responsibilities and citizen duties through adverse health, he observed, the sick role serves to bring two rights and two responsibilities into focus that ordinarily uphold and contribute to social order. As Paul Taylor explains in his book‘Sociology in Focus‘, ‘Illness is not a not simply a state of fact or condition but a specifically patterned social role.’ So what are the rights and obligations Parsons speaks of and how do they relate to health and wellbeing in modern society? Rights • Firstly, Parsons argued that a sick person is generally regarded as being temporarily exempt from their normal societal role and accompanying duties. The more severe the condition, the greater the justification for exemption. A sick person, he reasoned, holds a democratic right to withdraw from their societal role for the duration of a health condition. Thus, a person may take time off work or withdraw from family duties when they are ill. Parsons argued that it is important to understand that this exemption status is dependent on the severity and type of affliction. • Secondly, a person is not generally held to be responsible for an illness or health condition. Being ill is generally considered to be out of a person’s control, so it is accepted that they have a right to be taken care of and to receive the necessary treatment. This status might be different if a person is suffering from a self-inflicted health condition, such as alcoholism, drug addiction or obesity – as we shall see, health conditions where personal responsibility might be attributed have conditions attached to these rights. Obligations • A sick person is expected to hold the view that their condition is undesirable and that their exemption from society is only temporary. Parsons argues that those who occupy the sick role are under an obligation to get well again and return to their societal duties as soon as they are able. • A person occupying the sick role is expected to go along with the advice of experts in the medical profession, or to liaise with knowledgeable professionals to give themselves the best chance of getting well again.  The sick role is rubber-stamped by medical professionals – either directly or via generally held perspectives on the latest scientific evidence – where this expertise can either justify or discredit leave of absence from a person’s normal social role. This second obligation is fundamental to Parsons’s argument, where he reasons that the sick role demonstrates the power of the medical establishment in our society. Not only is the bio-medical model of health the recognised authority on the classification and the identification of illness, but the dominant healthcare model holds the principal monopoly on the legitimate practices on prognosis, healing and cure. All four of the rights and obligations outlined by Parsons are ultimately dependent on procedures and practices which have been established by the dominant agencies of medical healthcare. Re-emphasising the philosophy of functionalism as a theory of social order, Parsons proposed that the sick role is a unique combination of value themes, juxtaposed around vulnerability and deviancy. While a person suffering from an illness might be characterised on the one hand as being vulnerable and in need of care and treatment, the sick role is also deviant in the sense that the suspension of citizen duties and obligations may become attractive for all the wrong reasons. Parsons argues that this role must be managed by the state to prevent a breakdown in social order. The idea that illness can be understood by observing citizen rights and responsibilities is particularly relevant to covid-era healthcare. The medical pharmaceutical complex has assumed unprecedented influence over our lives since 2020 and the wholesale transformation in our rights and responsibilities became dependent upon following the advice of medical professionals. A ‘good citizen’ followed the guidelines that were rolled out. Many actually called for citizen rights to be taken away from people who were labelled ‘free-riders’. COVID: unvaccinated people may be seen as ‘free riders’ and face discrimination People were refused medical treatment if they were unvaccinated, and many lost jobs for questioning or refusing to follow their new obligations as citizens. The nature of Parsons’s concept of the sick role changed during this time. There was an implicit understanding that people suffering from covid held priority over those waiting for treatment from other medical conditions. These people now became peripheralised by the medical establishment, with many dying because the healthcare system was ‘overwhelmed’ by the pandemic. The shadow of compulsory vaccination hung has over this period, a situation where all human rights would have been suspended. Among the endless range of magic bullets now being promised for a widening range of previously intractable health conditions, Streeting’s comments highlight the dangerous repositioning of our healthcare systems around the increasingly nefarious intentions of the state. Our citizenship status is now more and more based upon the power of politicians and their allies to define health and wellbeing, and our willingness to go along with their increasingly dubious solutions.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Culture War,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/killing-freedom-under-the-banner-of-public-health/
The climate scaremongers – energy operator tells Miliband: Your plans cannot work,"LABOUR’S manifesto promised we would have a zero carbon electricity system by 2030. It is a pledge that Ed Miliband has been making for years, not least in his party conference speech last year, and it was also one of Labour’s ‘Five Missions for a Better Britain’ policy pledge launched last year. It would therefore be reasonable to presume that Miliband had a detailed plan of how he would achieve this and in particular how much it might all cost. So it came as a surprise when shortly after taking office in July he asked the National Energy System Operator, NESO, to provide practical advice on achieving the target. NESO have now responded with some bad news! Many energy experts have long argued that a zero carbon grid simply is not possible at these timescales, because you cannot run a grid predominantly on intermittent renewable energy. It turns out that NESO, whose job is to make sure that Britain has the electricity has it needs every second of the day, agree. Their reportsent to Ed Miliband emphasises that we will need to retain a full fleet of gas power plants to fire up when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine: This really is a damning indictment not only of Labour’s energy policy, but also of the whole Net Zero agenda and its reliance on intermittent renewable energy. Even though NESO say that gas power will supply only 5 per cent of our electricity, they admit there will be many days when we will need it for half our power or more, just as we do now. And keeping a fleet of gas plants on standby creates problems of its own. They will need to be fully manned all year, fully maintained, and ready to fire up when needed, all of which will cost a lot of money. With these plants standing idle most of the time, operators will demand billions in standby payments, all of which will end up on our energy bills. We will have to pay for two electricity systems – one for when the wind blows, and the other for when it does not! The NESO report also confirms that the increase in wind and solar power demanded by Miliband will drastically increase bills, not lower them as we were promised. Not only is renewable energy more expensive to produce than gas generation, there are indirect costs to consider, such as the standby capacity mentioned above, storage, curtailment payments when we have too much wind, and grid upgrades. Analysis of NESO data suggests that annual costs could be £20billion higher by 2030 if Miliband’s plans are carried through. NESO also say that annual investment of £48billion will be needed for grid upgrades between now and 2030 to achieve targets. All this expenditure will merely end up duplicating what we already have. If this was not all bad enough, over-reliance on intermittent renewables will mean that we will end up having energy rationing. According to NESO, households will have to switch off appliances at times of peak demand. Currently, of course, gas generation is turned up and down to match demand. They hope the public will do it voluntarily! Good luck with that. The reality is that there will be brownouts and punitive pricing to discourage electricity consumption at peak times. Unsurprisingly, Ed Miliband has already been bragging that this new report proves that his clean power plan is both achievable and will lead to cheaper electricity. Both are outright lies. But it looks as if we will have to prove this the hard way! Bragging in Baku SIR Keir Starmer flew out to Azerbaijan to make a speech at COP29 on Tuesday. He is obviously deluded enough to think that the rest of the world would pay the slightest attention to the platitudes and lies he delivered in his usual monotone. It was almost as if his speech had been written by ChatBot. He talked of a climate crisis, opportunities for Britain, 1.5C warming and technologies of the future. He lied that Net Zero would bring energy independence, by which he meant reliance on the EU for electricity imports, and boosting living standards, when his plans will push up energy prices and destroy jobs. He bragged about stopping new North Sea oil and gas licences, while spending billions on inefficient technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. And he claimed the UK was a ‘climate leader’, committing to an 81 per cent cut in emissions by 2035 (meaning a cut of 65 per cent from today’s emissions). He does not seem to realise that nobody else is in this race. Meanwhile Azerbaijan’s President revealed the same day that his country would continue to exploit its God-given reserves of oil and gas. As ever with COPs, this one is all about the money. COP29’s President, the Azerbaijani Minister for Ecology, demanded $8trillion to ‘fight climate change’, claiming that we had ‘marshalled’ the same amount to fight Covid-19. Will Starmer and Lammy have the backbone to stand up to this blackmail? I doubt it. Over 66,000 are attending the jamboree, including 470 ministers and officials from the UK. Yet curiously only 3,975 have registered for ‘virtual online’ participation. So much for saving the planet! Why, for instance, did Starmer fly out to make a speech that nobody took any notice of? Could he not have done a video presentation instead? As for the other 469 bureaucrats and ministers, why are we even employing them? Nothing they do will alter the weather.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-15T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-energy-operator-tells-miliband-your-plans-cannot-work/
"Here is the long-term weather report: same old, same old","I HAVE been living for over 77 years, and for half of that time I have apparently been living through a time of increasing climate risk, now escalated to a climate emergency. Perhaps I was sleeping, but I hadn’t really noticed. What I have noticed over the years has been the occurrence of a wide variety of different and severe weather events, something which I learnt early on in developing my interest in weather was a salient feature of life in the British Isles with its frequent changes of dominant air masses. I was born in February 1947, in bitter, winter weather, not alleviated by the immediate post-war austerity. My father then decided we should move from Surrey to Dovercourt, once popular as a bracing East Coast resort adjacent to Harwich. Being taken there at six months old has always seemed to me a sort of survival ritual, akin to the custom of the Spartans, leaving their newborns out on the mountains. The first major weather event the I experienced at first hand was the East Coast storm of January 3/February 1, 1953. This really was a major event, and huge areas of eastern England were flooded by the North Sea. By then we had moved to Ipswich, which was fortunate, as there were a number of fatalities in Harwich and at many locations in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. The day prior to those floods, the same weather system brought severe gales across Scotland and Northern Ireland and caused the sinking of a rail ferry between Stranraer and Larne with the loss of over 100 lives. There was no debate, however, about climate change or zero carbon; rather it was about how to improve defences, flood warnings and responses. It was obvious from historical records that such events were far from unprecedented. Coronation Day, June 2, 1953, was much anticipated, but it turned out wet, cold and miserable.  My parents were never great on ‘big occasions’, so we went, as I remember, out for a bicycle ride in the country around Ipswich. Many people have childhood memories bathed in warmth and sunshine, but most of my early memories conjure up more of wet and cold. I remember the contrasting summers of 1958 and 1959. Rain seemed to dominate August 1958, at least so it appeared on the days when we attempted trips to the seaside or during a memorable thunderstorm as we walked back to Liverpool Street station from the Tower of London. I was beginning to take a keen interest in cricket and would listen toTest Match Specialon the radio, but that summer’s test series against New Zealand was constantly interrupted by rain. 1959 was the opposite: the sun shone well into the autumn, it hardly rained through September and into October, and so we were restricted to playing touch rugby until the October half-term. Following the long drought of 1959, I identified that for many parts of Southeast England, the 14-month period from December 1959 to January 1961 produced two years’ worth of average rainfall. I recall frequent extensive floods on Suffolk rivers and many soil slumps on the banks of deep lanes. 1960 produced widespread flooding around Exeter, which nine years later gave me early work experience of historic flood analysis for the Devon River Authority. Winter 1962/63 was extreme by anybody’s reckoning. I had by then become so interested in weather that I was taking daily temperature readings on a maximum-minimum thermometer mounted on a north-facing wall. From the day when the snow arrived in a blizzard on December 27 until March 3, the minimum temperature did not rise above 0°C. A warm front from the Atlantic tried to make inroads on the blocking high toward the end of January, and two drizzly days did push temperature up to 1°C, so there were 62 consecutive days with frost. The weather was dominated by dry easterly winds, and I was able to watch the process of ablation gradually reduce the depth of lying snow.  I also carried out an experiment where I placed a pebble on the solid ice that filled an old roasting tin in the garden: I noted over a period of a few days how the pebble gradually sank into the ice as a result of its weight (pressure), melting a thin layer of ice beneath it, just as described in the Physical Geography textbooks. By now climatologists were concentrating on possibilities of the return of at least a mini-ice-age, exacerbated by fears of attempted climate manipulation by Russian nuclear testing in northern Siberia. I shall not prolong this catalogue of events, but suffice it to say that these weather extremes were experienced by many people in the UK. Why have these been ignored by today’s media when it comes to reporting severe events? What is behind the collective amnesia, or in more modern parlance, ‘denial’? And of course regular severe events continued. These included violent thunderstorms in East Anglia in July 1968 (coinciding with my graduation) and a few weeks later, to disrupt my journey to Belfast to take up my first postgraduate appointment. I missed the flooding events that affected Sussex, Kent and Essex on September 14/1, 1968. There was a major storm and flood over Hampstead Heath in August 1975, which I witnessed from Wimbledon; I was also involved in the immediate post-event analysis. I left the UK just as the prolonged summer heatwave of 1976 began and spent most of the next 22 years working abroad, mostly in monsoon and tropical climates. At least I had plenty of experience of tropical downpours, monsoon deluges and long, hot droughts – enough to realise that the weather-related adjectives now used by the media in this country are somewhat exaggerated! During my absence from the UK between 1976 and 1998, a revolution in the TV presentation of weather forecasting took place. Francis Wilson was one of the first to use graphics to depict the movement of weather systems, a process that had already been started by several commercial TV weather channels in the USA. Michael Fish of course became famous overnight with his ‘no hurricane’ statement during the devastating 1987 storm. In the UK, TV weather forecast became media- and personality-orientated and no longer the preserve of a formalised statement pattern issued from the Met Office. I was present when ‘climate change’ perhaps went public, at the Lacey Memorial Lecture 1991 to the Institution of Civil Engineers by Sir John Mason, Director General of the Met Office. He introduced the topic as a focus of research by the Met Office that could be of interest to civil engineers. In an unbiased, non-committal summary, he gave his opinion that the world was under greatest threat from population growth, which for two decades became a central theme of David Attenborough! Climate-change theory became focussed in the 1990s on large-scale droughts, especially inthe Sahel. This was a well documented situation, and indeed serious, but it was not unprecedented, though the populations involved were. The drought eventually eased and by the early 2000s the greening of the Sahara became evident from satellite imagery. In the UK the 1990s were also marked by droughts, and widespread concern over drying up of major reservoirs, groundwater sources, river headwaters, etc – which eventually of course recovered. In 1998 it started raining with a vengeance. Widespread flooding in April prompted the government to take a concerted look at all aspects of flooding, culminating in the production ofthe Bye Report. Mr Bye was a prominent civil servant, not an engineer, hydrologist or meteorologist. No sooner had the industry started to respond to the Bye Report than a series of major floods occurred from October 2000 to October 2002, and this concentrated the mind wonderfully. I was seconded from HR Wallingford to a National Flood Warning Centre (England and Wales), a joint operation between the Environment Agency and the Met Office. This secondment lasted nearly two years and was very interesting. Our first ‘active’ flood found two or three of us working late, desperately trying to locate flooded sites on an AA Road Atlas! The operation and organisation would become much slicker and more thorough, developing websites that provided near-real-time updated data on river levels, rainfall, and weather radar, and also flood forecasts and warnings. There were people in the group from media and political backgrounds and ‘blue sky’ thinkers who began to provide the impetus for thoughts on climate change. One interesting thing to emerge in examining the locations of major floods in winter 2000/01 was the amazing similarity they bore to the flooding of 1851. This information was readily available in theBritishHydrochronology(Frank Law-British Hydrological Society), which catalogues all major floods from written sources. The first entry was from the 13th century, so information existed on the severity of past floods to which today’s ‘unprecedented’ events can be compared. Various groups with political agendas, and especially the television and press media, began to raise the question of climate change influencing individual weather events. These influences were denied by professional engineers, meteorologists and hydrologists, but eventually the pressure told, and in 2010/11 the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology made a statement conceding that a single event could be influenced by recent global warming. This has since opened the floodgates for a range of half-baked opinions and wild speculations. The flights of fancy have lately produced such irrelevant ideas as ‘named storms’ and the shifting of climate change to far more exaggerated and emotive terms like ‘climate catastrophe’ or ‘climate emergency’; even ‘global burning’. I hope I have made clear a few climate vicissitudes during the first 30 years of my life. I had become professionally involved in hydrometeorology over that period, and do not recall any great concern over climate changeper se. There had certainly been a lot of interest in catchment studies and severe rainfall events. The publication of the NERC Flood Studies Report in 1975 was a major achievement in objective analysis for dam and river flood design. Only in the period since 2010 has the fixation on climate change ballooned. To my mind this has been the result of political pressure, whatever the reasons. The make-up and variety of weather across the British Isles has remained unchanged; thus the climate is about the same as before.",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-16T01:16:00+00:00,Climate Watch,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/here-is-the-long-term-weather-report-same-old-same-old/
Revealed: Pfizer’s hidden vaccine injuries ,"MAINSTREAM media has extensively reported on the catastrophic injuries caused byAstraZeneca’scovid vaccination but has yet to detail the truth about Pfizer-BioNTech’s covid jab. Hidden in America’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), there is a significant number of detailed, serious, adverse events from the UK, all relating to Pfizer’s injection and submitted by Pfizer. VAERS collects post-vaccine injury data from other countries, not just the US, and by November 11 2022, two years into the covid vaccination drive, it had published 103,000 British reports. UK citizens suffered multiple serious symptoms including debilitating headache, chest pain and heart abnormalities, anaphylaxis, clots, vision problems, serious autoimmune conditions and tinnitus. Many patients described a metallic taste in the mouth which can be a sign of poisoning, or neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a paralysing, potentially fatal autoimmune condition known to be linked to the Pfizer jab. By December 8, 2021, the UK’s Yellow Card Scheme had received69 reports of GBSlinked with Pfizer jabs but did not consider this statistically significant compared with incidence in the wider population. The cause of GBS is ‘unknown’ or to use a more recent word, ‘baffling’, meaning it is not possible to rule out vaccination as a cause. According to the respected journalNature,GBS is a known reaction to many vaccines, including covid mRNA. Disturbingly, 13 per cent of the 103,000 VAERS British reports related to the under-25 age group, which according to pathologist Clare Craig dispels the myth that vaccine reactions occur only in the elderly. She said: ‘This statistic suggests that young people are not immune to experiencing adverse reactions, challenging the notion that vaccine side effects are coincidences that occur predominantly in older, sicker populations. The median age of individuals reporting adverse events was 41, indicating that middle-aged adults represent a substantial portion of the reports.’ The MHRA Yellow Card Scheme recorded 2,240 suspected deaths. AstraZeneca vaccines are associated with most deaths. Pfizer comes a close second. The reports detail cases of death, life-threatening conditions and hospitalisation all linked to the Pfizer jab. Most patients, 83 per cent, were available for follow-up consultations which added credibility, but few were contacted according to the data. Pro-vaxers dismiss the Yellow Card Scheme, collated by our drugs watchdog the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), saying that anyone can add them, but most, if not all, events found in VAERS have detailed descriptions probably submitted by clinicians and pharmacists. Distressing examples include a 30-year-old woman with no co-morbidities, who suffered life-threatening anaphylaxis after receiving Pfizer batch number EJ0553 on December 18, 2020. Her throat swelled and her condition was assessed as being ‘medically significant and life-threatening’. She was patient report number GB-MHRA-ADR 24545042. One man, age unknown, was admitted to hospital on December 17, 2020, spitting blood, vomiting blood, bleeding from his nose, with headache and dizziness. He suffered a horrible death three days later. His report number is GB-MHRA-ADR 24545199, batch number unknown, and his death was considered ‘unexplained’. The batch numbers are significant. The US chart below shows that some batches caused 100 times more adverse events than others. Was this because the public were part of the trial with some vials having more active ingredient than others? A Danish studypublished in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation in July, 2023 suggests this is the case. The population of Denmark is 5.8million and received 52 batches that had three different adverse event outcomes. Researchers examined suspected adverse events (SAEs) for the Pfizer vaccine and produced the graph below. The blue line clearly shows thousands more reactions than the green line, while the yellow line could have been placebo as not a single SAE was reported. The following table relates to the ten worst Pfizer batches used in the UK and was obtained under freedom of information from the MHRA in September 2024. At some stage, probably after 2021, the publicly available reports suddenly disappeared. VAERS published a disclaimer stating that the data had been deleted at the request of the European regulators. Thankfully, Marek Pawlewski, a data scientist who worked in the hi-tech industry for over 30 years, had the foresight to download it. His subsequent analysis (below) highlights important symptoms taken from a list of over 5,000. Neither the MHRA nor any other drug regulatory agency have explained why they failed to pull the covid vaccines. In 2009, the vaccine Pandemrix was introduced during the swine flu pandemic. It was discontinued after34 deaths.Covid vaccines caused 273 per cent more deaths per 1,000 doses compared with Pandemrix but are still available with the MHRA stating ‘they are the best defence against covid’. Pawlewski also calculated the harms caused by the flu jab between  January 1, 2020 and December 13, 2020, compared with the covid jab a year later from December 14, 2020 to November 30, 2021. Both periods are around 11.5 months. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 50 per cent of the US population were vaccinated with the flu vaccine, and approximately 70 per cent of the US population were vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 over the same time frame. The final comparison was adjusted to account for the difference between the uptake of the two jabs. Like the MHRA, VAERS is a victim of under-reporting, receiving around ten per cent of reactions. Some say it could be as low as one per cent. Nevertheless, the calculation shows that a person is 91 times more likely to die after a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; that someone is 80 times more likely to be hospitalised after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine; a person is 81 times more likely to develop a life-threatening event after receiving a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine and someone is 82 times more likely to experience a serious adverse event after a covid vaccine compared with a flu vaccine. Even with reports that were less serious, someone was 42 times more likely to report a less serious event if they had the covid jab compared with the flu jab. This data was submitted to the Metropolitan Police at Hammersmith Police station in December 2021 by former GP partner Dr Sam White, solicitors Philip Hyland and Lois Bayliss and retired police officer Mark Sexton, as evidence of malfeasance. The team were issued a crime number, 6029679/21, and subsequently sent the police hundreds of official documents provided by scientists including retired Pharma executive Sasha Latypova and former Pfizer Vice President Mike Yeadon. Inexplicably, the police took no further action. Pawlewski said: ‘Before all this I was minding my own business and didn’t question vaccines. I had one AstraZeneca and had flu symptoms for over a week, my wife had the same and we decided to get no more. Then a friend sent me a video produced by [researcher and computer programmer] Craig Paardekooper who was also tracking data that showed some batches were worse than others. [Paardekooper then started his websiteHow Bad Is My Batch.] I watched it and thought there’s no way, then I downloaded the data myself, checked it, and he was right. I then asked my colleague Jason Morphett, an experienced data scientist, to independently review the data. He reached the same conclusion. ‘I was shocked and worried for friends and family which is why I shared the information with the police. I thought once they had it, they would stop the vaccine rollout in its tracks, but nothing happened. That woke me up big time.’ The MHRA said: ‘The MHRA does not directly report suspected adverse drug reaction reports to the US VAERS system. However, vaccine manufacturers are required by US law to submit certain foreign (non-US) source adverse event reports to VAERS. ‘We continue to review reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome received following vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines. ‘Every medicine or vaccine is assessed by the MHRA independently based on its own benefits and risks. For the Covid-19 vaccines, the benefits continue to outweigh any known side effects.’ VAERS state: ‘Under US regulations, vaccine manufacturers must report to VAERS each adverse experience that is both serious and unexpected, whether foreign or domestic, as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the applicant.’ NOTE: By November 11 2021, 701million doses of Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine had been administered, with nearly 800,000 reports of suspected adverse events made to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).",The Conservative Woman,2024-11-11T01:19:00+00:00,COVID-19,Polarised,https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/revealed-pfizers-hidden-vaccine-injuries/
Corbyn and McDonnell leave police station after being INTERVIEWED UNDER CAUTION by Met,"Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have been interviewed under caution by the Met Police. It was over the force’s alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met – accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media – ‘doorstopping’ the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn’s response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police’s actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day – notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children’s marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers – including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures – would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines – the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, ‘please filter through.’ When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation – a maximum of 25 people – be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to ‘pass this up the line for a decision.’ While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police’s actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.",Canary,2025-01-19T17:21:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-mcdonnell-met-police/
People rally at the Old Bailey in support of the Palestine Action Filton 18,"Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them – and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the ‘Filton 18’ political prisoners have entered ‘not guilty’ pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel’s largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including ‘quadcopter’ drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a ‘terrorism connection’. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel’s largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK’s complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a “terror connection” in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.",Canary,2025-01-19T15:02:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/filton-18-trial/
Jeremy Corbyn slams Met Police's wilful 'inaccuracies' following mass-arrests at Palestine march,"On Saturday 18 January, Britons once again took to the streets to show their support for the people of Palestine. As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as “fascist” police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn’s response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn’s former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers’ body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel’s genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included “domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide.” The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel’s wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel’s genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn’t turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned ‘second phase’ of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn’t mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It’s alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it’s not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions “go away” and that they’ll be “locked up”. On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn’t come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn’t be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It’s all the same system; it’s all the same violence; we’re just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won’t hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.",Canary,2025-01-19T14:01:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-met-police-palestine-march/
The blame game: the rise in false allegations of maternal abuse in long Covid and disability,"With Donald Trump’s election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women’s rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right – just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there’s always someone else to blame – not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations – almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It’s one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It’s another to be blamed for your child’s disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. “Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called “Functional Somatic Syndromes” (FSS) and “Medically Unexplained Syndromes” (MUS) umbrellas”.  DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there’s a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument – with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It’s such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there’s no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke’s Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It’s more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope – one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education’ changed the phrase ‘deliberately missing’ education to ‘unexplainable and/or persistent absence’ in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it’s easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem – all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism. It supplies simple answers, shifts the blame game on to the individual – all to avoid institutional due diligence. It is no wonder that women have been caught in the crosshairs. We have become an easy target for complex problems.",Canary,2025-01-19T12:51:45+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/fii-long-covid/
Starmer ends a disastrous week with his most ridiculous pledge yet,"Prime minister Keir Starmer has had another bad week. While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven’t all ended with a punchline. That’s because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn’t finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn’t: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the “stomach or the balls” to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: “Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election.” Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a ‘fighter’: While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun – a newspaper which has been in decline for years – he’s not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he’s also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer’s war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain’s disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: “We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,” Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. “I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he’s going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off.” We’re sure he does remind himself of that; we’re sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can’t keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they’re just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn’t understand that while you can get away with telling people ‘I will deliver’; you can’t get away with delivering people shit once you’re in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet – the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is ‘yes’; the long answer is ‘ha ha ha ha ha, yes’. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced – a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don’t know how long he’ll last as prime minister, but we do know there’ll be serious talk of him going if this year’s local elections go as badly as people are predicting.",Canary,2025-01-19T11:34:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/starmer-new-policy/
It didn't take long. The British public now believe Keir Starmer should resign as prime minister.,"It’s little over five months since the Labour Party won the election. Yet a majority of the UK public are now opting for Keir Starmer to resign as prime minister, according to YouGov. 40% of respondents think he should resign, while 36% think he should remain and 24% don’t know. Further, Starmer has a net favourability rating of -38. But many who are sick of the two party status quo see Nigel Farage’s Reform as a viable alternative, partly through years of corporate media boosting his profile. In a recent poll for YouGov on voting intention, Farage’s Reform was just one point behind Labour. It had Starmer’s Labour on 26%, Reform on 25% and the Conservatives trailing on 22%. The surge of Reform underscores the need for the progressive left to unite, potentially under an umbrella group to defeat the far right. In France, the New Popular Front – a broad alliance of the left, centre left, communists and Greens – received the most votes in the 2024 parliamentary election. Starmer indicated what he would prefer in the general election, where he gifted Farage his seat on a platter through essentially withdrawing the Labour candidate for Clacton. Starmer abandoned every pledge he made to become Labour leader and through that dropped many policies that are immensely popular with the people. These include public ownership of water, energy and healthcare. 2024 polling shows that 82% want water in public ownership, 71% for energy and 87% for the NHS. Yet Starmer lied about carrying out water nationalisation even as monopoly firms have paid out £72.8bn in dividends over the years, along with eye watering salaries and bonuses for corporate bosses. He lied about nationalising energy and what’s particularly embarrassing is that Britons don’t even own the national grid itself, which alone has paid out £28bn in dividends since privatisation. And instead of ‘ending outsourcing’ in the NHS as promised, Starmer is expanding private provision of NHS services by 20%, instead of properly investing in healthcare. On foreign policy, Starmer has failed to stand up to Israel with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn showing what leadership on the issue looks like. 56% want the government to ban arms sales to Israel, compared to 17% who don’t. Yet Starmer has only blocked a woeful 8.5% of licenses. As well as these policies, Starmer has raised bus fares by 50%, cut the winter fuel payment for some of the least well off pensioners and announced cuts of 5% to each government department. Starmer’s mantra of positive ‘change’ looks like anything but. Hence, the Tory/ Labour double act continues and provides ample fuel for an alternative.",Canary,2025-01-17T20:32:49+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/starmer-resignation-polling/
The March for Palestine is STILL ON - despite the Met Police's attempt to disrupt it,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators will gather in London on Saturday as they have done throughout the 15 months of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. This will be the eve of the ceasefire that Palestinians and their supporters around the world have desperately sought as Israel carried out a barbaric assault on Gaza with catastrophic results. Ending the bombing is only the start. Israel’s siege on Gaza must be lifted immediately to enable the flow of vital humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. The ceasefire must be permanent. The genocidal onslaught in Gaza is rooted in decades of oppression – ethnic cleansing, settler-colonisation, military occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. It has been enabled by decades of support for Israel from UK governments, corporations and institutions. For all these reasons and more, we will continue our campaigns and demonstrations such as that tomorrow in London. Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and its Coalition partners have organised 22 major demonstrations since October 2023, working with the police authorities. The marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful and well-ordered as the police themselves have accepted. However, this protest has suffered from heavy handed police obstruction using powers under the Public Order Act that erode our democratic rights. The Met Police originally agreed the route of the march, BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, in November 2024, but have this month reneged on their undertaking on the grounds that it would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel’s actions – including MPs, trade unions leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 900 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of a march. Over the past week the Met Police have imposed a series of repressive conditions to prevent us marching and have even attempted to impose a route that the Board of Deputies announced they had suggested to the police. This has been firmly rejected by the Palestine Coalition – it is an affront that pro-Israel groups can attempt to decide where we can or cannot march. Despite intensive efforts to reach a compromise with the Met, it has so far refused to accept or offer a reasonable solution. However, we will assemble on Whitehall on Saturday at noon. We reiterate our call on the police to lift their repressive conditions and allow us to march. If they continue to refuse to do so and prevent us from marching, we will be rallying in Whitehall to protest. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said : Israel’s genocide has not ended. Even now, while we await a ceasefire, Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are dying from bombardment, and suffering from lack of medical care, food and shelter. We demand a permanent ceasefire, an end to the siege of Gaza and the immediate provision of massive humanitarian aid. It is absolutely legitimate and necessary for us in the UK to be holding our government to account for it’s military, diplomatic and economic support of Israel, which continues to be investigated by the world courts for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But this protest has been marred by political policing which is an attack on our fundamental democratic rights. The Met has seemingly accepted and acted upon the arguments of pro-Israel groups that seek to delegitimise our protest as antisemitic or a threat to Jewish people. This is a gross distortion of the truth. There is not a single instance of our marches posing any threat to synagogues or Jewish individuals. Indeed, we count a large, self-organised Jewish bloc as some of our most indefatigable supporters. The Met’s approach has been confrontational, heavy-handed and intransigent. Their use of powers under the Public Order Act has been based on flimsy grounds and arbitrarily applied, which erodes the right of peaceful protest that is fundamental in a democracy. Despite this, our protest tomorrow will go ahead – we call on all those who seek justice for Palestine to stand with us.",Canary,2025-01-17T16:58:23+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/march-for-palestine-route/
The 'Hastings Three' are in court next week for protesting outside an arms supplier to Israel,"Huge crowds are expected next week at the trial of the “Hastings Three”, who were charged nearly a year ago for their part in protesting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. NHS worker Clem McCulloch, 33, artist Thomas Delves, 25, and retired train driver Laurie Holden, 72, were arrested at General Dynamics arms factory on February 29 last year during a peaceful protest organized by the Hastings & District Palestine Solidarity Campaign (HDPSC) and supported by a coalition of community groups including Jewish groups, social justice and climate justice groups, parent groups, and political parties. All three will plead not guilty to charges of aggravated trespass when they come before a district judge at Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 22 January. The charge carries a maximum tariff of a three-month jail term and £2,500 fine. They are expected to be joined by a large number of supporters as local groups across the county – including Brighton Stop the War, University of Sussex Friends of Palestine and Brighton and Hove Palestine Solidarity Campaign (BHPSC) – have called a ‘solidarity rally’ in support of the three men. Ahead of the trial, BHPSC’s executive committee released a statement: BHPSC is a sister PSC branch to Hastings & District PSC, and have followed the case of the #Hastings3 with great interest – not least because we in Brighton know too well the indignation caused locally by having an arms factory based in our city – an arms factory (like General Dynamics in Hastings) that is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide being perpetrated by Israel upon the people of Gaza. The statement went on: The executive committee of BHPSC sends our solidarity to the three defendants whose case will be heard here in Brighton on the 22nd of January. Our many local members and supporters will be outside the court in large numbers on the 22nd to voice our support for our Hastings comrades, who are on trial for doing nothing more than exercising their right to peaceful non-violent protest. Compared with the appalling crimes against humanity being facilitated by the General Dynamics factory in Hastings and other weapons manufacturers in the UK, the actions of the #Hastings3 register as expressions of conscience rather than crimes. General Dynamics is the fifth largest global arms manufacturer and is responsible for all the MK80 bombs being dropped on Gaza. Laurie Holden, from Burwash, said: It is appalling that ordinary people like myself are in the dock instead of General Dynamics, which is making a killing from genocide. This will be the sixth time our case has come before the court, representing a disgusting waste of taxpayer’s money. Meanwhile, General Dynamics made $3.3 billion profit in 2023. “The Hastings Three are not guilty” said Grace Lally, twinning officer for the Hastings & District PSC: General Dynamics is guilty of profiting from war crimes and genocide. Two thousand pound bombs made by General Dynamics have been dropped on families sheltering in tents in the so-called safe zone of Al Mawasi, where our friends live and our community has deep connections. Nothing can justify this. General Dynamics has come under sustained pressure from concerned locals for its part in Israel’s 15-month campaign in Gaza. Hastings & District PSC has led more than a dozen actions to the two arms factory sites in Hastings since November 2023, including die-ins, marches, pickets and a 48-hour peace camp and the sites have also been subject to regular and spontaneous ‘pop up’ protests. Mum-of-one Olivia Cavanagh said: We don’t want this weapons manufacturer here in our town, making money from slaughtering innocent Palestinians, making us complicit in war crimes. A legal fighting fund for the three men has raised nearly £5,000 but still has some way to go to cover all their legal costs. “The outrageous and expensive pursuit of the #Hastings3 does not stand in isolation but forms part of a nationwide clamp down on peaceful protest” said Katy Colley, HDPSC Chair: Our friends are good men of conscience who, like the rest of us, cannot bear to see the wholesale destruction and annihilation we are witnessing in Gaza. The majority in this country stand against genocide, ethnic cleansing and apartheid. For fifteen months, people up and down the country have protested the UK’s complicity in the worst crime of our time, demanding that the UK stops arming Israel. Yet our government refuses to listen and those who speak out are smeared, defamed and persecuted. There are now over 46,000 confirmed dead in Gaza – mostly women and children – though a report this month in the Lancet estimated the real death toll to be at least 40% higher with the number of deaths in the first nine months alone estimated to be over 64,000. A year ago, the International Court of Justice put Israel in the dock for acts of genocide and last month, reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Medecins Sans Frontieres all concluded that Israel is guilty of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza. The rally at Brighton Magistrates Court begins at 9.30pm and donations to the legal fighting fund can be made here.",Canary,2025-01-17T15:43:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/hastings-general-dynamics-protest/
Government BURIED damning report in DWP PIP failings to try and push through reforms,"It’s been revealed by a leading disability news outlet that the previous Conservative government tried to bury a damning report into the DWP PIP system and its failings. We only know this thanks to the tenacity of one journalist. However, the issue raises further questions about the approach of the now-Labour Party government. In January 2024, Conservative ministers chose to withhold a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) report that highlighted significant issues within the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) system. This decision occurred just days before the release of a green paper proposing substantial changes to it. We only know this information thanks to John Pring at Disability News Service (DNS). As Pring wrote: DNS has obtained copies of emails exchanged last year between ministers and advisers, which show how the minister for disabled people, Mims Davies (pictured above, left), was asked to approve the publication of four Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research reports in January 2024. The unreleased report contained testimonies from disabled individuals who had undergone PIP assessments and received zero points, rendering them ineligible for support. One participant, diagnosed with ME and confined to bed for all but half an hour daily, described the assessment process as dismissive, noting that attempts to elaborate on his condition were abruptly halted. Such experiences left claimants feeling “broken,” “numb,” and “fuming.” Internal emails obtained through Pring’s freedom of information request revealed that on 29 January 2024, minister for disabled people Mims Davies was asked to approve the publication of four DWP research reports. This included the critical PIP study. A response on 8 February suggested delaying its release due to ongoing policy development. It cautioned that publication could “set hares running.” The final decision to withhold the report was made on 24 April, just five days before the green paper’s publication. On 29 April 2024, work and pensions secretary Mel Stride introduced the “Modernising Support for Independent Living” green paper. In this, the government expressed concerns over rising PIP expenditures. It also questioned the benefit’s value. The paper proposed making it more challenging to claim PIP and suggested replacing cash payments with vouchers or one-off grants, a move described by campaigners as a “brutal, ideological attack” on disabled people’s support. The timing of these events indicates a deliberate effort by ministers to suppress evidence of the PIP system’s deficiencies. It would have laid cover for advancing policies that could further restrict support for chronically ill and disabled people. The news comes as the DWP lost a court case over ex-Tory ministers’ reforms to the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Concerningly, the Labour government has already indicated it may go ahead with the changes, regardless.",Canary,2025-01-17T12:13:36+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/government-buried-dwp-pip-report/
"5,000 nurses come forward to expose the dire state of the NHS. It's a ""wake up call"" to Labour.","Over 5,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), a large UK and international union, have presented evidence showing the dire state of our NHS. Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN general secretary, said the findings are a “wake-up call” to Labour. The report, entitled On the frontline of the UK’s corridor care crisis, details testimony from nurses who observed patients dying in corridors, on trolleys and in chairs in waiting rooms. The crisis is also defined by nurses treating patients not only in corridors but in storerooms, carparks, offices and even toilets. There, patients have no access to critical equipment like oxygen or vital signs monitoring systems. There were also multiple testimonies of healthcare staff feeling that the scandal of corridor care has or can delay emergency procedures such as CPR. Further, nurses said corridor care was “routine” at their hospital or even happening “permanently”. Generally, the sheer volume of NHS nurses who have significant experience with corridor care is shocking. One pointed out that one nurse and a healthcare assistant were looking after 20-30 patients in a corridor. The report notes that selected testimonies already reflect the experience of many nurses. One said: I was redeployed from my shift in critical care to the emergency department – where I had never worked before. All bays were full and I also had 4 male patients on trolleys in the corridor who had been there since the previous night awaiting a hospital bed as all were admitted. This made for a concerning and difficult time since the patients were confused, there was no name allocated to a bed area as they were in corridors – staff knew these as ‘spaces’ as they were regularly used. Another said: Utilising corridors on daily basis now with patients staying up to 24 hours in these locations. Also seeing patient in the back of ambulances due to lack of flow through the system. Patients constantly receive poor dignity, are frustrated, in some cases refuse treatment and self discharge against advice due to situation placing them at risk of significant adverse event that would likely not have happened had the system been functioning as intended. This is demoralising for staff who wish to provide exceptional care, in some cases has led to long term sickness through depression and burn out, and has significantly increased staff turnover as it is no longer viewed as a sustainable career option for nurses and has diluted the overall knowledge and subsequent safety of the department. I have worked in Emergency care for nearly 20 years and have never seen it as bad as it is today, frankly it is embarrassing. Labour aren’t providing enough capital funding to fix the healthcare infrastructure we already have, let alone expanding buildings and technology to meet demand. So how will the corridor crisis end under their administration? Healthcare leaders have previously said hospitals are “outright dangerous” due to years of underfunding. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS needs an extra £6.7bn per year to maintain its estate. Labour has claimed it’s providing an “additional” £13.6bn in capital funding, but that’s actually a £3.1bn increase on the 2023-24 capital budget. The party is reportedly considering fresh private finance initiative (PFI) scams. That’s instead of the government providing sufficient public funding, the private sector loans the money off the books. Through PFI, the public purse is hugely overcharged for infrastructure in a heist of billions of pounds. Former Blairite advisor and now UK ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson is one of the figures behind the push for Labour to adopt PFI. Reeves has also walked back the headline figure in Labour’s budget of a £22.6bn increase in NHS day-to-day spending, through announcing a 5% cut to each governmental department. That leaves the spending increase at £7.6bn. This is far short of what’s required for the Long-term Workforce Plan. Rather than investing in the NHS, Keir Starmer’s Labour seems to be using the crisis as an opportunity for the private healthcare sector (which donates to Labour) to make cash from the struggling service. On 6 January, Starmer announced that the private sector will deliver an additional million appointments, scans, and operations a year. This is a 20% increase on the current private provision of five million operations, appointments and tests annually. This is not the answer – as anyone working in the NHS will tell you.",Canary,2025-01-16T19:50:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/nhs-rcn-report/
"DWP WCA consultation broke the law - yet Labour planning on making the Tories' changes, anyway","On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The DWP misrepresented the reforms as a way to give more disabled people support into work, citing figures that said 20% of people in the LCWRA group had said “would like to work at some point in the future”. Of course, they conveniently ignore the 80% who disagreed with this and that just 4% said they would be able to start work now if the right job and support were available. The consultation received a massive pushback from disabled people, who could see it for what it was: a cost-cutting measure designed to force people back into work and score points in the next election. Clifford and Aoife O’Reilly from the Public Law Project, who was acting as her representation, argued that the consultation was unlawful on many grounds. Firstly, the consultation did not explain that many disabled claimants impacted by the reforms would receive significantly less money and in some cases, be required to meet stringent conditions or be at risk of sanctions if they did not meet them. O’Reilly also argued that the primary motive for the reforms – to reduce DWP spending – had not been disclosed. She argued that the consultation had led people to believe the aim was to help people into work, without actually providing any evidence as to how they planned to do so. Lastly, the team crucially argued that the consultation had been unlawful as it ran for just under 8 weeks, which didn’t give DDPOs adequate time to respond. Government consultations typically run for six-to-twelve weeks. Over the course of the judicial review, internal DWP documents revealed several damning things. Firstly, the DWP had not actually done any sort of impact assessment on the WCA proposals, prior to the consultation being launched. This is despite the fact that civil servants had, based on internal estimates, identified that almost 100,000 people would be pushed into poverty if they went ahead. There was an equality impact assessment that was done after the launch of the consultation, but that has never been published. Civil servants were also aware that the proposals would have a particularly strong effect on people with preexisting mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. Proposals made by civil servants on what changes to consult on were instead based on the financial benefits. Internal documents reveal that “the Prime Minister [at the time Rishi Sunak] indicated that the DWP should consult on reforms to the WCA gateway in time to score them for the Autumn Statement…” The narrative around how easy home working was for disabled people seemingly came out of the DWP and realised that the WCA proposals would be “perceived as purely cost-saving measures by influential disability rights groups” this led to recommendations that “a wider narrative based on modern and home working” was also developed. Internal documents demonstrate that DWP boss at the time Mel Stride had considered including particular proposals as part of the consultation, because it could be “useful” to play into the idea that the motivation for consultation was the importance of getting more people into work and not saving money. Mr Justice Calver ruled that the consultation was “rushed”, “misleading” and “so unfair as to be unlawful”. He described the DWP a relying upon a “false rationale”, in the consultation. It also did not inform people about the “substantial” financial loss claimants would face. He said that the evidence which had been presented before him: Strongly supported the conclusion that costs savings was at least one of the two bases, if not the central basis, on which decisions would be taken on which policies would be taken forward by the Government. The judge also said considered that the DWP should have made this fact clear and that “disclosure of this highly relevant fact, was required”. Calver ruled that the consultation time was “unlawfully short” given not only the importance of the subject but based on the fact that the DWP was also at the time running a significant consultation on the Disability Action Plan. This was particularly unexpected as the DWP had only just published the Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper. Mr Justice Calver observed: The unfair burden upon vulnerable people of having to deal with a yet further consultation process at this time at such short notice cannot be overstated. In setting the consultation period, the Defendant ought to have had more regard to the attributes of those people who would be affected by these proposals. These were proposals which, in particular, could potentially drive vulnerable people into poverty as well as adversely affecting disabled people and substantial risk claimants who have mental health conditions and suicide ideation. Disabled activist Paula Peters, who was outside the court for the ruling, said: It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions today, bittersweet sadness as we remember all disabled people we’ve lost to the WCA process. Relief that justice was served and that the judge overseeing this judicial review said the WCA Consultation was radically wrong and didn’t take into account the impact on disabled people’s lives. In her statement outside court, Ellen said she was “overjoyed and very emotional” about the judgement: When I heard the judgement, I was reminded of all of those who we gave lost and all of those who we don’t know who have died – countless people who’ve died as a result to cuts and changes to their benefits and other austerity measures. But today Mr Justice Calver has recognised the unfair of a government consultation that deliberately set out to mislead and to disguise the potentially devastating impacts that these particular changes would have on disabled people. Well, despite the ruling the government wouldn’t legally be required to completely get rid of the DWP plans to make the lives of those subject to the WCA hell. That’s probably why the DWP has confirmed today they will be redoing the consultation. In a statement a spokesperson for the DWP told the Canary (and the rest of the media): The judge has found the previous government failed to adequately explain their proposals. As part of wider reforms that help people into work and ensure fiscal sustainability, the government will re-consult on the WCA descriptor changes, addressing the shortcomings in the previous consultation, in light of the judgment. The government intends to deliver the full level of savings in the public finance’s forecasts. This is interesting. Although they’re being upfront about it being “savings” motivated, they’re still not being transparent about how the cuts would affect people. A big takeaway is also that they’re still seemingly intent on changing the goalposts of what the descriptors will mean and who will qualify to be unfit for work. Just as many disabled activists worried, a Labour-led DWP is no better than a Conservative one. But disabled people are prepared to fight them on this too. Clifford said in her statement: We know the government is hellbent on attacking disabled people and essential incomes we need to survive, in order to manage the economy better than they are at the moment. As Peters said: We hope this legal victory gives disabled people across the UK hope that disabled campaigners are fighting back, prepared to take government on and bring change about” Speaking of the fears of disabled people facing both cuts and the Assisted Suicide Bill, Clifford said: This is not how any democracy should treat its most disadvantaged members; we fight on together.",Canary,2025-01-16T16:45:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/dwp-wca-court-verdict/
A hung jury in the latest Just Stop Oil trial shows the nonsense of these prosecutions,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who sprayed Heathrow departure boards with orange paint during the Oil Kills, international uprising to end fossil fuels last July have won a temporary reprieve as their jury failed to reach a majority decision. Phoebe Plummer and Jane Touil were appearing before judge Duncan at Isleworth Crown Court accused of criminal damage over £5,000 for their action on 30 July 2024 to demand a fossil fuel treaty to end oil and gas by 2030. The trial, which lasted nine days, ended when the jury failed to reach a majority decision. The judge has scheduled a retrial for May 2026. Phoebe was remanded for 58 days and Jane for 14 days following the action in which the pair used fire extinguishers to spray water-based paint at the departure boards in the terminal. The Crown alleged that the Just Stop Oil action caused £8,000 worth of damages. Phoebe is currently serving a two year prison sentence for criminal damage for throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting in October 2022. They were sentenced by Judge Hehir at South Crown Court on 27 September 2024, a sentence that is now being challenged in an appeal scheduled for 29-30 January 2025. During the trial, Judge Duncan ruled out the defence of necessity, saying this did not extend to civil disobedience and what she called the Just Stop Oil defendants’ “honestly held opinions” about climate change. Jane Touil responded that: It is not accurate to say that I am acting on my beliefs. It [the climate crisis] is not ‘a cause’. This is physics, an objective reality. I can see that everything is at risk. We only do the right thing if we know what’s going on. Phoebe was not allowed to be present in court to make their closing speech as during the course of the trial, the heating system in the holding cells at Isleworth Crown court, contracted to the private company Serco broke down and no one currently in custody could be produced in court. A Just Stop Oil supporter who was present throughout the trial said that: Phoebe and Jane had all their substantial defences removed, a severely mismanaged prosecution, logistical nightmares and a jury that was told to completely disregard their motivations. This is absolutely huge! In her closing speech Phoebe Plummer said: I have struggled with not being able to talk about the climate crisis – hearing it being called irrelevant feels inhumane and dishonest. The prosecution says I’m ‘committed to breaking the law’; my only commitment is to act in line with my conscience. They say ‘I do what I like without thinking about the law’. I don’t think following the law and doing the right thing are always the same thing. I cannot be a bystander to suffering where I see it. Nonviolence means being honest and living in line with the truth. I need to tell the truth about what I see. I act in a way that I think will be effective in saving life. When a doctor breaks a rib while doing CPR the doctor’s intent is still obviously saving life not causing grievous bodily harm, the context always matters.",Canary,2025-01-16T15:12:04+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/16/just-stop-oil-hung-jury/
London mayor refuses to act to block Heathrow expansion,"Despite running on a platform to halt any further expansion of Heathrow Airport, on Thursday 16 January during Mayor’s Question Time, Sadiq Khan dismissed multiple invitations from Green Party AM Zack Polanski to work together in pursuit of that shared goal. At the core of Heathrow’s expansion plans is the construction of a third runway. Initially proposed over two decades ago, the plan seeks to increase Heathrow’s capacity by accommodating up to 700,000 flights annually, compared to its current cap of 480,000. This expansion would allow Heathrow to handle an estimated additional 50 million passengers per year. Of course, one of the most contentious aspects of the Heathrow expansion has been its environmental impact. Critics have long argued that adding a third runway would significantly increase carbon emissions at a time when the UK has set legally binding commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The additional flights, coupled with construction emissions, pose a substantial challenge to these climate goals and would exacerbate the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Heathrow expansion has faced numerous legal battles and political hurdles over the years. In 2020, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that the government’s approval of the third runway was unlawful because it failed to account for the country’s climate obligations under the Paris Agreement. However, this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court later that year, allowing the project to proceed. As of early 2025, the Labour Party government has expressed conditional support for the expansion, contingent on meeting stringent environmental standards and securing broader public backing. Proponents of the expansion argue that it is vital for the UK’s economic future. Heathrow’s role as a global hub supports thousands of jobs directly and indirectly, and the additional capacity could generate billions of pounds in economic benefits. Increased connectivity is seen as crucial for trade, tourism, and maintaining London’s status as a leading financial center. However, opponents highlight the significant costs associated with the project, estimated to exceed £14 billion. They also point to potential disruptions for local communities, including increased noise pollution and the need to relocate homes and businesses. Local communities near Heathrow have expressed mixed reactions to the expansion plans. While some see the potential for job creation and economic revitalization, others are concerned about noise pollution, air quality, and the loss of green spaces. The proposed expansion would require the demolition of parts of several villages, including Harmondsworth, raising questions about fair compensation and community well-being. Currently, as the Financial Times reported Keir Starmer’s cabinet are split over whether to approve the Heathrow expansion: Bosses at Heathrow, which handles more than 80mn passengers a year, are putting the final touches to their first expansion plan since the pandemic, but will not include a third runway at this stage, said people familiar with the matter. Downing Street and the Department for Transport said they were “open-minded” about a third runway, but only if it satisfied four tests: delivering growth across the country, meeting climate obligations and complying with air pollution and noise considerations. But one political aide said the cabinet was divided. “It’s no secret that there isn’t universal backing for the third runway, it’s just not a priority right now. [Energy secretary] Ed [Miliband] is the most obvious example of someone who is anti, but there are others who are uncomfortable about expanding Britain’s biggest airport,” the person said. So, on that Polanski pushed Khan on 16 January over the Heathrow expansion. Yet when prompted to join forces in lobbying government against any approval of the Airport National Policy Statement (ANPS), the Mayor repeatedly dismissed, and even mocked, Zack’s outstretched hand: Reflecting after the exchange, Green Party London Assembly Member Zack Polanski said: Expanding Heathrow Airport would be dangerous, even deadly, for every Londoner interested in breathing clean air or swimming in the Thames anytime in the next century. The Mayor ran on a campaign promising to oppose Heathrow expansion, yet when I present him with opportunity after opportunity to take action, he refuses to engage with me. Why won’t the Mayor work across party lines to stop Heathrow expansion in its tracks?",Canary,2025-01-16T14:47:12+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/heathrow-expansion/
Palestine Action's #Filton18 are in court TOMORROW - and need YOUR support,"On Friday 17 January, the Palestine Action #Filton18 political prisoners will appear at the Old Bailey, London, to enter their pleas for the first time since their arrest. They are expected to plead ‘not guilty’ to charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and, for some, violent disorder, after an August action against Israel’s Elbit Systems research hub in Filton, Bristol. The action saw activists enter the site, operated by Israel’s largest weapons company, and dismantle the weapons of war inside – including the Elbit ‘quadcopter’ models used for targeted killings of children in Gaza. Ten of the #Filton18 have been imprisoned since their arrest in August 2024, with a further eight arrested and imprisoned since November, all of them subjected to abuse of ‘Counter Terror’ powers by the British State. The Crown Prosecution Service are alleging that the charges faced have a ‘terrorism connection’. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy. Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest weapons company, is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza – providing over 85% of Israel’s armed drones, along with a wide range of munitions, armaments, and military equipment, all of which it markets internationally as having been “battle-tested” on Palestinians. From Britain, the subsidiary ‘Elbit Systems UK’ is a major exporter to Israel of military drone components, along with arms including weapons sights. The Filton weapons hub was opened in July 2023, with Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotevely in attendance praising the site for the “very best of Israeli technology”, alongside Elbit’s CEO Bezalel Machlis. If you want to show support for the #Filton18,  be at the Old Bailey, City of London, EC4M 7EH on Friday 17 January at 9:30am.

Andy McDonald champions Labour's shoddy workers' rights bill at PMQs. Here's the facts.,"At Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), Andy McDonald MP said on 15 January: The employment rights bill is urgently needed especially given the exploitation of gig workers like those retail assistants employed throughout with vital rights denied and staff being charged a premium should they want to be paid on time. Insecure work denies workers their rights but the TUC also says it costs the UK economy around £10bn a year. So will the prime minister agree with me that having a single status of worker will help end such abusive practices, give workers security and significantly benefit the economy? UK high street retailers have been employing young assistants through gig acts that lack basic employment rights. Labour’s employment rights bill doesn’t include a single status of worker, which aims to guarantee rights across the economy. Keir Starmer responded: I believe everyone is entitled to fair, flexible and secure working. And that’s why we introduced our employment rights bill, which is the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation. It includes measures that will end the scandal of fire and rehire, preventing exploitative zero hour contracts and introducing basic rights for workers from day one. The Labour Party’s move to strengthen workers’ rights is only significant because the benchmark is so low. That’s partly because of anti-trade union legislation that the Tories introduced including in 2016. A report from academics for the Trade Union Congress (TUC) found that the UK presently lags behind other developed OECD countries when it comes to workers’ rights. The bill is a step forward in a shoddy context. Professor Deakin, director of the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge University, said: The UK is an international outlier when it comes to worker protections. Our labour laws are significantly less protective of workers’ rights than the average in the developed countries which make up the OECD. The gap is particularly marked with respect to laws on working time, employee representation, and the right to strike. The report shows that UK labor laws have been less protective of workers’ rights than other developed countries since Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, the Tories, propped up by the Lib Dems, increased the period before workers are protected from unfair dismissal to two years of employment. Labour’s bill remedies the unfair practice altogether through introducing protections from unfair dismissal from the beginning of employment. The bill also included piecemeal steps forward in the right to sick pay. Further, it will guarantee hours for those on zero hour contracts, if the employee wants them. The act will repeal the restrictive trade union ballot threshold for strike action that the Tories introduced in 2016. In October, Zarah Sultana MP said in parliament: We must go further and repeal every single anti-trade union bill since Thatcher It seems Labour won’t be doing this – and so, everything else is piecemeal, as PMQs exposed.",Canary,2025-01-15T18:57:18+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/pmqs-15-january/
"Patients are dying because of profit-driven political decisions - so in 2025, EveryDoctor is stepping things up","In 2025, campaign group EveryDoctor is stepping up its work to save the NHS from privatisation, and build a functioning, flourishing healthcare system for patients and staff alike. However, there’s work to do. The group wants to grow its following from thousands, to a vibrant patient and staff community of millions. It feels it will take nothing short of this to turn things around because: millions of people are currently being profoundly failed by politicians In short, the group aims to transform its campaign community into something more: a movement. Its ambitious goal comes amidst another spate of alarming news stories over the appalling state of things in the NHS. What’s more, EveryDoctor founder (and Canary columnist) Julia Grace Patterson has crunched the numbers on patient deaths – and the situation is actually worse than the headlines suggest. By the close of 2024, and into the New Year already, the media has been awash with dire developments in the NHS. A ‘quad-demic’ storm of influenza, Covid, norovirus, and RSV has been overwhelming NHS hospitals across the country. More than a dozen hospitals have now declared “critical incidents” as hospitalisations mount up, and services are swamped. Meanwhile, headlines abound about intractable wait times, and lack of available beds. Patients entering NHS hospitals face a disgraceful situation – first a major problem during the Covid pandemic – but now tragically commonplace. The phrase “corridor care” has firmly cemented itself into the British vernacular. In December, 54,000 patients waited on trolleys longer than 12 hours for hospitals to admit them to wards. EveryDoctor’s Patterson has laid out the devastating cost of all this in a Tiktok video. Specifically, she analysed the Royal College of General Medicine (RCEM)’s statistics showing the toll long wait times have been having. Horrifyingly, she highlighted that almost 300 patient deaths a week can be linked to long waits. In short, this atrocious state of affairs is putting patients’ lives at risk. So, as all these crises in the NHS unfold, the Labour government has answered with yet more plans for privatising the public healthcare system. EveryDoctor wrote to its supporters on the situation that: This government released big plans for the NHS last week, and those plans involved further privatisation. This government has failed to invest properly in emergency services, and patients in A and E departments are receiving urgent treatment in corridors. Its latest foray into opening the NHS up to further backdoor privatisation comes in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the Canary’s James Wright highlighted, AI companies likely had a little help from science and technology secretary Peter Kyle. Also an acting vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Kyle has repeatedly rubbed shoulders with a who’s who of AI’s most prolific lobbyists. Given this, Wright pointed out that Kyle likely had a hand in this latest NHS AI privatisation manoeuvre. Of course, all this is barely the tip of the iceberg of privatisation’s manifold fallouts for the NHS. Therefore, turning things around in the NHS will take a momentous groundswell of action. And it’s why Patterson and the EveryDoctor team have declared their intention to build a bold movement to “fearlessly” fight back. Since 2019, EveryDoctor has been campaigning against this unrelenting tide of private profiteering in the UK’s health service. The group has put out critical research on NHS privatisation. It has met with MPs, and created far-reaching public awareness campaigns. Most recently, it ran a powerful campaign to engage MPs with a doctor-led manifesto for fixing the NHS. Alongside volunteers and the public, the group brought these ideas to 117 MPs and their teams. However, Patterson lamented how to date, none of it has yet been enough. So she spelled out that: we need to think a lot bigger now. Much, much bigger. We need millions of people to know what we’re doing and to stand together with us to fight for the NHS. In just the first two weeks of 2025, EveryDoctor has already set a number of things in motion. The group has called on the Liberal Democrats to collaborate in holding the Labour government to account for the emergency situation in A&E departments. It is also organising urgent meetings with MPs about this too. And EveryDoctor has started the year off with a social media bang too. The Tiktok video Patterson posted on the RCEM statistics went viral. Off the back of this, NHS staff, film-makers, and members of the public have been flooding the group’s inbox with offers of support. Of course, this is only the start. EveryDoctor has many more plans in the works for the year ahead. Patterson set out to supporters that: There is only a point to our campaigning if we do it fearlessly, relentlessly, boldly, and loudly. I can only lead EveryDoctor if I will do it fearlessly. So that’s what I am going to do – that’s what we are going to do. I went back to TikTok this morning and continued making videos. We’re starting daily YouTube videos this week. We’re hiring into our team. We’re completing our research into the financial links between MPs and the private healthcare sector. And we have so much more to do… Going forward, she hopes that many more people will join EveryDoctor’s community to work together in saving the NHS for the millions that depend on it. You can keep up with EveryDoctor’s vital work by joining its WhatsApp community. The group is also fundraising to ramp up the reach and impact of all its upcoming plans. If you’re in a position to donate, you can do so here.",Canary,2025-01-15T16:09:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/everydoctor-campaign/
SEND system in England falling apart at the seams - thanks to the Tories,"The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee’s report Support for children and young people with special educational needs published on 15 January highlights significant challenges within England’s Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system. Notably, it outlines how funding over the past ten years has not matched demand – as the previous Conservative Party governments let the SEND system fall into a state of disrepair. As BBC News reported: In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system “in disarray”, “mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money”. An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England. The Department for Education (DfE) said the government was “making progress” on the issue with a £1bn investment in Send. Despite a 58% increase in high needs funding over the past decade, the number of children with Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plans has surged by 140%, leading to funding not keeping pace with demand. This disparity has resulted in stagnant outcomes for children, eroding parental confidence in the system. The Public Accounts Committee summed up by saying: The Department of Education will be unable to make the fundamental reforms needed without a clear, costed plan to measure progress, which it is lacking. To do this it needs a clear vision of what an inclusive education would look like, better data to target funding, and to deliver a system where all those with critical roles work together. This includes the Department for Health and Social Care, who must play their part in reducing long waits for support. With more than 40,000 children waiting over 12 weeks for speech and language therapy alone as at June 2024, timely access to health expertise constitutes a significant barrier in a struggling system. Recommendations: The Local Government Association was particularly concerned by the report. Councillor Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said: The Committee is right to describe the failing SEND system as an emergency, and its report reflects councils’ long-standing concerns over the need for more inclusive provision and the immense financial pressures on councils to be adequately addressed. It is vital the Government urgently sets out a comprehensive reform plan that ensures children and their families get the support they need and deserve. This must include ensuring councils on a financially stable footing, with high needs deficits written off. Otherwise, many councils will face a financial cliff-edge, and be faced with having to cut other services to balance budgets through no fault of their own, or their residents. Without urgent action, the report warns of a “lost generation” of children who may leave school without receiving the necessary support, emphasising the critical need for systemic reform to meet the growing demands and complexities of SEND provision in England.",Canary,2025-01-15T13:52:46+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/send-england/
Campaigners have 'discovered' ANOTHER company exporting arms to Israel,"Local campaigners have uncovered a previously-missed company that is actually now one of the biggest UK arms exporters to Israel – therefore, complicit in its genocide. Meet G&H Artemis. On Monday 13 January, campaigners across the south west stopped business at Gooch and Housego’s (G&H) Artemis site in Plymouth: The action marks the start of a new campaign – Shut Down G&H – committed to shutting down a company that’s deeply complicity in Israel’s genocide in Gaza: According to research by Campaign Against Arms Trade, G&H, with the acquisition of Phoenix Optical Technologies last year, is now the largest recipient of single issue arms export licenses to Israel between October 2021 and May 2023. G&H Artemis export a range of military equipment to Israel, including components for head up/down displays for military aircraft. G&H Artemis provide optical and laser technology for head up displays. On the ground, activists reported that many of the workers couldn’t gain entry to the factory due to the disruption. A spokesperson for Shut Down G&H said “this act of resistance was inspired by the growing awareness that G&H is directly implicated in the murder of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is unconscionable. As the local community, we are taking action to reject our city’s complicity in Israel’s genocide and display our unequivocal solidarity with the struggle for Palestinian life, freedom, and self-determination”: Today’s action is only the start. G&H have offices across the South West. We can and we must shut them down! The Canary asked G&H Artemis for comment – but the company declined to provide us with one. Campaign Against Arms Trade’s media coordinator, Emily Apple, said: It’s great to see this campaign being launched today. For too long G&H has got away with slipping under the radar. It should be a household name. Everyone should know this company is complicit in and profiting from Israel’s genocide. In only imposing a partial arms suspension, this government has made it clear that it will continue to prioritise arms dealers’ profits over Palestinian lives and international law. It’s therefore down to ordinary people across the country to take action and say no to the genocide profiteers on their doorsteps.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:57:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/gh-artemis/
Shell was given a stark reminder of its role in events like the LA wildfires,"Fossil Free London staged a protest outside Shell’s global HQ, the Shell Centre, on Southbank on Wednesday 15 January, in protest over the role fossil fuel corporations like Shell’s have in exacerbating the climate crisis. Dressed in red and orange, signs read “It’s not a tragedy, it’s a crime”, chanting “Shell did this”: A London firefighter joined the crowd, holding a placard saying “Big oil makes our job harder”: Shell continues to drill for new fossil fuels, making fires like the ones we are seeing in LA much more likely. In March 2024, Shell defied climate experts and rolled back their green targets, pledging to keep oil production steady until 2030. Wildfires across Los Angeles have now killed at least 24 people, and burned down more than 12,000 homes and businesses. Scientists warn these fires are driven in intensity by heat and drought; both conditions are directly linked to and made increasingly common by the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that emissions from fossil fuels are the biggest cause of climate change. Fossil fuel corporations have been aware of climate change and its effects as early as 1977, but continued to expand oil and gas production. Joanna Warrington, who attended the protest with Fossil Free London, said: LA is on fire, and it’s big oil that sparked the match and fanned the flames. Corporations like Shell have known for decades the disasters their fossil fuels would cause, but spent billions delaying climate action and funding misinformation to protect their business interests. As devastating events like these become more commonplace, its vital blame is put on the oily bosses who profit whilst our homes burn. Andy Warren, a London firefighter, said: Firefighters know that the increasingly frequent and destructive wildfires we face are the responsibility of the fossil fuel industry and its disregard for human life. These companies have known about the effects of their profiteering for decades and it is high time they were taken into public ownership and their profits used to fund a just green transition. No fire service in the world will be a match for the disasters that come if we carry on as we are.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:35:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/shell-protest-wildfires/
Keir Starmer's AI plan misses the central point of the fourth industrial revolution,"Keir Starmer’s plan for artificial intelligence (AI) falls well short of the main point of the fourth industrial revolution. That is to liberate people from labouring work they don’t want to do, providing more time for social, creative, and intellectual endeavours. Instead, Starmer is largely pursuing private sector for-profit ownership of AI that threatens to rob people of their work without fairly sharing the fruits that robots have created. In his speech on AI, the prime minister paid some lip service to the issue, without saying how for-profit, private ownership of AI will facilitate it: Who gets the benefits? Just those at the top – or working people everywhere? The thing is, there will be a point where capital increasingly becomes labour: where the money for resources equates to labour. That’s because in the long term the economy will be mainly automated rather than consisting of people providing the labour. Without public ownership of that automation or some kind of citizens dividend, the opportunity for the utopia explored in Aaron Bastani’s Fully Automated Luxury Communism will be replaced by the opposite: AI-controlling overlords and a poverty stricken public. Yet the public research and development funding for AI Starmer has issued is a drop in the ocean compared to the private investment we are seeing. The government’s AI plan also mentions the environmental factor in this, given AI generation is an energy intensive process. But corporate lobbyists and fossil fuel donations have played a role in reducing the government’s green energy strategy to near zero, compared to what’s necessary. In Labour’s first budget, the government issued just £100m to Great British Energy (GBE) for two years. That’s despite its already low pledge of £8bn by 2029. GBE aims to crowd in private investment in renewables. It falls far short of what we need. And it squanders the opportunity for a publicly funded Green New Deal. Starmer’s plan further proposes a national data library to power for-profit AI. That includes data from publicly funded institutions such as the British Library, the NHS, the BBC (through TV license), the Natural History Museum and the National Archives. It also includes reworking copyright law so AI can use people’s work, whether academic or creative. All of this is essential for the development of AI. But why should people’s work and public funding fuel AI if the outcomes are going to be privately-owned profit generation? It only makes sense for public ownership of the outcomes: AI machines that could be liberating. At present, the British people are already paying twice for education and information. Once, to create research (for example, through Research Council funding). Then, we are paying again to buy back the research through online journal subscriptions, university fees and public library costs. Despite funding the research, the taxpayer must pay again for access. The for-profit agenda for AI threatens to prolong this reality but at a much greater scale, across the entire economy.",Canary,2025-01-14T20:26:47+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/ai-fourth-industrial-revolution/
Just Stop Oil trio who targeted ex-Tory MP Mark Jenkinson NOT GUILTY - and rightly so,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters who fly posted the offices of a former Conservative MP to draw attention to his lies about a proposed Cumbrian coal mine have been acquitted of criminal damage by a magistrate in Carlisle. The trio took action in April 2024 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Catherine Rennie Nash, 74, Fiona Atkinson, 68, and Margaret Reid, 54 all from Kendal were part of a group of four arrested on 24 April 2024 after posters reading “Stop Tory Coal” were plastered on the Maryport offices of the former Conservative MP for Workington, Mark Jenkinson: The three have been acquitted of criminal damage under £5,000 at Carlisle Magistrates today, after the magistrate ruled that the three could not have known that the window was covered with a specialist film that the prosecution alleged had been damaged and led to repair costs of £3,392.21. Margaret Reid has been on remand at HMP Styal for the past five months after being arrested by Great Manchester Police on August 5 2024 during the Oil Kills international uprising at airports around the world. She is charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and is due to stand trial on 3 February. Catherine Rennie Nash said: Mark Jenkinson promised his constituents a carbon neutral coal mine that would deliver hundreds of jobs for West Cumbria. However the High Court ruled that this was legally flawed and the mine will not go ahead. Mark Jenkinson also claimed that in our efforts to draw attention to this misinformation we had caused thousands of pounds’ worth of damage to his office. Today we have been found not guilty and we question why the police and courts wasted so much time in pursuing this. Fiona Atkinson said: We call on Cumbria’s new MPs to tell the truth about fossil fuels and support, rather than criminalize, people who are drawing attention to the climate crisis. We welcome Markus Campbell-Savours’ and Josh McAllisters’ efforts to bring investment in new green jobs for Cumbria but this needs to happen much more quickly. Also arrested on 24 April 2024, but subsequently released without charge was Alison Parker who said: I was shocked that I was arrested, as I only filmed what was happening. I was recognised outside the office by Mark Jenkinson, and then pursued by the police and courts for 8 months until finally my case was dropped. A solicitor is taking on my case for wrongful arrest so I can find out why so much taxpayer’s money was wasted. Mark Jenkinson has been a strong advocate for the proposed new Whitehaven coal mine, which was granted planning permission by the former Conservative Government in 2021, before it was subject to legal challenges by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Climate Action last year. The High Court ruled in September 2024 that the former secretary of state for levelling up Michael Gove had acted unlawfully in granting the coal mine proposal planning permission. In doing so the High Court upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas should have been taken into account when deciding whether to approve the project.",Canary,2025-01-14T19:45:32+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/just-stop-oil-mark-jenkinson/
Beating benefit reforms starts with tackling the MSM’s eugenicist anti-fatness stigma,"We’re now a quarter of the way through the 21st century. But from one look at the corporate media benefit claimant-bashing bile over the last year, you wouldn’t know it. The date marches on, some of the hacks trade places with electoral washouts – and vice versa – but the vile bigotry never ceases. If anything has changed in the past 25 years of hate-rag vitriol, it’s only that they’ve increased the ever-flowing pool of marginalised community scapegoats. Not that any oppressed group ever graduates from the right-wing press’s punch down portfolio. The Canary reviewed the past five years of Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail coverage on disability benefits – and the data can attest to this. However, perhaps most notably of all, what became abundantly clear was quite how much the corporate media had refused to let some abhorrently ableist and grossly bigoted narratives lie. And amidst a torrent of this, the corporate press’s particularly nasty and appalling anti-fatness stigma stood out tall. The benefits are a “life-style choice” purveyors, arbiters of the ‘grift’ and ‘graft’ “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” sanctimony, “workshy”, “idlers”, “shirkers” – it was all there. Across the dataset – with its 1130% rise in 2024 – the words themselves weren’t particularly prolific. We found the facetious idea that it’s a “lifestyle choice” in five articles. Grifter and grafter guff came up in four. That old (rotten) “workshy” chestnut cropped up across no fewer than ten pieces. Invocations of “idleness” and “shirkers”, just three and one pieces over our time period and search terms respectively. That these outlets used these terms in any articles at all is appalling enough. Yet, most also didn’t have to say it in as many explicit words. The implication was often plain and terrible to see in many articles regardless. Among the most infamous of infamous smears, there were two that really encapsulated an especially disgusting discourse that the corporate media refuses to put to bed. Just when you think it can’t get any worse, the right-wing regurgitators raise you: its “lazy scrounger” rhetoric. Again, they didn’t often voice it in quite so florid adjectives. Four counts of “scrounger” – all courtesy of the Daily Mail, naturally. Meanwhile, the Telegraph spewed out five out six of the pieces peddling “laziness” as synonymous with benefit claimants. Once more, there were plenty of articles where it didn’t need to say these outright for readers to know that’s what it was implying. Crucially, the corporate media often wrapped this up in a vastly more reprehensible narrative (hard to believe, we know). It’s one that has long been rife in the right-wing press. In tandem with these disgusting terms, the mainstream media’s output was also bristling in anti-fatness bigotry. That is, amidst the vicious crusade against benefit claimants, the fascistic foghorns whipped up a furore over fat people. And often, they did this in the most paternalistic, and putridly body-shaming ways. In October, Telegraph troll Allison Pearson penned one notable disgusting anti-fat diatribe. Hers specifically extolled the economic advantages of mass-prescribing weight-loss drugs. In it, she unironically advised we “as a society” should stop fat-shaming people. So herself and her hate-mongering employer especially then? Rich too when she packed the very same Ozempic – likely quid-pro-quo – promo-piece with every single hate-riddled insult and stereotype under the sun (or in the Sun for that matter). The oxymoronic lack of self-awareness was therefore truly off-the-charts scale staggering throughout. She literally labelled benefit claimants “useless lumps” and suggested they would “flog their free drugs on the black market”. To the likes of Pearson, people not cranking out capital are burdens to society, or criminal fraudsters – a rhetoric that has reared its head repeatedly in recent months. And why not divvy out a dose of anti-fat discrimination while she was at it – “lumps” – a deliberate double entendre that should not go unnoticed. We won’t reel off a list of her numerous other incorrigible insults and give them any oxygen. Safe to say that she made every attempt to punch down on fat folks, poor people, really any marginalised demographic she could swing her arm at. And the grand crescendo of it all leads exactly where you might expect. Make people fit for work – then ramp up punitive benefit conditionality. Every other sentence seems an ode to framing fatness as something to revile – about yourself, and in others. Similarly, a supposedly ‘satirical’ soapbox from Telegraph columnist Michael Deacon in December had an equally vile message. Deacon pitched “high-altitude fat camps” to fix the UK’s so-called ‘obesity crisis’. Of course, his bigoted banter fits right in with the worst kinds of weight loss porn we see plastered across every nook and cranny of the media. From late-stage capitalist entertainment media’s fetishization of fat-shaming to the clickbait press’ capitalisation of it. The point is that it’s within this context that Deacon was emboldened to say this – and vice-versa legitimise it in a vicious mutually-sustaining circle. And significantly, what these articles have in common is the way in which they pitch fatness as some form of personal failing. Ostensibly, they’re suggesting that people are undeserving of health-related benefits by reason of their fatness. So there’s the implication too that people claiming disability benefits for conditions linked to their weight, shouldn’t be. If the corporate media can foist the blame for people’s poor health on individuals, then they can preserve the capitalist status quo. Simply put, it shifts the onus away from tackling the structural factors of our inequitable classist, ableist, racist, and misogynistic society. One particularly revolting headline from the Daily Mail said it all: Listen love, I can’t be applying for jobs day in and day out. You’ve got to have some ‘me time’: The brazen words of Jimmy, 40, to SABRINA MILLER in this shocking dispatch from the ‘disability benefits capital of the UK’ where 75 per cent are overweight Needless to say, it’s the ‘lazy scrounger’ narrative all over. However, the blatantly bigoted tirades from corporate media’s resident click-hate merchants wasn’t the only way these outlets farmed outrage and stirred up contempt either. They also churned out a steady stream of analysis articles pointing out the so-called “sickness benefits bill”. Crucially, these made the connection with ‘obesity’ as a driver of increasing rates of ill health and unemployment. Some directly honed in on this, while others merely mused on it in passing. But all were part of building a despicable discourse over fatness. Let’s talk cause and effect here. What do you get when you have a band of right-wing media anti-fat bigots bashing the costs of “obesity-linked benefits”? A government in bed with Big Pharma readying to pimp claimants out for profits. Specifically, this would be the DWP doing a deal with the pharmaceutical corporate devil Eli Lilly for a weight loss drug trial. Essentially, it’s the department testing whether so-called weight-loss jabs could get unemployed claimants back into work. Slow-clap for Labour then. The dust barely settles before Starmer’s government seems to jump jovially aboard another astonishingly atrocious back-to-work bandwagon. In fact, the Times piece was quite literally crooning over a report from healthcare analytics consultancy LCP reifying the welfare savings these drugs could foment. What the Times didn’t mention? That Novo Nordisk A/S has previously paid an author of the report – Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard – for studies into the healthcare costs of ‘obesity-related’ conditions. That would of course be the same Novo Nordisk that manufactures two of the major weight loss drugs in question – Wegovy and Ozempic. Additionally, Pearson-Stuttard also took fees from Pfizer outside the study. The company produces weight loss drugs too. Go figure. So perhaps it’s no surprise Pearson-Stuttard was plugging the “cashable savings for the welfare system” of Novo Nordisk’s drugs to the Times. Honourable mention too to former DWP coalition government Liberal Democrat minister-turned-lobbyist Steve Webb for jumping on the Wegovy-train as another author on the report. The so-called “worklessness crisis” narrative and weight loss jabs have been banging around together at least since Sunak launched Wegovy NHS trials in June 2023. Then health secretary Steve Barclay boasted the boon they could be for the economy by getting people back to work. Predictably, this – at least in part – revolved around building: evidence that the drugs can reduce the benefits bill And since then, the right-wing press and politicians have been increasingly trading on this anti-fat benefit claimant propaganda. Yet, that has hardly been the end of it. Because, if that all weren’t insulting enough, in December, the Telegraph reported that: Obese people are to be given gastric band surgery on the NHS in a drive to reduce worklessness. So, we have both pharmaceutically suppressing appetites and surgically shrinking people’s stomachs. That’s the new Labour government’s grand plan for getting claimants back to work? There’s a stupefying scale of anti-fat bigotry on display in all this. And as the Canary’s Steve Topple has noted, it all comes down to the matter of coercion. He tempered that it doesn’t mean that “Labour is that dystopian – yet” that it’s going to condition benefits on their take-up. After all, it’s early trial days for now on both counts. At minimum though, the rancid rhetoric the press is spouting could pave the way for the DWP withdrawing disability benefits from people with conditions it links to obesity. And that’s a form of coercion too. Namely that by rendering people without support, it could leave them with little choice but to turn to these drastic – and sometimes dangerous – health interventions. Not that there’s actually any guarantee that either will actually improve people’s health, or help them find work with a livable wage. There aren’t even enough jobs going for the number of job seekers, let alone sick and disabled people that the government seems hell-bent on shunting into work. Plus, vacancy numbers say nothing of whether the work is appropriate, accessible, and accommodating of people’s health conditions. Not to mention the companies too numerous to count who’s bosses are parasitic pricks profiting off the backs of low-waged workforces. Every article we found bandied about the concept of ‘obesity’. This pertains to the medical measurement of body mass index (BMI). That might seem innocuous enough at first glance. However, it’s premised on a medical model that disparages fat bodies as automatic indicators of unhealthiness. Essentially, it promotes fatness as something that needs to be fixed. Of course, this atrociously ableist thinking tracks, given its roots in eugenics. It was 19th century Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet who invented the model that later formed the basis of BMI. Notably though, he did so on a study he conducted with only white French and Scottish men. In other words, by its very origins it centred whiteness and patriarchy. Moreover, he pursued this to identify the “ideal” weight and size for an “average man” – by which he quite clearly meant white Western European males. A telling passage in his book laid bare the ableism at the heart of it: Everything differing from his proportion or condition would constitute deformity or disease. Fatness above his metrics constituted a deviation from his “ideal” and inherently signalled sickness. Invariably, it fed into the dominant ideology of the day to devalue chronically ill and disabled lives. Because from there, a who’s who of 19th and 20th century eugenicists took up the concept. Predictably, vulture capitalists of the 20th century also sniffed out the profits potential of this junk science-turned medical model. Life and health insurance companies adopted it as a predictor of health conditions. So let me be clear: the implicit assumption that there’s anything wrong with fatness in the first place is utter bullshit. The medical mainstreaming of BMI is about one thing, and one thing only. That is, the capitalist urge for policing poor, racialised, and disabled bodies. In short, insurance companies hijacked BMI to deny claims. Now, the media-political corporate establishment is making mutterings over removing disability benefits linked to ‘obesity’. These things aren’t unrelated. In a nutshell, it’s the very same eugenicist medical science that threads through both repressive weaponisations of anti-fat stigma and bias. However, the history of the terminology the corporate media has been using is just the start of all that’s wrong with the coverage. Another is that the term ‘obesity’ has a linguistic origin that’s hardly less problematic. The Latin etymology ‘obesus’ translates as “having eaten oneself fat”. Additionally then, there’s in-built oppression and othering from a term that literally blames people for their body weight. And this is also largely the underlying intimation of the articles too. Outlets largely made the suggestion – though not always explicitly – that fatness equates to laziness. In other words, fat bodies are that way because of people’s personal choices in relation to diet and exercise. Obviously, there’s so much wrong with this too. Topple has also previously underscored how this hugely misses the point that, in multiple ways, it isn’t a choice. He highlighted a number of examples: Moreover, inequitable access to healthy food is also not only down to poverty, but also due food deserts too. Specifically, where you live can determine the cost and availability of food as well. Then there’s dietary requirements that can limit the types of food people can eat safely, or that their body needs. These include things like allergies, autoimmune conditions, diabetes, conditions causing digestive dysfunction like gastroparesis, or eating difficulties like dysphagia. Many neurodivergent people also have personal ‘safe foods’. Moreover, plenty of these and other health conditions therefore affect people’s weight gain or loss. So ultimately, it’s massively ableist to make out a person’s body weight is down to their own personal dietary failings. And talking of time poverty for overworked and exhausted households – we’ll say it again: disability benefits are also not out-of-work benefits. Many people claiming them actually work, so this extends to them as well. Some people – like those with ME – also can’t and shouldn’t exercise, or risk a permanent worsening of their health. The point is, framing exercise and diet as a choice vastly oversimplifies something with multiply-marginalising factors at play. Of course, the right-wing press knows all this, but has put out this constant drip of discriminatory drivel regardless. At the end of the day, hawking hate pays. Bedding down with Big Pharma pays. Celebrating body diversity, tackling structural health inequalities, and buttressing society with a functioning, fair welfare system? Not so much – and the political establishment media lapdogs know this too.",Canary,2025-01-14T18:44:57+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/anti-fatness-media-headlines/
Leicester and Birmingham students keep resisting university complicity in Gaza genocide,"Students remain on the frontline of resistance against institutional complicity in Israel’s genocide in Gaza. In Leicester, five students are set to go on hunger strike following their university’s harsh repression of anti-genocide protests. In Birmingham, meanwhile, students and others are calling for their university to protect the right to protest amid controversial disciplinary proceedings. According to a press release from Leicester Action for Palestine, five University of Leicester students will start a hunger strike on Wednesday 15 January “over the university’s complicity in genocide”. The statement says: This act of protest follows severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower, and is inspired by the thousands of Palestinian political prisoners who have hunger struck in the past, as well as our comrades at the Swansea encampment who went on strike for over a week, securing £5 million of divestment from Barclays bank in the process. They want the university to “stop banking with Barclays bank”, “disclose and divest” from companies complicit in the Gaza genocide, and to “demilitarise” the campus by cutting “ties with arms companies currently aiding and profiting off of the genocide”. Regarding the latter, the statement explains that: this includes the 7 and a half million pound research deal with Rolls Royce and Siemens through the school of engineering. Rolls Royce help to produce the F-35’s Israel is using to drop bombs on children and Siemens provided key infrastructure to illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Updates on the hunger strike will appear on @leicsaction4pal on Instagram. Student-staff coalition BhamLiberatedZone, meanwhile, released a press release explaining how the University of Birmingham is: under fire for disciplining two students involved in protests against the university’s financial ties to companies allegedly complicit in human rights violations in Palestine. The “coalition of students, staff, alumni, and public supporters” wants the university to drop disciplinary investigations and “to protect students’ rights to protest”. The coalition calls Antonia Listrat and Mariyah Ali’s treatment “a deeply prejudiced, management-driven disciplinary process”. It asserts: The university has accused them of intimidation and participating in unauthorized protests, but activists argue these allegations are exaggerated, rooted in anti-Palestinian racism, and part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on campus. Their protest demanded the university’s: divestment from over £76 million in investments and partnerships with companies allegedly tied to the genocide of Palestinian people. But as the statement says: The students have highlighted a pattern of alleged Islamophobia and racial prejudice, including the labelling of Palestinian flags as “threatening” and the removal of such flags from campus, as well as harassment of students wearing Palestine badges. They argue such actions demonstrate systemic repression of pro-Palestinian activism under the guise of maintaining campus safety. The “prolonged process”, meanwhile, “has caused significant stress and harm to the students’ wellbeing, reflecting a punitive approach to silencing dissent”. Campaigners want the university: to drop the disciplinary actions, respect free speech, and address growing calls for divestment and ethical investment practices.",Canary,2025-01-14T16:34:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/leicester-birmingham-students/
Cops try to disrupt a Palestine Action meeting - just as the group target Elbit director's business,"Palestine Action targeted the new London premises of an Elbit Director’s consultancy firm, Eagle Strategic Consulting Limited, on Tuesday 14 January. However, at the same time in Bristol cops were ‘visiting’ the venue where a group meeting is being held in Bristol. Coincidence? Palestine Action activists shattered the windows and sprayed the company’s new London address in red paint to symbolise the company’s continued complicity in Palestinian bloodshed: Eagle Strategic acts as a consultancy firm for weapons manufacturers and is wholly owned by Richard Applegate, the former Chairman and current ‘head of strategy and new business’ for Israeli weapons firm Elbit Systems UK. This is the second time his lobbying company have been targeted by the direct action network, with Palestine Action shattering windows and spray painting the building of the Dorset premises in March 2024. Applegate has a long history of lobbying for the Israeli arms company, previously boasting about pulling off a covert political lobbying campaign which secured a £500m from the MOD, by ensuring his “fingerprints weren’t over any of it”. He was caught by journalists admitting that he had applied pressure by “infecting” the system at “every level”. According to Israeli media, Elbit provides up to 80% of the Israeli military’s land based military equipment and 85% of its military drones. It supplies vast numbers of munitions and missiles – including the ‘Iron Sting’ recently developed and deployed for the first time in the 2023-2024 Genocide in Gaza, along with wide categories of surveillance technologies, targeting systems, and innumerate other armaments. Meanwhile, as Palestine Action posted, cops visited the People’s Republic of Stokes Croft; a venue that is hosting a meeting of the group: Called “Smashing the genocide-industrial complex“, the meeting will look at what activists can learn “about effective direct action from the courageous efforts of Palestine Action?”. No wonder the cops weren’t happy. The venue and the group refused to be intimidated, however, and the meeting is due to go ahead as planned. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We remain committed to targeting all firms and associations which enable Israel’s weapons trade to continue fuelling genocide. There is no space for war criminals on our streets and those responsible for mass murder must be held accountable. Applegate can’t hide behind his consulting firm and changing its premise doesn’t change a thing. We’ve hit Eagle Strategic before, we’ll hit them again and we’ll keep taking action until we’ve shut down Elbit Systems for good.",Canary,2025-01-14T15:34:58+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/palestine-action-eagle-strategic/
The Renters' Rights Bill is a victory says ACORN - but there's still a huge flaw,"As it enters its final stage in the House of Commons, community union ACORN has heralded the Renters’ Rights Bill “a huge victory for the organised renter’s movement”. However, the proposed legislation is still not without its pitfalls. The Renters’ Rights Bill is on the way to delivering improved security and standards for renters, including: A new addition, debated at the ‘report stage’ in parliament on Tuesday 14 January, would see an end to landlords being able to charge rent in advance of a tenancy starting. This is a key issue that ACORN has been campaigning on, and is welcome news for the many renters struggling to secure a place to call home. Low income people, young families and those on benefits are more likely to be asked for several months, or even longer, of rent up front, something that is simply not possible for many. More widely however, the Bill fails to seriously address the issue of unaffordable housing. This is why ACORN has been working alongside partners in the Renters Reform Coalition and MPs to support amendments in this area. One of these amendments, expected to be debated this afternoon, proposes a cap on in tenancy rent rises, to prevent landlords from hiking rents and evicting tenants through the back door. But if we are truly to tackle the burning issue of unaffordable homes, the government needs to introduce controls to stop spiralling rental costs. That’s why ACORN is supporting amendments such as the one put forward by Carla Denyer MP, calling for a national ‘living rent’ commission to set rent levels between tenancies, taking into account factors such as the home’s condition, size and local incomes. Martin Mawdsley, a renter in Liverpool and ACORN representative said: The changes promised in the Renters’ Rights Bill can’t come soon enough for the millions of renters living in poor conditions, extortionately priced homes and with the threat of eviction through no fault of their own hanging over their heads. We’re pleased to see the hard work of our members over the last decade paying off, and we’re glad that the Government has listened to us and will ban bidding wars and landlords being able to change many months worth of rent up front, two areas that ACORN has been campaigning on across the country. But as most renters are spending way more than 30% of their income on rent, and prices just keep rising, we still need more action to make rented homes more affordable. That’s why we’re calling for in-tenancy rent rises to be capped and rent controls to be brought in.",Canary,2025-01-14T13:48:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/renters-rights-bill-acorn/
"For the first time since records began, fewer poor students are going to university","For the first time since records began, there has been a decline in the number of the poorest students who end up going to university. Young people from free school meals (FSM) backgrounds fell further behind their peers in England in progressing to higher education from 2021/2022 to 2022/23, with the gap in terms of numbers progressing increasing to over 210,000. The areas with less than one in five FSM learners go onto higher education are drawn mainly from rural and coastal communities. The Access to Higher Education and Regional Inequality: who is missing out? report looks in-depth at progression to higher education for young people from FSM backgrounds across regions and local areas in England from 2005/06 to 2022/23. Key findings in the report include: The report argues that the government needs to build on the success of national collaborative university outreach initiatives that support those from low-income backgrounds, which were first launched 21 years ago with the Aimhigher programme. A new programme should be launched where universities combine their resources working with those 16 and under alongside local targets for FSM learners progressing to higher education. The report is produced by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON), which is the national organisation for supporting access to higher education for those from under-represented groups in the United Kingdom based at the University of West London. As Professor Graeme Atherton, Director of NEON and author of the report states: This year’s data shows a worrying slowdown in progress in terms of widening access to higher education and shows again clearly the huge differences in future opportunities that young people from low-income backgrounds face across the country. As the government looks to break down regional inequalities post levelling up, higher education progression has to be a central concern.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:44:15+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/university-admissions-poorest-students/
"AI seeks to profit from NHS data, with a little help from a 'Labour Friend of Israel'","Artificial intelligence (AI) profit-makers look set to get their hands on NHS data. And lobbying Labour Friends of Israel vice chair Peter Kyle probably played a role. Backdoor privatisation of the NHS is nothing new. Thatcherism paved the way, 2010s austerity made things worse, and then the Covid-19 pandemic helped to push things further. Now, with the economy predictably struggling under Keir Starmer’s Tory continuity government, his neoliberal crack team have suggested that handing NHS and other data to AI companies could help to turn things around. In reality, however, it looks very much like corporate money and influence have triumphed again. Media outlets are currently asking questions like “Has Rachel Reeves crashed the economy?” and “Why has Labour Failed So Badly on the Economy?” The answer, says economist Richard Murphy, is that Reeves has made a conscious ideological choice to avoid the steps necessary to improve the economy. He is also doubtful that artificial intelligence is able to make a big difference without a fundamental shift in the government’s positions. Nonetheless, the Times reported on 12 January that: the health service is set to make its archives of scans, biodata and anonymised patients records available for the first time to train the latest AI models. Ministers think their plans will “attract billions of pounds of investment from American tech firms”. And the awful Peter Kyle, now secretary of state for Science, Innovation and Technology, compared AI development to “the nuclear race” of the 1940s and 50s. A lovely, hopeful image to place into our minds. Importantly, however, WeOwnIt founder Cat Hobbs asked: When did the British public give our permission or mandate to use OUR health data to make a profit for private companies? As the Guardian wrote, meanwhile, Starmer “put concerns over privacy, disinformation and discrimination to one side” when announcing the AI push. “I don’t think that we should have a defensive stance here”, he said. He would say that though, as a corporate crony who happily welcomed a dodgy donation of “£4m from [a] tax haven-based hedge fund with shares in oil and arms”, which also “stood to profit” from Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The fund had invested, for example, in billionaire Israel and Trump fanboy Peter Thiel’s spy tech company Palantir. You know, the pro-Israel company with “deep ties to British and American security agencies”, access to our NHS data, and experience helping to smear progressives, back right-wing causes, and mistreat vulnerable people. Kate Brimsted from law firm Shoosmiths warned about “the substantial data privacy, confidentiality and security challenges that accompany this initiative”. The Guardian has already reported on serious flaws with previous government uses of AI. But officials claim they’ll “take into account national security and ethical concerns”, just like they’ve ‘taken into account’ concerns about the genocide in Gaza while still participating in and legitimising it. AI companies’ mission to profit from NHS and other data, however, needs government insiders. And while massive corporate donations from dodgy hedge funds helps, constant lobbying is key. And Peter Kyle is no stranger to lobbyists’ hospitality. In 2024, openDemocracy reported on how: Hakluyt is a globally operating corporate strategy firm that advises some of the largest companies in the world across all sectors. It spun out of MI6 and despite attempts to shake off its reputation for remaining relatively ‘close’ to the intelligence services in the years since, it is still widely regarded as a retirement home for spies. It added that Hakluyt: forked out several thousand pounds to ferry… Kyle around San Francisco earlier this year. We know that Kyle sat down with senior figures at all the big silicon valley firms while he was there: Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, Open AI et al. On top of that, the firm “arranged a secretive dinner for Kyle to meet with more influential people”. openDemocracy also called Kyle’s role “one of the most lobbyable briefs in government”. And in the run-up to the 2024 election (in which he lost thousands of votes partly over his support for Israel amid its genocide), he “benefited from external support in his office… with the consultancy Public Digital providing a member of staff four days per week to support on policy” and him benefiting “one day per week from the expertise of a member of staff from Faculty AI”. The latter firm: co-authored a substantial policy report titled ‘Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State’. The report was published with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change… The lobbying apparently worked. Because Kyle and his colleagues are now opening the door for AI profit-making in the NHS and beyond. Starmer’s Labour is a disgrace. And as many on the left predicted, its corporate cronyism and the lack of a mass left-wing alternative has helped to make Reform UK the second most popular party in Britain, and a real contender for power in the next election. The need for the left to come together to present a strong front against the far right and its Tory-Labour enablers is more urgent than ever.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:40:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/labour-ai-policy/
Met Police under pressure as outcry increases over Palestine BBC protest ban,"Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and Coalition partners are today issuing a statement that reaffirms their determination to lead a protest at BBC headquarters in central London despite the efforts of the Met Police to prevent a March for Palestine which it previously agreed to in November 2024. Over the weekend a flurry of public figures have criticised the decision by the Met to use conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the protest at the BBC on Portland Place, on the grounds that this would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months of the Gaza genocide. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel’s actions – including MPs, trade union leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 800 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of the march. PSC are calling on all those who support an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, as well as everyone who believes in the democratic right to protest, to join them in London at 12 noon on Saturday 18 January for the March for Palestine. The March for Palestine will assemble in Whitehall, which will allow people to form up in massive numbers in an orderly fashion, and then they will march towards the BBC. Organisers have written today to the Met Police seeking a meeting and asking them to work with them to ensure the march can proceed peacefully and finish with a protest outside the BBC. The groups call upon the Met to drop any restrictions which would prevent this. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said: Hundreds of thousands of people wish to continue to protest at our Government’s ongoing complicity with Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people, which reports this week suggested may have killed tens of thousands more than the suggested figure of 46,000. They also wish to protest at the complicity of the BBC which has failed to report the facts of this genocide, as revealed in recent investigations. There are no legitimate grounds for the Police to impede our proposal to march from Whitehall to the BBC, finishing with a rally outside its HQ. We call upon the Met Police to make clear they will drop any conditions which will deny the right to protest as planned.",Canary,2025-01-13T21:04:11+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-march-18-january-bbc/
One in six UK workers skipping meals as cost of living crisis deepens under Labour,"A survey from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has found that more than one in six UK adults working full time or part time have had to skip meals to make ends meet. The figures come as workers have undergone the largest squeeze in real term pay since Napoleonic times. Real wage growth fell from between 2007-2019 by 0.2%. And it has only improved slightly since, with workers still worse off than they were from before the financial crash and the cost of living crisis continuing. The Labour Party’s first budget failed to address the crisis through measures such as public ownership of essentials (including renewable energy), price controls on essentials and significant rebalancing wealth taxes. Switzerland has kept inflation much lower through its energy security and price controls. The country’s electricity production is 60% from hydropower and 29% from nuclear. On top of that, the Swiss government has issued price controls on 30% of goods and services in the country. This shields its citizens from profiteering price hikes (greedflation) and international gas markets (fossilflation). In the budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves did increase capital gains tax. But she also boasted that we have still have the lowest rate of the G7. Proponents of an increased rate argue that people living off investments shouldn’t pay less tax than those working. Equalising capital gains with income tax rates would rebalance the economy by a further £12.7bn on top of the £2.5bn from Labour’s increase in the budget. The budget’s improvements were piecemeal: Reeves also increased the minimum wage from £11.44 to £12.21 (a 6.7% rise) from April 2025. Workers have undergone the biggest hit to living standards since the 1950s. Food prices generally rose by 19% from March 2022 until March 2023. But some key foods such as pasta and vegetable oil are up by at least 60%. Indeed, in 2023, 61% of the poorest fifth of households reported cutting back on food. And the findings from the TUC umbrella group chime with this. While 17% of worker respondents (more than one in six) said they had skipped meals in the past three months, 8% said they skipped meals most days to make ends meet. Further, 24% said they made large or significant cut backs in food spending over the past year. And 31% of working adults said they never or only occasionally put the heating on. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak had positive things to say about Labour’s Employee Rights Bill, currently at committee stage in parliament. The bill would ban zero hours contracts, among other measures. Nowak also said: After 14 years of Tory chaos and stagnation, we urgently need to boost living standards and to get more money into people’s pockets.

The Scottish government has 'abjectly failed' over ordinary people's access to justice,"Environmental charities including the RSPB and the Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS) have called out the Scottish government’s ‘abject failure’ to meet the access to justice requirements of the UN Aarhus Convention. In 2021, the Convention’s compliance committee gave Scotland six recommendations to remove barriers that are preventing people from taking environmental cases to court. The UK’s final progress report confirms none of the recommendations have been met and it remains ‘prohibitively expensive’ to access justice. Scotland, as part of the UK, is a signatory to the Aarhus Convention, a UN treaty that guarantees people’s rights to access information, participate in decision-making and access justice in environmental matters. Following the most recent ruling of non-compliance by the Convention’s governing bodies in 2021, the Scottish government was required to make access to justice affordable, reform time limits for judicial review and reform planning permissions by the deadline of 1 October 2024. Yet the UK’s Final Progress Report to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC) confirmed that Scotland has made only minor modifications to legal expenses and no concrete commitments for future reform. Comments on the UK report, submitted jointly by the RSPB, ERCS and Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, have been scathing in their assessment of government action to date, with signatories remarking that they are ‘deeply concerned and frustrated that, as a whole, the UK has failed to make any tangible progress’. For the past two years, Scottish legal experts have been raising concerns about the Scottish government’s lack of progress in removing barriers to environmental justice. Campaigners held a rally outside the Court of Session to mark the 1 October deadline, with speakers urging the Scottish government to ensure citizens can hold public bodies and polluters to account for environmental harm. Access to justice remains unaffordable for two main reasons. First, it is incredibly difficult to access legal aid for environmental cases. Second, the ‘loser pays’ rule means that litigants are liable to pay their opponents fees if they lose their case which can cost tens of thousands of pounds. The ACCC has clearly stated that this causes a ‘chilling effect’ – deterring individuals and organisations taking legal action, even if they have a strong case to do so. Shivali Fifield, Chief Officer at ERCS, said: Upholding our environmental rights in court is the ultimate guarantee of the rule of law. Without this credible threat, polluters can act with impunity. Scotland, as part of the UK, has been a signatory to the Aarhus Convention for nearly two decades, but despite repeated warnings from legal experts and campaigners, it has a record of abject failure when it comes to delivering the reforms needed to guarantee access to justice for environmental cases. After years of broken promises, it would be easy to think that the government is threatened by adhering to international law and making access to justice affordable. If they truly believe in community empowerment and a just transition to net zero, they must make our legal system work for people and planet. Aedán Smith, Head of Policy & Advocacy at RSPB Scotland, said: Scotland is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world and we are continuing to lose nature, with 1 in 9 species at risk of national extinction. Yet, despite welcome progress to improve some legal protections for nature over recent years, it remains extremely difficult for individuals and community groups to challenge poor decisions. The Scottish Government must urgently address this to ensure the laws it has introduced can be implemented effectively and as intended.",Canary,2025-01-13T17:07:17+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/scotland-access-to-justice/
Palestine Action has a new company in its sights over Israel's genocide in Gaza,"Palestine Action Scotland targeted the offices of military parts manufacturer Parker Hannifin at its Glasgow production facility overnight on Monday 13 January, damaging the building and covering it in red paint, which it said was ‘symbolic of the Palestinian blood on the hands of the company’. The building on Seaford Road South, which Parker Hannifin describes as a ‘state-of-the-art production facility’ for its Parker Prädifa technology division, had multiple windows smashed during the nighttime action. Its walls and signage, as well as the interior of the building, were sprayed with red paint: A Palestine Action Scotland spokesperson said the activists who carried out the direct action did so because Parker Hannifin is a supplier to Leonardo and other major weapons companies that make military products used by Israel’s forces in its attacks on Gaza. Leonardo has extensive ties to the Israeli state and makes parts for Apache helicopters and targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, which have been used by Israel to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza, destroying homes and civilian infrastructure, and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Leonardo’s site in Edinburgh has been targeted and shut down by activists multiple times since Israel’s ongoing destruction of Gaza intensified in October 2023. Parker Hannifin itself has been involved in the design, development, testing and production of the F-35. Its fuel systems and components are used for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It provides systems for military helicopters and drones to companies including Leonardo Helicopters. Its products are designed to meet specialist military-ready specifications for use in missiles, ordnance and aircraft, as well as use in flight control systems, jet engines and landing gear. The action was the first time that activists in Scotland have targeted Parker Hannifin for its links to the destruction of Gaza, which is described as genocide in a case brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa and 11 other countries. An investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Palestine Action Scotland’s spokesperson said: We are sickened that the continuing genocide is made possible by companies based in Scotland that are happy to profit by designing, making and selling products that result in the mass murder of Palestinian people in Gaza. Every company that chooses to be part of the supply chain to Israel’s military, including Parker Hannifin, shares responsibility for and profits from the shredding of children’s bodies in Gaza, and we will not rest until they cut all their connections to that chain of brutality. By carrying out this action, we intervened directly to disrupt the flow of technology that enables the ongoing genocide. Parker Hannifin has blood on its hands and will remain a target until it cuts its ties to complicit companies including Leonardo and stops supplying essential parts and materials without which apartheid Israel’s weapons could not cause the horrors being committed every day against the Palestinian people. In taking this action, we have been inspired by and acted in solidarity with our friends and comrades in Gaza and throughout all of Palestine, from river to sea. We look forward to celebrating the liberation of Palestine with you in the near future.",Canary,2025-01-13T15:46:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-action-parker-hannifin/
13 Holocaust survivors and descendants slam Met Police over Palestine demo ban at BBC,"Thirteen Holocaust survivors and survivor descendants have just signed a joint letter protesting against the Met Police’s plans to prevent the next Palestine march from gathering outside the BBC headquarters on 18 January. As survivors of the Jewish genocide, or descendants of such survivors, the 13 say they are in despair at the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. This is especially the case when this same government intends to commemorate other genocides – including that of the group’s Jewish relatives – on Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. How any politician can commemorate past genocides while openly supporting an ongoing genocide is something future historians will study with horror and disbelief. But this just makes it all the more important for those of us who oppose all genocides to continue to protest. Naturally, the government and other supporters of Israeli crimes want to discredit and suppress our protests. Having run out of other arguments, they can only resort to claims that people’s demonstrations are somehow antisemitic. As survivors and survivor descendants, the 13 individuals say they take antisemitism extremely seriously. Consequently, they would always make sure of their facts before accusing anyone of antisemitism. Unfortunately, many supporters of Israel are rarely so careful and they routinely accuse anyone they disagree with of antisemitism without any evidence. Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos spoke at a Palestine rally in Hyde Park in April: Note the respect with which the crowd listens to Stephen. This is not the sort of crowd that would ever chant the horrible phrase ‘genocide of Jews’ – yet this is the sort of completely unsubstantiated claim that the right-wing press are resorting too in order to have Palestine demos banned. The 13 also took part in a previous Palestine demo near the BBC headquarters on 18 May: The BBC also broadcast interviews with them there on that day and their journalists will have witnessed the overwhelmingly warm reception from the crowd. The letter from the 13 reads in full as follows: The Metropolitan police intend to ban the 18 January Palestine march from the area around the BBC headquarters in Portland Place in London. Their excuse is that Jewish attendees at a synagogue that is well away from the march route will suffer ‘disruption’ of their religious worship. We are writing as Jewish Holocaust survivors, and descendants of survivors, to protest against this clear attempt to dissuade people from opposing the Gaza genocide. Along with thousands of other openly Jewish protesters, we have attended numerous Palestine demos in London and have received nothing but support and warmth from our fellow demonstrators. To suggest that the 18 January march is a threat to Jews, or is in any way antisemitic, is simply a fabrication in order to restrict everyone’s right to protest. Yours sincerely, Stephen Kapos (survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary) Agnes Kory (survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary) Haim Bresheeth (son of two survivors of Auschwitz) Mark Etkind (son of a survivor of the Lodz ghetto and Buchenwald) Aurora Yaakov (daughter of survivor of Dachau & Kaufering camps) Yosefa Loshitzky (daughter of survivors of the Holocaust in Poland) Miranda Pinch (daughter of a survivor of the Holocaust in Czechoslovakia) Ursula Blumenthal (daughter of a survivor of the Holocaust in Germany) Peter Kapos (son of a Holocaust survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary) Peter Hall (son of a survivor of the Holocaust in Austria) Sonja Linden (daughter of a survivor of the Holocaust in Germany) Chris Romberg (son of a survivor of the Holocaust in Austria) Beatrice Hoffman (daughter of a survivor of the Holocaust in Germany)",Canary,2025-01-13T12:45:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/18-jan-palestine-demo-update/
Just Stop Oil take bold action - because Darwin would be turning in his grave,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted Charles Darwin’s grave to demand that the UK government works with others to phase out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. At around 9:30am on Monday 13 January, two Just Stop Oil supporters entered Westminster Abbey and proceeded to use spray chalk to write ‘1.5 Is Dead’ on Charles Darwin’s grave: This was referencing the news that the world has exceeded the ‘safe’ 1.5 degree warming limit agreed by world leaders in Paris in 2015. The supporters could be heard saying “2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. Millions are being displaced, California is on fire and we have lost three quarters of all wildlife since the 1970’s. Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The government’s plans will take us to over 3 degrees of warming. This will destroy everything we love. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030”: One of those taking action was Alyson Lee who said: Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we have already exceeded the so-called safe temperature rise of 1.5 degrees, and are heading for over 3 degrees of warming. This rapidly accelerating crisis means huge parts of the world will become unable to support life, resulting in millions of refugees, social collapse and extinction for countless species.” Despite lots of fine words from international leaders, emissions are still rising. Without real action, words are useless, you cannot negotiate with the laws of physics. We need mass civil disobedience now, join us on the streets and help us reclaim parliament this April. Also taking action was Di Bligh who stated: Darwin once said- ‘It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works cooperatively against common threats. Last year was the hottest since modern humans evolved. If we do not work together to reign in the corporations and billionaires driving us beyond our means, humanity will not be able to adapt to what is coming. We are on course to lose everything, and politicians are doing nowhere near enough to prevent it. How many will we have to bury as a result of climate breakdown and who will be left to mourn them? Just Stop Oil’s action came as the death toll rises to 24 in California, as fires continue to rip across the state. The fires have been driven by climate breakdown after decades of drought, followed by rapid swings between extreme wet and dry conditions in the past two years. This has created large areas of ‘tinder dry’ vegetation, creating the perfect conditions for uncontrollable wildfires. Meanwhile, the Copernicus Climate Change Service has confirmed that 2024 was the first year on record with a global average temperature exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. All continents except Australasia and Antarctica experienced their hottest year on record, with 11 months of the year exceeding the 1.5°C level. All ten of the hottest years on record have fallen within the last decade. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again this April.

REVEALED: MSM disproportionately targets mental health-related DWP claimants in attack articles,"Disabled people living with mental health conditions came on the receiving end of an exponential surge in corporate media attacks against benefit claimants in 2024. Across the year, the right-wing press cranked up its concerted campaign to vilify chronically ill and disabled claimants more than eleven-fold. But significantly, over half of this coverage featured references to mental health as a leading factor in the recent post-pandemic-height rise in claims. Of course, the substantial uptick in attention on claimants with mental health conditions could have devastating ramifications in the real world. The Canary’s analysis comes amidst “senior government” sources tipping off the Telegraph that Labour Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ministers plan to proceed with some iteration of the former Conservative government’s brutal Personal Independence Payment (PIP) reforms. Already then, this media-manufactured outrage is serving as a convenient pretext for the Labour government to unleash an ideological swathe of new austerity assaults to the welfare system. It’s all a crucial reminder of how the right-wing manoeuvres to single out disabled demographics as undeserving of social security support. The Canary unveiled that in 2024, the corporate media enormously ramped up its scapegoating of disability benefit claimants. Specifically, coverage of disability benefits in the Telegraph, the Times, and the Daily Mail together sky-rocketed more than 1130% from 2023’s output. But notably, the Canary’s research also found that the three outlets had certain marginalised demographics in their sights in particular. The outlets honed in on mental health within the context of disability benefits and unemployment specifically in at least 23 articles (7.7%). In total, the three outlets put out 147 articles either focusing on mental health and disability benefits, or mentioning the two. Notably, the Canary only included articles that did so in a way that made a connection between the two, or at minimum implied it. It meant that nearly half the articles in the Canary’s data drew attention to mental health in the context of disability benefit claims and unemployment. They published the majority of these – 135 – in 2024 alone. What’s more, they weren’t the only marginalised group the mainstream hate-merchants put in the firing line for benefit clampdowns either. Neurodivergent stigma featured heavily across the corporate outlets’ output too – again showing a marked increase in 2024. Articles attributed the rise in disability benefit claims to the increase in claims from autistic people, and people with ADHD. There were 19 pieces (6.4%) that specifically focused on these in the three outlets’ coverage. All but one of these they wrote in 2024. Neurodivergence and the connection to disability benefits cropped up across 39 articles within our analysis time-frame all told (13.1%). The Telegraph published just two of these in 2023, while neither the Times nor the Daily Mail linked these in articles before 2024. The results offer more proof – if we needed it – that the right-wing press and government have a blatant joined-up agenda to strip disabled people of their benefits wherever they can whip up politically-motivated moral panic. Where mental health was concerned, a clear narrative emerged. Specifically, the outlets visibly capitalised on the Covid pandemic’s psychological fallout. In particular, they visibly did so to prey on claimants with mental health conditions. Articles frequently posited pandemic lockdowns and school closures as a key factor in the surge of mental health problems among young people. Naturally, the right-wing press has been quick to condemn Covid protection measures that helped to shield more clinically vulnerable populations at the height of the pandemic. A Times article in January 2024 proclaimed that: The effect of lockdown and school closures on the mental health of young people has also meant more need help with everyday life, officials believe By contrast, as for the trauma of living through a global deadly and disabling pandemic, it was tumbleweed from the trio. So between them, outlets simultaneously blamed protections that were vital for keeping chronically ill and disabled people safe, while at the same time managing to punch down on people psychologically disabled by the pandemic. Of course, leave it to the right-wing foghorns to deal a double-blow of ableism in one. However, more than this, it’s patently clear that the aim was to invalidate new cases of mental health diagnoses. The Canary’s data uncovered a chicken-and-egg style dance between the corporate media and halls of power. We identified how conversations on mental health and disability benefits first appeared noticeably in January 2023. Then, in September 2023, then DWP boss Mel Stride announced proposals for a dangerous tightening of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Notably, this included honing in on mental health claimants. Significantly, the Tories’ response to the consultation stated how the government would: specify the circumstances, and physical and mental health conditions, for which LCWRA [limited capability for work-related activity] Substantial Risk should apply. In other words, the DWP will decide who this descriptor will apply to going forward. Or, in short, it will obviously move the goalposts to exclude many people living with mental health conditions. Up to that point in September, we had found at least seven articles that disparaged the rise in mental health-related claims. Of course, we can’t say for certain that these shaped the government’s thinking. However, it seems no coincidence that right-wing talking heads had been harping on about it not long before it took root in the establishment echo-chambers of Westminster. Arguably, timing is everything where the corporate press treads. So, it was also no mistake that it started stepping up its vitriol against claimants with mental health conditions in 2024 either. In other words, the Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail planted the seed in the public consciousness. Policy-makers took up this convenient narrative and scapegoat. And on the merry-go-round of client media revolving door politics continued. It’s easy to see how the corporate media fear-mongering then paved the way for politicians making a political football out of disabled people with mental health conditions. In fact, the Canary’s data helped plot a notable timeline of this very development as well. Between January and the end of March 2024, the three posted a flurry of articles that directly honed in on this connection: Cue, a disgusting diatribe from Stride. On 20 March, he opined to the Telegraph on all things stereotyping and stigmatising mental health. He made classic bogus contention of work as a health outcome, claiming that: we seem to have forgotten that work is good for mental health If that weren’t bad enough, Stride took to the dismissive and downright despicable diminishing of people’s mental health. He derided it as the “normal ups and downs of human life” and a case of people “feeling rather down and bluesy”. The corporate media had been banging on about all this so vehemently, that it gave Stride the perfect ready-made justification for his atrocious claims. And that of course was the entire point. It should therefore come as little surprise that the Tory government followed this up with a raft of ludicrous welfare reform proposals too. Less surprising still: that people with mental health conditions were a particular target. In April 2024, the Tories launched their toxic proposals for changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP). As with the WCA changes, this would also legislate to shut people with mental health conditions out from the disability benefits system. Naturally though, it wasn’t the end of it when Labour took to the helm either. Unsurprisingly, Labour’s DWP chief hate-hawker Liz Kendall has certainly been living up to her arch-right-wing ideology. While she made a big song and dance that she wasn’t jumping on her predecessor’s “bluesy” bandwagon – she basically did anyway. In November, she suggested that “self-diagnosed” mental health had contributed to the rise in people unable to work. So, that would be: people unable to access underfunded mental health diagnosis services then? What’s more, it was all wrapped up in a grandstanding over sanction threats, naturally. However, more than her disgraceful diatribes, she has gone pedal to the metal on policy-making as well. For instance, job coaches in more mental health settings is one example of Labour amping up this hostile offensive. Moreover, lo and behold, Labour appears to now be mulling some of these PIP reforms too. And if it seems a little too on the nose that anonymous “senior government” sources were spilling the tea to the Telegraph, it really shouldn’t. This is what the client media do best. The DWP is scratching the Telegraph’s back with an insider tip off. Conversely, the dutiful mouthpiece is doing the government’s dirty work, in preemptively announcing it. A shameless PR-type move to lessen the reputational blow this Spring? It seems highly plausible. The dataset also reinforced the fact that it has been a similar story for neurodivergent claimants. The first piece the Canary found goading the link was a Telegraph article in August 2023 titled: Number of children on disability benefit jumps after surge in ADHD and autism cases Of course, many of the articles revolved around this bogus notion the right-wing scapegoat-mongers have been spouting. Specifically, this is that healthcare professionals are over-diagnosing people with ADHD and autism. Naturally, the implication in the coverage seems to be that autistic people, and people with ADHD shouldn’t be claiming disability benefits either. Broadly, the articles are also suggesting that many have been wrongly diagnosed, and ergo again, should not be eligible to claim disability-based social support. The Canary’s Rachel Charlton-Dailey has been documenting this. In August, she debunked one of these shameful tirades. And notably, the article was emblematic of the broader discourse at play across the Canary’s dataset. For one, it had all the hallmarks of the most classic ableist tropes around neurodivergence. Overdiagnosis made its cameo appearance, as did a sweep of antiquated terms which Charlton-Dailey incisively pointed out the outlet had used to “delegitimise the conditions”. Significantly though, it was the Telegraph’s deployment of misleading statistics to underpin its nonsense claims that was most characteristic of the articles in our dataset. In its case, it made a number of deliberate categorical conflations to misrepresent the figures. Charlton-Dailey explained that: Despite linking the two and putting the main total of 730,000 kids with DLA – much, much further down, the article itself explains that less than half of claims (337,000) were for “neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and Asperger’s syndrome”. They then pulled out that 72,500 kids claimed benefits for “hyperkinetic syndrome – also known as ADHD”, despite making it sound like a separate figure this will have actually gone in with the 337k. Separately, Fullfact also eviscerated the statistical claims of the piece. The article (still) claims that: The number of parents claiming disability benefits for children with conditions such as ADHD and autism has surged by 200,000 since lockdown, new figures reveal. However, this simply isn’t true. As Fullfact detailed, that increase instead: refers to the total increase in DLA claims for under-18s, rather than only those related to ADHD and autism. Naturally, there were other problematic parts of the article too. But the bottom line was that it was using inaccurate, manipulated figures to make neurodivergent claimants a target of public acrimony. In reality, neurodivergent claimants actually made up a small fraction of the overall increases. Not that it should matter anyway. Regardless, it hasn’t stopped outlet’s spewing a slew of headlines all making the same bogus over-egged connection. Other shitty takes on neurodivergent disability claims? What the Times outlandishly branded “a new industry” of “disability influencers”. It tracks that the ableist bigot soapbox would frame a community of disabled people helping other disabled people with the notoriously inaccessible disability benefits process, in this egregiously derogatory way. The bullshit insinuation is of course that neurodivergent people are gaming the system – go figure. And like with the media fanfare over mental health claims, politicians haven’t passed up the opportunity to pounce on all this either. Amidst his vile comments on mental health in April, Stride also questioned whether people with ADHD and learning disabled people should be entitled to disability benefits. Predictably, the right-wing outlets have continued with all this in 2025. Less than two weeks in, and establishment shill the Telegraph was platforming former New Labour prime minister Tony Blair’s odious warnings to the government on mental health. He revived the ghost of DWP Tory past, parroting Stride’s facetious “ups and downs” of life drivel. In tandem, Kendall’s self-diagnosis claims made a cameo appearance. Once again, it perfectly illustrated how indistinguishable Labour’s welfare rhetoric is from the Tories. Ultimately, disabled people know all too well where corporate media scapegoating leads. This latest maligning of mental health and neurodivergence is invariably a warning signal for the next round of callous cuts and reforms. Of course, they won’t be the only demographics in line for this. The Canary has documented how it’s part of a broader-scale attack on disabled claimants en masse. We don’t know the details of what Labour has in store yet this Spring. However, all chatter from the government so far points in the direction of some form of the dangerous WCA and PIP reforms. What is clear is that if it takes its cue from the corporate media’s crackdown circus, it will spell more misery and harm for neurodivergent folks and disabled people with mental health conditions alike.",Canary,2025-01-13T12:07:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/msm-mental-health-dwp/
Gaie Delap spent her 78th birthday in prison - and people came out to show solidarity,"A vigil to mark unjustly imprisoned Just Stop Oil activist Gaie Delap’s 78th birthday was held outside Eastwood Park Prison on Friday 10th January. It came after she was sent back to prison – despite having served her sentence – because of failures of the criminal justice system. The vigil for Gaie a peaceful and dignified Quaker-led occasion accompanied by family and friends: https://x.com/JustStop_Oil/status/1878396377899655427 It is now three weeks since Gaie was arrested and returned to prison following systemic failings in the management of her home detention curfew. These include evidence of deceit on the part of Serco EMS who manage tagging arrangements on behalf of the Ministry of Justice (see our New Year’s statement). Gaie’s brother, Mick, who visited her last Friday said: Despite her outrage, tempered with resignation, she tries to stay strong. She knows about the vigil. She is overwhelmed with the messages of support she has received. The best birthday present for her would be that common sense and justice prevail and lead to her re-release. Lily Pridie, her daughter, had this message for her mother: Please stay strong and keep your spirits up. We are so proud of you. Thousands of people are supporting you. Let’s hope that something positive comes out as a result of this awful situation. One of the organisers of the vigil Jo Flanagan said: The vigil will be supported by dozens of singers from the Climate Choir Movement which started in Bristol. Several of the organisers of this movement are Quakers and know Gaie personally and attend the same Quaker Meeting House in Bristol including the two co- founders. Many of the principles on which the choir it is founded align with Quaker values including peacefully singing ‘truth to power’ and standing up against injustice. Close friend Mike Campbell added: Gaie makes it clear too that this is not just about her situation. There are other countless women who are impacted by tagging failures. She told us about a woman released late and then recalled because there was no available bus to get home in time for their curfew. She also witnesses daily the impact of imprisonment on other women, those with mental health problems, addiction issues, mothers separated from their children. Like Gaie, these are women who should not be in prison. Another birthday present for Gaie arrived early. This was in the form of a song called Eastwood Park Blues, written and performed by the Blue House Buoys, with a call to Shabana Mahmood, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Timpson, Prisons Minister to ‘free Gaie Delap’. “Dearest Gaie, we shower you with love”, said a spokesperson for group. Carla Denyer, Green MP for Bristol Central, said “My heart goes out to Gaie who is spending her 78th birthday behind bars – all because the private company responsible for fitting electronic tags couldn’t find one the right size for her. I know her friends and family are desperate to see her come home. Gaie has not broken bail conditions, neither is she a threat to the public. I find it beyond belief that a solution cannot be found to get Gaie home”: As Gaie’s MP I have tried everything I can to challenge the decision to send her back to prison – including writing to the prisons minister Lord Timpson and the probation service – and I will continue to push for her release. Hannah Greer, of the Good Law Project who are crowdfunding for Gaie’s legal fees, said: You should not be in prison on your birthday. On behalf of the hundreds of supporters whose generosity has so far raised over £20,000 you have our continued support and we send birthday greetings. Melanie Jameson from Quakers in Criminal Justice who are upholding Gaie on her birthday said “With prisons overflowing, this is no place for peaceful climate protesters. In Gaie’s case, we are appalled that Serco’s failings have led to her recall”.

"McDonnell brands Treasury response to bond markets turbulence ""economically inept""","Former Labour Party shadow chancellor John McDonnell has denounced the Treasury for reportedly planning to use bond markets turbulence as an excuse to cut welfare: The issue is that the bond market itself attaches debt to the financing of public services in a form of corporate welfare. The gilt set up constrains government and functions as a tool for private finance to extract money from the public. This week, Reform MP Rupert Lowe tabled a bill to ban quantitative easing. He said: Our moral decline is clearly evident as true capitalism has been undermined by regular intervention, increasing state regulation and a growing, bloated and inefficient state Regulation often means the standards that uphold quality in society. And the idea the state is necessarily inefficient makes no sense, given public ownership of essential services brings down prices for people and businesses. It also helps control inflation through keeping pricing low on the essentials society needs, like water, energy (say, through a Green New Deal) and the internet. And it’s inflation that is a key driver of the increase in price of government bonds. It’s a merry-go-round of con artistry. Essentials are a risk free investment for the state to run (and can do in a way that’s accountable to the people). That’s because we aren’t going to wake up one day and say we don’t need water anymore or we’re going to stop using electricity and live in caves. Lowe further described quantitative easing as a “national ponzi scheme”. But what we have at present is that money is created when private banks issue loans to people. This is a system where we rent our money from private banks, rather than the state issuing it without interest. Money could be cost price, rather than effective usury. As the Bank of England explains on its website: Most of the money in the economy is created, not by printing presses at the central bank, but by banks when they provide loans… Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Positive Money, meanwhile, estimates that 97% of the money in the economy is created in this way. So, McDonnell was right to call out just how the Labour government is responding to the bond markets. Whether it listens or not remains to be seen.",Canary,2025-01-12T11:11:36+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/12/bond-markets/
150 MPs and public figures slam the Met over pro-Palestine BBC march restriction,"Cross-party MPs and peers, trade union general secretaries, cultural figures and celebrities, writers, journalists, health workers and civil society organisations and activists have condemned police attempts to stop an agreed Protest for Palestine taking place at the BBC on Saturday 18 January. In a statement issued today (10 January) by the six organisations behind the national Palestine marches, and supported by at least 150 high profile individuals and organisations, including Liberty, Amnesty International UK, and Greenpeace, the Metropolitan Police are accused of misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. Among those to have signed the statement are musician Brian Eno, singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, actors Mark Rylance, Khalid Abdalla, Nadia Sawalha and Juliet Stevenson, author Susan Abulhawa, economist Yanis Varoufakis, Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty and Asad Rehman, executive director, War on Want, along with several leading health workers, including London Hospital A&E doctor Dr Andrew Myerson. Labour, Independent, Green, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein and SNP MPs have signed, while trade union leaders include PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, the NEU’s Daniel Kebede and FBU leader Matt Wrack. The route of the march was agreed by the Met in November. They have now reneged on that agreement, citing possible disruption to a synagogue, which is not on the route of the march. Making the point about the preciousness of the rights to freedom of speech and protest the statement concludes: It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned. We strongly condemn police attempts to stop an agreed march for Palestine from protesting at the BBC on 18 January. The route for the march was confirmed with the Police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police is reneging on the agreement and has stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. The police should not be misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that the march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue which is not even on the march route. As the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that pro-Palestine marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that Jewish people have been joining the marches in their thousands. The rights to protest and free speech are precious. It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned. Palestine Solidarity Campaign

Headteachers warn of Labour's austerity 2.0 as schools face 'death by a thousand cuts',"Headteachers have intervened after a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that funding for primary and secondary schools is facing a 0.8% cut under the Labour Party government. And that’s before you account for the 5% cut to each government department that chancellor Rachel Reeves quietly announced before Christmas, branded as “efficiency savings”. The 0.8% reduction is because of a promised increase in teachers’ salaries. But providing more income for undervalued teachers shouldn’t come at the price of cutting resources for schools, as well as increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. Overall, the education budget already faced a 9% cut from 2010-2020. This was drastic for school sixth forms that underwent cuts of 26%. The lack of funding forced 47 school sixth forms to close from 2016-2019. Funding for colleges, meanwhile, will still be 11% lower than in 2010. Julie McCulloch, director of policy as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: This report reveals the reality that is facing many schools and colleges – yet another round of cutbacks. It will inevitably mean further reductions to pastoral support, curriculum options and classroom resources. It is also likely that in many cases class sizes will increase. Schools and colleges have been expected to absorb relentless financial pressures over the past 15 years, and they have done an incredible job in minimising the impact on students. But we cannot go on like this. It is death by a thousand cuts. The government must recognise the importance of improved investment in education. When it comes to a share of GDP, education spending has also fallen from around 5.6% of national income in 2010 to about 4.1% in 2023-24. The National Education Union (NEU) is also not happy with Labour’s proposed pay increase. The government already issued a 5.5% pay increase for teachers for the 2024-25 academic year. But, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. NEU general secretary Daniel Kebede said: The current proposal of 2.8 per cent is not sufficient to even start to address the crisis in recruitment and retention. The suggestion that an unfunded pay award can be paid for by making ‘efficiencies’ is an insult to a profession who have already endured 14 years of austerity. Thousands of teachers voted for the change that Labour promised for education. They promised to invest in education, to recruit 6,500 teachers and to value education and to secure the life chances of our children. The austerity has gotten so bad that headteachers are taking on additional roles. Amanda Richards, the headteacher of Sytchampton primary in Worcestershire, said in April 2024 that her school “literally can’t afford” a permanent caretaker. Richards told the Guardian: I’m 53 this year; I’m not built for lifting and shifting, to be honest with you. But there isn’t anyone else to do it. Just before half-term, the toilets in our new building were blocked. So when that happens during the day, it’s me who puts the marigolds on and goes down to the toilets with the plunger and tries to unblock it as best as I can. That’s a fairly regular occurrence. With regard to things like DIY or maintenance for the building, we don’t have anyone to do that. So we either do it ourselves, or we save up bigger jobs for someone to come in and do, because we just couldn’t afford somebody to be on hand regularly as a member of staff. A survey has further found that one in six schools in England can no longer afford to employ a caretaker.",Canary,2025-01-09T19:44:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/schools-funding/
Another Brexit 'win' thanks to Nigel Farage: the UK now has a critical skills shortage,"The UK faces increasing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals, exacerbated by shifts in, and far-right rhetoric around, immigration policy and the impact of Brexit. These factors have shaped the dynamics of inbound migration, contributing to growing concerns about skills shortages across industries. Understanding the role of immigration policies, the effect of Brexit, and the resulting skills gap is essential for addressing this issue. The UK’s departure from the EU has significantly altered migration patterns, particularly for skilled workers from the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Under the new immigration framework, European nationals are subject to the same visa requirements as non-European nationals, which has reduced the ease of movement for workers who previously filled vital roles in the UK. Before Brexit, the healthcare sector heavily relied on EU nationals, who made up a large proportion of its workforce. According to the NHS, recruitment from the EU has slowed dramatically since the end of free movement, compounding pre-existing staffing shortages. The Skilled Worker Visa has partially mitigated this by enabling those in recognised healthcare roles to apply for a Health and Care Worker visa, which enables those eligible to pay reduced visa fees and benefit from reduced minimum salary thresholds. Nonetheless, administrative hurdles such as the need to secure sponsorship, combined with the UK’s departure from the EU, have deterred many professionals from applying. The construction and engineering industries have also been impacted. EU workers were a key source of labour, particularly for roles requiring mid-level skills that often do not meet the minimum salary thresholds required under the current Immigration Rules. Many UK organisations also relied on short-term labour from the EU, with specialist workers travelling to the UK to undertake short work assignments. UK employers are now struggling to fill vacancies, which in turn is delaying projects and increasing recruitment costs. Sectors such as hospitality and agriculture, which rely on seasonal and lower-wage workers, have been particularly affected. Despite the introduction of short-term visas for some agricultural roles, businesses have reported difficulties accessing sufficient labour to meet demand.. The current immigration system recognises that high-skilled workers can be sponsored, but it imposes strict requirements that limit access to the international workforce. The general salary threshold of £38,700 and skill level requirements exclude many mid-level roles. Employers also face high costs, including visa application fees, the Immigration Skills Charge, and the Immigration Health Surcharge, which collectively increase the financial burden of hiring international workers. The end of free movement has reduced the pool of available workers from the EU, particularly in industries where EU nationals previously accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce. For example, the hospitality and construction sectors have seen a notable decline in applications from EU citizens, leading to unfilled vacancies. Brexit-related uncertainty has made the UK less attractive to international professionals, with many professionals wanting to secure EU citizenship – along with the benefits this brings – as opposed to British citizenship. The Government’s clear focus on reducing immigration also makes the UK less attractive to those considering emigrating to another country for work. Skills shortages hinder productivity, delay projects, and increase operational costs for businesses. The construction and engineering sectors, which are essential for infrastructure development, face growing difficulties meeting demand. Similarly, reduced staffing in healthcare and hospitality has affected service delivery and customer satisfaction. Employers report greater difficulty in filling vacancies, particularly for mid-level and seasonal roles. This has increased reliance on domestic workers, where available, and has driven up costs for recruitment and training. Businesses are also exploring automation and outsourcing as potential solutions, but these options are not always viable. The UK’s ability to position itself as a global leader in technology, research, and innovation is at risk. Skilled professionals are critical for advancing key industries, and difficulties in attracting international talent could stifle growth in emerging fields such as renewable energy and artificial intelligence. Streamlining visa processes and reducing associated costs could help attract skilled workers from abroad. Expanding the Immigration Salary List (previously known as the Shortage Occupation List) to include more roles and lowering salary thresholds for specific industries could also ease immediate pressures. Targeted visa schemes for mid-level roles, such as those in hospitality and agriculture, could address gaps in these sectors. Investing in domestic talent is essential for long-term resilience. Enhanced apprenticeships, vocational training, and partnerships between industries and educational institutions can equip UK workers with the skills needed to fill critical roles. Since winning the General Election, Labour has confirmed its plan to upskill the domestic workforce in order to reduce immigration, and Sir Keir Starmer has recently confirmed that those who sponsor skilled workers will be expected to train people from the local labour market. To address the decline in EU migration, the UK could introduce specific incentives for EU nationals, such as reduced visa fees or streamlined pathways to residency. Recognising professional qualifications from EU countries could also simplify the process of hiring EU-based talent. Earlier this year, the UK Government was involved in discussions enabling the free movement of young people aged between 18 and 30 between the UK and EU (also known as the Youth Mobility Scheme), but thus far, the Government has rejected the possibility of extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to include EU nationals. Creating a more appealing environment for skilled professionals by enhancing working conditions and offering flexible arrangements could reduce the desire to leave the UK. In this regard, the Government has published the Employment Rights Bill, aimed at upgrading the rights of workers to improve work conditions. Policies aimed at improving quality of life, such as affordable housing and access to public services, may also help retain talent. Brexit has undeniably reshaped the UK’s workforce, creating new challenges for industries reliant on skilled professionals. While government initiatives such as the Skilled Worker visa and Global Business Mobility visa routes offer partial solutions, more comprehensive measures are required to address the root causes of skills shortages. A balanced approach that combines targeted immigration reforms, domestic workforce investment, and quality-of-life improvements will be necessary to ensure the UK remains competitive in attracting and retaining talent. Collaboration between government, businesses, and educational institutions will be key to developing sustainable strategies for mitigating the impact of these changes.

ANOTHER Just Stop Oil supporter is preposterously sentenced by a judge,"A Just Stop Oil supporter who climbed an M25 gantry after an unprecedented 40c heatwave in the UK was found guilty by a jury in Chichester on Thursday 9 January. Abigail Percy Ratcliff took action in July 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Abigail, 25, a student from London, was among five supporters who blocked the M25 in three places by climbing on the overhead signs after Just Stop Oil declared the M25 a site of civil resistance on 20 July 2022. The action was prompted by news that UK temperatures had recently topped 40c for the first time ever, causing multiple fires to break out and resulting in the busiest day for the London Fire Brigade since the WWII. Before taking action in 2022 Abigail said: The UK crossed the 40 degree threshold yesterday, runways melted, wildfires raged and hundreds died. This is not the new normal, it will keep getting worse until we just stop oil. We must act now. I joined Just Stop Oil because I was worried about my future, about my sister’s future, but I think a lot of us have realised this week that we’re not talking about the future, we’re talking about now, it’s happening today. Abigail was found guilty of public nuisance, and given an eight month suspended sentence plus £1,500 in costs. She was previously remanded to prison in November 2022 for three and a half months. Her sentence comes just days after Just Stop Oil supporter Dr Patrick Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. The judge sentenced him to a year in prison. Speaking prior to the trial Abigail said: This protest I’m on trial for was back in 2022, during a heatwave that broke temperature records and killed thousands of people in the UK. And the government at the time was planning to approve 100 new licenses for oil exploration in the North Sea, in light of the evidence of the harm it would cause. The most vulnerable among us were killed that summer and the UK government went ahead and approved those licenses anyway, flagrantly denying the evidence that the climate disaster was already a threat to this nation. It was under those circumstances that I took action. Democracy has failed to protect us. Both the labour and Tory parties are neglecting to take serious action on the climate. We have now passed 1.5 degrees warming over pre-industrial levels. There is absolutely no time for talking about whether it’s okay to block a road. It’s not okay to sell future generations’ futures off for a profit, and that’s exactly what these fossil fuel companies are doing. It’s exactly what our government is allowing them to do. Peaceful protesters are filling our prisons while the real criminals sit in power handing down a death sentence to future generations. We mustn’t go without a fight. Another of those taking action on 20 July 2022 was Louise Lancaster. She was prosecuted in October 2022 for contempt of court for breaking the M25 protest injunction, but received a suspended sentence. Three others who took action on the same day were also given suspended sentences after being found guilty of public nuisance in May 2024. However, that was before ‘Lord’ Walney called for Just Stop Oil to be treated like a terrorist organisation and the courts started dishing out multi-year prison sentences for nonviolent action. These disproportionate sentences are being challenged at the court of appeal at the end of this month. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

#WeWillMarch: campaign groups push back against Met Police over Palestine demo,"A new year has begun, yet Israel’s atrocities in Palestine persist. In Gaza, the situation is more dire than ever. Health workers are stretched to breaking point, particularly in northern Gaza, where not a single hospital remains functional. Their resilience in the face of unimaginable suffering is nothing short of heroic, but they cannot do it alone. On Monday 7 January, health workers and supporters gathered outside parliament to demand urgent action. Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd calling for IDF troops to withdraw from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as from southern Lebanon and Syria; and for the British government to stop supplying arms to Israel. On Saturday 18 January, we will unite and once again call for an end to the genocide, despite attempts by the police to curb our right to protest.

"Labour 'no better' than the Tories on dodgy political donations, polling finds","Capping political donations could help to reset the government’s reputation, campaigners claim, as a poll shows two-thirds of the public regard the ethical standards of the Labour Party government as worse or no different than those of its predecessor. The survey, commissioned by pressure group Unlock Democracy, found that by more than four to one, the public favours limiting the amount of money individuals can donate to political parties or politicians, with support for such a move consistent across voters for all major parties. The most recent quarterly data from the Electoral Commission reveals Labour accepted over £2 million in donations of £15,000 or more between July and September of 2024, including £171,000 from the former boss of Autoglass, Gary Lubner. Tom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy, said: The public is fed up with the corrosive influence of big money in politics.3 Labour will find it hard to convince voters it is serious about governing in service of working people while it continues to accept large donations from wealthy individuals and corporations. There is an opportunity here for the government to show clearly that it is different from its predecessor. At the moment, if the public perceives a difference, it’s not in a good way. Two-thirds of survey respondents – including more than four in 10 Labour voters – said this government is worse (34%) or no better (31%) than the last government when it comes to behaving ethically, compared to only a quarter (25%) who think it’s behaving better. Just as troublingly for a government elected on a promise to restore “the highest standards of integrity and honesty” to public life, one in two Labour voters see no improvement with this government in delivering on its promises. Overall, nearly half of all respondents felt Labour was worse in this regard (46%), compared to only one in five (19%) who thought it was doing better. Brake continued: Labour must address these perceptions head-on. More people think the scandals and dysfunction in politics are the fault of the broader system than believe it is only individuals to blame. Half-measures, such as the government’s tweaks to rules around second jobs and enhanced ministerial code, won’t cut it. Bold reform is what’s needed. The government must deliver on its commitments by championing reforms that ensure those with the deepest pockets cannot wield outsized, unaccountable influence. The government has this week reaffirmed its manifesto commitment to strengthening donation rules. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee that the government was considering changes to ensure “transparency in the process of where donations come from”. This follows MHCLG spokesperson, Lord Khan of Burnley, stating in the House of Lords last December: The government has committed to reforming political finance rules. We are considering changes that will help protect our system from foreign interference, such as tighter controls on donations. A cap on political donations forms part of a suite of measures aimed at protecting UK democracy from big money and foreign interference set out in Unlock Democracy’s Democratic Integrity White Paper, a summary of which is available here.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:49:18+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/labour-political-donations/
"DWP complaints up 38%, with Universal Credit causing chaos for countless families","The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has seen a 38% increase in just three years in the number of claimants making official complaints against it. Moreover, the head of the independent body responsible for dealing with claimant complaints has slammed the DWP for ” simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should”. It comes amid a startling 83% increase in the number of complaints accepted by the independent body, too. Perhaps the best summing up of the situation is to be found in one DWP complaint, where it told a dying claimant that they owed it £89,000 – when they didn’t actually owe anything at all. The Independent Case Examiner’s (ICE) 2023-2024 annual report offers insight into the complaint-handling process within the DWP. It outlines recurring patterns of administrative errors, delays, and the inadequate treatment of vulnerable claimants. All this suggests that DWP has not fully embraced the principles of accountability and effective service delivery. The ICE office serves as a mediator between the public and the DWP, tasked with investigating complaints of maladministration. For the reporting year, the ICE office experienced a 38% increase in complaints compared to the past three years, highlighting a growing dissatisfaction among claimants. Among the complaints accepted for examination, nearly 50% were fully or partially upheld, a figure indicative of consistent service failures. The report asserts a commitment to fostering improvements within the DWP. However, the patterns observed – such as poor communication, lack of prompt action, and insufficient redress – raise questions about DWP’s ability to enact meaningful change based on ICE recommendations. The ICE report documents various categories of complaints, such as Universal Credit, disability benefits, debt management, and child maintenance, among others. Universal Credit remained the most complained-about benefit, reflecting its complexity and the impact of policy decisions such as mandatory recovery of overpayments caused by administrative errors. It also had one of the highest rates of complaints being upheld. However, Universal Credit was also subject to one of the most shocking complaints about the DWP. In May 2021, Customers A and B made a joint Universal Credit claim but received no payments as their income exceeded the entitlement threshold. B declared a serious health condition and later claimed New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). In early 2022, A reported that the couple would soon receive capital exceeding £16,000, which temporarily affected their Universal Credit claim, requiring a DWP decision on whether the claim should close or the capital disregarded. The DWP took three months to decide, initially miscalculating capital and incorrectly applying nearly £89,000 from the start of the claim. Although the error was corrected the same day, delays led to a £300 Universal Credit overpayment, which was referred for recovery without notifying A. The claim was eventually closed mid-2022, and Debt Management later contacted A and B to recover the overpayment. A challenged the overpayment, citing distress due to B’s terminal condition. DWP’s subsequent errors included sending a letter erroneously claiming a debt of £89,000. After further review, DWP acknowledged the mistake and revised the debt to nil. However, their errors caused significant distress during B’s final days. The DWP offered just £200 in compensation – despite A saying that the DWP’s actions had hastened B’s death. Universal Credit’s framework’s rigidity and lack of proportionality in overpayment recovery indicate structural deficiencies. Vulnerable claimants, unaware of overpayments, are disproportionately penalized, undermining the principles of fairness and trust. The transition from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and related issues in communication exacerbated hardships for claimants. For example, a parent contested DWP’s abrupt change in the appointee for their child’s DLA without notification. Despite prolonged distress and inconvenience, DWP delayed in resolving the issue, later reinstating the rightful appointee and arrears under ICE’s direction. Procedural lapses in notifying stakeholders and delayed responses expose a failure in safeguarding the interests of dependent and vulnerable groups, violating procedural justice. Debt management, a critical area of claimant dissatisfaction, highlighted inconsistencies in application processing and lack of proactive communication. For example, a claimant requesting Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) faced months of delays due to repeated administrative missteps. Despite escalating financial hardship, the DWP failed to address urgent needs until ICE’s intervention. The neglect of claimants’ immediate financial crises underscores systemic inefficiencies. Such failures question the robustness of the DWP’s operational oversight. The ICE report identifies systemic weaknesses within the DWP: The report commends the DWP’s incremental changes, such as revised guidance for vulnerable claimants and improved debt management procedures. However, the critical lens reveals these measures as reactive rather than preventative. ICE’s Service Improvement Observations (SIOs) repeatedly cite issues stemming from outdated policies or failure to act on past recommendations. Head of ICE Joanna Wallace said of the DWP: Given that there is some delay between the events a customer is complaining about, and my office seeing a complaint, it can be frustrating to still see complaints about things I know DWP have addressed. She particularly noted that Universal Credit was an issue, saying: Overpayments to students would be one example from this last year – I raised this concern and the action DWP had taken to stop repetition in my previous annual report, but these customers with these concerns have continued to come to my office and some of these cases have been amongst the most concerning I’ve seen. In no small part this is because Universal Credit procedures require all overpayments to be recovered, regardless of their cause. This can mean that a customer can do absolutely everything they should have done in terms of telling DWP about their circumstances, but due to administrative error be overpaid. And overall, Wallace said: I agreed with a customer’s view that they had not received the service they should, and that DWP hadn’t recognised that fully, in about half the cases I saw during this last year. Most often, as I’ve commented before, this is due to the department simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should. The 2023-2024 ICE report underscores persistent challenges in DWP’s complaint-handling mechanisms – but also its overall conduct. While incremental improvements are evident, the prevalence of service failures, particularly affecting vulnerable groups, demonstrates an urgent need for systemic reforms. Claimants’ case studies expose a troubling pattern of indifference and inefficiency, further showing that the department is barely fit for purpose.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:08:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/dwp-complaints-report/
It's obvious why Keir Starmer brushed off a question on toxic political donations at PMQs,"At Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 8 January, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey questioned the prime minister on party donations: While the honourable member for Clacton may miss out on his big allowance from Elon Musk, the spectre of the richest man in the world trying to buy a British political party should give us all pause for thought. And after years of the Conservatives taking millions of pounds of Russian money, will the prime minister now work with us to bring in long overdue reforms of party funding. So that power in this country lies with the voters and not wealthy overseas oligarchs. Musk is reportedly considering a donation of up to $100m to Reform, although he has now called for its leader Nigel Farage to resign over a disagreement about far-right fascist Tommy Robinson. The thing is, at PMQs Keir Starmer shrugged off the pressing issue of rich people buying our politics, saying: I think we all had a smile… when the honourable member said how cool it was to have the support of Musk, only for Musk to say he should be removed just a few hours later… Of course we’re looking at the question of funding more generally. It’s no wonder Starmer is so blasé about the corrupting impact of large political donations in politics. Since he became leader in April 2020, the Labour Party has accepted a total of 61 donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. That includes 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping £23.6m from just a handful of people. And the corrupting influence can be seen through the £4m from Quadrature Capital. This a tax haven-based hedge fund with investments in weapons, fossil fuels and private healthcare. Indeed, Labour has even appointed Rachel Kyte as its climate envoy. She also sits on the advisory board of Quadrature Charitable Foundation. By contrast, throughout Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership from 2015-2019 the party only received a total of five donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. Instead, donations from those other than trade unions tended to be small amounts from various members of the electorate and funds driven from a mass increase in party membership. Too bad much of the British electorate slept on the opportunity of making Corbyn prime minister. And the situation is worse than super rich individuals and corporations buying influence through donations. Recent research from Transparency International has found that one in every ten pounds donated to UK parties comes from outright dubious sources. That includes where corruption, cash for access, fraud or money laundering has been specifically alleged or proven. The organisation recommends capping donations from individuals and corporations at £10,000 per year. Such a change would be most welcome. It would be a huge step towards de-toxifying UK politics.",Canary,2025-01-08T19:47:06+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/pmqs-8-january/
Corbyn pushes government on RAF base's role in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"On 8 January 2025, independent MP Jeremy Corbyn pushed Keir Starmer’s government for transparency on the role that a strategically important RAF base is playing in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. The previous day, Corbyn described in his letter that foreign office parliamentary under-secretary Hamish Falconer had responded to a question of his “during an Urgent Question on Northern Gaza”. And the former Labour Party leader said Falconer had “failed to answer or acknowledge my question on the use of the British air base in Cyprus, RAF Akrotiri”. He insisted that: My constituents deserve to know the full scale of this government’s complicity and participation in genocide. With this in mind, Corbyn asked for clarification on three important follow-up questions: 3. Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be deployed in Gaza? 4. How many US Air Force flights have flown from RAF Akrotiri to Israel since 7 October 2023? 5. Has your government sought legal advice over the continued use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israeli military operations? And he warned the government to be careful with its actions for legal reasons: Your government will be aware that the ICC has issued arrest warrants to Israeli officials. The government should also be aware that if it knowingly sends weapons to a government whose leader is wanted for war crimes, then it is not immune to the long arm of international law. He was referring to the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issuing arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel‘s former defence minister Yoav Gallant back in November 2024. Both the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government have used RAF Akrotiri (the unique colonial relic on occupied Cypriot land which is part of the “largest Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom”) to lend a helping hand to Israeli war criminals. So far, RAF Akrotiri has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. And as Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of “a country which is participating” in Israel’s genocide – “a direct participant”. Corbyn’s original question, that Falconer failed to answer properly, was: Will Britain continue supplying weapons, including parts for jet planes, and allowing the use of RAF Akrotiri as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be used to destroy life in Gaza? And that’s a question that everyone in the country should be asking their MPs regularly and repeatedly until British participation in the genocide ends.",Canary,2025-01-09T10:10:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/corbyn-raf-akrotiri/
Met Police just BLOCKED a pro-Palestine protest from marching outside the BBC,"Today (Wednesday 8 January) the Palestine Coalition have been informed by the Met Police that they intend to go back on a previous agreement and impose conditions to prevent us marching from BBC HQ at Portland Place on Saturday 18 January. We have already announced our intention to assemble outside the BBC to protest against the pro-Israel bias of its coverage – something recently highlighted in a detailed report by journalist Owen Jones to which the Corporation has so far not responded. We utterly condemn this attempt to use repressive powers to prevent our planned protest at the BBC. The route for the march was confirmed with the police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police has now reneged on our agreement and stated its intention to prevent our protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. It is unacceptable for the police to misuse public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that our march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue. It follows representations from pro-Israel groups and activists who have been publicly calling for action to be taken to curtail our right to protest against Israel’s ongoing genocide. This includes the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis who has openly celebrated the horrific and criminal actions of the Israeli military in Gaza, describing them as the “most outstanding possible thing that a decent responsible country can do”. In fact, the closest synagogue to the BBC is not even on the route of the march. Moreover, as the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that our marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that every march has been joined by thousands of Jewish people – many in an organised Jewish bloc – and addressed by Jewish speakers on the demonstration platforms. Representatives of the Jewish bloc have written to the police seeking a meeting to express their concerns that the police are choosing to listen solely to pro-Israel Jewish voices, but they have not had any response. We firmly reject any attempt to suppress our right to campaign for an end to Israel’s genocidal violence and decades long violations of the rights of the Palestinian people. In the past few weeks, Israel has intensified its indiscriminate attacks including against hospitals and civilians sheltering in so-called ‘humanitarian safe zones.’ It is this and the ongoing complicity of the British government in these crimes that continues to bring people onto the streets in huge numbers. Our marches represent a diverse cross section of the public including the Palestinian community, many of whom are relatives of those killed by Israel. We remain in dialogue with the Metropolitan Police but call on them to immediately abandon their intention to prevent our protest at the BBC.  We call on all those who are rightly outraged by Israel’s ongoing genocide and those who uphold the democratic right to protest to join us when we march in London on Saturday 18 January.

Does Britain execute children abroad? Damning new evidence suggests it does.,"The ongoing controversy over RAF Akrotiri‘s participation in Israel’s genocide in Gaza is not the only scandal relating to British armed forces. Because the Afghanistan Inquiry into possible UK Special Forces (UKSF) war crimes has just revealed that SAS officers had a “golden pass allowing them to get away with murder” from 2010 to 2013. This is according to a former senior Special Boat Service (SBS) officer who, along with others, had raised concerns in 2011 about SAS executions and cover-ups. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick faced criticism in 2024 for “casually revealing a UK extra-judicial assassination program designed to evade ECHR jurisdiction”. And there were many official denials. But the revelations from the Afghanistan Inquiry suggest that this type of behaviour may indeed be commonplace. The inquiry’s closed hearings do not allow attendance by members of the public, the media, or the legal teams of bereaved families. As the BBC reports: Senior SBS officers told the inquiry of deep concerns that the SAS, fresh from aggressive, high-tempo operations in Iraq, was being driven by kill counts – the number of dead they could achieve in each operation. A junior officer of the SBS, meanwhile, reported how an SAS member had spoken “about a pillow being put over the head of someone before they were killed with a pistol”. They added that “some of those killed by the SAS had been children” likely younger than 16. In an email, another SBS officer showed concern about what might happen if they didn’t speak out: When the next WikiLeaks occurs then we will be dragged down with them One said that “basically, there appears to be a culture there of ‘shut up, don’t question'”. The low level of accountability for the SAS was apparently “astonishing”. British support for and participation in Israel’s genocide in Gaza has been utterly damning. But the UK seems not to reserve impunity only for its allies’ crimes. Instead, it seems to be how things work with our own forces too.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:53:10+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/sas-murder/
Raffi Berg just 'the tip of the iceberg' when it comes to BBC pro-Israel bias,"Raffi Berg, the online editor for BBC News coverage on the Middle East, has been at the centre of a massive controversy in recent weeks. But a new petition from former Channel 4 editor Tamara Abood insists that “Raffi is the tip of the iceberg”. And she calls for the sacking of people even higher up than Berg over the BBC‘s shameful (and longstanding) pro-Israel bias, specifically during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Public attention focused in on Berg after journalist Owen Jones published an investigation in December about pro-Israel bias at the BBC. Having interviewed journalists and other staff at the public service broadcaster, Jones revealed that “senior figures” had been skewing coverage to be more favourable to Israel while dismissing regular objections from employees who demanded the corporation uphold its supposed commitment to providing fair and impartial reporting. And in particular, Jones highlighted the malign role that Berg played. According to one former BBC journalist: This guy’s entire job is to water down everything that’s too critical of Israel. Others said he “micromanages” coverage, with one insisting that he “has the power to reframe every story”. Even worse are his connections to the CIA, Mossad, and war criminal Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Jewish Voice for Peace explains: Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism, and is the primary ideology that drove the establishment of Israel. It adds that: While it had many strains historically, the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state where Jews have more rights than others. The pro-Israel (or Zionist) lobby in Britain has a massive influence. In the last parliament, it donated money to a quarter of British MPs, and reportedly had significant sway in the government. Half of the initial cabinet of the current Labour government, meanwhile, had received such funds. Abood argues that the same is true in the British media sector. As she said in the petition text: I have first hand experience of the extraordinary and malign influence that Zionist lobby groups exert over programme makers and broadcasters. I have spent the last 15 months watching in disgust as mainstream broadcasters in the UK have framed what is happening in Gaza through the lens of Israeli propagandists. But Berg is just a part of this, she stressed: Raffi is the tip of the iceberg. Scratch the surface of the BBC and you will find it packed to the rafters with Zionists who will quash ideas for programmes that are critical of Israel and who will frame the reporting on Gaza to centre Israeli interests. Abood also insisted: It is my belief as a former lawyer and tv producer that, in time, our mainstream media will be judged to have been complicit in a genocide by providing cover for Israel’s crimes. In fact, as I write, lawyers who specialise in international law and human rights have many of these so-called “journalists” in their sights. And she argued that: BBC license payers are being deliberately mislead about the nature and extent of Israel’s depravity in Gaza. The BBC is breaching its own requirements, and that of Ofcom, for due impartiality. As a license payer, you should be able to trust the BBC as a credible news source. The BBC is no longer credible. It has shown itself to be an outpost of the Israeli Ministry of Misinformation. Overall, her comments were damning. She said “the BBC subverts the truth in order to influence the public’s response in favour of Israel”, and that there has been “a deliberate strategy of lies and omissions by broadcasters like the BBC“. Rather than focusing on Raffi Berg, though, she looks to BBC News CEO Deborah Turness. As she emphasised: Your license fee pays her £400K + salary. Deborah Turness must go For her, licence-fee payers deserve so much better. And we completely agree. That’s why we should all support the petition and demand change.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:19:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/raffi-berg-bbc/
A family GP has been JAILED for attacking... PETROL PUMPS with Just Stop Oil,"A family doctor has been sentenced to one year in prison for taking action with climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil. Dr Patrick Hart took action in August 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. Esso is a subsidiary of the Oil giant Exxon Mobil which infamously concealed the alarming findings of its own scientists, which showed that fossil fuels caused global warming. Exxon subsequently ploughed millions into a disinformation campaign which initially sewed doubt and later confusion around the emerging climate science. In his closing statement at Chelmsford Crown Court during his trial, Hart said: I disrupted people as an act of care. I damaged the petrol pump screens as an act of care, because in times of great peril, a caring person has to stand up for what is right. My actions have already cost me greatly. I have been handed a suspended prison sentence, and thousands of pounds in costs through a civil injunction for this exact same action. I have been penalised at work and stand to be suspended or lose my licence to practise as a doctor. But I regret nothing. Because to not do it, would have been to give up on caring, and that would be worse. In the face of the permanent collapse of our climate, our economy, our society and life on Earth, the only thing that keeps me going is our continued capacity as people to care, regardless of what happens. Yes, I fear prison, but I am ready to go if I must Hart has already faced civil charges for this action and been fined, as the Thurrock Esso petrol station is subject to a private injunction. He will also face a tribunal after being referred for a disciplinary hearing by his professional regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). In the last 12 months, the GMC has suspended two doctors from the medical register following their convictions for non-violent climate protest. As such Hart stands to be penalised three times for the same action. Before sentencing, Hart said: Right now, the greatest health threat to all of us is the unfolding climate catastrophe. It is the greatest health threat we have ever faced. All healthcare workers have a responsibility to protect the health of their patients. If we do not stand up to the oil and gas executives who are wreaking havoc on our climate and the politicians who enable them, if we do not end the burning of fossil fuels, then we will have failed as a profession and the health systems that we have developed over centuries will collapse. I will continue to fight against the death sentence of fossil fuels for as long as I have strength in me. I have no greater duty as a doctor at this moment in history. Today’s sentencing comes after a jury found three Just Stop Oil supporters ‘not guilty’ in June of 2024 for disabling petrol pumps in the same manner as Hart. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

"""Sex for shifts"": capitalist criminals McDonald's at the centre of another workers rights scandal","McDonald’s is confronting renewed allegations of severe abuses of workers rights, with over 100 current and former employees reporting experiences of sexual assault, harassment, racism, homophobia, and bullying. These claims have prompted the UK parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee to summon McDonald’s UK chief executive, Alistair Macrow, for questioning. Meanwhile, the the TUC has hit back at what it calls the corporate giant’s ‘race to the bottom’. The BBC conducted an investigation revealing that employees, some as young as 17, faced inappropriate behavior from colleagues and managers. Reported incidents include sexual assault, sexually explicit remarks, homophobia, and a lack of effective response from management when complaints were raised. One former employee recounted being sexually assaulted by a senior manager, while another described a culture where such behavior was normalised. As the BBC reported, workers’ claims against McDonald’s include: A worker quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023, after she says managers inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she says she was told to “suck it up”. A 16-year-old current employee based in the West Midlands says he was bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers. A female worker, 20, says a male manager sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald’s branch in the East of England in August. Specifically, the BBC noted the case of Claire (not her real name). She told it that: A shift manager asked her for sex in return for extra shifts, which she refused. She was 17, he was in his 30s. “You don’t expect that to happen,” she said. “It was totally inappropriate.” Of course, McDonald’s is notorious for zero-hours contracts. Across its businesses, including franchises, 89% of staff are on these contracts. The BBC noted that: McDonald’s says workers can choose to switch to minimum guaranteed hours. But we have spoken to 50 workers across the country who say they were not given that choice. In response to these allegations, McDonald’s stated that it does not tolerate harassment, abuse, or discrimination and is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace. The company highlighted its implementation of new policies and training programs aimed at preventing such behavior. However, the persistence of these issues suggests that existing measures may be insufficient. This is not the first time McDonald’s has faced scrutiny over workplace practices. In 2021, the company introduced anti-harassment training following at least 50 employee-filed charges concerning workplace harassment over five years. The Environmental Audit Committee’s involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation. The committee is expected to examine McDonald’s corporate governance and the effectiveness of its policies in safeguarding employee welfare. This inquiry forms part of a broader evaluation of labor practices within large corporations operating in the UK. The outcome of this inquiry could have significant implications for McDonald’s operations and reputation in the UK. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said: No-one should ever find themselves in the position of being asked to exchange sex for shifts. It’s abhorrent – the McDonalds CEO has serious questions to answer. This investigation has exposed how sexual harassment and insecure work can go hand in hand. Zero-hours contracts create a huge imbalance of power in the workplace that leaves workers vulnerable to predatory bosses. If staff say no to their manager they face losing all of their work. This is why cracking down on exploitative working practices like zero-hours contracts and giving people stronger protections at work is so important. McDonald’s is one of the largest employers in the UK. It should be setting the standard on workforce conditions – not leading a race to the bottom. The problem is – McDonald’s is the epitome of the corporate capitalist race to the bottom. It’s a business where the planet, biodiversity, human rights, and the rights of its workers are all far-less important than its profit margins. The fact that the BBC has uncovered yet another scandal is not a surprise. It is parasitic McDonald’s operating as it is supposed to.",Canary,2025-01-07T11:30:55+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/07/mcdonalds-staff-abuse/
Trump Makes Triumphant Crowd Entrance at Inaugural Eve MAGA Rally,"President-elect Donald Trump made a triumphant entrance through the crowd at his Make America Great Again rally less than 24 hours before he is once again sworn in as president. Lee Greenwood delivered a live rendition of his iconic song, “God Bless the USA,” as Trump emerged from the crowd dozens of rows above the floor of the Capital One Arena, less than a mile from the White House. “I’m thrilled to be back with so many friends, supporters, and true American patriots on the eve of taking back our country; that’s what we’re going to do: take back our country,” Trump told supporters. “Tomorrow, at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride, bringing it all back,” Trump added, to cheers. He then pledged to dismantle the D.C. political establishment: Once and for all, we’re going to end the reign of a failed and corrupt political establishment in Washington, a failed administration. We’re not going to take it anymore. We’re going to stop the invasion of our borders. We’re going to reclaim our wealth. We’re going to unlock the liquid gold that’s right under our feet… We’re going to bring back law and order to our cities.

Supporters Gather for Trump's Inauguration Eve 'Victory Rally',"WASHINGTON, DC — Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump gathered from across the country on Sunday to attend the 45th and soon-to-be 47th president’s Inauguration Eve “victory rally” at Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, braving cold weather and long lines. Brenda Mantooth, 84, of Missouri, told Breitbart News that she is looking forward “to seeing this country brought back up — not only to where it was morally, spiritually, innovatively — but go beyond that.” Sending a message to Trump, Mantooth added, “Stay true to yourself, you listen and let the lord guide you.” “I’m looking for Trump to bring morale up,” Terrence Fowler of Georgia said. “I spoke to a lot of people about the morale of the country. It’s been down for four years. It’s definitely time for us to get our morale up.” Trump is “bringing structure back to the country, and that’s what I’m excited about,” Fowler continued, adding that he is looking forward to seeing the soon-to-be 47th president address the “border crisis, housing market,” and getting “our economy back up and going.” “It’s exciting to see,” Fowler said. “I’m expecting a lot of great things. A lot of his appointments with the cabinet have been great. The two most important ones [being] Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr.” Chuck Boggs of Tennessee told Breitbart News his top concern is immigration, which he is looking forward to seeing Trump address in his upcoming second presidential term. “Secure the borders and get rid of inflation,” Mary Macionski of Michigan said of the changes she would like to see.

Biden Grants Posthumous Pardon to Black Nationalist Marcus Garvey,"In his final full day in office, President Joe Biden has given a posthumous pardon to black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Referring to the pan-Africanist and racial separatist as a “renowned civil rights and human rights leader,” Biden said his 1923 conviction and subsequent five-year sentence was an “injustice.” Born in 1887 in Saint Ann’s Bay, Jamaica, Garvey moved to the U.S. in 1916 before forming the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which aimed to “establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa.” In 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud after advertising the sale of stocks in a boat for his shipping company, Black Star Line, which the business did not yet own. After being found guilty and sentenced to serve five years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey’s sentence in 1927, and deported him back to Jamaica. Biden’s Sunday statement from the White House on Garvey’s posthumous pardon is as follows: Marcus Mosiah Garvey (1887-1940) was a renowned civil rights and human rights leader who was convicted of mail fraud in 1923, and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927. Notably, Mr. Garvey created the Black Star Line, the first Black-owned shipping line and method of international travel, and founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which celebrated African history and culture. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. described Mr. Garvey as “the first man of color in the history of the United States to lead and develop a mass movement.” Advocates and lawmakers praise his global advocacy and impact, and highlight the injustice underlying his criminal conviction. The outgoing president has set a new record for giving out the most individual pardons and commutations, announcing on Friday that he was commuting sentences for almost 2,500 nonviolent drug offenders. Biden also notably pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing a 17-year sentence after being convicted of tax and gun charges.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:42:57+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/law-and-order/2025/01/19/biden-grants-posthumous-pardon-to-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey/
Trump to Swear In with Personal Bible and Lincoln Bible During Inauguration,"President-elect Donald Trump will swear into office with two Bibles — one given to him by his mother, and one that President Abraham Lincoln used in his own inaugural ceremony in 1861. The incoming president’s personal Bible was gifted to him by his mother in 1955 to “mark his Sunday Church Primary School graduation at First Presbyterian Church, in Jamaica, New York,” a press release from Trump’s inaugural committee obtained by Fox News states . Trump’s Bible is a 1953 revised standard version, the outlet reported. He will also be sworn in with the historic Lincoln Bible, which was used by former President Barack Obama at both of his inaugurations and Trump at his first inauguration. “It has only been used three times since, by President Obama at each of his inaugurations and by President Trump at his first inauguration in 2017,” the Trump inaugural committee stated. “The burgundy velvet-bound book is part of the collections of the Library of Congress.”",Breitbart,2025-01-19T23:23:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/trump-swear-in-with-personal-bible-and-lincoln-bible-during-inauguration/
Poll: Most Americans One-Word Summary of Biden's Legacy Is 'Nothing',"Americans who participated in a recent poll appear to view President Joe Biden’s (D) time in the White House as a big nothingburger. A poll conducted for the Daily Mail by J.L. Partners with some 1,009 registered voters asked how they would describe 82-year-old Biden’s time in office, the Mail reported Sunday: When the results are arranged in a word cloud, the most common answer sticks out at the center. The next most popular answers are economy, inflation, and infrastructure, in a more encouraging nod to one of his landmark pieces of legislation. Yet the same word, ‘nothing’ stands out when the responses are split by political persuasion. … When voters were asked whether they can remember a single Biden achievement, more than half say they cannot. Some 37 percent say they ‘strongly’ agree with the statement that they cannot name a single one. Social media users were quick to share their thoughts on the Mail ‘s report, one person writing , “Worst President Ever. Good riddance.” “Destroying the economy and enriching his family off of the American taxpayers,” someone else commented , while another user replied ,”Hes wrecked our country and gotten dirty rich while doing it.” Meanwhile, a recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that “border and immigration handling” was named as Biden’s biggest failure, per Breitbart News. “The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels ‘like a morgue’ and ‘glum’ as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in,” the article said. It is also important to note that Americas have been suffering under the grip of inflation during the Biden-Harris presidency. “U.S. consumer prices climbed at a faster rate in December, capping off the inflation-plagued Biden administration’s final year and suggesting that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to bring down inflation may have run out of steam,” Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. In addition, Biden’s health and ability to serve has also been questioned. In December, CBS News reporter Jan Crawford claimed that Biden’s “obvious cognitive decline” was the most underreported story in 2024, per Breitbart News.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:51:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-one-word-summary-president-joe-bidens-legacy-nothing/
Exclusive: Sen. Tim Scott Highlights 'American Renewal' Under Trump,"Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) released a video highlighting how the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump signifies the “American Renewal.” In the video , Scott speaks about how it is “time for an American Renewal” of the United States’ security, economy, education, and “national spirit.” Scott adds that only Trump could make the vision of American renewal a reality, and that the “Great American Renewal starts today.” “What is victory? When you defy the odds and get back up. When you show the world the strength of America,” Scott says in his video. “When your resilience sends a message. A message so powerful — it roars. It is time for an American Renewal. Renewal of our security, economy, energy, education, and our national spirit”: “We’re not just the Grand Old Party of the past,” Scott added. “We’re the Great Opportunity Party of America’s future. There’s only one person who can make that vision a reality, Donald Trump. The Great American Renewal starts today.” The video from Scott comes a day before Trump is set to be inaugurated. As Breitbart News previously reported , Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors and will be held in the Capitol rotunda “due to forecasted freezing temperatures.” A recent CBS News poll , conducted January 15-17, found that 60 percent of Americans were optimistic about the next four years under Trump while 40 percent were pessimistic. When asked about how things were in the U.S. today, six percent said “very well,” 29 percent said things were “somewhat well,” 39 percent said things were going “somewhat badly,” and 26 percent said things were going “very badly.” Roughly 2,174 adults in America were surveyed in the poll.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T22:22:51+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/exclusive-tim-scott-releases-video-highlighting-american-renewal-ahead-trump-inauguration/
TikTok Restores Services After Trump Says He Will Delay Ban,"TikTok restored services in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump clarified that he would issue an executive order delaying a ban on the app. In a post on X, TikTok issued a statement revealing that “in agreement” with their service providers, they were “in the process of restoring service.” “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,” TikTok said. “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.” “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship,” TikTok continued. “We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” The statement from TikTok comes after Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he was calling for companies to not allow TikTok to remain dark. Trump also clarified that his executive order would “confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark” before the order. “I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” Trump said. “The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.” Trump added that he “would like the United States” to have a 50 percent “ownership position in a joint venture,” explaining that, by doing so, “we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to” remain up. “Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok,” Trump added. “With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars — maybe trillions.” On Saturday evening, American users on TikTok were greeted with a message informing them that TikTok was unavailable in the United States, due to a “law banning TikTok” being enacted. As Breitbart News has previously reported , in December, the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C.

"Jon Voight, Matt Boyle, James O'Keefe Tribute Andrew Breitbart","WASHINGTON, DC – Award recipients, ranging from actor Jon Voight to Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle, praised Andrew Breitbart during the Patriot Awards on Saturday, underscoring the immeasurable scope of his legacy. After winning one of just a handful of Patriot Awards, which recognize individual contributions to the MAGA movement, Voight gave a nod to Breitbart in his remarks. He recalled meeting Breitbart at a small gathering of conservatives in Hollywood years ago. WATCH — Actor Jon Voight Remembers Andrew Breitbart at Patriot Awards: “I Loved Him”: “I saw Andrew Breitbart, and I’m sitting there next to Gary Sinise and I’m saying, ‘Gary, this guy’s got it. He’s amazing,'” Voight recalled. Voight reminisced about his conversation with Breitbart after the event. “I said, ‘Andrew, you’re a special guy.’ I said, you know, ‘What are you going to do with that energy?’ And I was saying to him that, you know, ‘I say a few things, I’m not as open as some people, but I say a few things — I’m not afraid to get in the game a little bit,'” Voight recalled. “And he said to me, ‘Jon, I can’t wait. I can’t wait to get into their faces.'” “I said, ‘Oh, this guy’s dangerous,'” he added, drawing laughs. “And then I saw what he did with that energy. He did confront everything. He said these most wonderful things.” As one Voight pointed to Breitbart’s famous standoff with Occupy protesters, telling them to “behave” themselves and to “stop raping people!” “He got up in front of them, and they would shout him down and try to shout him down, and the press was there, right? So he knew what to do with the press,” Voight said. “He stood up and stood in front of these people, he went right to them, and he said, ‘Stop raping! Stop raping!’ He said it like 15 times, and that was it. That was the way the message got across to people that these people were perverse people, you see, bad people, criminals.” “And anyway, he had this great imagination, and I loved him, and I spoke to him the day before he passed,” Voight added. “And he was he was attacked, you know, just like in the way our president was attacked, Rudy Giuliani was attacked, and all that, but he stood up. He was so beautiful, such a beautiful person.” Boyle also paid homage to Breitbart after being presented with his award. “Andrew Breitbart always used to talk about how culture is upstream from politics and you have to win the culture war. Well, let me make it clear: the Presidential Inaugural Committee just announced that Nelly is performing at one of the inaugural balls on Monday night. Last night, we had Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Soulja Boy performing — not my cup of tea, but whatever. The point is — Rascal Flatts are performing at another one, Carrie Underwood is singing at the inauguration — we’ve won the culture war, guys,” Boyle said, to applause. “I will say, Andrew Breitbart would be so proud of where we are as a movement today; he was a really good friend of mine, and we have a very, very bright future ahead of us,” he said to close out his remarks. “So here in the heart of the establishment media’s power, if you will, in Washington, DC, at the National Press Club, we declare: The establishment media, you are dead, and we’re going to win this thing.” James O’Keefe, founder of O’Keefe Media Group, also honored Breitbart when he accepted his Patriot Award. “So I’ll keep this pretty short, but you know I appreciate this honor and Andrew Breitbart, there’s so much to say, but way back when, because I’ve been doing this since I was in college, he used to say ‘We are the media now’ right? ‘ We are the media,’” O’Keefe said after noting OMG broke a story last week leading to the firing of a Pentagon official. “This week, you know, in an extraordinary series of events, the Pentagon fired this guy for, you know, he’s an adviser to the Joint Chiefs; he’s in meetings inside the Situation Room inside the Pentagon, and in an extraordinary series of events, not one single member of the DC press corps reported on it,” O’Keefe added. “So I think Andrew used to say this in so many words, but it’s not that the legacy media is just merely not reporting news– n ow they’re in the news suppression business. And stop complaining about the media. Understand that now you, me, we are the media.” The tributes come as the 13th anniversary of Breitbart’s passing, March 1, 2025, approaches. The Patriot Awards, which are 18-inch bronze statues of Trump, resemble a larger-than-life two-story bronze statue of Trump, which Breitbart News first reported of in November as it neared completion. “PATRIOT Founder Ashley Sansalone was responsible for the idea to create the statue and manages the construction and logistics of the project,” event host Dustin Stockton told Breitbart News. “Without Ash, none of this could have happened.” Stockton is a former Breitbart News reporter.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T21:20:12+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/jon-voight-matt-boyle-james-okeefe-tribute-andrew-breitbart-patriot-awards/
Poll: Most Americans Have Poor View of President Biden's Time in Office,"Citizens are not looking favorably on President Joe Biden’s (D) time in office as President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration approaches. According to CBS News polling, “When Americans look back now on Biden’s presidency, 37% approve of the job he has done over the last four years. That is just below any approval mark he received while in office,” the outlet reported Sunday. When Biden took office four years ago, most Americans felt optimistic about the job he would do. However, following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that left many service members dead, his approval rating took a dive and continued to drop as Americans suffered in the grip of inflation, and “it never recovered,” the article stated. Social media users shared their thoughts on the CBS News report, one person writing , “And you did everything possible to cover for him. You’re a joke.” “Over the past four years you told us he was fit for office, reducing our debt, and bringing illegal workers across the border to help America. You have earn ‘old media’ tag which you will never shed. What you paid to play has earned you a walk in the media shadows,” another user commented . Meanwhile, some members of the Democrat party are distancing themselves from claims that Biden was fit to serve, Breitbart News reported January 7. “After Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July following a poor debate performance, Democrats claimed he was fit to serve,” the outlet said. “Now two weeks before Biden leaves office, a handful of Democrats are starting to trash the president and warn of accountability.” A recent survey from the Economist /YouGov found that “border and immigration handling” were named as Biden’s biggest failure as president, per Breitbart News. The news of Biden’s decline in favorability comes as Trump prepares for his inauguration on Monday in Washington, DC, AFP reported Saturday. Per the CBS News report, “This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,174 U.S. adults interviewed between January 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is ±2.5 points.”",Breitbart,2025-01-19T20:49:40+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/poll-most-americans-have-negative-view-outgoing-president-joe-bidens-time-office/
"Actor, CNN Show Host Michael Ian Black Wants to 'Fu**ing Impeach' Trump Before He's Sworn In","Well, that didn’t take long. Donald Trump has yet to take the oath of office at his second inauguration and Hollywood celebrities are already clamoring to run him out of office. Trump surprised fans and foes alike over the weekend when he announced the release of $TRUMP, his very own cryptocurrency. The meme coin’s value is already surging as a feverish flood of buying sent its market capitalization through the roof on Saturday to several billion dollars. That’s good news right? Not if you ask left-wing comedian Michael Ian Black. “Fucking impeach him,” Black wrote in a Bluesky screed. Fucking impeach him. [image or embed] — Michael Ian Black ( @michaelianblack.bsky.social ) January 18, 2025 at 3:21 PM If you didn’t already know, Black wasn’t rooting for Trump during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, he was among the few people who thought Kamala Harris “kick Trump’s withered old ass” during their one and only debate. Black, a co-captain on the CNN quiz show Have I Got News for You , was last seen on these pages embarrassing himself on the aforementioned CNN program for making false claims about a diplomatic success story Trump explained during the aforementioned debate. Black spent Trump’s first term in office obsessing over nearly ever thing the president-elect did or said. He wrote an anti-Trump children’s book and even advised reporters tell Trump to “fuck off.” Black is already reeling again, so we can probably expect more of the same sad shrieks.

"Michael Rapaport Celebrates the Demise of 'Dirty, Biased, Damn Near Soft Porn Dumphole' TikTok","Actor and comedian Michael Rapaport celebrated the shuttering of Chinese-owned social media outlet TikTok, which went dark on Sunday in the wake of a ban put in place by an act of Congress. TikTok went dark on Sunday in compliance with the ban put in place by Congress and upheld on Friday by the U.S. Supreme court. Consequently, the site told users that it was shutting down in compliance on Sunday but also noted they were hoping to work with Donald Trump to resolve the issue. For Rapaport, TikTok’s seeming demise was all good news. The Prison Break actor jumped to his account to celebrate TikTok’s closure on Sunday, and called the Chinese-affiliated site a “dumphole.” “Say what you want about Elon & Zuckerberg at least we know where to find them,” he said in his caption. “TikTok, au revoir,” he said emphatically in his video. “You did it to yourself, TikTokers,” he added. “You can say what you want about Elon Musk, you can say what you want about [Mark] Zuckerberg,” he continued, “at least we have a face,” he said of X and Facebook’s owners. “At least we have people to complain to, we can tweet at them, we can DM them, we can put our face on wax and scream and yell at them, we don’t know who the fuck has been running this platform [TikTok]. This platform is dirty. This platform is biased. It’s damn near soft porn on here.” “I’ve seen some crazy shit on TikTok. You did it to yourselves, TikTok, you did it to yourself TikTokers!” he exclaimed. “Say what you want about Facebook, Instagram, X, Whatsapp, Snapchat, at least we know who’s running the joint,” he explained. “We don’t know what the fuck and who the fuck is doing what at TikTok. And the vile, antisemitic, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, soft porn, tits and ass, every fucking five seconds the weirdos, the creeps, the creep cock-suckers — bye bye TikTok, you did it to yourself, if this is signing off, farewell. You know where to find me, I’m on Instagram and X and Facebook.” “See ya later assholes,” he concluded with a beaming grin. Rapaport’s glee may have been a bit premature, though, because only hours after shutting down, TikTok began restorting service after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push out an executive order in the social media outlet’s favor after he is inaugurated.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T19:27:05+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/19/michael-rapaport-celebrates-the-demise-of-dirty-biased-damn-near-soft-porn-dumphole-tiktok/
German Ambassador Warns Trump Will Undermine 'Constitutional Order',"Germany’s ambassador to the United States reportedly warned that Donald Trump’s incoming administration will undermine “basic democratic principles” and seek a “redefinition of the constitutional order.” While European leaders have been relatively muted in their response to the re-election of Donald Trump, particularly compared to the hysterical reaction to his victory in 2016, the panic has apparently merely been confined to backrooms rather than in public. According to Reuters, a confidential document briefing Berlin on the incoming administration signed by Ambassador to the U.S. Andreas Michaelis warned that the incoming administration would seek “maximum disruption” and usher in “a redefinition of the constitutional order – maximum concentration of power with the president at the expense of Congress and the federal states.” “Basic democratic principles and checks and balances will be largely undermined, the legislature, law enforcement and media will be robbed of their independence and misused as a political arm, Big Tech will be given co-governing power,” the document reportedly added. The ambassador went on to warn that Trump would seek to weaponize the Department of Justice and the FBI against his political enemies and to help facilitate mass deportations. Michaelis suggested that the new administration could go so far as to launch a “military deployment within the country for police activities would be possible in the event of declared ‘insurrection’ and ‘invasion’.” Additionally, the German ambassador pointed to the supposed danger of Trump’s alliance with X owner Elon Musk, who has become a nemesis of the political establishment in Berlin for backing the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in the February elections. According to Michaelis, Trump and Musk may seek to enact a “redefinition of the First Amendment,” claiming that they intend to punish non-friendly media outlets. “One is using lawsuits, threatening criminal prosecution and licence revocation, the other is having algorithms manipulated and accounts blocked,” he claimed. It comes as the German Defence Ministry announced this week that it would no longer actively post on X, complaining that “the factual exchange of arguments is becoming increasingly difficult.” Berlin’s Foreign Ministry refused to verify or comment on the leaked document but affirmed that it still considers the United States to be a key ally of Germany. “The Americans chose President Trump in a democratic election. Of course, we will also work closely with the new U.S. administration in the interests of Germany and Europe,” the ministry said . The opinion of the German ambassador may not matter for much longer anyway, with the leftist coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsing the day after Trump’s victory, the governing Social Democrats look set to be removed from office following the February federal elections in Germany.

Dave Chappelle Wishes Trump the Best in ‘SNL’ Monologue: 'The Whole World Is Counting on You',"Dave Chappelle returned to the Saturday Night Live stage clad in a sharp suit, smoking a cigarette, and armed with an array of searing jokes touching on the presidential election, the Los Angeles wildfires, Sean Diddy Combs, and President-elect Donald Trump, whom the veteran comedian wished for success in his second term. “The presidency is no place for petty people. So, Donald Trump, I know you watch the show. Remember, whether people voted for you or not, they’re all counting on you,” Chappelle said, after jokingly saying he knows Mr. Trump watches the show. “Whether they like you or not, they’re all counting on you. The whole world is counting on you.” “I mean this when I say this: Good luck. Please, do better next time. Please, all of us, do better next time,” Chappelle continued. “Do not forget your humanity. And please, have empathy for displaced people, whether they’re in the Palisades or Palestine.” Those were the last lines of his nearly 20-minute monologue. Chappelle started his act by explaining how he initially told SNL creator Lorne Michaels he didn’t want to host the first episode after the election, as he did in 2016 and in 2020. After repeatedly telling Michaels no, Chappelle said he had an epiphany: “You know what? I could just get rid of all these old Trump jokes. I’ll do it!” he said, adding “The moment I said yes, L.A. burst into flames!” Chappelle, who lives in Ohio, one town over from Springfield (more on that later), noted how the deadly L.A. fires broke his heart. He also realized how the negative comments online lambasting the many celebrities who lost their homes reminded him why he hates poor people: “Because they can’t see past their own pain.” “The other day on the news, they said these fires were the most expensive tragedy that ever happened in the United States’ history. I think that’s because people in L.A. have nice stuff. I could burn 40,000 acres in Mississippi for like six or seven dollars,” Chappelle joked. “If you were a rational, thinking person, you’d have to at least consider the possibility that God hates these people.” Chappelle later turned his attention to Trump and his comments about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, last year. “Trump’s a wild guy. He said the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people’s dogs and cats. I live one town over from Springfield. That’s not what happened in Springfield at all,” Chappelle said. He said he wanted to show his support to the Haitian immigrants to let them know they were welcome. “Every day I’d drive over to Springfield and eat lunch at the Haitian restaurant,” Chappelle said, pausing, “And to be honest with you, I don’t know what that meat was. But whatever it was, it fell right off the bone.” Chappelle said he realized in the worst way why he didn’t know about Diddy’s “Freak Off” orgy parties. “Oh my god, I’m ugly! That’s a tough way to find out,” he joked. “Can you imagine if you were me reading the newspaper finding out: everyone in Hollywood had an orgy behind your back?” Jerome Hudson is Breitbart News Entertainment Editor and author of the book 50 Things They Don’t Want You to Know About Trump.

Google Defies EU's 'Fact-Checking' Requirements for Search and YouTube,"Google has informed the European Union that it will not integrate work from “fact-checking” organizations into its Search and YouTube platforms, as the EU prepares to expand its disinformation laws. The Verge reports that Google has notified the European Union that it will not comply with the bloc’s upcoming requirements to integrate “fact checking” into its Search and YouTube services. The tech giant’s decision comes as the EU is in the process of formalizing its voluntary disinformation commitments into law under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Google had previously signed the EU’s set of voluntary commitments in 2022, which aimed to reduce the impact of online disinformation. However, in a letter addressed to the European Commission’s content and technology czar Renate Nikolay, Google’s global affairs president Kent Walker stated that the fact-checking requirement “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our services.” Furthermore, Google plans to withdraw from all fact-checking commitments in the Code before the rules become law in the DSA Code of Conduct. The EU’s Code of Practice on Disinformation currently requires signatories to collaborate with fact-checkers in all EU countries, make their work accessible to users in all EU languages, and reduce financial incentives for spreading disinformation on their platforms. The code also mandates companies to simplify the process for users to recognize, understand, and flag disinformation, as well as label political ads and analyze fake accounts, bots, and malicious deep fakes that spread disinformation. However, these commitments are not legally binding at present. Google’s objection to the fact-checking requirements is not entirely unexpected, as the company has not included fact-checking as part of its content moderation practices thus far. In its agreement with the EU, Google had stated that “Search and YouTube will endeavor to reach agreements with fact checking organizations in line with this measure, but services will not have complete control over this process.” While 40 online platforms have signed the code, including Microsoft, TikTok, Twitch, and Meta, the level of commitment to fulfilling the requirements has been inconsistent. Twitter (now X) initially signed the code but withdrew after Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform. The European Fact-Checking Standards Network has also noted that many of the other digital platforms that signed the voluntary disinformation code have been lax in fulfilling their commitments. The EU is currently in discussions with signatories to determine which commitments will be formalized into official rules under the DSA. It remains unclear whether all of the code’s requirements will be included in the final legislation. The European Commission has yet to announce when the code will officially become law, having previously stated that it is expected to come into force by January 2025 “at the earliest.” Read more at the Verge here.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T15:48:17+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/google-defies-eus-fact-checking-requirements-for-search-and-youtube/
Six People Shot in Six Hours in Brandon Johnson's Chicago,"Six people were shot during an approximate six-hour time-frame Saturday night into Sunday morning in Mayor Brandon Johnson’s (D) Chicago. Chicago 32 reported the first two shooting victims were shot and wounded at 9:39 p.m. Saturday and the sixth victim was shot at 3:46 a.m. Sunday. The first two victims–men who are both 37-years-old–were sitting in a vehicle “in the 5800 block of West Madison Street”–when someone opened fire on them then fled the scene. Both men were wounded with non-life-threatening wounds. Just before midnight Saturday, a 25-year-old woman and a man were traveling in a vehicle “in the 2800 block of North Laramie Avenue” when gunshots rang out. Both were shot and wounded, but the injuries are not life-threatening. Roughly two hours later, a 19-year-old was shot and left in serious condition following a verbal altercation with another individual. The altercation occurred in a parking garage “in the 3100 block of North Central Avenue.” At 3:46 a.m. Sunday, a 41-year-old man was also shot following an altercation. He was hospitalized in fair condition.

NYT: L.A. Firefighters Took 20 Minutes to Respond to Palisades Fire,"Firefighters took 20 minutes to respond to the Palisades Fire on January 7, according to the New York Times , confirming what sources have told Breitbart News over the past two weeks about the city’s poor reaction. Breitbart News learned from local neighbors that while there was a fire engine near the origin of the fire, due to a traffic accident, it took 20-25 minutes for a helicopter to arrive at the top of the mountain ridge above Pacific Palisades where the fire began, and 44 minutes for a full response by the Los Angeles Fire Department. Firefighters have told Breitbart News that they did not pre-deploy ahead of the fire, despite warnings of extreme winds, due to budget cuts by Mayor Karen Bass and the city council that discouraged the use of overtime pay for pre-deployment. The Times reported Saturday: The [ Times ‘] review showed a series of planning failures, delayed evacuations and significant shortfalls in firefighting resources that together hampered efforts to limit the spread. Fire dispatch transmissions suggest that firefighters did not arrive on scene until about 20 minutes after the first 911 call in Pacific Palisades, a possible missed chance to stamp out the blaze while it was still small, the review showed. Residents are still piecing together evidence about how the fire started. Many believe that it was caused by re-ignition of a burn scar from a fire caused by fireworks set off by hikers on New Year’s Eve, though arson is also a possibility.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:26:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/19/nyt-l-a-firefighters-took-20-minutes-to-respond-to-palisades-fire/
Millionaires Flee UK in Record Numbers Since Left-Wing Labour's Election Win,"British millionaires are fleeing the country in record numbers since Sir Keir Starmer’s left-wing Labour Party claimed last year’s election win and set out in socialist fashion to try and tax the country into prosperity. Turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses has raised further concerns about Labour’s punitive tax plans while moves to remove the non-domiciled tax regime that allows people to keep non-UK income in a foreign country, in exchange for a fee, is also being blamed. LBC reports some 10,800 people with liquid assets of over $1 million left the country in 2024, an increase of over 150 percent on 2023, in a move predicted not long after Starmer moved into Number 10 Downing Street. A total of 78 centi-millionaires (people with $100 million or more) and 12 billionaires departed the UK last year, according to New World Wealth, a research firm. The news, coming on the back of recent turmoil in bond markets and warnings from businesses, has raised further concerns about Labour’s push to punish the rich will also hitting farmers, old age pensioners, and everyday taxpayers with a host of penalties. Millionaires are mostly moving to other European countries such as Switzerland and Italy,  as well as to places such as the United Arab Emirates. Labour are getting rid of the non-dom regime from April, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves said would raise nearly £13 billion over five years. Over 70,000 people with non-dom status lived in the UK in 2023. An intense lobbying campaign from wealth advisors and representatives for non-dom’s ensued in the run-up to the Autumn Budget, where the policy was announced. Experts warned it would lead to a “tidal wave” of departures. David Hawkins, of Foreign Investors for Britain, a group representing non-doms explained the Government’s policy is “a monumental act of national self-harm”. He said : “It appears that decisions have been made not based on the evidence but based on ideology. It’s a real worry because more and more people are leaving. And it’s businesses, jobs, investment, spending into the economy and tax take and philanthropy that are hit.” Follow Simon Kent on Twitter: Follow @SunSimonKent or e-mail to: skent@breitbart.com",Breitbart,2025-01-19T14:17:50+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/19/millionaires-flee-uk-in-record-numbers-since-left-wing-labours-election-win/
London Mayor Khan Warns of 'Resurgent Fascism' with Trump's Return,"Far-left London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that the “spectre of a resurgent fascism” threatens the West with the rise of populists in Europe, tech giants rolling back censorship, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House. The leftist Labour Party politician, writing for the Observer , the sister paper of the Guardian , likened the growing rejection of neo-liberal globalist policies in Europe and America to the rise of fascism in the “1920s and 1930s”. “The far right is on the march,” Mayor Khan exclaimed. “From Switzerland and Sweden to Hungary, Austria and Italy, European nations are coming under the influence of extreme nativist parties that are hostile to democratic institutions, immigrant populations and fact-based journalism.” “In Germany, the AfD is on course for a breakthrough in next month’s federal elections. In France, the National Rally is topping presidential polls. And, of course, in the US, Donald Trump is back,” he lamented. The far-left mayor said that the rise of populist parties is “deeply worrying… especially if you’re a member of a minority community.” “We should be in no doubt, this is a perilous moment. The spectre of a resurgent fascism haunts the West,” Khan declared. Khan went on to argue that the global left must do more “to inoculate our societies against the virus of far-right populism. History shows us the time to act is now.” A major area of concern cited by the London mayor is social media, which he claimed is “fuelling racist populism and polarisation.” Khan pointed to X owner and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk, whom he accused of using his social media platform as a “propaganda tool to amplify lies and advance the cause of the far right.” He also lamented the decision by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to remove its so-called fact-checking apparatus in favour of an X-style community notes system, which he claimed was an act of bending the knee to the incoming Trump administration. Khan, who has long advocated using state power to crack down on speech, suggested that countries like the UK should use legislation such as the Online Safety Act to counteract the popularity of populist messages on social media. This act empowers the government to impose hefty fines of up to ten per cent of a large internet firm’s global revenue if it fails to police so-called “harmful content.” The London mayor has been a vocal critic of Trump, demanding in 2017, for example, that the then-president should be barred from having a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II over his supposed use of “ xenophobia, racism, and ‘otherness’ as an electoral tactic ”. Not one to take such accusations lightly, Trump branded Khan a “ stone-cold loser ” for failing to tackle knife crime and terrorism in London.

Failure to Record Ethnicity of Criminals Soars Among British Police Forces,"British police forces have been accused of being afraid of getting called racist as the recording of criminal ethnicity fell to the lowest rate in at least 15 years. According to Ministry of Justice data unearthed in Freedom of Information requests by former Tory minister Neil O’Brien, the percentage of instances in which British police failed to log the ethnicity of child sex offenders stood at 28.7 per cent last year, up from 11.6 per cent in 2010. For sex crimes as a whole, police failed to record the ethnicity of 29 per cent of perpetrators, up from 15 per cent, The Telegraph reported . Similarly, police failed to record the ethnicity of those convicted of murder, rape, and assault resulting in grievous bodily harm in over one in three instances (34.4 per cent) last year, compared to 11.8 per cent in 2010. The trend of listing the ethnicity of criminals as “unknown” was also seen in lower-level crimes, including 44 per cent of robberies last year, up from 14 per cent, and 30.2 per cent for shoplifting, compared to seven per cent in 2010. The MoJ figures showed the most significant increase in drug offences, from an eight per cent failure to record ethnic data in 2010 to 39 per cent in 2024. The failures come despite years of warnings that police forces throughout England had overlooked the scourge of child rape grooming gangs, in which mostly Muslim Pakistani-heritage men sexually preyed upon and trafficked young white girls for fear of appearing racist or stoking ethnic divides. Last week, a national police task force revealed that Pakistanis are up to four times more likely to commit child sexual grooming crimes than the general population. However, even the task force admitted that their figures were “limited” as police forces in England and Wales had only recorded the ethnicities of around a third of suspects. Commenting on the revelations, former Conservative government minister Neil O’Brien surmised that political correctness was to blame for the increasing instances of police not recording the ethnicities of offenders. “It has to be wariness on the part of the authorities about recording and fear of being called racist,” the Harborough, Oadby and Wigston MP said. “We don’t see a big rise in refusal to declare in other services, and the rise across the country is completely inconsistent.” Robert Jenrick, the Conservatives’ shadow justice secretary, demanded that the government provide Parliament with an annual report documenting every convicted offender’s ethnicity, nationality, visa, and asylum status. “The reduction in published data on the ethnicity of convicted criminals, in sharp contrast to data on age or sex, will only fuel perceptions that the British state is covering up the costs of migration,” Jenrick said. “We urgently need all the data so that, for the first time, we can see the actual impact of different types of migration.” While establishment governments of both Labour and the Tories have refused to publish data relating to the criminality of migrant groups in Britain, an analysis conducted last year by The Telegraph found that foreigners were over a quarter more likely to be imprisoned than the native population. The report also found wide disparities among different foreign nationalities, with Albanians being by far the most likely to be imprisoned, at a rate of one in 50, followed by migrants from Kosovo, Vietnam, Algeria, Jamaica, Eritrea, Iraq, and Somalia. On the other hand, Germans were the least likely, followed by Italians, Greeks, Americans, Sri Lankans, French, and Chinese. The findings led to calls for the government to curtail migration from countries which produced higher numbers of migrant criminals.

TikTok Goes Dark for Americans Hours Before Ban Takes Place,"American TikTok users were faced with a message that the app was unavailable Sunday and they would not be able to use it, hours before a ban was set to take effect. “Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” a message pops up on the social media app when users in the United States open the app. The message further explains that due to a “law banning TikTok” being enacted in the U.S., Americans are unable to use the app. However, the message continues to praise President-elect Donald Trump for having “indicated that he will work” with TikTok to find “a solution to reinstate TikTok.” “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,” the message on TikTok reads. “Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” TikTok going dark comes after the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the “sell-or-ban legislation” on the app. Trump has previously expressed that he has a “warm spot” in his heart for TikTok, citing how he “won youth by 34 points” in the presidential election. Trump has also indicated that “TikTok had an impact” on him winning the election and stated his administration would look into it. As Breitbart News’s Alana Mastrangelo previously reported , in December a federal appeals court upheld that required ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok to sell the app or face a possible ban in the U.S. During a recent interview with NBC News, Trump revealed that he would “most likely” give TikTok a “90-day extension” to avoid a ban.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T08:51:31+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2025/01/19/tiktok-goes-dark-for-americans-hours-before-ban-takes-place/
Youngkin Orders Flags to Be Flown at Full-Staff for Trump's Inauguration,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) ordered the flags in the state to be flown at full-staff for President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday. In a statement issued on Saturday, Youngkin ordered the American flag and the flag of the Commonwealth of Virginia “to be flown at full-staff” for Trump’s inauguration on Monday. Youngkin added that the flags would be lowered to half-staff the next day in honor of former President James Earl “Jimmy” Carter Jr., who passed away in December at the age of 100. Youngkin said in a statement: In accordance with the authority vested in me as Governor and in accordance with federal law 4 U.S.C. § 6(d), I hereby order that the flags of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia are to be flown at full-staff on all state and local buildings and grounds in the Commonwealth in recognition of the inauguration of the 47th President of the United States. “The flags will be lowered back to half-staff the following day to continue honoring former President James Earl Carter, Jr. and remain at half-staff through January 28, 2025,” Youngkin added. “I hereby order that the flags shall be raised at 11 am on Monday, January 20, 2025 and lowered at sunrise on Tuesday, January 21, 2024.” Youngkin joins Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in making announcements that flags in their states would be raised to full-staff for Trump’s inauguration. In December, President Joe Biden ordered the flags to be flown at half-staff for a period of 30 days in honor of Carter: NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr., and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions for a period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. Other governors, such as Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson (D) Missouri Gov.

Adam Schiff Re-Hires Former Radical Pro-Palestinian Staffer Maher Bitar,"Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has re-hired Maher Bitar, a former White House staffer who spent his student years as a pro-Palestinian radical in Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), and played a major role in the Biden administration. Bitar’s new job is confirmed by Legistorm. He also previously worked for Schiff during the first impeachment effort against then-President Donald Trump, who will return to office on Monday. As Breitbart News reported last year: Maher Bitar, the White House Coordinator for Intelligence and Defense Policy at the U.S. National Security Council (NSC), was a radical pro-Palestinian activist and a leader within Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). The SJP is one of the most prominent groups involved in the pro-Hamas, antisemitic “encampment” protests that have taken over dozens of university campuses. Its parent group is also the target of a lawsuit by survivors and families of victims of the October 7 terror attack that alleges SJP is a propaganda front for Hamas in the U.S. In addition, conservative author Daniel Greenfield wrote about Bitar’s record for the Jewish News Syndicate: At the PSM [Palestine Solidarity Movement] conference in Georgetown [in 2006], Bitar had run a session describing how to best demonize Israel. Next year, he facilitated a Palestinian Student Society summit addressed by Joseph Massad , who had called Israel a “Jewish supremacist state” and praised terrorism. … A few years later, Bitar could be found presenting at a Sabeel conference featuring some of the worst bigots like Rebecca Vilkomerson of JVP, who had invited a terrorist to address the BDS hate group, and Richard Falk, who had endorsed a book which wondered whether “Hitler might have been right after all.” … Bitar went to work for UNRWA, interned at the misnamed and militantly anti-Israel Foundation for Middle East Peace and studied at Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre, writing papers on the so-called “Nakba” and on “Palestinian” activism. He appeared to describe Israel’s security barrier as a “segregation wall.” Schiff is considered a pro-Israel Senator, by the standards of the Democratic Party, but his reliance on Bitar for advice on national security policy signals a possible shift mirroring the anti-Israel drift of much of the rest of his party.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T03:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/adam-schiff-re-hires-former-radical-pro-palestinian-staffer-maher-bitar/
Youngkin Slams Biden's Clemency of Men Who Killed Police Officer,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) criticized President Joe Biden for granting clemency to “two violent criminals” who killed a police officer, stating that he was “beyond outraged.” In a press release on Saturday, Youngkin stated that what made Biden granting clemency to Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson “even more unconscionable” was that “the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House” against commuting the sentences. Youngkin noted in the press release that “both” men had “admitted to being responsible for the brutal killing of Officer Allen Gibson in Sussex County Circuit Court.” Claiborne and Richardson were “acquitted of the 1998 murder” of Officer Allen Gibson, a Sussex County police officer, according to WRIC News. The outlet noted that while the men were “acquitted by a federal jury,” they ended up receiving “a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge.” However, in an unusual move, they still received a life sentence in 2001 when being tried for a related drug charge. Previously, a legal analyst told 8News that it was a “miscarriage of justice” to cross-reference a charge someone had been acquitted of when sentencing, adding that he had never seen that before. “I am beyond outraged and in utter disbelief that President Biden would announce clemency for Ferrone Claiborne and Terence Richardson—two men who admitted for being responsible to brutally killing Officer Allen Gibson,” Youngkin said in a statement. “What makes this even more unconscionable is the Biden U.S. Attorney advised the White House not to commute these sentences as they are violent offenders.” “The pain and sorrow this clemency causes the Gibson family is unimaginable,” Youngkin added. “To know that the men who took Officer Gibson’s life will walk free is not just a grave injustice—it is a heartbreaking blow to those who continue to mourn his sacrifice. This is despicable; a grim day for justice and for the families who trust that our system will hold the guilty accountable.” Youngkin’s criticism of Biden commuting the sentences of Claiborne and Richardson came a day after Biden commuted the sentences of almost 2,500 people. As Breitbart News previously reported , in December, Biden issued presidential pardons to 39 Americans who were “convicted of non-violent crimes,” and commuted the sentences of almost 1,500 others.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T02:12:17+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/glenn-youngkin-slams-bidens-clemency-of-men-who-murdered-va-police-officer-beyond-outraged/
HHS Defunds EcoHealth for Facilitating Gain-of-Function Research,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has cut off all funding and “formally debarred” EcoHealth Alliance Inc. and its former president, Dr. Peter Daszak, after finding evidence that it facilitated gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China, without proper oversight and violated statutes in its National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Evidence was gathered over an eight-month investigation by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said in a Friday news release . A letter from HHS states that a five-year “period of debarment for Dr. Daszak is necessary to protect the Federal Government’s business interests,” and confirms that EcoHealth terminated his employment on January 6 of this year. A May 2024 interim report from the coronavirus subcommittee revealed “serious, systemic weaknesses” within NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) that “enabled” Daszak to fund “dangerous” gain-of-function research with the the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) with a multi-million dollar federal grant. Then-subcommittee Chair, Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), accused the British doctor of having “blatant contempt for the American people,” calling it “reprehensible”: EcoHealth Alliance President Dr. Peter Daszak is not a good steward of U.S. taxpayer dollars and should never again receive funding from the U.S. taxpayer. Dr. Daszak and his organization conducted dangerous gain-of-function research at the WIV, willfully violated the terms of a multi-million-dollar NIH grant, and placed U.S. national security at risk. This blatant contempt for the American people is reprehensible. It is imperative to establish higher standards of oversight at the NIH. The Select Subcommittee’s detailed and comprehensive report today holds Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth Alliance accountable and sheds light on severe shortcomings in our public health systems. On top of debarment, the interim report also recommended that Daszak be criminally investigated. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) celebrated the defunding and debarment of EcoHealth and Daszak in a Friday statement: “Justice for the American people was served today. Bad actor EcoHealth Alliance and its corrupt former President, Dr. Peter Daszak, were formally debarred by HHS for using taxpayer funds to facilitate dangerous gain-of-function research in China,” the Kentucky Republican said in the committee’s press release. “Today’s decision is not only a victory for the U.S. taxpayer, but also for American national security and the safety of citizens worldwide.” “Given that a lab-related incident involving gain-of-function research is the most likely origin of COVID-19, EcoHealth and its former President should never again receive a single cent from the U.S. taxpayer,” Comer added. EcoHealth Alliance’s period of debarment is set to end on May 14, 2029, and Daszak’s is set to end six days later, Fox News reported. The medical research firm got nearly $100 million from the U.S. government over the last 15 years, the outlet noted.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T01:21:17+00:00,Health,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/18/hhs-defunds-ecohealth-dr-peter-daszak-for-facilitating-dangerous-wuhan-gain-of-function-research/
Georgia 'BLM' Mayor Under Fire for Spending 1.000s of Taxpayer Dollars,"A Georgia mayor who claims to be “America’s first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office” is accused of spending $26,000 of public funds for unauthorized expenses, primarily for international travel. South Fulton Mayor Khalid Kamau has come under fire this week residents and at least one city council member questioned items he allegedly bought with his city-issued purchase card, Fox 5 Atlanta reported. Kamau, who boasts of being a “self-proclaimed Elected Activist” and BLM protester on the city’s website , identifies as a “socialist” who was proud to support legislation to “eliminate Columbus Day in favor of Indigenous People’s Day” and to “ban the box” asking city job applicants to disclose their criminal history. When asked if the mayor had made unauthorized purchases, Councilwoman Helen Willis said, “It appears so. Within the last fourth quarter of 2024, it was approximately $26,000.” One of the major purchases was a trip to Africa, she alleged. “It’s a pretty large amount of unauthorized charges, mainly for international travel,” Willis told the Atlanta outlet. Kamau, who was elected in 2017 and goes by “Mayor Kobi” on Instagram for unclear reasons, documented a 20-day trip to Ghana in December on the platform, one disgruntled resident told WSB-TV. One video shared by the mayor on December 22 shows him dancing with a couple of smiling ladies at a popular beach club in the West African nation’s capital of Accra: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mayor Kobi (@kobi.cares) “I wanted to find out if taxpayers paid for this trip,” the resident, Reshard Snellings, told the station. “We should not be asked to go without something so that our elected officials can travel all over the globe.” When asked if the city of South Fulton was conducting any business in Africa, Councilwoman Willis said no. “Not to my knowledge, that isn’t even a priority,” she told the outlet. “We need more economic development here and we don’t need to go to Africa in order for the city to have a multi-business deal.” On top of multiple flight purchases totaling more than $5,000, there was also a $1,300 purchase for a drone and multiple expensive Amazon orders, according to WSB-TV. Councilman Jaceey Sebastian, mayor pro tem, said that Kamau needs to provide an explanation. “There are some things that I see in the public that need some explanation,” he said to Fox 5 Atlanta. Councilwoman Linda Pritchett concurred, saying, “I would like to see the mayor have the opportunity to address the issue transparently.” While international travel is not prohibited for the mayor, using the city card for personal items and services is. The city council ultimately voted to suspend international travel for 30 to 45 days while that statute is reviewed, the local Fox affiliate reported. Kamau has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that the accusations are politically motivated. “It’s really a smear campaign. You will see in the meetings, the people who are talking the most are running for mayor in 2025,” the mayor said to WSB-TV. Kamau was arrested at a complete stranger’s home and charged with trespassing and burglary in 2023, after allegedly bypassing a “No Trespassing” sign on a property in the neighboring town of Fairburn and entering a lake house without permission, 11Alive reported. The homeowner held Kamau at gunpoint and called the police. When officers arrived, the mayor claimed he was taking his dog to a nearby park when he saw his “dream home” and knowingly trespassed because he wanted to buy it. He was later released on an $11,000 bond.",Breitbart,2025-01-19T00:40:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/local/2025/01/18/georgia-black-lives-matter-mayor-under-fire-for-spending-thousands-of-taxpayer-funds-on-africa-trip/
Former Intel Officials: Tulsi Gabbard Puts Party Loyalty Far Behind Duty to Country,"Former intelligence officials said that Director of National Intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard has put “party loyalty far behind duty to country.” In the week after his historic election, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Gabbard to serve as director of National Intelligence. “For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our Country and Freedoms of all Americans,” Trump s aid in a written statement. “I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!” Gabbard thanked Trump on X “for the opportunity to serve as a member of your cabinet to defend the safety, security and freedom of the American people,” adding, “I look forward to getting to work.” Her nomination garnered swift backing from many leaders in the intelligence community. Bernard Hudson, a retired CIA official who was the agency’s chief of counterterrorism, where he oversaw the CIA’s efforts in the Global War on Terror, said in a statement to Breitbart News, “To be successful, a Director of National Intelligence must have two key attributes. One, they need to have the confidence of the President. An intelligence chief without this is going to be a severe disadvantage in trying to carry out their duties. Tulsi Gabbard clearly has the confidence of the incoming Chief Executive. Two, the DNI needs to be willing to speak truth to power, no matter what the personal or political cost to them. This tends to be easier said than done. Tulsi Gabbard has already demonstrated she is willing to pay a steep price for speaking uncomfortable truths. “During her run for the Democratic nomination for President, she demonstrated this time and time again. And she paid a price for it, but it had not deterred her from seeking and speaking the truth. In regards to her experience with the intelligence world, she’s been both a consumer of tactical and strategic intelligence,” he continued. “As a soldier, especially during her combat tour in Iraq, she has seen the value, and sometimes the limitations, of tactical intelligence for the warfighter.” As a member of congress sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was privy to and responsible for understanding and supporting some of the most sensitive and vast global intelligence programs the United States has. Lastly, she is someone who has put party loyalty far behind duty to the country,” the former senior CIA officer concluded in his statement to Breitbart News. “That bipartisan background should help her demonstrate to the American people that the intelligence community she leads is a non-partisan tool that supports the key interests of the United States and its key allies.” Robert C. O’Brien, who served as the 27th U.S. National Security Adviser under Trump, on Sunday wrote an op-ed calling on the Senate to confirm Gabbard and all of Trump’s national security nominees. He explained: Gabbard also has an open mind and the curiosity necessary to evaluate complex and, often, contradictory reports that are commonplace in the Intel World. Her path from congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate to supporting President Trump demonstrates her ability to put country above party and ideology when the facts require courageous action. … In my hours of meetings with Gabbard since her nomination, it is clear why the president selected her to serve as DNI. She listens, she asks questions that go to the heart of the matter being discussed and she is concise and eloquent in sharing her views. She is also unafraid of the IC bureaucracy that she will have to reform and bring into the 21 st Century by rooting out partisanship and introducing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and quantum computing into both intelligence collection and analysis. On Sunday, Gabbard received the backing of Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee after the nominee said she believes in balancing the need for protecting Americans’ civil liberties and national security. Lankford explained: She’s now coming in and saying, those changes have been done because even since she was in Congress, there have been quite a few changes that we’ve made in Congress to make sure we’re protecting the civil rights of Americans. But when she came out and said, “Hey, this is something I’m going to stand for” – that’s part of the role of the Director of National Intelligence is to make sure we’re actually watching for people to come attack us and stopping them before they do.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:25:04+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/former-intel-officials-director-national-intelligence-nominee-tulsi-gabbard-put-party-loyalty-far-behind-duty-to-country/
Poll Shows Post-Election Crash in Public Tolerance for Illegal Migration,"Just 10 percent of Americans oppose President Donald Trump’s promise to deport illegal migrants with criminal records, according to an Ipsos poll for the New York Times . In contrast, 87 percent support the deportations strongly or “somewhat,” so providing a broad consensus for a national enforcement campaign. And just 19 percent of Americans — fewer than one in five — strongly oppose “deporting all immigrants who are here illegally ,” the Ipsos poll also showed. Fifty-six percent support the deportations strongly or somewhat. The post-election collapse of tolerance for illegal migration was spotlighted Saturday when the newspaper posted its early-January poll of 2,128 citizens and residents that confirmed recent polling trends . The broad shift in political opinion — dubbed a “preference cascade” by academics —  was likely caused when Trump’s campaign and November win showed Americans how many other Americans oppose migration. The new numbers will help Trump and his deputies begin the careful, low-drama, and gradual removal of millions of wage-cutting, rent-spiking migrants from U.S. society. A patient and popular enforcement campaign will also help shift the political attention to the even bigger impact of legal migration on Americans. Already, the rising public demand for less legal migration was spotlighted over Christmas when Twitter erupted in a furious debate over white-collar migration via the H-1B visa program. That drama was ignored by the poll but is expected to rise as the nation draws closer to the 2026 election. Pro-migration groups, however, hope the Trump enforcement is chaotic and rushed because any tactical mistakes will help their media allies paint the repatriations as cruel and counterproductive. The newspaper’s coverage of the poll downplays the drama, saying : Many Americans who otherwise dislike President-elect Donald J. Trump share his bleak assessment of the country’s problems and support some of his most contentious prescriptions to fix them, according to a new poll from The New York Times and Ipsos . The new poll includes much evidence that GOP voters are leading Democrats away from their politically disastrous support for the quasi-open borders policies put in place by President Joe Biden’s pro-migration, Cuban-born border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. For example, only 16 percent of Democrats oppose the deportation of criminal migrants, and only 34 percent of Democrats now “strongly” oppose the deportation of “ all immigrants [emphasis added] who are here illegally.” Overall, 55 percent want all migrants to be deported, and 87 percent want crminal migrants to be deported. These numbers — the approaching 20256 midterm elections — help to explain why a critical share of Senate Democrats are expected on Monday to support the Laken Riley bill that would allow the detention of criminal migrants. Similarly, 56 percent said the Mayorkas migration has caused more crime. Just 38 percent — including 63 percent of Democrats, said the migration “doesn’t have much impact on crime.” The poll said that 41 percent of Americans, including 68 percent of GOP voters — say “immigrants today are a burden on our country because they take our jobs, housing and health care.” However, the “forced choice” question did not offer alternative answers, so it prodded 56 percent of respondents to say immigrants “strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents.” There is much evidence that legal and illegal migration makes ordinary Americans poor and less productive . Elsewhere in the poll, Ipsos asked if there were too many or too few legal migrants. Thirty percent said too many, and just 24 percent said too few. But the plurality of 43 percent picked a middle option — “the right number” — likely because the respondents do not know that Biden’s deputies imported roughly one migrant for every American birth since 2021. Other recent polls show less support for migration. A January 5-8 survey by YouGov showed a 34 percent plurality believes legal migration makes the nation “worse off,” and a 41 percent plurality favor cuts or ending legal migration.  Just 17 percent favor additional legal migration. Similarly, a January 8 poll by YouGov showed that 27 percent of Americans want the white-collar H-1B migration program to be reduced or eliminated, while only 17 percent want it increased. Among Republicans, 40 percent want to cut or eliminate the program, while only 12 percent want it to be expanded.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T22:08:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/01/18/poll-shows-post-election-crash-in-public-tolerance-for-illegal-migration/
Google CEO to Attend Inauguration After Hosting Party for Left Resistance,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai will attend Monday’s inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump after the search giant in November planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those Democrats sought to “resist the Republican agenda.” The inauguration will feature many of the most prominent Silicon Valley leaders, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, and Google’s Pichai. While other big tech platforms have tried to steer right in the aftermath of Trump’s landslide election, Google reportedly planned to cohost a social event with Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, as those affiliated with the super PAC sought to “resist the Republican agenda.” Breitbart News’s Lucas Nolan wrote : According to an invitation obtained by the Washington Free Beacon, Priorities USA will first hold a “digital retrospective” to discuss the role of online campaigning in the 2024 election cycle and strategize ways to “resist the Republican agenda.” Following this meeting, Google will co-host a social hour for the attendees. Priorities USA, which has received substantial funding from billionaire donors such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg, reportedly spent $75 million on digital mobilization efforts to support Harris’s campaign. The timing of the event is particularly notable, as President-elect Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Google, accusing the company of rigging its search engine to promote negative stories about him. While Trump has indicated that he may not pursue breaking up Google as a monopoly, he has vowed to take action to ensure that the search engine is “more fair.” A Google spokesperson said that the big tech company will host the happy hour for Priorities USA; however, the spokesman said that the company would not participate in the “digital retrospective” event. “We did not participate in creating the content of the meeting. As they do for large ad buyers on both sides of the aisle, our political sales team will host some drinks after it,” the spokesman said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T21:54:22+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/https-www-breitbart-com-politics-2025-01-18-poll-plurality-either-enthusiastic-or-satisfied-with-next-4-years-of-trump/
Exclusive--Kentucky AG Commissioner: Confirmation of USDA Nominee Brooke Rollins Will Help Make America Healthy Again,"Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said on Breitbart News Saturday that swiftly confirming agriculture secretary nominee Brooke Rollins will aid the Trump administration’s efforts to Make America Healthy Again. Shell spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as nearly two dozen state agricultural commissioners have called for a speedy confirmation of Rollins. “There is no mystery as to why President-elect Donald J. Trump won 433 of the nation’s 444 farming-dependent counties with an average of 77.7% of the vote,” the commissioners wrote in their letter. Shell said that Rollins will have the policy acumen to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), one of the largest federal departments. “What I love about her the most is she comes from a policy background, the think tank world,” Shell remarked. Rollins has led many major conservative think tanks, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the Trump-backed America First Policy Institute. “She brings a different perspective that will solidify what we need to move into the future for Kentucky agriculture and American agriculture and our interests abroad,” the Kentucky commissioner wrote. Shell noted that Rollins can help push back against other countries’ unfair trade practices to boost American agriculture and cut “so much red tape” holding back American farmers. He also argued that if President-elect Donald Trump could do “one thing” to aid farmers, it would be to lower gas prices. Shell noted that Rollins could work alongside Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to enact the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda. He said that “food is medicine” and that health starts with decentralizing our food system. Shell also noted that schools often do not provide the proper food for America’s school children. “There’s no way to make America Healthy Again without American farming and American agriculture. It starts with the food that we eat,” he explained to Breitbart News Saturday . Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.

NYT Exposes 6 People Responsible for Trying to Cover Up Joe Biden's Health,"“Six key people” knew of President Joe Biden’s condition for years and tried to cover it up, the New York Times reported Friday. The establishment media tried for years to help the president appear able to lead the nation, but now that Biden is set to retire from office, some in the media are beginning to expose those who worked behind the scenes to cover up the state of Biden’s health. The six key people who covered up Biden’s health situation were, according to the Times’ Katie Rogers, Adam Entous, Maggie Haberman, and Carl Hulse: First Lady Jill Biden Hunter Biden Mike Donilon, the president’s longtime strategist, Steve Ricchetti, the president’s lawyer Annie Tomasini, the deputy chief of staff Anthony Bernal, the first lady’s most senior aide Many — if not all — of those named in the report still claim Biden is fit to serve. “I mean, today, I think he has a full schedule,” Jill Biden recently told the Washington Post . “He started early with interviews and briefings, and it just keeps going.” “We can get through it,” Ricchetti reportedly told lawmakers about Biden’s health before he stepped aside as a candidate. “We think our allies on the Hill are wrong.” The Times reported on the coverup: The people closest to President Biden were well aware that he had changed. He talked more slowly than he had just a few years before, needed to hoist himself out of his seat in the presidential limousine and walked with a halting gait. … The president’s acknowledgment has put a new spotlight on his family and inner circle, all of whom dismissed concerns from voters and Mr. Biden’s own party that he was too old for the job. And yet they recognized his physical frailty to a greater degree than they have publicly acknowledged. Then they cooperated, according to interviews with more than two dozen aides, allies, lawmakers and donors, to manage his decline. They rearranged meetings to make sure Mr. Biden was in a better mood — a strategy one person close to him described as how aides should handle any president. At times, they delayed sharing information with him, including negative polling data, as they debated the best way to frame it. They surrounded him with aides when he walked from the White House to the waiting presidential helicopter on the South Lawn so that news cameras could not capture his awkward bearing. The Times’s report is corroborated. Biden’s aides successfully covered up his health until he stepped into the spotlight for July’s debate, according to Wall Street Journal interviews with nearly 50 people, including many who had direct knowledge of the operation. Interviews conducted by the Journal reveal Biden’s aides protected the “diminished” president from cabinet members, donors, pollsters, and top Democrat lawmakers, who might have undermined the aides’ directives. Biden’s aides reportedly excluded negative stories about the president in his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign. Those closest to the president took the following actions to cover up Biden’s health, the Journal reported: Adjusted the presidential schedule, starting at the beginning of his term, due to “Biden’s advanced age” Limited Biden’s schedule because he “became tired if meetings went long” causing him to “make mistakes” Told “visitors to keep meetings focused,” including meetings with senior Democrat lawmakers and some cabinet members Excluded negative stories about the president from his daily news clips, including negative polling about his 2024 campaign Implemented greater than normal “controls” over who Biden “spoke with,” what they “said to him” Limited “the sources of information he consumed” Gave Biden great assistance at public events, which was characterized as “hand holding” unlike “other recent presidents have had” Allowed Biden to start his day later in the morning, “since Biden has never been at his best first thing” Handled things in such a way that “[a]t least one cabinet member stopped requesting calls with the president, because it was clear that such requests wouldn’t be welcome” Dictated agency “decisions and expect[ed] cabinet agencies to carry them out” Fielded concerns from cabinet members, who were mostly not allowed to take their concerns directly to the president Tried to protect the president, who “couldn’t recall lines that his team had previously discussed with him” during meetings Prevented the press, donors, and stakeholders in Biden’s campaign from direct contact with the president Often repeated “basic instructions to him, such as where to enter or exit a stage” Looked for a “voice coach to improve the president’s fading warble” Many Republicans believed Biden was in poor health for years. The speculation, based on visual evidence, appeared to be confirmed when Special Counsel Robert Hur characterized Biden in February 2024 as “an elderly man with a poor memory.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T20:46:34+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/nyt-exposes-six-people-responsible-trying-cover-up-joe-bidens-health/
WaPo Admits Trump 'Already Conquered' Washington Before Inauguration ,"President-elect Donald Trump “already conquered” Washington, DC, before Inauguration Day, the Washington Post ‘s Marianne LeVine , Clara Ence Morse, and Aaron Schaffer admitted Saturday. The report details a “stark contrast to his divisive entry in 2017 and departure in 2021” compared to Trump’s reelection, but it failed to mention the amount of obstacles he overcame to achieve the greatest political comeback in American history. Trump ultimately defeated political opponents who tried to imprison him, bankrupt him, remove him from the ballot, and make him politically irrelevant by introducing a partisan committee to investigate January 6 — and whose inflammatory rhetoric created a ripe environment for two assassination attempts. The omission amplifies the Post’s framing of Trump’s return to Washington: President-elect Donald Trump is returning to Washington triumphant: His legal cases are behind him, corporate executives are flocking to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him, his inaugural committee has raised record sums of money for Monday’s ceremony and the Republican Party is now fully in his control. It’s a stark contrast both to his 2017 inauguration — when Trump came to Washington as a political unknown without close personal relationships to his Cabinet or congressional leaders — and to his departure from the Oval Office in January 2021, when he was widely condemned for the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Now, many of his Cabinet picks appear poised to sail through the Republican-controlled Senate, including his controversial pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, whose nomination seemed in danger just a month ago. Trump is expected to sign scores of executive orders as he takes office, especially on the border, a central issue of his presidential campaign. He is personally closer to his proposed Cabinet and other top aides compared with eight years ago and is enjoying some of the highest favorability ratings of his political career. Days before coming into office, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that both Trump and President Joe Biden have sought to take credit for. The report did mention how Trump’s polling numbers are high, perhaps as high as they ever have been. A CNN poll found Trump’s approval rating was 48 percent, up from 39 percent just last year. Trump’s imminent return to Washington has caused President Joe Biden to feel “totally dejected,” NBC News reported based on people who recently met with officials. The mood at the White House reflects the state of the Democrat party. The shattered party does not appear to know why Trump won or how to prevent further Democrat defeats. It is in the middle of revamping its nine-year-old talking points that claimed without evidence that Trump and Republicans were racist, bigots, and misogynists. In recent weeks, the bewildered party does not seem equipped to mount a strong resistance to Trump’s cabinet nominees, most of whom appear to be on a glide path to confirmation, although Senate Democrats might try delay tactics, moves that are expected but can be overcome with strong Senate Republican leadership. “It’s hard to reflect, it’s hard for it to sink in that we’re done here — until we’re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,” one White House official told NBC News. “That’s their mood… it hasn’t sunk in for people who are still here yet because we’re working until the last minute.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:55:23+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2025/01/18/wapo-admits-trump-already-conquered-washington-before-inauguration/
"Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross Attend Pre-Inauguration Crypto Ball -- Both Fantasized About Killing Trump","Rappers Snoop Dogg and Rick Ross appeared at the pre-inauguration “Crypto Ball” on Friday — signaling a change of heart for both rappers after they fantasized about killing President-elect Donald Trump in their music, with Snoop even pretending to point a gun at the then-president in a music video. Snoop Dogg headlined the pro-Trump Crypto Ball event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington D.C., with House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in attendance — along with other rappers including Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, according to multiple reports. Video footage from the party has gone viral, showing Snoop Dogg taking the stage to perform a set for the tuxedoed crowd. In a video message , Ross denied he was performing at the event, though he did appear to confirm his attendance saying, “it’s a private ‘vibe’ I’m doing with my brother Snoop Dogg.” However, additional viral footage from Friday’s party showed Ross performing on stage. Snoop Dogg vehemently opposed Trump during his first term in the White House. In 2017, the rapper starred in a politically-charged music video for the single “Lavender” that saw the rapper pull a gun and “shoot” a parody clown version of then-President Donald Trump. Rick Ross also fantasized about the death of Trump. In a music video for his single “Free Enterprise” released in 2016, Ross rapped: “Assassinate Trump like I’m Zimmerman/Now accept these words as they came from Eminem.” The lyrics are an apparent reference to George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Rapper Soulja Boy has publicly opposed Trump, attacking fellow rapper Kanye West during a radio interview in 2019 by questioning his support for the then-president in a profane rant. “You supporting Trump, bruh? What the fuck wrong with you, bruh? That shit not right, bruh,” Soulja Boy erupted on The Breakfast Club. Snoop Dogg signaled a change of heart when it comes to Trump a year ago during a conversation with the U.K. Sunday Times. “Donald Trump? He ain’t done nothing wrong to me. He has done only great things for me. He pardoned Michael Harris,” he told the outlet, later adding: “So I have nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump.” Friday’s Crypto Ball was a private, four-hour affair, with tickets going for $2,500 and $5,000, according to a report from Coindesk. Other attendees included Trump’s crypto czar pick, David Sacks, as well as tech entrepreneurs Michael Saylor, Brian Armstrong, and the Winklevoss brothers.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:50:10+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/01/18/snoop-dogg-rick-ross-attend-pre-inauguration-crypto-ball-both-fantasized-about-killing-trump/
Brad Sherman Criticizes Pacific Palisades Residents Who Returned to Their Homes,"Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) criticized residents of the Pacific Palisades who had returned to their homes without authorization, telling a telephone town hall on Wednesday that they had “ruined” things for other local residents. Sherman was providing information about federal relief funds and fielding questions about when people would be allowed to return to their homes — whether to remove any remaining belongings, or simply to grieve the ruins. The Los Angeles Police Department and the National Guard are currently denying entry to residents in the evacuation zones, and have said that anyone caught violating a 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew in the area will be arrested. He said that while police escorts had been provided for some residents for several days (Jan. 9-11), they had been suspended — and he blamed the fact that some people had tried to return to their homes, often successfully. You’re gonna say, “Well, why not at least let me in to check out my own house?” Um, they were doing that for a while, they didn’t have the resources. And then there’s another problem that I hesitate to mention and that is some people were taken in to look and they stayed, they “de-evacuated” themselves, they walked in their front door and locked it behind them, and, uh, they were not arrested. And so, uh, they kind of ruined it for other people. Of course the research commitment is also very high to, to, to escort people back in. So they’ve got to deal with the toxic chemicals, they’ve got to deal with the safety of the utilities, in order to, uh, uh, I, in order to let people into the fire area. I’m sure we’ll get more questions on that. Sherman’s comments triggered outrage among some residents, who are worried about looting and who have, in some cases, hired private security companies to protect their neighborhoods, or have slipped past police and the National Guard. There are a few residents who have refused to evacuate, preferring to live secretly in their surviving homes without electricity, power, gas, or water rather than to leave. One homeless man, “Eric,” lives openly in the burn zone.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T18:18:42+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/brad-sherman-criticizes-pacific-palisades-residents-who-returned-to-their-homes/
"Israel Will Release Mass Murderers, Terrorists in Hostage Deal","Israel will release major terrorists, including those who have murdered dozens of civilians, in exchange for the 33 hostages who will be freed by Hamas from captivity in Gaza, where they have been held illegally for 470 days of war. Under the terms of the deal, there will be a ceasefire lasting six weeks (42 days), during which Hamas will free several living hostages once a week, plus twelve hostages in the final week, freeing living hostages before deceased ones. In return, Israel will withdraw partially from Gaza, and will release roughly 1,900 terrorists — including nearly 1200 who were arrested during the war, and more than 700 who were already serving prison sentences in Israeli prisons. While no terrorists who took part in the October 7, 2023, attacks will be released, Israel has agreed to release some terrorists who committed mass murder in past terrorist attacks. For example, according to Israel’s Army Radio, one terrorist who will be released was involved in planning a suicide bombing at the Megiddo junction in northern Israel in 2002, during the second intifada . The attack killed 17 innocent civilians who were simply riding a public bus. The Israeli government said Saturday that authorities would begin notifying families of victims of terror that those involved in the murders of their relatives were about to be released. The ceasefire-and-hostage deal goes into effect on Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m. local time in Israel — though there could still be snags. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government will not go through with the deal unless Hamas fulfills its obligation to provide the names of the hostages to be released. The Red Cross is preparing to handle the transfer of hostages, as it did in the last truce, in November 2023, though the international agency has come under criticism for failing to visit the hostages during their captivity, and allowing Hamas to use the releases as propaganda events. Update: Netanyahu addressed his nation on Saturday night, emphasizing that Israel had not given up its military gains in the Gaza Strip, including the Philadelphi Corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border. He quoted from the Bible, citing Jeremiah 31:16: “And the children shall return to their borders.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:45:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/01/18/israel-will-release-mass-murderers-terrorists-in-hostage-deal/
Aggressive Driver Shot Numerous Times After Allegedly Chasing Couple,"An aggressive driver was shot numerous times Friday night in Houston, Texas, after allegedly brake-checking, blocking, and chasing a couple riding in another vehicle. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. KHOU reported that the suspect, a man in his 40s, was driving a pickup truck when he allegedly “zeroed in on a car driven by a 20-year-old man.” There was also a pregnant woman in the car with the younger man. The driver allegedly brake-checked the 20-year-old, drove into oncoming traffic to get beside him, and finally, blocked the car’s forward motion, then exited his truck with his hand near his pockets. The 20-year-old feared for himself and for the woman with him and opened fire, hitting the 40-year-old numerous times. Houston Police Department’s Lt. R. Willkens explained: The 20-year-old’s actions are tentatively being referred to as self-defense and come just weeks after another Houston shooting in which a 24-year-old woman claimed self-defense for her actions. AB C 13 noted that the 24-year-old shot and killed a man at an apartment on Christmas Day. Police indicated the man, 22-year-old Jonathon Mason, was dead when officers arrived. Houston PD “determined the shooting stemmed from a domestic dispute” and the case will go before a grand jury.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:23:28+00:00,2nd Amendment,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2025/01/18/aggressive-driver-shot-numerous-times-after-allegedly-chasing-couple/
"Exclusive -- Sen. Ron Johnson: 'Most, if Not All' of Trump's Nominees Will Get at Least 50 Votes","Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) on Wednesday predicted that “most, if not all” of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees will get at least 50 votes in the Senate on Breitbart News Daily . When asked if he believes Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of Defense, will get 50 votes, Johnson replied, “Oh, yeah, I think most, if not all, Trump nominees will.” “The default position of Republican senators is this is a convincing election,” he said, explaining that it is presidents who decide who they want in their cabinet, not senators. “Our role is to respect the results of the election and confirm that the people that President Trump wants to surround himself in his administration,” the senator said. “He’s ultimately responsible.” Host Mike Slater pointed to an analysis from the Washington Post that highlighted a number of senators who could potentially vote “no” on Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s choice for Health and Human Services Secretary. “Well, what’s interesting is I did sort of the unofficial whip count for Bobby Kennedy early on, and I talked to, I think 41 of my Republican colleagues and 15 Democrats. I think that was my account almost. The conversation was almost identical with everyone. It was started off with, ‘Boy, there’s a lot that I really love that Bobby’s trying to do,’ but they have concerns,” he said, explaining that Kennedy can “easily” alleviate those concerns. “And I think he will, and I think he has, so we’ll see how this goes. I know there will probably be an extensive lobbying effort from all corners of the swamp… because by bringing forward the truth to the political process here, it does threaten people’s business models, I suppose, but that’s what we need,” he said, explaining that the American people “absolutely support getting to the truth of what is causing chronic illness.” LISTEN: Breitbart · Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) – January 15, 2025 “Is there a problem with 80 some doses of childhood vaccines — the schedule? What is the truth about it? We haven’t even been able to ask the question,” he said, identifying Kennedy’s first task as restoring “integrity to science, which has been completely corrupted.” “I mean, when you have federal government paying for it, we have big farmers paying for their studies. You pay for a scientific research paper, you’re going to get the result you want. Peer review is a joke. It is. It’s also corrupt. Scientific journals are corrupt. They’ve all been corrupted by the money that funds them. So that needs to be exposed, so that we actually get back to true scientific research,” the Wisconsin senator added.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T17:04:07+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/exclusive-sen-ron-johnson-most-if-not-all-of-trumps-nominees-will-get-at-least-50-votes/
Poll: Plurality Either 'Enthusiastic' or 'Satisfied' with Next 4 Years of Trump,"A plurality is either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” with President-elect Donald Trump leading the country over the next four years, according to the latest weekly survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, “How do you feel about the next 4 years with Donald Trump as president?” Overall, 47 percent are either enthusiastic or satisfied. Of those, 31 percent said they are enthusiastic, and 16 percent are satisfied. Another 31 percent said they are actively upset, and 13 percent are “dissatisfied but not upset.” Another nine percent remain unsure. Predictably, most Democrats — 60 percent — are upset, compared to 31 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans who feel the same. One in five independents said they are enthusiastic, as did 71 percent of Republicans. Only two percent of Democrats feel the same way. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 U.S. citizens. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey comes as the Democrat Party remains in disarray after its loss to Trump — a loss that occurred even after they subverted the will of their voters and coronated Vice President Kamala Harris to run against Trump instead of President Joe Biden. To their surprise, Trump not only won the election but secured every single swing stat, as well as the popular vote. RELATED — Trump: MAGA Saving, Not Threatening Democracy Biden, 82, still believes that he would have defeated Trump had he remained the Democrat nominee. “Do you believe you could have won in November?” USA Today ‘s Susan Page asked Biden in a January interview. “It’s presumptuous to say that, but I think yes,” he said, referencing polling. However, Biden was not so confident that he would have the “vigor” to serve four more years. “Do you think you would’ve had the vigor to serve another four years in office?” she asked. “I don’t know. That’s why I thought when I first announced, talking to Barack about it, I said I thought I was the person,” he said, adding: I had no intention of running after Beau died – for real, not a joke. And then when Trump was running again for reelection, I really thought I had the best chance of beating him. But I also wasn’t looking to be president when I was 85 years old, 86 years old. And so I did talk about passing the baton. But I don’t know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I’m going to be when I’m 86 years old? Trump’s inauguration is less than a week away. So far, the president-elect’s inaugural committee has raised over $170 million, according to reports. As Breitbart News reported , “Trump’s political accounts could reportedly be brimming by the summer of 2025 with as much as $500 million.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:54:29+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/poll-plurality-either-enthusiastic-or-satisfied-with-next-4-years-of-trump/
Poll: 'Border and Immigration Handling' Identified as Biden's Biggest Failure,"“Border and immigration handling” has been identified as President Joe Biden’s biggest failure, according to a survey from the Economist /YouGov. The survey asked respondents, “Which, if any, of the following do you consider to be the biggest failure of Joe Biden’s presidency?” It listed several failures, but a plurality, 23 percent, chose border and immigration handling as Biden’s biggest failure. The high inflation rate came in second place with 17 percent choosing that as Biden’s biggest failure. In third place is Biden’s decision to run for a second term, with eight percent choosing that as the biggest failure of his presidency. Six percent said Biden’s biggest failure is the withdrawal from Afghanistan, six percent said handling the Israel-Hamas conflict, five percent said handling investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, five percent said pardoning Hunter Biden, and four recent said ineffective messaging. Another three percent said his handling of abortion policy, and three percent said the increase of the national debt. One-third of Republicans chose border and immigration handling as Biden’s biggest failure, and 24 percent of independents agreed. Fifteen percent of Democrats said Biden’s decision to run for a second term was his biggest flop. The survey was taken January 12-14, 2025, among 1,558 respondents. It has a +/- 3.6 percent margin of error. The survey coincides with reports that the White House in its current state feels “like a morgue” and “glum” as Biden and his administration prepare for a final exit and President-elect Donald Trump and his allies prepare to move back in. According to NBC News : In the White House, the mood feels “like a morgue,” according to a person who recently met with officials there. Biden leaves office feeling he contributed significant wins for the country that Americans don’t appreciate. Privately, he has vacillated from feeling melancholy to resigned to angry to wistful as he reflects on his legacy, two people close to him said. “He’s totally dejected and the people around him are, as well,” another person close to the president said. One White House official attributed the glum atmosphere to Trump’s impending return to the Oval Office and noted that Biden’s aides warmly reacted with cheers when he surprised them at a staff party earlier this week. The report also cited a White House official who said it is “hard to reflect.” “It’s hard for it to sink in that we’re done here — until we’re actually done and out the gates with our stuff,” the individual added.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:46:50+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/poll-border-and-immigration-handling-identified-as-bidens-biggest-failure/
Outrage over Short Prison Sentences for Grooming Gang Child Rapists,"The British judicial system has come under criticism after eight child rape grooming gang members were given what some feel were light sentences for the abuse and rape of two girls in Keighley in the late 1990s. The West Yorkshire Police revealed Friday that over the past two years, the Bradford Crown Court has sentenced eight members of a grooming gang over the sexual exploitation of two young girls between 1996 and 1999. However, the announcement was mired by what many saw as overly-lenient sentences for child rape, particularly given that most offenders in Britain are released after serving just half their sentences behind bars. This would likely mean that some of those imprisoned by the Bradford court would serve less than two years in prison for raping a child. The police force said that following the first trial, which concluded on October 20th of 2023, five men were jailed, including Amreaz Asghar,47, for four and a half years for rape, Perwaz Asghar, 50, for six and a half years for two indecent assaults,  Mohammed Din, 47, for 14 years for 11 counts of rape, Sajid Mahmood Khan, 45, for three years for rape, and Zehroon Razak, 47, for six and a half years for rape. Following the conclusion of the second trial, which concluded on Friday, a further three men were sentenced, though two were tried in absentia as their whereabouts are currently unknown. The West Yorkshire Police said that Ibrar Hussain, 47, was jailed for six and a half years for two counts of rape. The two men tried in absentia, Fayaz Ahmed, 45, and Imtiaz Ahmed, 61, were sentenced to seven and a half years and nine years in prison, respectively. The two victims were between the ages of 13 and 16 years old during the time of the grooming offences. Mohammed Din was convicted of raping both girls, while the other men were convicted of raping the first victim to come forward to police, which she did as an adult. Responding to the sentences, former detective turned grooming gang whistleblower Maggie Oliver said : “These sentences in this Keighley group rape gang case just beggar belief, again – children of 13/14 raped repeatedly and their rapists will serve HALF these sentences!!!! So 18 months for one of the rapists, just over 2 years for another. “Shocking! Yet again! And I honestly find myself lost for words, and I’ve no doubt the police officers who have put this case together are equally disgusted with these sentences! Disgusting!” Grooming gang victim and activist Sammy Woodhouse added : “The Judges in the UK are sentencing men to 3 years for raping a child. He won’t even serve half of that. Absolutely vile. No wonder there’s so many children being raped in our country.” The British public also appears to want harsher sentencing for grooming gang child rapists. According to a survey published this week by Friderichs Advisory and JL Partners, some 47 per cent of Britons support life sentences for such offenders, while 30 per cent backed the death penalty for grooming gang child rapists. Following the publication of the sentences in Keighley, Detective Chief Inspector Vicky Greenbank of Bradford District Police said: “We welcome the sentences that have been handed down to these men. Cases such as these are incredibly sensitive and complex and it has taken years of painstaking investigation to bring them before the courts. “I would like to take this opportunity to praise both victims for coming forward and reporting these offences to the police. They have both shown immense patience whilst the criminal investigation has been ongoing and courage throughout the court process. “The abuse both girls endured robbed them of their childhood and I hope seeing these men sentenced for these horrendous offences, will give them justice and some closure.” Follow Kurt Zindulka on X: Follow @KurtZindulka or e-mail to: kzindulka@breitbart.com",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:38:25+00:00,London / Europe,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/outrage-over-short-sentences-for-grooming-gang-child-rapists/
'Shark Tank' Investor O'Leary Offers $20 Billion Cash to Buy China's TikTok,"Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary is offering $20 billion in cash to buy communist China’s social media platform TikTok. During an interview Friday on Fox News’s America’s Newsroom , O’Leary said , “Right now, $20 billion’s on the table. Cash.” O’Leary said in March that he or another American would buy TikTok to keep it from being shut down, per Breitbart News. He stated at the time, “It [is] not going to get banned. I’m going to buy it. Somebody will buy it. It won’t be Meta and Google. A regulator will stop that. A syndicate will be formed. I’d like to be involved obviously. What I would do is form a bipartisan committee, an advisory committee for 18 months. Go to them and say to them, how much will you let me keep of the Chinese?” There have been strong opinions regarding a potential ban of TikTok as users, who are mostly teenagers and young adults, do not want access interrupted or restricted, Breitbart News reported on Wednesday. O’Leary’s recent $20 billion offer comes after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a law requiring the company to find a buyer or face being banned, the Fox report continued: In its decision, the Supreme Court backed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, a law passed by Congress last April with wide bipartisan support. The law gave TikTok nine months to either divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or be removed from U.S.-based app stores and hosting services. Congress has voiced concerns about how the app could be used as a weapon or a way to gather massive amounts of data from users. “TikTok, ByteDance and several users of the app swiftly sued to block the ban in May, arguing the legislation would suppress free speech for the millions of Americans who use the platform,” the Fox article reads. “After a lower court upheld the ban, the Supreme Court agreed to hear TikTok’s emergency request to either block or pause implementation of the law under a fast-track timeline just nine days before the ban was slated to go into effect,” it said. TikTok will “go dark” when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday unless a deal is made to keep it going, O’Leary said. Meanwhile, TikTok users are reportedly shifting over to another app called Xiaohongshu, or “Little Red Book” as the ban looms, Breitbart News reported on Friday. “Xiaohongshu, which Chinese media is referring to as ‘RedNote’ in an apparent bid to distance it from its Mandarin name – is also controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and is named after all-time murder champion Mao Zedong’s ‘Little Red Book’ of communism,” the article said.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T16:15:58+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/18/shark-tank-investor-kevin-oleary-offers-20-billion-cash-buy-chinas-tiktok/
"GOP Rep. Pushes Bill Prohibiting State Bans on Certain Rifles, Shotguns","Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY) introduced legislation this week that would prevent states from banning rifles and/or shotguns that are legal federally. The legislation, the Second Amendment Guarantee Act (SAGA), would operate as a national preemption law, preventing states from banning firearms the federal government has not banned. Moreover, it would undo bans contained in laws like New York’s SAFE Act. Rochester First quoted Tenney. “The SAGA Act nullifies New York’s unconstitutional SAFE Act and prevents other states from enacting laws that violate the Second Amendment,” she said. “This legislation upholds our country’s founding principle of protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans, even from liberal states with anti-gun policies.” The Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA) reached out to Breitbart News regarding SAGA, noting that the measure is cosponsored by Reps. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and Nick Langworthy (R-NY). CCRKBA chairman Alan Gottlieb pointed to the SAGA Act, noting that it allows “America’s gun owners…[to] put anti-gun lawmakers on notice that we’re tired of being treated like second-class citizens, and that our rights are more important than their ill-advised crusade to disarm law-abiding Americans and erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.” He added, “Millions of people already own these firearms across the country and there is no good reason to penalize them for crimes they didn’t commit, and for merely choosing to exercise a right guaranteed by the Constitution.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T15:43:48+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2025/01/18/gop-rep-introduces-saga-act-if-you-like-your-ar-15-you-can-keep-your-ar-15/
"Wilders: Unlike Trump's America, EU Bigwigs Censor to 'Protect Democracy' from Voters","Next Tuesday, the European Parliament will discuss with the European Commission the “need to enforce the Digital Services Act to protect democracy on social media platforms, including against foreign interference and biased algorithms.” The Digital Services Act (DSA) is the central European Union legislation regulating social media. The EU bigwigs in Brussels are up in arms because Elon Musk had a chat on X with Alice Weidel, leader of the Alternative for Germany. The AfD is an increasingly popular right-wing party which the EU establishment wants to isolate in a cordon sanitaire. According to the European Commission, Ms. Weidel’s chat with Mr. Musk “improperly boosts” her agenda over her political rivals ahead of Germany’s upcoming Feb. 23 elections and constitutes “foreign interference” in the German electoral process. Brussels has also reacted in outrage to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement to end the fact-checking era on Facebook and restore free expression. Zuckerberg regretted that in the past, Facebook had suppressed information, and he confirmed years of systematic online censorship, either on demand of politically biased “fact-checkers” or under direct government pressure. While the American elections were “a cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech,” Mr. Zuckerberg pointed out that Europe has yet to come to the same conclusion. “Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship,” he said. The Meta boss was at once denounced by the European Commission. He is not telling the truth when he says the EU is institutionalizing censorship, European Commission Vice President Henna Virkkunen whined. It is “not true” and “misleading,” she wailed. At the same time, she took a snipe at Elon Musk for his support of AfD on X, threatening the platform with legal sanctions, saying that X has “obligations under our Digital Services Act and X is supposed to assess and mitigate the risks they are posing to our electoral processes and to civic discourse.” Last December, the presidential elections in Romania were annulled after an outsider had surprisingly won the first round with 23 per cent of the vote. According to the EU bigwigs, this was the result of foreign “disinformation” spread via TikTok and other social media platforms. While the EU’s Digital Service Act (DSA) pays lip service to freedom of speech, it acts as an instrument to restrict freedom of speech and censor social media platforms so that “risks to the electoral processes and civic discourse” are “mitigated”. On these platforms, politicians such as I, who were the victims of media bias, but also every citizen, can freely speak our minds and voice our opinions without “mitigation” by the powers that be. The fact that platforms such as X and Facebook are owned by Americans is used as a xenophobic pretext to add “foreign interference” to “the risks to Europe’s electoral processes and civic discourse.” The EU uses the word “democracy” in the same way as the former Communist dictatorship in East-Germany used to call itself the German “Democratic” Republic. In the infamous G“D”R, “democracy” also needed to be protected against critics who were said to be in cahoots with foreign powers. I am the leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), by far the most popular party in the Netherlands. For decades, the PVV and other parties like mine have hardly ever been fairly treated by mainstream journalists. But never did the European Commission voice any concern about how the disinformation about us might “improperly boost” our political adversaries or how it might subvert the “electoral process.” I am not complaining, just pointing out the EU hypocrisy. I am not complaining, because guess what? The scandalous behaviour of the mainstream media had the same effect as water on a duck’s back. It flowed off us. The voters kept coming to us because voters are mature enough to make their own decisions. For decades, we were also the victims of outright censorship by some social media outlets. Parties like mine have been censored online for years. I am one of many like-minded European politicians whose views were banned. Whenever we voiced our opinion on Islamization or mass immigration, so-called fact-checkers had our messages removed as “hate speech”. It happened to me on Twitter — before that company was bought by Elon Musk — and on YouTube. Despite years of social media censorship, however, we kept winning the elections. Voters can feel when they are being lied to. They sense when they are being deceived. They realize well enough that the authorities are deceiving them when social media remains silent about what is happening on the streets of Europe. Indeed, the electorate is mature enough to make their own decisions. Companies like X and Facebook are abandoning censorship. I applaud them for that. The mainstream media say they “sprint to kiss Trump’s ring” and “suck up to the incoming president,” but the decision is plain common sense. Censorship is a costly business and just not worth the effort. The mainstream media refuse to see it, but they are a dying breed. Who cares about what The Guardian writes? Parties such as mine have survived decades of media bias and disinformation; if anything, it has only made us stronger and more popular. Ultimately, we won. This will happen everywhere. Ultimately, freedom and truth will prevail! The only “risk to the electoral processes” that I see in Europe, is the EU “interfering” in elections because Brussels does not like the outcome and claims it has to protect “democracy” against the voters.

Maine Admits Licensing Transnational Criminal Organizations to Grow Marijuana,"Maine’s Office of Cannabis Policy (OCP) Director John Hudak told state legislators he is aware that his office has been issuing marijuana grow licenses to persons associated with Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO). On Wednesday, Hudak told members of the state legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee that his agency cannot deny the medical licensing requests. Hudak told the committee members that state statutes did not give his office the authority to deny the licenses to the suspected Transnational Criminal Organizations. Hudak’s statements were made in response to concerns about illegal cannabis cultivation in parts of Maine that are believed to be controlled by Asian Transnational Criminal Organizations, including those with connections to China. Hudak, a Brookings Institution fellow, told the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee legislators that individuals associated with the TCOs who have had to grow operations raided by authorities in the past are now using the medicinal license application process to continue their illicit activity and avoid law enforcement scrutiny. Hudak elaborated saying “They’re applying so they can have a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card, or what they perceive as a ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card to continue to do the operations that they’re doing.” Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) addressed the issue of foreign criminal organizations operating in her state with FBI Director Christopher Wray during a June FBI budget hearing just days after a Somerset County Sheriff’s Office raid shut down an illegal growing operation that involved 1,500 marijuana plants and more than 30 pounds of processed marijuana. The unlawful growing operation was located adjacent to a daycare. During the hearing, Collins asked Wray, “What is the theory about why Chinese nationals or Chinese Transnational Criminal Organizations are setting up these illegal marijuana growing operations in states like Maine?” Wray responded saying the FBI was actively conducting several investigations into the connections between illegal grow operations and the Chinese government itself. Still, no clear connections had been established at the time. Wray did, however, acknowledge the agency is seeing more ties between the growing operations and Chinese organized crime. As for why the Chinese TCOs are choosing to engage in illicit marijuana cultivation, Wray went on to say, “Our assessment is that it’s a combination of the fact that it is activity that can be done relatively cheaply, and by comparison to other drugs in the United States, the consequences that they face from a legal perspective are not as severe as that they might be in other countries where they might also want to operate.” Collins has spearheaded several efforts to address the issue that she believes is assisting the Chinese TCO’s to launder money for other purposes, including to bring more fentanyl into the country. The latest admission that state licensing officials knowingly provide cover for the illicit growing operations will likely hinder federal efforts to crack down on the foreign TCOs operating within the state.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T14:28:45+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/01/18/maine-admits-licensing-transnational-criminal-organizations-to-grow-marijuana/
GRAPHIC: Cartel Gunmen Behead Rivals as Mexican Officials Claim Crime Dramatically Lower,"Three days of shootouts led to several dead gunmen and a gory beheading as members of the terrorist organization Cartel Jalisco New Generation continued their push for control of the western state of Michoacan. This escalation in violence comes one day before Mexican government officials talked about how crime has decreased in recent weeks. On Friday morning, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and her top security officials held a news conference. During the presentation, they displayed a series of statistics claiming that violence had decreased in states like Sinaloa and Guerrero. They also claimed to have made numerous arrests and seized various weapons, causing noticeable decreases in crime. Hours before the news conference, gunmen from Cartel Jalisco New Generation photographed themselves beheading a rival in the state of Michoacan. The killing came at the end of three days of constant shootouts as CJNG has been pushing into the town of Apatzingan to take over areas controlled by a small cartel called Knights Templar. The latter cartel is allied with a “self-defense” group run by the narco-terrorist Juan Jose “El Abuelo” Farias. As Breitbart Texas first reported last year, several smaller cartels from Michoacan, including Los Viagras, the forces of El Fresa, El Boto, and others, joined forces with CJNG to fight off their rivals. Earlier this year, CJNG and its allies announced that they would be making a push for APatzingan and the surrounding communities and try to push out the Knights Templars. Since then, violence has escalated throughout the state. As Breitbart Texas reported , El Abuelo Farias has a long history of crime in Michoacan and other parts of the country and has been arrested in the past on organized crime and drug trafficking charges. However, in 2018 and other prior cases, Mexican judges ordered his release under suspicious circumstances. For several years, Michoacan has been ground zero to a fierce turf war as various organizations continue to fight for control of lucrative drug production and drug trafficking routes into Mexico.

Ukrainian Police Raid Draft-Dodgers in Nationwide Conscription Searches,"Ukrainian police conducted nationwide raids on draft dodger gangs on Friday as the country battles to generate enough conscripted soldiers to keep its military competitive in the war against Russia without radically widening recruitment criteria. The National Police of Ukraine said they conducted “over 200 searches” of gangs assisting illegal border crossings by adult Ukrainian males, who have been banned from leaving the country since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in 2022. The searches “at the premises of persons involved in illegal transactions” took place in 19 of 27 Ukrainian regions, police said Friday. According to the AFP news agency, the raids against draft dodging-enabling gangs followed searches of 600 addresses last week. In a statement, Ukraine’s police said draft-dodging crimes are “committed through fraud, forgery of documents, unauthorized interference in the operation of electronic registers, and bribery of officials.” Announcing the latest raids, Ukraine’s police published images, including one anonymised picture [top] of officers wearing police and ‘Cyberpolice Department’ patches on their coats accompanying fatigue-wearing armed officers of the national police’s Special Patrol unit. While Ukraine has over a million men in its conscription army, thousands of nationals have evaded call-up orders or registration on the national database. As previously reported in 2023, 20,000 military-aged men were known to have illegally crossed Ukraine’s borders by that point to flee abroad. Ukraine’s border guards said then they had caught another 21,000 at the frontier and brought them back into the country. While many will presumably have fled out of concern for their own lives, attempting to go abroad is not without risks, with the Ukrainian government stating in Spring 2024 that they know of 30 people who died trying to flee the country . A spokesman for the government said those who died had attempted to get out of Ukraine by trying to cross hazardous mountain passes, swimming border rivers, and in some cases, had even been killed by wild animals in the wilderness, presumably bears, which are common in that part of Europe. Some reportedly have frozen to death trying to cross the Carpathian mountains. It is claimed that the recent crackdown on draft dodgers has caused “panic” among those avoiding enlistment and the criminal gangs that support them. Even before this recent change in tactics, military officers in “conscription squads” patrolled the streets of Ukrainian cities, checking the identities of men to ensure they had entered their details in the national database and were not fugitives if call-up papers had been served. In 2024, men were dragged out of a Kyiv nightclub if they were unable to show their identity papers or produce proof of exception from conscription amid overnight raids on restaurants, shops, and music venues. UK broadcaster the BBC noted a wedding of a young Ukrainian couple where half the guests didn’t show up because they were in hiding from conscription and felt turning up was too risky, and noted: “For those avoiding the draft, public transport is now off limits. So, too, are restaurants, supermarkets, and weekend trips to the park to play football.” The broadcaster cited the remarks of one conscription officer who said of the people he was rounding up at train stations: “I don’t consider them men. What are they waiting for? If we run out of men, the enemy will come to their homes, rape their women, and kill their children.” Those caught dodging can face criminal prosecution. But as reported in the Ukrainian press this week , courts can take a lenient view in rare cases. A Poltava man who was discovered to have been served call-up papers but who had ignored them for a year was let off with one year on probation as the judge noted he has an elderly mother who was dependent on his care, has a young child, and that he had made regular donations of money to the military. Ukraine reduced its minimum age of conscription from 27 to 25 last year, a difficult and unpopular decision the government had resisted in a bid to avoid a post-war demographic crisis by risking the deaths of the country’s generation of future parents. The average age of a Ukrainian soldier is in the 40s. There have been protests in Ukraine by groups of wives, mothers, and children against the fact conscription is open-ended and lasts for the duration of the conflict. Protesters state they want their men back and call for a return of the pre-war standard of an 18-month callup.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T12:00:30+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/01/18/ukrainian-police-raid-draft-dodgers-in-nationwide-conscription-searches/
W.H.O. Demands World Give It $1.5 Billion to Handle Emergencies,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) launched a campaign on Thursday urging the world to invest $1.5 billion into its emergency fund – a separate pool of money from its regular operations funding intended to address health crises around the world. W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus launched the campaign at a press conference on Thursday accompanied by an over 100-page brochure detailing the various global health emergencies the W.H.O. intends to address, focusing heavily on the collapse of a functioning state in Afghanistan, poor conditions caused by Hamas terrorists exploiting health centers to hide fighters and terrorists in Gaza, and the spread of cholera, malaria, and monkeypox (mpox) in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.N. agency predicted that it would have to address 42 health emergencies around the world in 2025. The costly appeal follows years of bad press as a result of the W.H.O.’s poor performance under Director-General Tedros. The W.H.O. was at the forefront of efforts in early 2020 to assure global observers that the highly contagious novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, was not capable of “human-to-human transmission” and later published a report on the origins of the virus so lacking in clarity that Tedros himself condemned it. Scores of women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have accused W.H.O. staffers of raping them for forcing them to have sex for much-needed jobs or other humanitarian needs. In 2023, the W.H.O. paid some of the victims $250 and offered them baking classes. Tedros obtained a second term at the helm of the world’s largest public health body in 2022 in an election in which he ran unopposed. The W.H.O. emergency appeal touted the agency’s work in DRC, among other countries, as a prime reason for requesting upwards of a billion dollars in additional funding. The breakdown of how the agency expected to spend that money listed DRC as one of the least expensive crises for 2025, however, using up only about $2 million of the $1.5 billion requested. The most expensive crisis on the list is that in Gaza, labeled as the “occupied Palestinian territory.” The W.H.O. is asking for nearly $300 million to address the situation in the war-torn area controlled by Hamas for nearly two decades. The W.H.O. is also asking for $141 million to offer health care and other aid to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of the Assad family dynasty in December. The ongoing crisis in Sudan, it predicted, would require $135 million to address in 2025. “The climate crisis, increasingly frequent and severe disasters, and unprecedented levels of conflict are jeopardizing health and decimating health systems, making those displaced more susceptible to disease, and disrupting lifesaving, vaccinations and care, particularly for children,” Tedros and W.H.O. Emergencies Director Michael Ryan wrote in a message accompanying the appeal. “We are no longer moving from emergency to recovery but instead enduring rolling crises that extend across years and decades, making health services inaccessible to many,” they continued. “Yet, as the urgent need for assistance grows, the global financial landscape is shrinking, forcing us to make increasingly difficult decisions about whom we can reach and how far we can go.” In a press conference to announce the push, Tedros insisted that health crises in the modern era were “relentless, overlapping, and intensifying.” “Without adequate and sustainable funding we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not,” he noted grimly. The two branded offering funding to the W.H.O. a “powerful act of global solidarity” that could “save lives … uphold the universal right to health, and to help restore peace to communities.” The appeal emphasized that this $1.5 billion is intended for the W.H.O. Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE), not the general pool of funding for the W.H.O. The CFE is distinct from general funding in that it is easier and faster to use those funds and is intended, the agency explained, to “revolutionize how public health emergencies are addressed.” While claiming the funds will be used to address health emergencies explicitly, the appeal’s brochure repeatedly emphasizes the agency’s fixation on “climate change,” declaring it “a health crisis” itself “wreaking havoc on human health, societies, economies, and overwhelming health care systems worldwide.” “Climate-induced disasters, including floods, droughts, and heatwaves, are intensifying disease outbreaks and worsening health inequities,” the W.H.O. claimed. “WHO leads emergency responses and builds resilience in health systems to mitigate these impacts.” The agency also claimed the money would help in the “prevention of sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment, asserting it would fund “strengthening the prevention of, and response to, genderbased violence, including capacity-building and increased accountability within W.H.O.” This commitment did not specifically address the ongoing sexual abuse scandal in DRC. The W.H.O.’s appeal arrived less than a week before the United States, one of the W.H.O.’s most generous donors historically, welcomes President-elect Donald Trump into the White House once again. Trump famously cut funding and withdrew from the agency in 2020 in response to its catastrophic handling of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, declaring that the W.H.O. “failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable.” Outgoing President Joe Biden reintegrated America into the W.H.O. and restored funding. Multiple reports following Trump’s election in November indicated that the president-elect is planning to withdraw from the W.H.O. “immediately” after taking office.",Breitbart,2025-01-18T04:20:44+00:00,National Security,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/health/2025/01/17/w-h-o-demands-world-1-5-billion-emergencies/
Exclusive—Sen. Tim Sheehy Ushers in Bold New Era of MAGA Leadership: ‘This Country Was Not Founded by 65-Year-Old Bureaucrats’,"The United States “was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats” but by patriotic young risk takers, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) explained in a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Marlow opined that officials in President Joe Biden’s administration like Attorney General Merrick Garland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had “no leadership qualities.” He questioned why the Democrats support these establishment politicians and get “offended” when Republicans support “natural leaders” who are “outside the box thinkers” like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pete Hegseth, who have been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve in his new administration. Sheehy agreed that “leadership matters” and said that the U.S. is dealing with multiple disasters–such as rising inflation and a “wide open border”–because the country is being led by bureaucrats who have “really never done anything else in their” lives outside of politics. “Leadership matters and decisiveness matters, and this country was not founded by 65-year-old bureaucrats,” Sheehy said. “The signers of the Declaration of Independence, I think the average age of the signers was like 24 years old. I mean, you look at — some of them were 18, 19, 21 years old. Thomas Jefferson was 33… These were young people who had a vision for the greatest experiment in the history of mankind, which is this country.” “It wasn’t 80-year-old, career government bureaucrats who took the risk to craft a new concept of human governance,” he continued. “It was young people who were creative, who had a decisive vision and were willing to take the risk to act on it.” Sheehy added that “in the last 50 years,” the U.S. “drifted away” from having younger political leaders and shifted instead towards having “highly educated, highly qualified, very experienced, bureaucrats to run the government.” “This technocrat concept, which, you know, Obama put that on afterburners and Biden just took it to a whole level further,” Sheehy continued. “This whole technocrat outlook–where we need these people who’ve really never done anything else in their life other than be involved in government policy–and the downfall of that is exactly what we’re seeing. The results are laid bare: Afghanistan disaster; $36 trillion in debt and growing rapidly disaster; wide open border; 20 million illegal immigrants; we have foreign policy crises around the world; rapid inflation; record interest rates.” “Pick a category that’s going well and show it to me, because I don’t think there’s any of them,” Sheehy concluded. “And, we’ve been led there by people who are apparently so highly qualified to be doing it.” The Alex Marlow Show , hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Exclusive—‘No Excuse’: Former Aerial Firefighter Sen. Tim Sheehy Details What CA Got Wrong Ahead of Wildfire Disaster,"There was “no excuse” for California not to be prepared for the wildfires engulfing Los Angeles County, Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT), a former aerial firefighter, explained during a Friday interview on The Alex Marlow Show with Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. Sheehy detailed the scope of the Los Angeles wildfires, the government’s role in the disaster, and the environmental policies that make firefighting more difficult. Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL who founded the aerial fire fighting company Bridger Aerospace, explained that “the entire wildland fire community” has been sounding the alarm for years that “we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness” in fighting wildfires. Sheehy noted that over the past 18 months there have been increasingly destructive wildfires in states as far-flung as Hawaii, New Jersey, and Texas; and, thus, he argued that there was “no excuse” for California to have been unprepared for a similar situation. “It’s not just me saying it,” he said. “The entire wildland fire community has really been screaming from the rooftops for years that we are entering an era of complete unpreparedness for these types of disasters. Just look at the last 18 months. Lahaina, Maui — remember that was wiped off the map? One hundred people [were] killed. In December and November, we had fires burning in New Jersey. Last year in February, March, we had the Smokehouse Creek fire in Texas, [the] largest fire in Texas history, second largest fire in American history. And then, of course, now we’re seeing literally… L.A. burning to the ground in front of us.” Sheehy added that wildfires were “threats we can prepare for and can fight.” “What we’re seeing in L.A. particularly is the confluence and culmination of decades of wrong-headed policies that have put common sense on the back burner and instead prioritized a bunch of really goofy priorities,” he said. He noted that the wildfires that occurred in California were not a “Pearl Harbor moment where the first time it ever happened, nobody saw it happen.” “This has been happening all the time. I mean, Paradise, California, wiped off the map; Lahaina, Maui, wiped off the map; as I said all the other fires I listed,” Sheehy explained. “This threat is not a one-time out-of-nowhere typhoon. This is something that happens every single year for decades. And there’s no excuse not to be prepared. I think for those in the industry, we were more prepared about 30, 40 years ago. We had a far more supportive environment for what we called full suppression, which is when we basically have a lot of helicopters, a lot of airplanes, a lot of firefighters ready to go.” Sheehy explained that we had been seeing a “massive decrease in suppression preparedness,” and he attributed the decrease in wildfire suppression preparedness to environmentalists who have “taken over” and said, “‘Nope, fighting fire is bad.'” He noted in particular the resistance from environmentalists to the use of water additives in fighting fires. “Every other country in the world that fights wildfire puts foam and gel additives into the water so when they spray the fire, just like a fire extinguisher, the water foams up and is three to six times more effective to suppress that fire,” Sheehy explained. “Every other country in the world does that, except for, ding, ding, ding, America. And, why? Because the environmentalists have said, ‘Nope, those foams could be bad for the endangered goldfish in that pond, so therefore you can’t use that.'” “Two things can be true,” Sheehy added. “We can want to protect our environment and take care of our endangered species. We can also want to protect our communities and protect our people from getting burned alive and their houses burned down. We can do both. Right now, we’ve chosen, instead to prioritize the protection of spotted owls, and trees, and salamanders, and goldfish instead of our communities.” The Alex Marlow Show , hosted by Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow, is a weekday podcast produced by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

Elizabeth Warren Accuses Longtime Democrat Donor Sam Altman of Seeking 'Favors' from Trump After $1 Million Inaugural Donation,"Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) in a letter to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accused the tech entrepreneur of wanting “favors” from President-elect Donald Trump after donating $1 million to his inaugural committee; Altman has been a longtime donor to Democrats. “Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats…,” Altman wrote on X, sharing the letter he received from the two Senate Democrats. Altman has confirmed to outlets he plans to attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday. It appears that the two Democrats have accused Altman of seeking some form of a quid-pro-quo scheme. “You have a clear and direct interest in obtaining favors from the incoming administration: your company and many other Big Tech donors are already the subject of ongoing federal investigations and regulatory actions,” Warren and Bennet claimed. The two continued, saying that the “industry’s efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules.” “This would be good for billionaire tech executives, but is bad for America,” they added. Warren and Bennet also said that the donation “raise[s] questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration.” The two Senate Democrats are attacking the OpenAI CEO as many outlets have reported that Altman has overwhelmingly donated to Democrats over Republicans. In one July report, Newsweek wrote that Altman has donated to hundreds of Democrats and just one Republican. Even a cursory glance at federal election databases show that Altman has been a major funder of the Democrat Party. Altman wrote on X that his own donation “was a personal contribution as you state; i am confused about the questions given that my company did not make a decision.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T02:02:37+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/elizabeth-warren-accuses-longtime-democrat-donor-sam-altman-of-seeking-favors-from-trump-after-1-million-inaugural-donation/
First Female Los Angeles Fire Chief Faces Calls to Resign as Blazes Rage On,"Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Chief Kristin Crowley, the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the position, is facing calls to resign as the destructive wildfires rage on in Southern California. Crowley has found herself in an awkward situation with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D), who has also received demands to step down, after she said the city “failed” her department and claimed that budget cuts “limited” their ability to respond to “large-scale events.” The fire chief, who was appointed by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) in 2022, then “disappeared” into a closed-door meeting in Bass’s office last Friday “for so long that they missed an evening news briefing,” the New York Times reported. Sources close to the situation told the Daily Mail that the mayor summoned Crowley to her office to fire her but said, “Whatever happened in that meeting, minds got changed.” “[Crowley] was going into the meeting, telling everybody goodbye, because she was told the whole purpose of the meeting was to fire her,” the source told the U.K. outlet. By the next morning, the Times reported that the chief and the mayor were “projecting a unified front, though the tension was apparent.” “The chief and I are in lock step,” the mayor, who also entered her role in 2022, said. “And if there are differences that we have, we will continue to deal with those in private.” Firefighters are still trying to extinguish the nearly 40,000 acres of active wildfires, which have killed at least 27 people since they began on January 7, NBC News reported. The drama intensified when active and retired LAFD battalion chiefs and administrators wrote a scathing letter demanding that Crowley step down: Arguing that the chief’s statement that the city “failed” her department was “ill-advised” and “poorly timed,” the coalition of unnamed current and former local fire officials concluded that Crowley has “lost the confidence of the Mayor and more importantly you have lost the confidence of many Chief Officers of the LAFD.” The group also claimed in the letter that the controversial chief knew about the LAFD’s budget issues before she entered the role but “went along” with the budget cuts, per NewsNation: Another large portion of criticism directed at the department’s leader stems from the fact that a shift of about 1,000 firefighters were “not on standby” when powerful winds swept through Los Angeles, picking up embers and rapidly spreading the flames, the California Globe reported. There also were not any additional firetrucks positioned in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood — where the initial major blaze sparked last Tuesday — in advance, the outlet noted. “Positioning firefighters and equipment near fire zones in significant numbers well in advance during periods of high wildfire danger has long been a key strategy in the department,” said former LAFD assistant chief and current Redondo Beach Fire Department Chief Patrick Butler. “It’s unfathomable to me how this happened, except for extreme incompetence and no understanding of fire operations,” he said. Los Angeles County pollster Manny Rodriguez told the Globe that he does not see a scenario where both Crowley and Bass “are still in office by the end of 2025.”",Breitbart,2025-01-18T01:39:28+00:00,Politics,Polarised,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/01/17/first-female-los-angeles-fire-chief-facing-calls-resign-blazes-rage/
How the right is justifying—and even celebrating—Musk’s Nazi salute,"Feeling emboldened by Donald Trump officially being sworn in as president, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, gave a nod to Germany’s Nazi Party—you know, the one thatkilled six millionJewish people and started World War II. “Thank you for making it happen,” Musk said to the raucous MAGA crowd during an inaugural event speech, which he wrapped up by doing the “Sieg Heil,” or Nazi salute—twice, just to clear up the possibility that it might have been an unintentional slip-up. Obviously, people have been expressing their reactions of shock and disgust on social media from around the world—except, of course, by far-right Trump supporters and white nationalists, who justified and praised the salute. “I studied the Nazis at university, taught the history of Nazi Germany on two continents and wrote for major newspapers about Nazi Germany,” Mike Stuchberywrote on X. “I am internet famous for fact-checking chuds on the history, ideology and policy of Nazi Germany. That was a Nazi salute.” “For every dingbat posting Kamala or [Hillary] waving... they're not doing the wind-up, hand to heart which is the hallmark of the Nazi/fascist salute,” Stuchbery said inanother post. Democrats in Europe were equally aghast, with Spanish Minister of Labor and Social Economy Yolanda Díazdeciding to leaveX after “the entire world witnessed Elon Musk mimicking a Nazi salute during Donald Trump’s inauguration.” Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholzsaidat the World Economic Forum Tuesday that Musk has the right to free speech, but “what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions.” Muskrespondedon his platform X on Monday in an attempt to downplay his Nazi gesture. “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired,” he wrote. Meanwhile, corporate media coverage of Trump has beenoverwhelmingly positive, with POLITICO co-founder John F. Harris writing that Trump is a “great president.” The Washington PostlabeledMusk’s Nazi salute as merely “exuberant speech,” and The New York Times explained it away with theheadline, “Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture.” So we’re watering down Nazi salutes as “hand gestures” now? To add insult to injury, the Anti-Defamation League, a pro-Israel and Jewish advocacy organization, defended Musk,sayingthat he “made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quicklyrespondedto the ADL’s statement. “Just to be clear, you are defending a Heil Hitler salute that was performed and repeated for emphasis and clarity. People can officially stop listening to you as any sort of reputable source of information now. You work for them. Thank you for making that crystal clear to all,” she wrote. During her hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New Yorkdeniedthat Musk did a Nazi salute whenasked about itby Sen. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. Meanwhile, white nationalist and far-right commentators like self-identified “Christian” Evan KilgorepraisedMusk’s salute. “Holy crap… Did[Musk]  just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington D.C… This is incredible,” he wrote. But after criticism came roaring in, Kilgorebacktrackedby insulting everyone with autism whodoesn’tsalute Nazis. “Elon Musk is autistic. He was excited. We all know his intentions weren't to make a Sieg Heil,” he wrote. “It looked much more like a Roman Salute. Can we all have a sense of humor for 5 seconds?” Andrew Torba, founder and CEO of theextremist and conspiratorialplatform Gab,sharedthe photo of Musk doing the Nazi salute with the caption, “Incredible things are happening.” “Incredible” is certainly one way to put it. This moment—and the four years to come—will serve as a significant flashpoint in the slow, steady battle over the normalization of fascism and oligarchy in U.S. politics and culture.

Trump immediately reminds America of his pettiness and fragile ego,"Less than 24 hours into his second term, Donald Trump is already trying to settle scores with his perceived enemies, taking multiple petty actions to stroke his giant and fragile ego. Less than two hours after being sworn in, Trump had a portrait of Gen. Mark Milley—the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who called Trump a “fascist” and a ""dangerous"" person—removed from the Pentagon, The New York Timesreported. The portrait had beenunveiledjust 10 days ago.  Milley is one of the people Trumpput on his enemies list. Trump's hatred of Milley runs so deep that former President Joe Biden gave Milley apreemptive pardonto prevent Trump from ordering his administration to prosecute Milley for whatever made-up crimes they could conjure up. Milley said he was grateful for Biden's pardon. “I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,"" he said in a statement. “I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.” Trump also announced that he removed four people Biden appointed, including Milley. Trumpwrotein a post on X: Andres is a humanitarian who has beennominatedfor a Nobel Peace Prize for his work with the World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit he founded that feeds people suffering from natural disasters, war, and poverty. Andres wrote in a post on X that he couldn't be removed from his position because he already resigned a week ago. Andreswrote: Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta and later worked in the Biden White House as the director of the Office of Public Engagement. Like Andres, Bottoms said she already left her position so Trump's ""firing"" was moot. ""A day late and a dollar short ... My resignation from the President’s Export Council was submitted January 4, effective yesterday,” Bottomssaid. “You can’t fire someone who has already resigned. Of all the things happening in the world, not sure why I’m on Donald Trump’s mind at 1:30 am following his inauguration, but I count it as a badge of honor.” And it’s unclear why he targeted Hook, who actuallyservedin Trump's first administration as an envoy to Iran. As for other pettiness, following Trump'sdark and low-energy inaugural address, he gaverambling 30-minute remarksin which he complained about his 2024 victory and lied about voter fraud, falsely saying he “would have won the state of California” in 2024 were it not for fraud. In thoseremarks, Trump also falsely accused Milley as well as the members of Congress who investigated the Capitol insurrection of being guilty of “very, very guilty of very, very bad crimes”—making Biden’s preemptive pardons look well justified. Ultimately, Trump’s first day in office was anabject disasterthat proved his detractors right when they warned that his second term would be four years of Trump going after anyone who he deems insufficiently subservient.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 21:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298193/-Trump-immediately-reminds-America-of-his-pettiness-and-fragile-ego
Why the internet is blaming a billionaire couple for California fires,"Online creators have been buzzing aboutStewart and Lynda Resnick, billionaires who own a portion of Southern California’s water supply, claiming that the couple is to blame for fire hydrantsrunning dryamid the ongoing wildfires across the region. But while the Resnicks have areputationfor being the “California couple who uses more water than every home in Los Angeles combined,” the blame is actually misplaced. The Resnicks made their billions from theirWonderful Company, which produces foods like Wonderful Pistachios, POM pomegranate juice, and Halo tangerines. In 1994, the Resnicks signed acontroversial backroom dealsecuring 58% of the Kern Water Bank. But according toCBS News, California’s water laws allow owners the right to usage, not ownership of the water itself. Moreover, the state actually has laws prohibiting people from withholding or hoarding water. Felicia Marcus, former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board, told CBS News that the state constitution includes a ""prohibition against waste and unreasonable use."" In other words, if ""you actually ended up in a situation where somebody was withholding water at a grand scale,"" the government could step in. The Resnicks, whopledged $10 millionfrom Wonderful Companyfor wildfire relief efforts,are just one example of the misinformed blame-throwing going on since the fires started. President Donald Trumpfalsely claimedthat California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s failure to sign a “water restoration declaration” was the reason for water supply shortages. Newsom’s office later noted that “no such document” even exists. Other finger pointing was aimed atAI and tech companies, where social media users quickly circulated claims that super computers used up the water supplies desperately needed by the firefighters. Thereal reasonfor the lack of water, however, is much more complicated. And, even more so, Los Angeles was simply not equipped for a natural disaster of this scale even with water supplies at a historical high. ""What's happening in LA is not because there's not enough water in LA in storage,"" Marcus said. ""There are no urban water systems that are built out to handle a firestorm like this."" At the end of the day, people are angry and scared. Many have lost their homes, their financial safety net, and their sense of security. And as of Jan. 16,at least 27 peopledied in the fires. While conditions have eased, allowing firefighters to push back the flames, the ultra-dry conditions have expertsconcerned about future vulnerability. For those looking to help out but not sure where to start, disaster relief expertIrwin Redlenertold Daily Kos that it’s not always helpful to throw money at large nonprofits like American Red Cross, since they often already have large endowments for disasters. Instead, he recommends supporting charities at the local level, including churches. But even that, unfortunately, can be complicated as it’s difficult to trace where exactly funds are going. “It's hard for the consumer to tell what is actually most effective,” he said, adding thatCharity Navigatoris a helpful tool for assessing a charity’s effectiveness. Redlener also pointed out that the destruction from the California wildfires will last much longer than the media coverage. “It will disappear from the front pages of news organizations, and it will be replaced by other issues. And, ironically, that may be the time when we really need to be thinking about what's happening to the people who have been affected by the disaster,” he said. “So sometimes it might be worth it for people to sort of hold on to their generosity.” ",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 20:00:22,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2297340/-Why-the-internet-is-blaming-a-billionaire-couple-for-California-fires
'Great president': Mainstream media slobbers all over Trump,"Early in Donald Trump’s new presidency, mainstream media outlets confirmed fears of how they would cover him—by avoiding the truth, equivocating on his abuse of power, and even praising him. The actions by widely read and watched outlets was the continuation of a recent trend that has seen outlets likeABC News,MSNBC, andThe Washington Postcave to Trump, even before he was sworn in.  “Time to Admit It: Trump Is a Great President,” readsthe beginning of a Politico headlinepublished Tuesday. Contrary to its appearance, the column was not written by Trump himself or even one of his many MAGA acolytes in the media. Instead, it is the work of Politico co-founder and current Global Editor-in-Chief John F. Harris, a longtime mainstay of Washington journalism. The gushing goes beyond the headline as Harris writes, “[Trump] is someone with an ability to perceive opportunities that most politicians do not and forge powerful, sustained connections with large swaths of people in ways that no contemporary can match. In other words: He is a force of history.” When the mainstream press isn’t prematurely declaring Trump’s greatness (and ignoring thedeath tollof his previous stint of making America “great”), it equivocated on one of his first acts, which gave a green light to hundreds of criminals. Trumppardoned about 1,500 people convictedof attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, over the protests of millions—including the police officersbattered and bruised by insurrectionists attempting to overturn the election. ButatThe Washington Post, this was the equivalent of President Joe Biden’sdecisionto preemptively pardon figures like Anthony Fauci, retired Army Gen. Mark Milley, and members of the Jan. 6 congressional committee whom Trump and his MAGA movement have targeted. “Biden started the day with pardons. Trump finished with many more,” reads the Post headline—as if pardoning Enrique Tarrio, convicted of sedition against the United States, is the same thing as pardoning Dr. Fauci, who MAGA world hates for the sin of telling Americans to mask up during a global pandemic. Things aren’t much better at The New York Times.Their headlineon Trump’s pardons: “In Dueling Pardons, an Intensified Fight Over the Meaning of Jan. 6.” Apparently, the Times believes that Biden issuing a pardon to Milley, whom Trump has lambasted for calling him a “fascist,” is on the same level as Trump’s pardon of the man who stormed the Capitol with a “Camp Auschwitz” hoodie. At a post-inauguration rally for Trump, his Co-President andcampaign benefactorElon Musk—the richest person in the world—gave a Nazi salute. Twice. Yet,atThe Washington Post, it was merely an “exuberant speech.” Meanwhile, forThe New York Times, the furor at the hand motion was explained away: “Elon Musk Ignites Online Speculation Over the Meaning of a Hand Gesture.” Meanwhile, NBC’s Chicago affiliate apparentlyposted a videoof Musk’s speech where the feed cut to a shot of the audience at the precise moments of the offensive salutes.  Over the course of the 2024 election, the mainstream pressmade clearthat it would prioritize criticism of Democrats like Biden and Vice President Harris while playing down offenses by Trump. Now that Trump is back in the Oval Office, the press is continuing that trend. The press has long been described as the watchdogs of democracy, but these outlets show that the watchdog has gone on a break.

Trump's speech raises the old question: Is he evil or merely stupid?,"In Donald Trump’s new conceit, America was a hellhole in 2016, he made it great, then former President Joe Biden broke everything, but thanks to Trump’s 2024 election win, everything will be great again. Or, as he said inhis inaugural addresson Monday, “The golden age of America begins right now.” You know he is full of shit. I know he’s full of shit. We’d like to think everyone around him knows so as well, but doeshe? It’s the age-old question: Is Trump evil or merely stupid? Ifhis inaugural speechsays anything, it’s that he is delusional in what he thinks he can accomplish. After some throat clearing, Trump’s speech begins: One of Trump’s conceits is that other countries no longer respect the United States but that they did respect us when he was president—a time when the world literallylaughed at him. Right off the bat, we find out that Trump has no intentions of uniting the country. Rather, he’ll be airing his usual grievances—Trump’s 24/7/365 celebration ofFestivus. Trump wants to end the weaponization of the Justice Department? So patently absurd, especially as Trumpfrequently talks aboutall his enemies he wants to prosecute. Just this past Saturday, heshared a poston his Truth Social platform that called for Democratic politicians to be prosecuted. It’s going to be an exhausting four years. Sunlight is pouring over the world, y’all. Imagine the gall of saying that when the front row of your inauguration audience—in front of your Cabinet picks—is the modern American oligarchy: Net worthof those pictured as of Tuesday morning: Tesla CEO Elon Musk: $425 billion Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos: $241 billion Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg: $212 billion Google CEO Sundar Pichai:$1.3 billion Add in Bernard Arnault, whoalso attendedand whose familial net worth is $181 billion, and you get a combined net worth of nearly $1.1 trillion. TRILLION. Four of the five richest men in the world were there, and it’s possible all five were if Trump pal Larry Ellison was also somewhere in the crowd. Trump will stand there and talk about “extracted … wealth from our citizens” when he seems to havejustpulled apump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemeon his own followers? It’s telling that when talking about national disasters, his real empathy has always been for the wealthy: Maybe those powerful and wealthy individuals can pay their fair share of taxes to support those services? Not to mention the brutal insult to the firefighters bravely fighting those fires in Los Angeles. Also,Trump cut the FEMA budgetlast time he was president. You better believe it’ll get hacked this time around as well. It won’t be remembered as such. Why would it be? Sheesh. And no, the nation isn’t unifying. It’sjust as divided as always. In any case, Trump then starts with his promises, leading with sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants. As I’ve written before,good luck with that. Even his own border czar, Tom Homan, is trying to temper expectations. The U.S. is already atop energy exporterin the world. Trump will soon take credit for somethingBiden has largely done. Given the climate crisis, though, this may not actually be a good thing. Congrats, Elon Musk, who owns the electric car company Tesla. Also, the Green New Deal isn’t law. Is Trump talking about green energy projects under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act? In one of those inexplicable things Democrats keep doing to themselves, the bulk of investment from that lawwent to red congressional districts. And those Republicansdon’t want to give up that sweet federal cash. Me, I’m actually rooting for Trump to kill those projects. If Republican voters want federal investment in their communities, they can vote Democratic next time. And when Democrats have power, they need to spend that money ontheirconstituents. Build those factories in blue cities and states. Give them a reason tokeepvoting Democratic. Because watching their tax dollars go to ingrate conservatives isn’t doing the party any good. Every business leader, including those sitting in Trump’s inauguration audience, knows that this will be a tax on American consumers. Along with any deportations the administration manages, this will prove to be deeply inflationary. So all those people complaining about the price of eggs? Buckle down—it’s about to get much worse. Also, there’s already an “External Revenue Service.” It’s thecustomspart of the U.S.Customsand Border Protection agency. Put a pin on this one. Itwon’t age well. Cruelty will certainly be the official policy of the United States. I’m gonna have to research what “radical political theories” he’s talking about. Is itwomen in combat? I bet it’s women in combat roles. Our armed forces are facing arecruiting crisis. Trump wants to make it worse. I’m laughing too! Trump’s a loon. He also claims he’ll take back thePanama Canal. But remember, he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker and unifier, as he threatens Panama (andGreenland and Denmark, andCanada, among other allies). He wants to keep kids disease-free … and yet he wantsa vaccine denierto lead the Department of Health and Human Services … all while being the dude wholovesMcDonald’s. He wants his legacy to be peace, and nothing says “peace” more than actual, literal imperialism. So … is his vision of “unity” and “peace” actually more like “world conquest”? Sure seems that way. Because nothing says “angry, violent, and totally unpredictable” like Trump himself and his MAGA movement. Indeed, if there’sanythingwe are sure to see over the next four years it’s more anger, violence, and unpredictability, courtesy of Trump. That is already his legacy, andeverythinghe is pushing for—deportations, inflationary tariffs, anti-trans hate, and imperialism—will only further cement that legacy.",Daily Kos,2025-01-21 17:00:09,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/21/2298037/-Trump-s-speech-raises-the-old-question-Is-he-evil-or-merely-stupid
Trump hit with barrage of lawsuits over his lawless Day 1 actions,"Just hours into his second term, Donald Trump has been hit with multiple different lawsuits. The lawsuits are challenging his spate of lawless executive orders that hesigned from a big boy deskin front of a crowd of his economically anxious supporters wholeft thousands of dollars worth of their belongingsoutside of the Capitol One Arena Monday afternoon. The lawsuits target everything from Trump'sblatantly unconstitutional executive orderthat reinterprets the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, to his toothless Department of Government Efficiency advisory commission. And more lawsuitscould be on the way. The ACLUsuedTrump over his executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, which is plainly guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Trump’s executive order states that the 14th Amendment doesn’t apply to people born to undocumented parents, and thus those people should not be given birth certificates. From theorder: The ACLU said in its lawsuit that this order violates the Supreme Court’s ruling inUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark. “The Supreme Court conclusively determined that all children born in the United States are citizens, subject only to very limited exceptions,” the ACLU lawsuit said of theWong Kim Arkdecision. “This order seeks to repeat one of the gravest errors in American history, by creating a permanent subclass of people born in the U.S. who are denied full rights as Americans,” Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,saidin a statement. “We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail.” Trump’s executive order creatingDOGE, meanwhile, was hit with three lawsuits, all of which allege that the fake government department violates theFederal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which defines how such committees operate. The public interest law firm National Security Counselors was first out the gate in suing the advisory commission led by co-President andNazi saluterElon Musk. (DOGE was also supposed to be led by billionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but Ramaswamy was reportedlyoustedbefore his job even began. He is preparing to launch a bid for governor in Ohio, as his fetish for losing elections can’t be suppressed.) The NSC lawsuitsaysthat under the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, DOGE is considered a “federal advisory committee"" and thus must ""be balanced in terms of points of view represented,"" have public meetings held with 15 days of advance notice and have minutes available to the public. DOGE follows none of those rules. Asecondlawsuit from six public interest groups, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, also alleges that DOGE violates FACA. ""DOGE’s unchecked secrecy, access, and private influence—bought by political loyalty—is anathema to efficient, effective government. Indeed, any federally endorsed, but fundamentally private, advisory effort to shape how our government serves the American people must comply with federal transparency laws, including FACA. Defendants have not done so,” the lawsuit states. And athirdsuit from Public Citizen, State Democracy Defenders Fund, and the American Federation of Government Employees, also says DOGE is in violation of FACA. “AFGE will not stand idly by as a secretive group of ultra-wealthy individuals with major conflicts of interest attempt to deregulate themselves and give their own companies sweetheart government contracts while firing civil servants and dismantling the institutions designed to serve the American people,” American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelleysaidin a statement. Finally, the National Treasury Employees Union filedsuitover Trump'sexecutive orderthat seeks to make it easier for him to fire federal employees. “When establishing hiring principles, Congress determined that most federal government jobs be in the merit-based, competitive service. And it established that most federal employees have due process rights if their agency employer wants to remove them from employment. Because the Policy/Career Executive Order attempts to divest federal employees of these due process rights, it is contrary to congressional intent,” the lawsuit states. “This order is about administering political loyalty tests to everyday employees in the federal workforce who took an oath to uphold the Constitution and serve their country,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in astatementto Bloomberg Law. Of course, Trump doesn't care about following the law, as he thinks he is above it, so it's unclear if he would even follow court orders that arise from these lawsuits. Already, he is blatantly violatingthe law that banned TikTokby signing an executive orderpausingthe app ban. NPRreported: So much for Republicans being the party of law and order.

Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of “law and order,” one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump’s pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost “patriots” and “hostages” in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned,” he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump’s actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio’s caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump’s action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading “Camp Auschwitz,” referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump’s action. “One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,” Gonelltold HuffPost. “It’s a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It’s a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again.” Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, “This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump’s pardons,writing, “President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists.”  One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that “these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.” The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.’s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “I don't think it's causing much controversy.” She later added, “President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system.” Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.

Why is Trump stockpiling so much cash?,"Business leaders and wealthy donors are surrendering to President Donald Trump’s demands for more money, and his team said it expects to amass an eye-popping $500 million by summer. According toAxios, Trump is hoarding cash partly because he doesn’t want his second administration to be seen as a lame duck, even though he’s constitutionally prohibited from running again. Of course, the fundraising efforts will benefit Trump first and foremost. With half a billion dollars in his coffers, Trump could surely continue wielding control over the GOP, using the money to punish his dissenters. “The money is just pouring in at Mar-a-Lago. Trump doesn’t have to lift a finger. Everyone’s coming to him,” one anonymous Trump adviser told Axios. The adviser added that Trump’s team is “on track” to raise $500 million by June. “It’s sort of a target but it’s just a realistic projection of what’s happening.” The money is feeding into several accounts, including Trump’s inauguration fund, the MAGA Inc. super PAC, the Securing American Greatness nonprofit, the Republican National Committee, and the fund for Trump’s future presidential library. While it’s been thoroughly reported that business and tech moguls aremajor Trump donorsand were beingrewarded with plum seatsat Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, people from the cryptocurrency industry are blowing them out of the water. A Trump adviser told Axios that “crypto guys” were giving as much as $20 million. Notably, it’s not just tech and crypto bros added to Trump’s treasure trove of cash. The donors come from a wide range of industries—from agriculture and insurance to finance to health care. These donations are a stark change from what we saw four years ago, when some companiespledged to rethink or withholdtheir donations from Republican lawmakers whovoted to overturnthe results of the 2020 election. While many of those companies later resumed their donations, Trump apparently kept a list of those who didn’t and is reminding them thatthey’ll only get richer once he’s back in the White House. “You guys made this amount of money last year and you’re gonna make so much more now because of me,” Trump told the representatives of one company, according to Axios. Trump is also apparently holding a grudge over the fact that some of the donors now knuckling under were nowhere to be found during his 2024 presidential campaign. One company’s consultant told Axios that Trump was “raking [a client and future donor] over the coals” after they paused donations. “When I needed you, where the fuck were you? You weren’t with me and maybe you were with [Vice President Kamala Harris],” Trump reportedly said. But he has made clear that his newfound treasure trove of cash won’t go toward benefitting those who donated. A second Trump adviser put it plainly: “He’ll take your money and then tell you, ‘I don't give a fuck what you want.’ He did that during the campaign. … He’s going to do what he wants, what the base wants.” This hasn’t stopped the donations from pouring in, however. Axios reported that some donors are holding out hope that getting back on Trump’s good side—even if they don’t get any tangible legislative rewards for their giving—is worth it. After all, getting on Trump’s bad side is known to negatively affect companies,just look at Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Plus, in the words of one anonymous lobbyist who spoke with Axios, these companies don’t want to “get DOGE’d” by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have threatened tocut an unspecified amountof federal spending once they’re co-leading thetoothlessadvisory commission known as the Department of Government Efficiency. With all this money stockpiled—and the abilityto keep raking it in—Trump will surely use it to punish his enemies, reward those who are loyal to him, and help Republicans keep power in Washington, D.C., where they hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate. In life, and in politics especially,money is power. With this, Trump can continue his reign as de facto leader of the GOP for not only his next four years in the White House but also long afterward.

9 Trump inauguration promises that won't lower the price of your eggs,"After not putting his hand on the Bible as he took the oath of office, Donald Trump gave an extremely dark and lie-filledinaugural addresson Monday in which he rattled off a list of his priorities—none of which will lower prices for Americans, as he promised to do.   In his speech, Trump bragged about hisnarrowvictory, whined that he’s been “challenged more than any president in our 250 year history,” and ultimately declared that God himself saved Trump so he could “make America great again”—a totally humble thing to say. He then went on to list his priorities, most of which were either immigration related or meaningless gestures meant to hurt vulnerable populations or make him feel macho. In fact, after the official speech was over, Trump spoke to an overflow crowd of his supporters—who were kept out of the Capitol Rotunda where the speech took place so that the cadre ofbillionaire tech brosTrump pals around with could get front-row seats—telling them that his advisers really wanted him to talk more about inflation, but he refused. ""How many times can you say an apple has doubled in cost?"" Trumpsaidin a rambling speech in which he went on to complain about his 2024 victory again and said he would have won California if it were not for fraud—a complete lie.   In any event, here are the promises Trump made in his inaugural address that won't help your pocket book and could actually make your finances worse: ""I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,” Trump said, invoking the Nazi-esque language about immigrants seeking asylum at the southern border.   Deploying troops to deal with immigrants at the border willcost taxpayers money, and likely won’t make a difference as it islegalto seek asylum in the U.S. “America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth and we are going to use it,” Trump declared. “We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.” Contrary to what Trump said, America is already producing a record amount of crude oil, and is currently the lead oil producer in the world for thesixth consecutive year. What’s more, experts say his “drill baby drill” policy won’t actually lower prices. “This will likely have little to no impact on #gasprices or fuel prices in the short-term, as a President can de-regulate, but there is no direct action that can be issued requiring oil companies to raise production,” Patrick De Haan, a gas prices expert,wrotein a post on X. “I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,” Trump said. “For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues that will be massive amounts of money pouring into our treasury coming from foreign sources.”   Of course, foreign countries do not pay tariffs. Companies in the United States that import goods pay the tariffs, and then they pass those added costs down to consumers, raising prices and causing inflation to soar. Hisnew tariff policywill be destructive to the economy, and your pocket book. “After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I will also sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America,” Trump said. There’s already a thing called the First Amendment that protects speech, so it’s unlikely a toothless executive order will do anything more than give Trump a piece of paper to sign at hisbig boy desk. “As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,” Trump said. This declaration will literally do nothing to make your daily life better, and instead will only hurt transgender Americans, who are already at risk of beingtargets of violenceanddiscrimination. Trump wants to look macho by declaring he will unilaterally change the name of a major body of water. How will this help you, you ask?  It won’t. It’s literally a meaningless gesture. It was such a dumb promise that Hillary Clinton was seen laughing out loud in the audience.   “We will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley to Mt. McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs,” Trump said. “President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.” Alaskans, where Denali is located,don’t even want this, but that’s not stopping Trump from using his sharpie to sign an executive order to make him feel like he’s accomplishing something.  “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made and Panama’s promise to us has been broken,” Trump said. “The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form. And that includes the United States Navy and above all, China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.”   There’s a lot to unpack here. First, American ships are being charged the same as other ships in the canal. And second,China is not operating the canal. Trump has been telling this lie for weeks, leading Panamanian President Jose Mulino todeclarepublicly, “There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God. The world is free to visit the canal.” Trump eventhreatened to use military forceto take back the canal, which would violate Trump’s other inaugural speech promise of not starting any wars. MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow pointed out that conflicting message after Trump’s inaugural address. “He pledged to be a president of peace and not start any new wars but also pledged to forcibly take another country’s territory,” Maddowsaid.  “And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars launching American astronauts to plant the stars and stripes on the planet Mars,” Trump said, a line that really got co-President Elon Musk going.   If this speech is any indication, the next four years are going to be so incredibly stupid. Just 1,461 days to go.

DOGE makes its first cut as 'co-chair' Ramaswamy reportedly dumped,"Awkward entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamyalready appears to be outat the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, multiple media outletsreported, not even making it to Day 1 of the toothless advisory commission. According to CBS News, Ramaswamy is expected to depart the pretend department, after he pissed off Elon Musk, a fellow awkward rich dude who Donald Trumpjointly taskedwith leading the entity that’s supposed to find ways to slash the federal budget. CBS News reported that Ramaswamy was lazy and hasn't been working on the project, leading to friction with Musk. ""Vivek has worn out his welcome,"" an unnamed ""person close to Trump""toldCBS. Rather than actually doing the work to find the $2 trillion in cuts to the budget that he and Musk promised to make, Ramaswamy has instead been trying to get himself a role as an elected official. He had reportedlywanted to be appointedto the Ohio Senate seat vacated by JD Vance, but the current Ohio governor snubbed him andchose someone else. Now, Ramaswamy has his sights set on Ohio’s governorship, and could announce his candidacy for that by the end of the month, Fox Newsreported. There’s nothing Ramaswamy—who ran a failed bid for president in 2024—likes more than losing elections, it seems. As for the future of DOGE, Musk has alreadyadmittedthat the commission, which is not a real department and has no actual power, likely won't even get to half of the $2 billion in cuts he once promised. And the Washington Postreportedthat DOGE is expected to be sued by the public interest law firm National Security Counselors within minutes of Trump’s swearing in. According to the Post’s report: All in all, not a very auspicious start for the DOGE bros. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Musk and Ramaswamyhad said they would cut $2 billion from the budget. The number is actually $2 trillion.

Meet the unlikely Democrats who could revive the weary party,"Democrats have a long four years ahead of them. Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential election loss finds the party in a wake of theories, finger-pointing, and hopeful ideas for how to reignite a fire in voters’ bellies. Part of this quest starts with the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the effort to elect Democrats to positions at the federal, state, and local levels. In other words, the DNC amplifies the message of the Democratic Party as a whole. Following the resignation of DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, Democrats are seeking tofind a new leaderwho excels in areas where the party fell short. A main area in need of improvement: engaging disinterested or alreadyexhausted voters. On Tuesday night, the DNC chair candidatesmet with CHORUS, a teamof progressive online creators, for afirst-of-its-kind forumin an attempt to do just that—and according to the statistics, they succeeded. A real-time poll during the event showed that 85% of the people tuning into the livestream were watching a DNC forum for the first time The candidates vying for the chair position include:Wisconsin Democratic chair Ben Wikler; Minnesota party chair Ken Martin; former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; 2022 Arkansas congressional candidate Quintessa Hathaway; self-help guru Marianne Williamson; New York state Sen. James Skoufis; and attorney Jason Paul. While most of these candidates might be unfamiliar to most Americans, the online creators who moderated the forum gave their collective millions of followers an opportunity to get to know them.  As the chart above shows, a Civiqs poll of Democrats showed that 64% of respondents feel “scared, depressed, or angry” about “the way things are going in the United States today.” Grappling with a growing number of weary and burnt-out voters following this last election cycle, the Democratic Party is looking toward creators as a way to inform, educate, and reengage the party base. Creator and political commentator Zack Kirk, known as theZacktiviston social media, told Daily Kos that he was shocked by how misinformed many people online are. “I've been baffled and was blindsided by the lack of understanding [people have] around how government works,” he told us. And as conservativeonline creators and podcastersrallied and enraged the right over the past four years, left-leaning creators such as Kirk realize more than ever the importance of educating and motivating their side’s online community. This is where his own content comes in. Kirk—whose full-time job doesn’t include politics and content creation—spends his free time thinking about how and where to best relate to his community. Identifying as someone who puts the “well-being of people” before politics, Kirk’s style of delivering political news and commentary offers something that traditional media such as MSNBC typically does not: a solution. Instead of reporting on the doom and gloom of MAGA wins, Kirk intends to flip the narrative. “[I will] continue to deliver information to my network, to my communities, that will give them ways of coping and surviving,” he said, adding that he plans to “uplift the stories that are being missed” in the sea of Trump news. For those looking for reprieve and connection when scrolling on their phone, stories that aren’t screaming of negative breaking news might serve as an avenue back into political engagement. Another benefit of these creator-led political discussions for the Democratic Party is the ability to highlight communities in America that may not always get air time in mainstream media. “Raise your hand if you know who the 92% are,” creator Elizabeth Booker-Houston asked the DNC chair candidates Tuesday night. The lawyer, professor, comedian, and content creator was referring to thepercentage of Black womenwho voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. Notably, only one candidate raised their hand when asked the question. Telling the panel of candidates that ""Black women are exhausted” and quipping that Baltimore is “too Black and too scary for Republicans,” Booker-Houston is but one example of a left-leaning creator who authentically appeals and relates to a base of Democratic voters sometimes viewed as forgotten. But as the countdown inches closer to Donald Trump’s second inauguration, Democrats—and the DNC chair nominees—unanimously agree on one thing: The Democratic Party’s approach isn’t working anymore, and it’s time to embrace new left-friendly media sources. If you ask Kirk, Democrats have their work cut out for them. “We're at ground zero,” he said. “No one has emerged as a definitive voice of the Democratic Party or the resistance to what Trump is going to do. No one's giving a counter.” A vote for the new DNC chair is scheduled for Feb. 1, and while a front-runner hasn’t emerged just yet, one thing is for sure—Democrats can’t afford to ignore the power of influencers.

What migration to red states could mean for the Democratic Party,"Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, a significantpopulation shifthas been underway, led chiefly by millennials and Gen Z Americans who aremovingfrom urban to rural areas. This could spell trouble for the Democratic Party, which has historically depended on voters in dense and progressive cities and states. As thepopulationsin states like California, New York, and Illinois decline, these once-solidly blue states could face an existential crisis as they are no longer the reliable powerhouses they once were. Meanwhile, conservative southern states like Texas and Florida are gaining new residents. This could dramatically shift the balance of political power, making blue states less competitive and red states more influential. According to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, if these migration patterns continue through the 2030 Census, California will lose four Congressional seats and New York will lose two. In total, states that went to Kamala Harris in 2024 could lose a dozen House seats and Electoral College votes, making the path for Democrats even more difficult. The concept ofcritical mass theoryis that collective political action requires a “critical number of personnel needed to affect policy and make a change not as the token but as an influential body.” It’s no secret that rural areas tend to be red, while urban areas are typically blue. The migration trend, while unsettling for Democrats, isn't all bad news. If it continues, the party could have an opportunity to reshape these growing, historically conservative regions into states in play. But this won’t happen overnight. First, Democrats might experience a significant loss of voters in blue states as people migrate to red states. Only after reaching a “critical mass” of voters in these conservative areas will Democrats have the chance to make an impact. However, parties can’t base their fundraising and strategies on wait-and-sees. Right now, Democrats are looking at North Carolina and, yes, even Texas, where there was a close Senate race in 2024—with Colin Allred losing by less than a million votes to Ted Cruz—to build a platform on the economic issues that got Donald Trump his populist base. As time passes and migration patterns continue, baby boomers will give way to a new generation of rural voters who Democrats could sweep up. But it would be a mistake to ignore the issues that impact the majority of Americansnow, like student debt, sky-high housing prices, the climate crisis, and expensive health care. There are many reasons why people migrate. The pandemic caused aboom in remote workthat, combined withrising rental costsin cities, made it easier for people to relocate to more affordable rural areas. Trends like “cottage core” and “trad wife” that have become popular among millennials and Gen Z have idealized homesteads and rural living. Some might argue that the great migration is simply a result of anoverworked,exhausted, anddisillusionedgeneration of Americans whowant to quitthe rat race. Migration could also be due, in part, to the drastic changes in cities as a result of the pandemic. What was once a bustling nightlife scene has given way toshuttered small businesses, leading to a more solitary lifestyle. Similarly, as rents increase, young people are priced out of homeownership, and wages don't keep up, people are opting to live in places where they can get more for their money. Democrats haven’t achieved a significant victory in the South since former PresidentJimmy Carterin the early 1970s. Meanwhile, the GOP staked out the long game, successfully implementingits southern strategyand winning all of those states in 2024. Even before its defeat in November, the Democratic Party recalibrated, adhering to its loss of the South and instead focusing on trying to win the Midwest’s “Blue Wall”—Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. But as the electorate has shifted, it’s no longer enough to win the White House without the support of some southern states. How will the party that is redlining itself reclaim rural voters, especially ones in the South who’ve gone devout MAGA? And will these migration trends solidify Democrats’ decline in traditionally blue states, or will they become an opportunity to shift the political landscape in red states? The answers are still unknown, but how the Democratic Party adapts to these population changes will determine where it goes from here.

Explaining the Right: The imaginary scourge of noncitizen voting,"Republicans in multiple states are pushing for federal legislation to address noncitizen voting, something they insist is an urgent matter requiring intervention at the highest levels of the government. But the problem does not really exist and is a smokescreen for rules, regulations, and practices that help Republicans win elections. Earlier this week, 12 of the state chairs for the right-wing State Freedom Caucus Networksent a letterto congressional leaders pushing for passage of the “Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act.” The law, proposed by Republicans, purports to close loopholes allowing for noncitizen voting. “The states continue to face the prospect of a huge population of noncitizens illegally voting in our elections and potentially affecting the outcome,” the letter alleges. “We must close the loopholes that put the integrity of our elections at risk. We need the SAVE Act to ensure that only U.S. citizens vote in U.S. elections.” This isfalse. First, it’salready illegalfor noncitizens to vote in federal elections. If a noncitizen even registers to vote, they could face up to five years in prison. Ina studyconducted by the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, researchers could find only 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting in the 2016 election, comprising 0.0001% of votes that were cast in those jurisdictions. That number includes onlypotentialnoncitizen votes—notcases that have been investigated and determined to be ineligible. Not only is noncitizen votingextremely rare, it’s also not coordinated by any groups in a way to systematically control the outcomes of elections. Additionally, civil rights groupshave calledthe SAVE Act “unnecessary and dangerous,” and said it “is intended to elicit irrational fear of the growing number of citizens of color.” But the issue is just one of the latest ways Donald Trump and other Republican officialsarefearmongeringaround immigration. Similarly, right-wing media outlets, like Fox News and Newsmax, havemade storiesabout the purported problem a staple of their programming. Promoting these lies creates an environment where voter-suppression laws and regulations can thrive. When these rules are in place, eligible voters have then beenbarred from voting, and frequently when election turnout is low,that has favoredthe political fortunes of the Republican Party (but it is not the case in every election). Noncitizen voting is also a convenient boogeyman for the right.Conservative ideasand candidates are often unpopular, but instead of confronting this lack of appeal, the right can simply blame noncitizens—a population they demonize anyway—for their loss. Trumpdid this in 2017, when he falsely claimed that his popular-vote loss to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was the fault of undocumented immigrants. Campaigning against an imaginary wave of noncitizen voting serves many purposes for the right: It rallies supporters against migrants, it pushes laws that help Republicans, and it excuses Republican losses in elections. The core issue is made up, but the effects are unfortunately very real.

Here’s the moment Mark Zuckerberg gave away the game,"Like the rest of the tech billionaire class, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided to give up any pretense of ethics in order to cozy up to President-elect Donald Trump. ZuckerbergkilledMeta’s fact checking andendedall of the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. In order to do some damage control—and to audition for the Trump administration’s favor—Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan’s podcast, which has become a forum for billionaires to act aggrieved as theytake control of the country. When Rogan asked Zuckerberg to elaborate on how he has become a victim of  a politicized government, Zuckerberg rambled on. “So we had organizations that were looking into us that were, like, not really involved with social media. Like I think like the CFPB like, this, financial—I don't even know what it stands for. It's the … it's the financial organization that Elizabeth Warren had set up. And, and it's basically, it's like, we're not a bank,” he said. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which started under theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, has beeninvestigating Metaover allegations that it misuses private data for financial gain. The idea that Zuckerberg doesn’t know what the CFPB is or that it doesn’t exclusively involve banks (having alsoinvestigatedApple, Amazon, Google, etc.) is incredibly disingenuous. He’s either so outrageously dumb that shareholders must force him to leave the business, or he’s lying on Rogan’s show for a reason. “They kind of found some theory they wanted to investigate. And it’s like, okay, clearly they were trying really hard, right? To like, to like, find, find some theory, but it, like, I don’t know. It just, it kind of, like, throughout the, the, the, the, the party and the government, there was just sort of, I don’t know if it’s, I don’t know how this stuff works. I mean, I’ve never been in government,” Zuckerberg told Rogan. Is the CEO of Meta talking about the CFPB’s investigation? Or maybe he’s talking about theupcoming anti-trust trialbetween Meta and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Since Trump’s first term, Meta has been fighting to keep anti-trust laws from breaking up its control of Facebook and Instagram. Outgoing FTC Chair Lina Khantold CNBCthat she wasn’t surprised companies like Meta are trying to “get some type of sweetheart deal” from the incoming Trump administration. While on Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg cravenly appealed to the insecure and aggrieved male audience,telling Roganthat the “corporate world is pretty culturally neutered,” before arguing that “masculine energy” was lacking in the workforce today. “It’s one thing to say we want to be kind of, like, welcoming and make a good environment for everyone, and I think it’s another to basically say that 'masculinity is bad,’” he said. According toThe New York Times, the ever-masculine Zuckerberg followed that up a few days later by throwing his former COO Sheryl Sandberg under the bus for Meta’s previous DEI policies. Zuckerberg has secured hisspecial VIP seatat Trump’s inauguration, along with fellow oligarchs Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Now he just needs all of those pesky consumer protection watchdogs to go away.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 18:00:08,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/18/2297478/-Here-s-the-moment-Mark-Zuckerberg-gave-away-the-game
Trump and his goons are already bailing on mass deportation pledge,"Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign emphasized two key promises far and beyond any others: to lower grocery costs—and inflation overall—and to enforce mass deportations of scary brown and Black immigrants (even those who are in the country legally). Already, Trump hasshrugged his shouldersat the first promise, saying there’s little he can actually do to lower prices. ""Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,” he said. Now Trump’s “Border Czar” Tom Homan is also walking back his mass deportation promise. CNNreportedearlier this week that Homan has been privately telling Republican lawmakers that deporting millions of immigrants might be a tad … impossible. “We are not having a discussion about 20 million [deportations],” Rep. Darrell Issa, Republican of California, told CNN. “We are having a discussion about an order, and priority, and expectation.” The expectation, of course, is that the federal government has nowhere near enough manpower or funding to expel that many immigrants. In fact, the American Immigration Councilhas estimatedthat it would cost nearly $1 trillion (with a “t”) to deport that many undocumented immigrants over a decade. Suffice it to say, this government isn’t scaring up an extra $88 billion this year to get the ball rolling. Democrats might not even need the filibuster to stop such a monstrosity in the Senate. As I’vewritten before, the reality is that mass deportations only work with the assistance of local and state law enforcement. The U.S. Border Patrol only has 20,000 agents, 17,000 of whom patrol the border (that isn’t about to stop, is it?). And as the CNN article cites, Homan said that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has only 6,000 officers—not nearly enough to deport millions of people. As Trump’s former Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgansaid in an interview with Stateline, “It’s not going to be successful, as long as we have sanctuary cities and states that refuse to allow local and state police departments to work with ICE.” That’s all well and good in places like Texas and Florida, where 6.4% and 5% of the population is undocumented, respectively. While local authorities might love to help the feds raid cities like Houston, Dallas, and Orlando, there are still millions of undocumented immigrants in sanctuary states like California, Illinois, and New York. So while Trump could achieve some small-scale deportations, he doesn’t have the resources for high-profile raids. Even in rural America, where farmers depend on the labor of undocumented immigrants, local politicians and industry groups (all Republicans, mind you) aresounding the alarm, warning of economic devastation if the feds—with or without local help—move in. So what is Trump to make of this? Xenophobia has been a key pillar in Trump’s reelection, and his party has gleefully followed along. But this is also the same party that pretends (sometimes) to care about budget deficits and the national debt, which would explode with an additional $1 trillion in expenses. While most Republicans don’t care about such things when they are in power, the razor-thin GOP margin in the House means it wouldn’t take many of them to derail these efforts. And those aren’t the only costs to deportation. “It will cost a lot to deport. But guess what? It will also save a lot. And it’ll be a net benefit,” hard-right xenophobic Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona told CNN. There is a false yet religiously held belief in right-wing circles that undocumented immigrants are costing good, hardworking Americans billions in tax dollars. The reality is the exact opposite: Those immigrants pay payroll and income taxes on their earnings, yet they’re ineligible for most public programs. “Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2 to 6.8 percent,” according to the American Immigration Council. “It would also result in significant reduction in tax revenues for the U.S. government. In 2022 alone, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare.” That’s a one-way flow of money, with none of it coming back to undocumented workers. So what exactly are these “savings” that Biggs is talking about? I looked hard, and the best I could find isstuff like thisfrom Fox News: “President-elect Donald Trump's immigration plan will be a ‘cost savings’ for the American people, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, responding to a warning from the Wall Street Journal that carrying out the largest mass deportation effort in history could bear a hefty price tag. [The Biden administration] is paying for free airline tickets around the country, free hotel rooms at $500 bucks a night, free education, free medical care, and that's in perpetuity."" Note that they can’t find math to support their theory that undocumented immigrants are costing taxpayers money, just that theenforcementof immigration laws is costing money. Well, that won’t change no matter how many people are deported—people who, by the way,aren’tbeing given “free airline tickets around the country” or staying in any “free hotel rooms.” So what now? Republicans hope that tough anti-immigration rhetoric leads to “self-deportation,” but the existence of sanctuary states complicates things. If anything, internal migration from hostile states like Texas and Florida to sanctuary states like California and Illinois is far more likely. Meanwhile, the demand for labor will be off the charts as thecharred toxic remainsof more than 10,000 homes, businesses, schools, libraries, and other structures in Los Angeles are cleaned up and rebuilt. The potential flow of immigrants from red states to blue ones won’t just help the economies of those welcoming them with open arms, but it would also decimate local economies in hostile red states, driving up the costs of food, hospitality, and construction—among other things. Expelling or driving out millions of their residents could also alter thedemographicsthat have allowed Florida and Texas to gain up to eight congressional seats at the expense of mostly blue states.

Law and order? Trump slammed for freeing terrorists and Nazi sympathizers,"Donald Trump is being slammed for granting pardons to more than 1,500 people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump and other Republicans have frequently touted the Republican Party as the party of “law and order,” one of his first acts in the presidency gave a green light to the criminal element. Trump’s pardonunravels hundredsof prosecutions that made their way through the Department of Justice and the criminal courts. Trump called the people who attacked Capitol police officers and were attempting to overturn the presidential election he lost “patriots” and “hostages” in the order. Before taking office,Vice PresidentJD Vance claimedthat people who engaged in violence on Jan. 6 would not be given a pass by Trump. “If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned,” he told Fox News Sunday on Jan. 12. That turned out to be a lie. Among those who will be released thanks to Trump’s actions is former Proud Boy leaderEnrique Tarrio. Tarrio was convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States andsentencedto 22 years in prison in September 2023. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, oversaw Tarrio’s caseand foundthat he had engaged in an official act of terrorism. He is expected to be a free man soon. Another figure helped by Trump’s action is Robert Keith Packer,who attackedthe Capitol while wearing an antisemitic shirt reading “Camp Auschwitz,” referencing the infamous death camp where thousands of Jewish people were executed by Nazis during the Holocaust. Former Capitol Police Officer Aquilino Gonell, who served at the Capitol on Jan. 6, spoke out against Trump’s action. “One of the first things that he does is pardon the criminals who nearly took my life,” Gonelltold HuffPost. “It’s a desecration to our service and the sacrifices made to keep everyone safe. It’s a violation to our democracy and a disgrace to the title he holds once again.” Gonell sent reporter Sam Stein photographs showing the pro-Trump mob attacking him on Jan. 6, as well as pictures depicting the serious injuries he received. Harry Dunn, another former Capitol Police officer,told the outlet, “This decision is a betrayal to the officers who were severely injured—and died—as a result of the insurrection. This decision puts Americans at risk as these violent criminals return to their communities. These pardons are a reflection of what abuse of power looks like and what we the people are bound to witness over the next four years.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost criticized Trump’s pardons,writing, “President Trump pardons Nazi & white supremacist that tried to overthrow the government. Fascists look out for fascists.”  One the same day Trump issued the pardons, his administrationreleased an executive orderpurportedly showing his opposition to criminal activity, promising to restore the federal death penalty. He criticized former President Joe Biden forcommuting the sentences of 37 facing the federal death penaltyand that his administration would take action to ensure that “these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.” The administration also releaseda list of prioritiesclaiming that crimes against law enforcement would be punished with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trumpappointedconservative activist Ed Martin to serve as Washington, D.C.’s interim U.S. attorney. Martin served on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, which advocated for the release of Jan. 6 offenders. Despite the criticism from law enforcement and members of Congress, the administration continues to stand by the assistance Trump delivered to convicted criminals. In an appearance on the pro-Trump Fox News Channel, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “I don't think it's causing much controversy.” She later added, “President Trump is restoring faith in our justice system.” Trump is the firstconvicted felonto be elevated to the presidency. On his first day in office, criminals convicted at the highest levels of the justice system received a gift from the most powerful position in the American government.

Trump's tiny inauguration is making MAGA morons lose their minds,"Donald TrumpannouncedFriday that his inaugurationwill be held indoorsdue to harsh weather concerns. Now, instead of hundreds of thousands of Trump voters gathering at the U.S. Capitol to watch their president begin his second term, they’ll instead be ushered to the Capital One Arena about a mile away where they can watch from …  a jumbotron. “We made all of the plans and all of the arrangements to come up and be a part of this event, and … it’s kind of a bummer,” Jose Granado toldNBC News. We might as well stay at home and watch it on TV. I’m kind of disappointed, to be honest with you,” Ken Robinson, who traveled from Oklahoma with his family, said. “We came here to watch it in person. We don’t really care to watch it on a jumbotron.” Traveling to watch the swearing in isn’t cheap. Hotel rates around Washington, D.C., are around $500 per night the weekend leading up to Trump’s inauguration. However, the Trump administration is handing out its condolences to supporters by allowing them to hold onto their now “commemorative” tickets. But it isn’t just average MAGA supporters getting the short end of the stick. Some of Trump’s wealthy donors have reportedly been cut from the in-person ceremony, given the limited number of seats in the rotunda. Instead, as The New York Times reporter Teddy Schleiferwrote, some of Trump’s donors will be escorted to a suite at the Capitol One Arena. Of course, Trump’s tech sugar daddies and burgeoningoligarchyhaveVIP seatingfor the inauguration, and all it took wasseveral millionsdonated to the convicted felon’s inaugural fund. Looks like Trump’s inauguration is only available for in-person viewing if you’re a part of the White House or wealthy enough tobuy your way in. But it isn’t just his everyday supporters who are taken aback by the news. Even MAGA talking heads like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia questioned the decision. “I have personally attended countless rallies where President Trump spoke in extreme weather conditions from cold to rain to heat,” shewrote on X. “Is there a security threat other than extreme cold temperatures? Not only for him but for the people?” Even MAGA conspiracy loon Glenn Beck had his theories about why Trump made the call to move everything indoors. ""These guys are under such threat. This is 'Jason Bourne' stuff,"" hesaid. Beck went on to imply that, due to Trump's shakedown of the ""power structure"" of government, conditions during the inauguration might not be safe for him. It’s unclear if he is implying that members of the U.S. government would target Trump. Trump’s last-minute decision means thatmonths of security planninghave been scrapped. Instead, the Secret Service and other security officials have three days to prepare for the new plan. The last president to be sworn in indoors was Ronald Reagan, when temperatures dipped down to 7 degrees in 1985. But you’d think MAGA supporters would be prepared for D.C.’s January weather, given that many of themmade the tripfour years ago.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 01:01:06,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297520/-Trump-s-tiny-inauguration-is-making-MAGA-morons-lose-their-minds
Democrats demand tech bros explain cash being tossed at Trump,"Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado sentlettersto tech company CEOs at OpenAI, Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Uber about their or their companies’ million-dollar donations to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund. In each letter, the senators remind the tech giants that their generous donations come at a suspicious time as their industry has “come under increased scrutiny from federal regulators for antitrust violations, violations of privacy, and harms to workers, consumers, and competition.” “We are concerned that your company and other Big Tech donors are using your massive contributions to the inaugural fund to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration in an effort to avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor,” the letter reads. Some of those big-money donations come from people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, whose companyreportedly donated at least $1 millionto Trump’s inauguration. But as Warren and Bennet explained in theletterto the Amazon CEO, his company “is the subject of multiple ongoing regulatory actions, including multiple Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suits related to anticonsumer and anticompetitive practices, a Department of Justice (DOJ).” Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi donated acombined $2 millionto Trump’s inaugural fund. “The company is the subject of an ongoing FTC investigation for predatory practices,” Warren and Bennet wrote in their letter to him, referring to the recentinvestigationinto the ride-hailing company’s subscription and cancelation policies. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmandonated$1 million to Trump. And the senators’ letter to him details how his company is under both an FTC investigation concerning itsconsumer practicesas well asone from the Securities and Exchange Commissionconcerning its investors. Googledonated $1 millionto Trump’s fund, and CEO Sundar Pichai was reminded by Warren and Bennet that the search giant “was found by a federal court to have an illegal monopoly over the online search market.” Google haspromised to appeal the ruling, and it will be up to Trump’s Department of Justice to decide whether to contest its appeal. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, gotits $1 million in early—after limiting political news on Facebook in the months leading up to the 2024 election. All this clearly seems done in order to ingratiate Zuckerberg and his company to Trump. Meta is facing aFTC antitrust lawsuit in April.  According toDemocracy Now, Trump's inauguration committee has raised upward of $250 million. To put into perspective, before Trump’s inaugural committee raised more than $100 million during his first go-round, the largest amount of money ever spent on an inauguration was President Barack Obama, who reportedly raised $50 million. Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the consumer-rights group Public Citizen, reports that much of that money has been donated by billionaires, such as the tech CEOs whom Warren and Bennet sent the letters to. Many of the CEOs who received letters from the senators areexpected to attend Trump’s inaugurationon Monday, and have beengiven VIP status for the day. And it cost them only a drop in their buckets.",Daily Kos,2025-01-18 00:00:16,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297500/-Democrats-demand-tech-bros-explain-cash-being-tossed-at-Trump
Trump’s family wastes no time profiting off of Daddy's second term,"Albania has given preliminary approval to Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to build a$1.4 billionluxury hotel complexon an abandoned military base. The deal raises eyebrows, given Trump will oversee foreign policy for Albania and has atrack recordofseeking revengewhen people or businesses don’t do what he wants. The hotel will be built on a 111-acre section of the 2.2-square-mile island of Sazan, which can be reached by ferry from Albania’s mainland. Ivanka Trump—who hassworn off politics—is apparently also working on the project. “The fact that such a renowned American entrepreneur shows his interest in investing in Albania makes us very proud and happy,” a spokesman for Albania Prime Minister Edi Rama told The New York Times last year. Kushner’s private equity company, Affinity Partners, was also given preliminary approval for a luxury hotel complex in Serbia, another country with vested interest in U.S. relations. While the Albanian government insists that its only motive behind approving the hotel is tourism, Albania and Serbia both havepending foreign policy matterswith the United States as theyattempt to jointhe European Union. The United States also has a vested interest inbolstering its relationshipwith Serbia to sway the country from supporting Russia. Kushner started Affinity Partners after he left hiscontroversial White House roleduring Trump’s first term, during which he established relationships with the Middle East and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who provided Kushner’s firm $2 billion from a sovereign wealth fund. Kushner’s hotel venture is just one example of questionable business deals circling Trump’s family leading up to his inauguration. Trump's real estate company met last week to discussreclaimingits former Washington, D.C., hotel, which has been owned by Hilton since the Trump family sold the lease rights in 2022 for $375 million. During Trump’s first term, Democrats claimed that his financial stake violated a constitutional provision known as theForeign Emoluments Clause. Should the family buy back the hotel, this would revive concerns. The perks rolling in for Trump’s family are hardly shocking considering his first term. For example, in 2018, Chinagranted 18 trademarksto companies tied to Ivanka and her father over a two-month span. Sixteen of those went to Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, raising her total of trademarks in China at the time to 34 for products such as handbags and sunglasses. Trump’s other children have alsobenefited immenselyfrom business,real-estatedeals, and other ventures since 2016. Now they’re at it again, and their father hasn’t even taken office yet.

Trump-loving tech bro reportedly set to run for Ohio governor,"Failed Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is reportedly planning to run for governor of Ohio. The news comes shortly after he attacked American culture for purportedly celebrating “mediocrity.” The Washington Post reportsthat multiple sources close to Ramaswamy say an announcement is soon to come and that the statement “is drafted.” Ramaswamy was a candidate for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination in 2024 but attracted very little support. Hereceived only 0.4% of the votein the primaries and was awarded just three delegates (of the1,215 needed to win the nomination). By contrast, Donald Trump received 76% of the vote and over 2,000 delegates on his way to securing the nomination. Despite a reported behind-the-scenes push from Trump, Ramaswamywas passed overby Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who announced that Lt. Gov Jon Husted would be appointed to the Senate vacancy created bynow-formerSen. JD Vance, who was elected vice president. Currently, Ramaswamyis set to co-chairthe proposed Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk, an essentially powerless advisory commission created by Donald Trump. The two billionaires will purportedly use the group tocut government spendingonsocial programswhile also advocating for tax cuts for the wealthy. After being tapped to co-lead DOGE, Ramaswamy made his most recent controversial remarks. In December, Muskdefendedthe use of H-1B visas to bring in skilled immigrant labor, a practice that many anti-immigrant Republicans oppose, when Ramaswamy weighed in. “Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long,”he wrote. “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.” Ramaswamy went on to cite the media portrayal of several nerdy characters on 1990s sitcoms as evidence of his claim. The comments provoked the ire of many, including fellow failed Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley,who wrotein response, “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture.” When he isn’t calling American culture mediocre, Ramaswamy has been afrequent promoterof debunked conspiracy theories. He claimed that the federal government was involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and called it an “inside job.” Ramaswamy also alleged that the 2020 election wasstolen by “big tech,”and theorized that the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged to help President Joe Biden win that year’s presidential election. On policy matters, Ramaswamy previouslyexpressed supportfor former President George W. Bush’sfailed planto privatize Social Security. Even if Ramaswamy officially announces his gubernatorial run and receives the backing of MAGA-aligned voters, it is not a sure thing that he will secure the nomination, let alone win. In 2022, Trump-backing candidate Jim Renacciran againstDeWine but failed to unseat the incumbent governor, who was then reelected. Additionally, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost,an election denier, is alsorunning. Ohio has been a reliable state for Republicans, but it is unclear if they will back a gubernatorial candidate with such a negative take on the American work ethic.

Dog killer Noem pushes immigration and wildfire lies at Senate hearing,"Dog-killingSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem fearmongered about the threat immigrants pose to the United States and lied about the California wildfires during the confirmation hearing for hernominationto lead the Department of Homeland Security Friday. As head of DHS, Noem would be in charge of Customs and Border Patrol and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps respond to natural and manmade disasters. Her answers about how she would handle both of those areas should scare everyone. During the hearing, Noem lied that the U.S. border is ""open,"" andclaimedthat ""the No. 1 threat to our homeland security is the southern border.” Of course, the border is obviously not open. In fact, border crossings havedramatically declinedin recent months, achieving similar levels as those during Donald Trump’s first term. What’s more, the head of the FBI has actuallysaidthat homegrown extremists are the biggest terror threat, and thatChina’s cyber programand its impact on U.S. infrastructure is a bigger danger to the United States than immigrants crossing the border. Aside from fearmongering about immigrants, Noem alsorefused to saywhether she'd withhold disaster relief if Trump asked her to—a relevant question as Trump and Republicans have said California should not receive financial assistance to help recover from the devastating fires. “If President Trump were to say to you, 'We’re going to withhold money from Connecticut or Michigan or any of the states, Iowa, because we don’t like the governor or we don’t like the politics of the state,' you would stand up to him and say, ‘Mr. President, we need to allocate that money’?"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, asked Noem. She refused to respond, saying that she couldn't answer a hypothetical question. But it’s not hypothetical, since Trumptried to do just thatduring his first term, when California was reeling from another wave of devastating wildfires. As Politicoreportedin October: “I assume you agree, withholding disaster relief is a violation of duty and law,” Blumenthal pressed Noam. “Leadership has consequences,” she said in a chilling response. Noem went on to lie about the response to California’s wildfires, claiming that somehow Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is responsible for the devastating impacts of this natural disaster—echoing the baseless claims ofTrumpand other Republicans. “I wish we would have had different leadership or a different governor in California,” Noemsaid. However,firefighters saythat humanscould nothave stopped the fires that ravaged the state. ""Wildfires like this, driven by 70 to 100 mph winds, couldn’t be 'put out' if every firefighter in the West were in Los Angeles,"" retired firefighter Riva Duncanwrotein an op-ed for MSNBC.

"Biden shows support for ERA, but does that actually mean anything?","President Joe BidenannouncedFriday that Americans should consider theEqual Rights Amendmentto be “the law of the land.” However, the last-minute effort to enshrine the 28th Amendment into the Constitution is unlikely to actually go anywhere due to its legal hurdles. “It is long past time to recognize the will of the American people,” the White House statement said. “In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.” The amendment would need to be formally signed and certified by National Archivist Colleen Shogan in order to become law. According toNPR, supporters of the ERA are expected to protest in front of the National Archives office, urging Shogan’s signature. She has previously stated that she will follow the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, which suggests that the courts or Congress must decide the amendment’s fate. To lift the1982 deadlinefor ratification, Shogan said that further action is needed—with Republicans now controlling all three branches of government, prospects for that seem bleak. Supporters of the ERA, however, believe that the amendment should have become law of the land after Virginia ratified it, making it three-fourths of states to pass it. Because of the obscurity of how to proceed, the amendment is expected to either face a long legal battle or to simply die at the hands of a GOP-led Congress. A senior Biden administration official told CNN that the president is not taking executive action but is “stating an opinion that it is ratified,” which was one crucial hurdle Shogan said needed to be cleared before signing it. “He is using his power of the presidency to make it clear that he believes—and he agrees with leading constitutional scholars and the American Bar Association—not that it should be, but it is the 28th Amendment of the Constitution,” the official said. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York and a leader in the ERA movement,posted on XFriday in support of ratification. “President Biden’s official notice to the nation today follows clearly established precedent dating back to President Adams in 1798. The ERA is a valid part of our Constitution,” she said. If the ERA is signed by Shogan, it would enshrine protections for women and trans people who will be vulnerable during Donald Trump’s second term. But for now, the odds of it moving forward seem slim.

Trump inauguration will be too frigid even for that coldhearted man,"Afraid of a little cold weather, Donald Trump will break with years of tradition tomove his inauguration ceremony indoors. He will deliver his address inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda before joining supporters at the nearby Capital One Arena. “There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country. I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way. It is dangerous conditions for the tens of thousands of Law Enforcement, First Responders, Police K9s and even horses, and hundreds of thousands of supporters that will be outside for many hours on the 20th (In any event, if you decide to come, dress warmly!),” Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social. Apparently, now he cares about the safety of law enforcement at the Capitol, unlikefour years ago, when he allowed those law enforcement officers to be brutally beaten by his supporters who were, at his behest, trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Trump’s swearing-in ceremony is scheduled for12 PM ET on Monday, when the temperature in Washington, D.C., is expected to be22 degrees, according to the National Weather Service, with the wind chill around 8 degrees. That puts it close to the28 degree temperature and mid-teens wind chill during Barack Obama's first inauguration, in 2009, according to historical data from the National Weather Service. And Obama didn't chicken out and move the ceremony inside. Trump continued, “This will be a very beautiful experience for all, and especially for the large TV audience!” What’s more, in 1961 when John F. Kennedy was sworn in, it snowed 8 inches and was also 22 degrees at 12 PM ET. Yet JFK still held his inauguration outside, withnearly 1 million peoplebraving those sub-freezing temperatures to watch his swearing-in. In fact, the last time an inauguration was held indoors was 1985, when the National Weather Service says temperatures in the District of Columbia were 7 degrees, with the wind child going as low as 20 below zero—far colder than what's expected on Trump's Inauguration Day. Holding the event indoors will make it so that Trump won't get to look out at a crowd of supporters as he delivers his inaugural address, which will probably be insanely dark and xenophobic. But maybe Trump prefers an indoor ceremony. After all, he can use it and the temperature as an excuse for why a paltry number of supporters show up. Trump is infamously obsessed with crowd sizes. He often lies about the number of people who attend his campaign rallies to say that more people showed up than actually did. And no one can forget the rage he felt when his 2017 inaugural crowd wassignificantly smallerthan Obama’s in 2009. He was so mad heforcedthe National Park Service to provide images that made his crowd look as big as the ones Obama had. Ultimately, moving the inauguration inside is a real chicken move.

CNN reportedly hiding anchor who dares to call out Trump’s BS,"CNN reportedly plans to move anchor Jim Acosta, who has frequently fact checked and challenged Donald Trump’s falsehoods, to a time slot with almost no viewers. As Status Newsreported, CNN’s CEO Mark Thompson proposed that “CNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta” be moved from the 10 AM ET time slot to midnight. “They want to get rid of Acosta to throw a bone to Trump,” a media executive told Status. “Midnight is not a serious offer when his ratings are among the best on the network.” If CNN goes through with this plan, it will effectively sideline someone who has provided accurate reporting on the leader of the Republican Party. Just a few days after his 2017 inauguration, Trump lied about losing the popular vote in the 2016 election to Hillary Clinton due to votes from undocumented immigrants.Acostanotedat the time that the allegation was “a falsehood, full stop.” Leading up to the 2024 election, when Republicans—led by Trump—continued to push lies about “voter fraud” in the 2020 election,Acostatoldthe chair of the Georgia Republican Party “you’re just lying” when he repeated Trump’s claims about the race. More recently,Trump claimedthat the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans was connected to immigration, citing afalse reportfrom Fox News. In an on-air discussion with a Republican strategist who pushed Trump’s false claim,Acostanotedthat the attack was “not connected” to immigration. Trump has a long history of expressing contempt for Acosta, who was CNN’s White House correspondent for much of Trump’s first term, tasked with debunking Trump and his team. In a 2018 exchange, Acosta asked Trump about his claim that a migrant caravan from Mexico was an “invasion,” noting that the characterization was false. Trump responded by calling Acosta a “rude, terrible person.” Trump supportershave echoedthis hostility. During a 2018 Trump rally, a crowd surrounded the reporter and yelled at him. Trump later shared video of the incident on his social media account. At the peak of the conflict between Acosta and Trump in 2018, the first Trump administrationpulledthe reporter’s media credentials andmade up a false storyalleging that he put his hands on an intern. A federal judge later ordered for Acosta’s pass to be restored. Back then, CNN had Acosta’s back. But now, the network appears to be joining a chorus of corporate media—including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times—who arebending to Trump’s will. Trump has expressed continual contempt for factual reporting, and hiding those who tell the truth about him is unlikely to stop during his second term. Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify that Jim Acosta’s show is currently at 10 AM in the eastern time zone.

Chaos among GOP lawmakers threatens Trump's agenda—already,"Yes, Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated for a second time, but we can take solace in the fact that his agenda is already on the rocks. Republican leaders in the House and Senatestillcan’t agree on how to move forward with legislation to make good on Trump's promises. More than two months after Republicans won both chambers of Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune are continuing to fight over whether to put Trump's destructive tax cuts for the rich and mass deportation agendain the same bill, or to split it into two. ""Right now, that teamwork isn’t happening. Not by a long shot,"" Politicosaidof Johnson and Thune's relationship. If Republicans can't even agree on how to move forward, forget about how difficult it will be to select the budget cuts Republicans will need to make to pass the legislation. That's because Republicans want to accomplish Trump's agenda using budget reconciliation, which will allow them to bypass the Senate filibuster and pass the bill(s) with a simple majority—i.e., just Republican votes. Butbudget reconciliation has strict limitsaround how much legislation can affect the national debt. And it will require Republicans to make cuts from other programs to fund the tax cuts and deportations. And getting Republicans to agree on what to cut from the budget will be harder than herding feral cats. Theywon't be able to lose a single votein the House, given Republicans' extremely narrow majority. Among the cuts Republicans arefloatinginclude slashing subsidies middle-class Americans to purchase Affordable Care Act plans, cutting food assistance for the poorest Americans, and making cuts to Medicaid. Good luck getting every single House Republican—including vulnerable members in swing seats—to vote for cuts like that. Even worse for Johnson is his political capital is already waning in his caucus, which will make it harder for him to twist arms and get his lawmakers to vote for whatever awful legislation ultimately emerges. That’s because Johnson pissed off many Republican lawmakers when he cowed to Trump andremovedpro-Ukraine Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. One unnamed House Republican told Fox News’ Chad Pergram that Turner may not vote for things Johnson wants to pass as a result of his ouster. “Mike’s never going to vote for another fucking thing around here again,” the unnamed House Republicansaid. “He’s mad.” What’s more, as GOP leadership quarrels about whether to put Trump’s agenda into one bill or two, Republicans are fighting over how to make the destructive legislation revenue neutral. Senate Republicans are rejecting a revenue generating proposal from House conservatives to raise the corporate tax rate, The Hillreported. “Absolutely not,” Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told The Hill, regarding that idea. Meanwhile, Democrats are watching with amusement as Republicans flail.

TikTok announces pro-Trump bash just as Supreme Court upholds ban,"TikTok has joinedthe paradeof tech companies lavishing money on the incoming Trump administration—though only TikTok faces exile from the American market on Sunday. The video social media platformwill sponsora pre-inauguration party for Donald Trump on Sunday that the company’s CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will reportedly attend. Pro-Trump influencers who used TikTok to promote him during the recent presidential campaign will be honored. The event is scheduled on the same day a recently passed law requires TikTok to be spun off from its Chinese owners or shut down U.S. operations—a lawupheld by the Supreme Courtin a rareunanimous opinionreleasedFriday. An official with the outgoing Biden administrationtold the Associated Pressthat the law will not be enforced in the time between taking effect Sunday and Trump’s inauguration on Monday. This effectively leaves the fate of TikTok in Trump’s hands, and his advisors have indicated that they also will not enforce the legislation. Legislation targeting the operations of a single company is extremely unusual behavior for the government. Yet the bill calling for the company’s sale had bipartisan support in Congress, and President Joe Bidensigned it into lawon April 23. The law did not successfully pressure the Chinese government to sever connections to TikTok or parent company ByteDance, andover 170 million Americanscontinue to usethe service millions of times per day. Now, both Democrats and Republicanshave apparently changedtheir positions and are wrangling behind the scenes to give the company behind the wildly popular app a reprieve. While his new stancealigns with public opinion, Trump’s about-face on TikTok is particularly notable since he was the first at the executive level to pursue government action against the company. In 2020,he issuedan executive order that required ByteDance to spin off the video service. In the order, Trump alleged there was “credible evidence” that TikTok “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” It’s likely not a coincidence that the order came at the height of Trump’s reelection campaign and thatvideos mocking himwere popular on TikTok. Trumphas often pushedfor media critical of him to be silenced or shut down. Yet when his campaign finally opened an account on the platform and quickly amassed millions of followers, Trump’s “full flop” on the platform—wherehe proudly braggedthat he was “a big star”—took root. Following Trump’s successful 2024 campaign, Facebook’s parent companyMeta said they wouldget rid of fact checkers and follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk’s X in allowing disinformation and bigoted content to circulate unchecked. With their sponsorship of the pro-Trump party, TikTok may be signaling they are also moving towards looking the other way in the face of more disinformation. “Big Tech” joining the Trump coalition—and being welcomed by Republicans—is a reversal from years and years ofthe right claiming(without evidence) that their voices were being silenced in new media. Nowadays, they are happy to take Big Tech’s money and bend the laws in their favor—or in TikTok’s case, pretend they don’t exist.

Democrats prepare to fight Trump’s Day 1 executive orders in the courts,"While Joe Biden’s presidency comes to an end on Monday, Democrats aren’t stepping down from the fight just yet, as they prepare to battle Donald Trump through the court system. The Democracy Forward Foundation, a prominent progressive legal group,announcedThursday that it will push back against Trump’s dangerous agenda by targeting his executive orders, of which he haspromisedmore than 100 on “day one.” Among Trump’s potential executive orders is a “shock and awe” strategy ofmass deportations. “We’re confident this center will be a critical resource for opposing dangerous policies in Project 2025 and other harmful and unlawful conduct,” Democracy Forward President and CEO SkyePerrymansaid in a statement. Launched in 2017, Democracy Forward is ramping up its four-year plan beginning on Inauguration Day. According to the report, it has already identified 200 potential executive orders that it will fight in the legal system as soon as Trump signs them into law. “During his first term, Trump’s executive orders made health care less accessible, banned travel based on the predominant religion in certain countries, and made it easier for corporations to pollute our communities,” Perryman said. “This time, the Trump-Vance administration is better organized, has four years of previous experience, and can rely on the policy and staffing infrastructure of Project 2025.” Biden administration officials will be joining Democracy Forward as senior counselors, including Karianne Jones, former litigation counsel for the Kamala Harris campaign; Mike Martinez, deputy general counsel at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; Dan McGrath, senior counsel at the Department of Labor; and Kevin Friedl, outgoing senior counsel at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Additionally, Department of Justice Executive Secretary Emily Ross will join Democratic Forward as deputy chief of staff and senior adviser to Perryman. This is in line with what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumertold POLITICOin December about how Democrats plan to use the courts to combat Trump during his second term. “I don’t know exactly what [Trump will] do. But I can tell you this: The judiciary will be one of our strongest—if not our strongest—barrier[s] against what he does,” he said. Democracy Forward will not only challenge the policies that Trump implements, but it will also aim to setlegal precedentsthat will limit the president's unchecked power in the long term.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 14:30:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/17/2297266/-Democrats-prepare-to-fight-Trump-s-Day-1-executive-orders-in-the-courts
Infamous Jew-hating racist Mel Gibson gets 'special' job from Trump,"Donald Trump is appointing three washed-up actors to serve as ""special ambassadors"" to Hollywood, including the notoriously racist and antisemitic Mel Gibson. ""It is my honor to announce Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, to be Special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California,"" Trumpwrotein a Thursday post on Truth Social. ""They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK—BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE! These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!"" Choosing Gibson to serve as whateverthisis ... is certainly a choice. In 2004, Gibson’s movie “The Passion of the Christ” waspanned as antisemiticfor depicting Jews as responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion. Then in 2006, Gibsonwent on an antisemitic tiradeduring a drunk driving arrest in Los Angeles. According to a police report, ""Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about 'fucking Jews'. Gibson yelled out: 'The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' Gibson then asked: 'Are you a Jew?'"" Gibson laterapologized, saying, “I am not an anti-Semite. I am not a bigot. Hatred of any kind goes against my faith.” But as the saying goes:in vino veritas. Then in 2010,audio tapes were releasedin which Gibson was heard verbally abusingOksana Grigorieva,his then-girlfriend and the mother of one of his children. ""You look like a fucking pig in heat, and if you get raped by a pack of [N-words], it will be your fault,"" he screamed at her. Gibson also threatened her, saying on tape, ""I am going to come and burn the fucking house down ... but you will blow me first."" That Trump would choose someone so vile to serve his administration in any capacity at all is despicable. But it’s also random. Maybe Trump thought of the “Mad Max” for this ridiculous made-up role because he saw Gibson’s Jan. 10 appearance on Fox News, where he spread paranoid theories about the raging wildfires in Southern California. “I can make all kinds of horrible theories up in my head, conspiracy theories and everything else,” Gibson told fellow bigot Laura Ingraham. “But it just seemed a little convenient that there was no water, and that the wind conditions were right and that there were people ready and willing and able to start fires, and are they commissioned to do so or are they just acting on their own volition?” Gibson also appeared on podcast bro Joe Rogan’s show, where heclaimedto know people with Stage 4 cancer who were cured after taking ivermectin, the horse deworming pill COVID deniers are bizarrely obsessed with.Ivermectin does not cure cancer. In a karmic twist, Gibson later revealed thathis Malibu home was burning downwhile he was yakking it up with Rogan in Texas. As for the other two men Trump appointed as “special” ambassadors, Voight is a vocal right-winger who haslong backed Trumpand bizarrelycalled for President Joe Biden’s impeachment. And Stallone has also emerged as a MAGA minion, ridiculouslycomparingTrump to George Washington Appointing these three clowns to somehow tell Trump how to fix Hollywood feels more like the latest attack on California from thenotoriously fame-hungryincoming president. Trump has spent the past weekspreading disinformationabout the deadly wildfires that have ravaged homes and communities in the Los Angeles area. Even worse, Trump isthreatening to withhold recovery fundingfrom the state. Hey Trump—just leave the people in and around Hollywood alone for once.

Even Republicans aren’t happy about House speaker’s latest cave to Trump,"House Republicansare disapprovingof House Speaker Mike Johnson’sdecisiontoremoveRep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, from his position as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Many believe this move was motivated by Donald Trump’s eagerness to install a MAGA loyalist in the position, since the president-elect has long sought to fill congressional seats with those willing to kiss the ring. Though Johnson denied external pressure, Turner believes otherwise. In a phone interview with CBS reporter and “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan, Turner said that Johnson told him, “You’re fired. There are concerns from Mar-a-Lago.” Johnsondeniedthis claim. ""This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,"" Johnson said on Wednesday. Now, Republicans are voicing their concerns about Johnson bending the knee to Trump. “We all have questions and concerns … This came out of nowhere,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, said. Crenshaw’s comments reflect the uncertainty and frustration that Republicans feel about the pressure to either fall in line with Trump or risk being demoted. ""I'm not happy with the decision. I think the vast majority of us are not happy with the decision,"" an anonymous House Republican told Axios. Other Republicans, like Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, are concerned that Johnson’s decision will be harmful to the party’s unity. “It divides the conference, and I don't think that's good,” he said, adding that ""most of us agree"" with Turner on issues like Ukraine. Turner has been astaunch supporterof Ukraine in its war against Russia, often pushing back against GOP colleagues who spread Russian propaganda. His strong advocacy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine has earned him praise from moderate Republicans, but it has also made him a target among what is now an empowered MAGA faction in Congress. While it’s still unclear how his second administration will cozy up to Vladimir Putin, Trump has suggested that heplans to speakwith the Russian strongman shortly after his inauguration. During his first term, Trump had aclose relationshipwith Putin, and he even sent him COVID-19 tests in 2020 while U.S. citizens reeled from the virus. And since leaving office, Trump has had numerous private phone calls with him. Trump’s long-standingbromancewith Putin—along with reportedlyidolizingdictators—has sparked accusations that Trump is sympathetic to autocrats and even perhaps has a desire to become one himself. But even as U.S. national security hangs in the balance, it seems Trump’s adoration of authoritarian regimes is still not enough to break the GOP’s obedience to Dear Leader.",Daily Kos,2025-01-17 00:30:12,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/16/2297298/-Even-Republicans-aren-t-happy-about-House-speaker-s-latest-cave-to-Trump
Trump treasury nominee slammed for opposing minimum wage increase,"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s nominee to besecretary of treasury, is being criticized for opposing an increase of the federal minimum wage at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Bessent was being questioned by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who noted to Bessent that the federal minimum wage has not been increased fromits current rate of $7.25per hour since 2009. “You don’t think we should change the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour?” Sanders asked. Bessent replied, “No, sir.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus,quickly responded, writing, “Wrong. Working people deserve a raise. Raise the minimum wage.” The last time that legislation was passed to raise the federal wage was the 2007 Fair Minimum Wage Act. Thatlaw incrementally increasedthe wage from $5.15 in 2007 to $7.25 in 2009, as Sanders stated. Since then, no laws have increased the federal minimum wage. In the meantime, due to inflation, the real value of the minimum wagehas gone down. According to a2019 studyby the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour would eventually increase wages for more than 33.5 million people across the country, including over 6 million people living in poverty. According to hisfinancial disclosures, Bessent, a hedge fund managerwho donatedto Trump’s campaign, is a billionaire. That is the normamong the figureswhom Trump has nominated to serve in his Cabinet and who are among his closest advisors. The average publicly known net worth of Trump’s team is $67.7 billion as of early December, compared to theroughly $1.06 million net worthof the average American family. Despite their extraordinary wealth, key Trump allies, like billionaire Elon Musk (the richest person in the world, worthover $427 billion),havepushed for cutsto the social safety net that millions rely on. These same people, and especially Trump, favor keeping in place tax cuts that disproportionately help billionaires and large corporations. Those tax cuts historically have beenlittle to no helpfor people making minimum wage.

"Rudy Giuliani has another terrible, no good, very bad day","After months of dragging his heels, disgraced former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has come to asettlementwith the two former Georgia election workers whom he defamed and owes nearly $150 million. CNN reports that details of the settlement are not yet known, but a brief courtfilingsays that plaintiffs Ruby Freeman and Wandrea Moss have come to an agreement with Giuliani that would allow Giuliani to avoid a trial. The settlement ended proceedings that saw thedirtbag former mayor’sFlorida condo, valued at $3.5 million, in jeopardy of being added to the assets Freeman and Moss could claim as a part of their compensation. “The past four years have been a living nightmare. We have fought to clear our names, restore our reputations, and prove that we did nothing wrong,” Freeman and Moss said in astatement. “Today is a major milestone in our journey. We have reached an agreement and we can now move forward with our lives. We have agreed to allow Mr. Giuliani to retain his property in exchange for compensation and his promise not to ever defame us.” The Independent reported that Giuliani was ano-showat his court proceedings on Thursday morning. Giuliani posteda self-serving statementabout the settlement to X, where he hilariously wrote, “This resolution does not involve an admission of liability or wrongdoing by any of the Parties.” But considering that Giuliani has beenfound liable for defamationand simply owes money that he’s been dragging his feet on, this is a choice piece of BS.

Another MAGA loyalist eyes Florida governor's race,"Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida has shared with potential donors and political big-wigs in the state that he intends to run for governor, making him the second MAGA loyalist to consider throwing his hat in the ring. “He was in town [Tallahassee] meeting with all the folks you need to meet with. He told them he is in,” a source who met with Donalds toldNBC News. “It’s the steps any candidate takes as they prepare to run for governor.” Donalds reportedly made similar remarks at a GOP meeting in Orlando this past weekend, according to the outlet. NBC News said it spoke with five sources familiar with Donalds’ thinking and upcoming plans. While there have long been rumors that the Florida representative is angling to replace Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited and will leave office in January 2027, this is the biggest sign yet that the Trump loyalist will likely leave his plum congressional seat in an attempt to be the Sunshine State’s next top executive. When asked for comment, Donalds didn’t deny the rumors but told NBC News he’s focused on “helping President Trump pass his America First Agenda.” A spokesperson for Donalds did not immediately respond to Daily Kos’ request for comment. Should Donalds run, he might face some intriguing competition. Disgraced former Rep. Matt Gaetzis also toyingwith whether to run for the gubernatorial seat. In a statement to NBC News, Gaetz reiterated that he and his wife are still considering his next steps. Notably, this is not the first sign of Donalds’ increased interest in running for Florida’s governorship. Earlier this month, hehiredone alum of President-elect Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign: Fabrizio, Lee & Associates. This company is led by Tony Fabrizio, who was Trump’s lead pollster during his first campaign for the White House and has conducted polling for MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. NBC News also reports that Donalds is working with Brad Herold, who served as an advisor to DeSantis during his 2018 run, among others who have long worked to help boost MAGA-type Republicans. Trump will almost certainly try to sway the fast-approaching GOP primary for Florida’s governor race. Last year, at a high-dollar fundraiser in New York,Trump asked Donaldspoint-blank whether he was planning to succeed DeSantis, whom Trump has had a ratherstormy professional relationshipwith. And let’s not forget, Trump’s influence can mean a lot in this race. After all, Trump’sendorsement of DeSantisin 2018 helped propel his candidacy. DeSantiswon that year’s Republican primarywith 57% of the vote; his closest competitor, Adam Putnam, the state’s former agriculture commissioner, received 37%. There’s no sign, either, that Trump’s grip on the party is slipping. Any Republican hoping to succeed in Florida politics likely needs to kiss the ring and earn Trump’s approval; at the very least, they need to avoid getting on his bad side. Donalds, who is 46, rose to prominence during the tea party movement. Hewas elected toFlorida’s House of Representatives in 2016. Then, in 2020, he won a seat in the U.S. House, representing Florida’s 19th Congressional District. In his relatively short time in Congress, Donalds has become a close ally of Trump’s. He was among the group of Republicans whovoted to overturnthe 2020 election results after Trump lost to Joe Biden, andwas endorsed for the House speakershipby far-right lawmakers who refused to back then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s bid in early 2023. Last year,it was rumoredthat Trump might tap Donalds as a running mate. That’s not to say Donalds is a shoo-in to be Florida’s next governor, should he decide to run. Beyond Gaetz, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson could jump in the race. At one point, it looked like the race to replace DeSantis might attract more candidates, but the field has narrowed. State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis isrunning to replaceGaetz in Congress (with Trump’s blessing, of course), and state Attorney General Ashley Moody has just beenappointedto fill the Senate seat that Marco Rubio will vacate if he is confirmed as Trump’s secretary of state, as is expected. There’s no timeline set for Donalds’ next steps. While he could, of course, leave Washington, D.C., early to start his bid, concerns about Republicans’ slim margins in the House make that tricky to navigate. As NBC News pointed out, Donalds may make his next move more clear following the conclusion of Florida’s two scheduled special elections, one of which reveals who Gaetz’s replacement will be. Both electionswill take placeon April 1.

Democrats have one weird trick to release the rest of Jack Smith's report,"In alettersent Thursday morning, House Judiciary Committee Democrats urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to drop federal charges against Donald Trump’s co-defendants in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. In so doing, Garland would remove the only barrier preventing the release of the second volume of Jack Smith’sreporton alleged crimes committed by Trump. ""The American people now deserve the opportunity to read Volume 2 of Special Counsel Smith's report, which explains how President Trump knowingly retained hundreds of presidential and highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago club and then deliberately defied subpoenas, obstructed law enforcement, hid evidence, and lied about his continuing retention of these records,” the letter reads. “It is in the very nature of American democracy that the people have a right to know of the public actions of their public officials, and it is essential to the rule of law that Justice Department special counsel reports continue to be available and accessible to the public,” it goes on to say. “As Attorney General, it is incumbent upon you to take all necessary steps to ensure the report is released before the end of your tenure, including, if necessary, by simply dismissing the remaining criminal charges against Mr. Trump's co-conspirators, Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira."" Last week, the DOJ released the first half of the report, which focused on Trump’s “unprecedented criminal effort” to steal the 2020 election. Garland noted that he would not release the second volume of Smith’s investigation since Trump’s co-defendants’ cases are still active. “To the extent that such a decision to dismiss these cases might encourage these defendants to keep enabling the corruption of their superiors,” House Democrats argue in the letter. “[T]hose concerns are outweighed by the many indications that Mr. Trump will simply end the prosecutions against his co-conspirators upon taking office anyway and then instruct his DOJ to permanently bury this report.” One alternative, with somesupport in Congress, would be for President Joe Biden to take advantage of the Supreme Court’s ruling on “absolute immunity” for “official acts” by releasing the report in the name of national security. Judge Aileen Cannonagreed to allowthe DOJ to release the first volume of Smith’s investigation, and she has nowscheduled a court hearingFriday to consider Garland’s plan to share the second volume with “some lawmakers.” Trump hassuccessfully eluded jail timeas a convicted felon, but the details of his other—and numerous—alleged crimes have yet to reach the public.

And to those people, I would just say, ‘You have my sympathy and I hope you get a TV soon that allows you to change the channel.’” Meyers proceeded to take apart Trump’sgrotesque choiceof Hegseth for secretary of defense.

Nancy Pelosi will skip Trump’s inauguration,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, will not attend President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, her spokesperson confirmed to Daily Kos. Pelosi is the second big-name Democrat to announce that they won’t attend. Earlier this week, former first lady Michelle Obama saidshe also plans to skip the event, which will take place on Monday. Other Democratic lawmakers who will play hooky that day include Reps.Jasmine Crockettof Texas,Ilhan Omarof Minnesota, andAyanna Pressleyof Massachusetts. News of Pelosi’s pending absence was first reported byABC News. Pelosi’s spokesperson didn’t elaborate on why she won’t make the pilgrimage to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,this go-around. Her absence may be because Pelosi is stillrecovering from hip surgeryshe underwent in Germany following a fall in December. It’s also possible that, like most Democrats,she just hates Trump. No one would blame her if that were the case. The two have long had a tumultuous professional relationship. Since Trump’s first administration, their disdain for one another has seemingly only increased. Pelosi famously spent the final days of Trump’s first term trying tooust him from the Oval Officeafter the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Trump, for his part, spent much of his first termavoiding Pelosi, even as the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged states and lawmakers attempted to work together to deliver aid. Since then, Trump has called Pelosi “crazy,” “crooked,” “evil,” and “sick,” among other abhorrent things. In November, he nearly called her a bitch during a campaign rally, though he stopped himself from saying the word outright. “She’s a bad person, evil. She’s an evil, sick, crazy—” Trump said ata rally in Michiganamid his 2024 campaign, sounding out the letter “B” but stopping just short of uttering the obscenity. “It starts with a ‘B,’ but I won’t say it. I wanna say it.” Pelosi’s inauguration absence marks a break in tradition for the octogenarian. In addition toattendingTrump’s first inauguration, in 2017, ABC News reports that Pelosi has gone to 11 presidential inaugural events. Senior leaders of both parties typically attend presidential inaugurations, regardless of the incoming president’s party. But Trump has no room to complain about Pelosi’s absence: Hefamously skippedPresident Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. In reality, Trump probably won’t notice that Pelosi’s gone. He’ll be too busy trying to impress his trio of tech-bro sugar daddies—Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg—who have beenrewarded with plum seatsat the inauguration. (All three men alsodonated at least $1 millionto Trump’s inaugural fund.) Meanwhile, while they will attend Monday’s inauguration, former presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama willskip Trump’s inaugural luncheon. According to NBC News, both Obama and Clinton were invited but declined. Bush’s office told the outlet that he never received an invite.

House Republicans take first step in mass deportation scheme,"Donald Trump’s Deputy Policy Chief, Stephen Miller,met Wednesday with membersof the House Republican Study Committee to begin planning for the mass deportation of immigrants. “He talked about how the cost of immigration is costing this country and he used the example of if an illegal has four children they have the same rights and privileges to the gimmes that Americans do, health care, education, all of that,” Rep. Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina,told the Daily Beast. Miller reportedly told the attendees to determine the funding needed to carry out Trump’s deportation plan, which they are expected to include in a reconciliation bill that requires a simple majority to pass through Congress. This would allow the party to secure funding for mass deportations without any Democratic support, as long as there aren’t many defectors within theslim Republican majoritiesin Congress. While the GOP reconciliation bill will include tax cuts for the wealthy and draconian changes to immigration policy, thereconciliation processwas originally used under Democratic administrations for more progressive policy items. Under President Barack Obama, reconciliation was used to pass health care reform in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Under President Joe Biden, it was used to pass theAmerican Rescue Planand theInflation Reduction Act. But now, Republicans are using the reconciliation process to move forward with Trump’s immigration policy, which is likely informed by Miller’sracist history. Miller served as an aide to former Sen. Jeff Sessions during whichhe promotedwhite supremacist literature, objected to efforts to remove symbols honoring the pro-slavery Confederacy, and promoted racist immigration stories. During Trump’s first term, Miller wasa key architectof the policy that separated immigrant families to supposedly dissuade border crossings. The policy led to the separation of children from their parents, anda reunification processthat is still ongoing under the Biden administration. Family separation wascondemnedacross the world by figures like Pope Francis. There is widespread concern about the mental and emotional harm that mass deportation is likely to cause for thousands of families, but experts have also warned that there will be a financial cost. A “highly conservative”estimatefrom the American Immigration Council found that Trump’s mass deportations would cost at least $315 billion. The council also projected that the amount of funding used for a 10-year deportation program could build more than 40,450 new elementary schools, construct 2.9 million new homes, pay college tuition for 8.9 million people, and provide brand new cars to more than 20.4 million people. Trump, Miller, and their Republican allies in Congress nonetheless seem locked in on foisting this extreme policy on the American public. Only time will tell how much it will cost us.

Trump mimics mug shot in official presidential portrait,"Donald Trump did his best to look as evil as humanly possible in his official presidential portrait, which wasreleased Thursdayahead of his inauguration on Monday. In the terrifying headshot, Trump, wearing a rare blue tie, appears to be scowling at the camera and squinting one eye closed, as if he's plotting something nefarious. His evil look is enhanced by the choice to light him from below creating creepy dark shadows on Trump’s face, while also blowing out his signature bright orange makeup to a muted apricot hue.

The release of the list comes just a few weeks after Trump said he would not seek retribution against his detractors. In November, after his election win, TrumptoldFox News, “I am not looking for retribution, grandstanding or to destroy people who treated me very unfairly, or even badly beyond comprehension.” But on Wednesday night,Trump wroteon his Truth Social platform, “In order to save time, money, and effort, it would be helpful if you would not send, or recommend to us, people who worked with, or are endorsed by, Americans for No Prosperity (headed by Charles Koch), ‘Dumb as a Rock’ John Bolton, ‘Birdbrain’ Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, disloyal Warmongers Dick Cheney, and his Psycho daughter, Liz, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, General(?) Mark Milley, James Mattis, Mark Yesper, or any of the other people suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, more commonly known as TDS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” While some of the people and groups on Trump’s list are merely fellow travelers within the conservative movement who have disagreed with him (the right-wing Americans for Prosperity group) or who ran against him (failed presidential candidate Nikki Haley), many of them are figures who warned that Trump would engage infascistic behaviorduring a second term. Beforeretiring, Army Gen. Mark Milley served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and was intimately involved in high-level national security issues during his administration.Milley later toldjournalist Bob Woodward that Trump was “fascist to the core,” and said, “He is the most dangerous person to this country.” Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming served on the bipartisan committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol led by Trump supporters hoping to overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden. Cheney often spoke out against Trumpand said in October, “Donald Trump believes he will be immune for anything he does once he’s in office.” SheendorsedVice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign and said she agreed with Milley’s assessment that Trump is a fascist. John Boltonserved asTrump’s national security adviser. In the foreword to his book about his time in the administration, BoltondescribedTrump as “unfit” for the presidency. Bolton specifically criticized Trump for prioritizing his personal vendettas over the country’s interests. Trump’s enemies list—something which is far outside of the bounds of normal political discourse—is another bit of evidence proving that the warnings of his fascistic tendencies were accurate.

House speaker demotes Ohio Republican who won’t ‘bend the knee’ to Trump,"Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio was unceremoniously ousted as chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, after Donald Trump ordered the pro-Ukraine lawmaker's removal, according to CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" hostMargaret Brennan. Turner has been avocal critic of Russiaand a supporter of Ukraine. He's evencriticized his own GOP colleaguesforspreading Russian propaganda. “We see, directly coming from Russia, attempts to mask communications that are anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia messages, some of which we even hear being uttered on the House floor,” Turner said in April. Being pro-Ukraine is untenable for Trump, who is buddies with violent Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Putin worked to help get Trump elected in 2016 by running an unprecedented propaganda campaign. And now that Trump won again, Politicoreportedthat Putin hopes the U.S. will stop sending money and weapons to Ukraine in its war against Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. “​​One person who’ll clearly be pleased Mike Turner’s been dumped as House Intelligence chair: Vladimir Putin,” Republican Bill Kristol, who has been a vocal critic of Trump and his own party in recent years,wrotein a post on X. Trump hasrefused to saywhether he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia in the war Russia started. But he has made it clear that he wants Ukraine tomake concessions to Russia, which attacked the country unprovoked, in order to end the war. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who removed Turner as committee chair, claims Trump had nothing to do with the decision to remove Turner. “This is not a President Trump decision. This is a House decision, and this is no slight whatsoever to our outgoing chairman. He did a great job,” Johnsonsaid, adding, “The intelligence community and everything related to [the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence], it needs a fresh start. And that’s what this is about. Nothing else.” It's not yet clear who will be the new chair of the committee, which has oversight of the U.S. intelligence community and is privy to the nation's top secrets. In 2017, during Trump’s first term, the committee was led byPutin stoogeDevin Nunes, who worked to thwart the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee,told reportershe's “enormously concerned” over Turner's removal since Turner wasn't one to ""bend the knee"" to Trump. ""His removal makes our nation less secure and is a terrible portent for what’s to come,"" Himessaidin a statement.

Trump's attorney general pick won't admit Biden won 2020 election,"Election denier Pam Bondi, Donald Trump'spickto lead the Department of Justice, refused multiple times at herWednesday confirmation hearingto say that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Sens.Dick Durbinof Illinois andMazie Hironoof Hawaii separately asked the former Florida attorney general if she believed Biden won the election—and Bondi refused to answer both times. When Durbin asked, Bondi dodged. ""President Biden is the president of the United States. There was a peaceful transition of power,"" Bondi said. Of course, the transition of power was anything but “peaceful,” as Trump incited a violent mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block certification of Biden's win. When Hirono asked Bondi, ""Who won the 2020 presidential election?"" Bondi gave the same canned answer. “Joe Biden is the president of the United States,” Bondi said robotically. The Hawaii lawmaker was unimpressed by that response. “You cannot say who won the 2020 election,” Hirono said. “It's disturbing that you can't give voice to that fact.” Sen. Alex Padilla of California asked Bondi for evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, which she has continued to lie about for years following Trump's loss to Biden. But Bondirefusedto give any concrete evidence. “Do you have any evidence of election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 election, yes or no? It’s a yes or no question,” Padilla said. In response, Bondi gave condolences to Padilla for the fires in California and refused to give a yes or no response about whether she had evidence of fraud.  Bondi was among the dozens of Trump campaign officials and surrogates who lied about voter fraud in the 2020 election in a failed quest to help Trump remain in power. She specifically focused on Pennsylvania, which Bondi falsely claimed Trump won. “We are not going anywhere until they declare that we won Pennsylvania,” Bondisaidduring a Fox News appearance in 2020. In fact, Bondi helped organize the infamous news conference in Philadelphia that was supposed to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel but instead was mistakenly held atFour Seasons Total Landscapingafter the inept campaign booked the wrong venue. Bondi didn't speak that day, but was seen “helping other staff to rearrange the company’s landscaping equipment to make way for a podium” before the event began,accordingto The Washington Post. It’s no surprise that Bondi refused to say Biden won. Trumpdemands total loyaltyfrom his Cabinet picks, and admitting that Biden was the victor goes against Trump’s narcissistic delusion that he didn’t lose in 2020. But it’s terrifying that Republican senators are set to confirm an attorney general who not only can’t admit basic reality, but will readily lie to stroke Trump’s fragile ego.

Trump tries to take full credit for Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal,"Israel and Hamas have reached a ceasefire deal to pause the devastating war after more than 15 months of fighting, according tothe U.S. and Qatar. The destruction and violence resulted in the deaths ofat least 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, while thousands morehave been injured. But amid the news, President-elect Donald Trump made the historic deal about himself and tried to take sole credit for it—all before President Joe Biden’s administration hadheld a news briefingon the matter. “WE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST,” Trump posted to hisTruth Socialplatform. “THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!” In asecond post, Trump added, “This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.” Of course, the ceasefire effort was put into motion by Biden and has been carried out while he is president. The deal reached by negotiatorsis broadly the sameasthe one Biden proposed last May, which the president noted in astatement, saying, “I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council.” Additionally, on Monday, Jake Sullivan, the Biden White House’s national security adviser, said that a deal was imminent and that he “coordinated very closely” with the incoming Trump team to “present a united message” and “get this deal done as fast as possible.” The deal stillneeds to be approvedby the Israeli cabinet, which isexpected to happen on Thursday. If approved as expected, the ceasefire will go into effect on Sunday. That said, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahusaid late on Wednesdaythat final details are still being worked out. If approved, the deal will allow for an exchange and release of all the remaining living Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. Israel would also release some jailed Palestinians and allow for increased humanitarian aid in Gaza. In addition, during the plan’s first 42 days, “Israeli forces will withdraw to the east, away from densely populated areas,” according toABC News, and eventually, there will be a “permanent cessation of military operations.” The final phase of the plan would see the two sides exchange remains for identification. At that time, the reconstruction of Gaza would begin, “with compensation for all affected individuals under the supervision of several countries and organizations, including Egypt, Qatar and the U.N.,” according to ABC News. Notably, last September, Netanyahurejectedthe Biden administration’s claim that a ceasefire plan was nearly finished. Since then, of course, the U.S. has elected a new president, suggesting that Netanyahu is far more prepared to bend a knee to the United States now than he was when Democrats controlled Washington, D.C. It’s alsolikelythat he wanted to harm Democrats’ chances at winning the presidency since the continuing conflict in Gaza was seen asa bad issue for them. Last week, Trump warned reporters that “all hell” would break loose if Hamas did not release the hostages by his Jan. 20 inauguration. It’s possible that the pressure of Trump’s threat shook Netanyahu, who has long shownfealtyto the president-elect despite Trump famouslyaccusing him of disloyalty. Of course, Trump is not currently president, so it makes sense that Biden is pushing back on giving the president-elect too much credit. When a reporter asked on Wednesday who gets credit for the deal, him or Trump, Biden responded, “Is that a joke?” Unsurprisingly, Trump’s allies are lapping up his lies that the president-elect was singularly responsible for brokering this deal. “HISTORY: President Trump has ended the war against Israel before he even took the oath of office,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenepostedto social media. “Thank God President Trump will be back in the Oval Office in just a few short days!” ",Daily Kos,2025-01-16 00:00:10,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297139/-Trump-tries-to-take-full-credit-for-Israel-Hamas-ceasefire-deal
Trump pushes DOGE dork to fill Vance's vacant Senate seat in Ohio,"Donald Trump isreportedly pushingfailed presidential candidate and billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy to take JD Vance’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat in Ohio. According to the Washington Post, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to take the position if offered by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who will make the appointment for the vacated seat once Vance is sworn in as vice president. The outlet also reports that Ramaswamy was planning to run for Ohio governor in 2026. If Ramaswamy assumed the position, Ohio would be represented by a senator whose history is checkered with promoting debunked conspiracy theories. During his unsuccessful presidential campaign,Ramaswamy saidthat the Jan. 6 insurrection of the U.S. Capitol looked like it was an “inside job,” amplifying a conservative conspiracy that it was undertaken by shadowy forces within the government. “Why am I the only person on this stage, at least, who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” Ramaswamy asked his fellow Republican candidates during a December 2023 debate. Healso postedon social media on the anniversary of the insurrection, writing “Happy Entrapment Day,” a nod to thedebunkedright-wing conspiracy theory that federal agents staged the event to entrap Trump supporters. Trump’s Secretary of Defense nominee, Pete Hegseth,has espousedsimilar beliefs. Ramaswamyhas also claimedthat the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which argues that increased immigration from Mexico is a plan to replace white people with Latinx people, is “a basic statement of the Democratic Party's platform.” He also promoted thefalsehoodthat the 2020 election was “stolen by Big Tech.” Perhaps the most absurd conspiracy that Ramaswamy has embracedis his theorythat the result of the 2024 Super Bowl was rigged in favor of the Kansas City Chiefs and that it would be connected to a future endorsement of President Joe Biden from Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. When he’s not promoting conspiracies, Ramaswamy has embraced unpopular conservative policy ideas, like privatizing Social Security. In avideofor AARP, Ramaswamy endorsedthe failed proposalfrom former President George W. Bush to allow partial privatization of the popular pension program by investing funds in the stock market. Along with Elon Musk, Ramaswamy iscurrently co-chairingthe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-governmental pressure group created by Trump. DOGE representatives have reportedly beenharassing federal workersin an effort to undermine federal spending. And recently, RamaswamydenigratedU.S. culture in a lengthypost on Xclaiming that “American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers. A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ or ‘Stefan’ over Steve Urkel in ‘Family Matters,’ will not produce the best engineers,” he wrote. So, if Ramaswamy assumes the Senate seat in Ohio, he’ll be representing the very people he believes to be subpar.

Even Fox News can't spin how much Greenlanders don't want to join US,"Well, this is awkward. A reporter from right-wing propaganda outlet Fox News headed to Greenland to see if its residents were as pumped about the idea of the country becoming part of the United States as Donald Trump and his brain-dead MAGA cult are. But the reporter did not encounter scores of Trump fans who want the country to be taken over by the U.S. Instead, the reporter said that ""most"" of the people she spoke to were against Trump's plan to acquire the territory. ""I hate it,"" one Greenlander told Fox News of Trump's proposal. ""I want to stick with Danish ... government,"" another person interviewed by Fox said. (Greenland is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.) Trump has had a bizarre fixation with annexing Greenland since at least2019, when he first saber-rattled about buying the island. He had gone quiet about the idea until after he won the 2024 election. And now, once again, he is saying that the U.S. should take control of Greenland, going as far as saying hemay use military forceto acquire the land. Earlier in January, Trump sent his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to the country to try to build support among the people for a U.S. acquisition. But Greenlandic politicians described Jr.’s visit as astaged public-relations stunt. In fact, a Danish media outletreportedthat the pro-Trump folks whom Trump Jr. featured in photos he posted of his visit included unhoused people who wereoffered free lunchin exchange for wearing MAGA gear. “They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,”Tom Amtoft, a Greenland resident, told the Danish outlet, according to Google’s translation of the comment. Trump alsoposteda video of a man in Greenland wearing MAGA gear, saying, “I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’” But apparently unbeknownst to Trump, the man in the video is a convicted drug trafficker,according toa Danish media outlet. Ultimately, officials from bothGreenlandand Denmark officials say the arctic territory will not become part of the US. “Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom,” Greenland’s prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede,said in a statement. And even Fox News can’t propagandize that fact. The outlet couldn’t find enough Greenland residents to praise their Dear Leader Trump. Sad!

AG nominee is still covering up Trump’s Georgia election fraud efforts,"Former Florida Attorney General and Trump lawyer Pam Bondi is lying her way through Wednesday’s Senate confirmation hearing for U.S. attorney general. When Sen. Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked if she “heard the recording of President Trump on January 2, 2021, when he urged the secretary of state of Georgia to, quote, ‘find 11,780 votes’ and declare him the winner of that state,” Bondi denied ever hearing it. ""No. I've heard about it through clips, but no, no, Senator, I've not heard it,"" she said. “What was your reaction to President Trump making that call?” Durbin pressed. “I have, I would have to listen to the tape, Senator,” Bondi responded. As Durbin continued pushing Bondi on the issue, the formerregistered foreign agentwiggled free by claiming that she didn’t know the context, adding “but it's my understanding that is not what he asked him to do."" But that isn’t what Bonditold Newsmaxin August 2023, ​​according to research from American Bridge. After Fulton County District Attorney Fani WillisindictedDonald Trump and more than a dozen others in a broad conspiracy to commit election fraud, Bondi appeared on the right-wing outlet to share her thoughts. ""Fani Willis is in way, way over her head,” Bondi said. “She has charged not only President Trump, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Mayor Giuliani, but a total of 19 defendants, including President Trump, with I think it’s a 41-count indictment that takes 98 pages. It’s unbelievable.” “First of all, it’s not a crime what they did,” Bondi explained, referring to thehour-long phone callbetween Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Trump, during which Trump demanded he “find” more than 11,000 votes for him. “It’s free speech. It shouldn’t even be in state court. Legally, it should be in federal court if they're ever going to prosecute him for something so ridiculous,” she said. Since Bondi’s lying and deceit on behalf of Trumpgoes backmore than a decade, it’s no surprise that he picked her as the next potential top lawyer.

Trump set to start second term with underwater approval rating,"As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office for a second time, he claims to have a “massive” mandate to enact his destructive agenda. But new polling shows that’s far from the truth. ANPR/PBS News/Marist College pollreleased Wednesday shows that just 44% of Americans view Trump favorably, while 49% view him unfavorably. That’s nearly identical to the 45% approval rating Trump has inCiviqs’ tracking poll. The fact that Trump is viewed unfavorably before he even takes office is a warning sign for his tenure. The start of a presidential term is usually when a president is at their high-water mark of approval. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, 51% of registered voters approved of the job he was doing on the transition, according to anNPR/PBS News/Marist College pollat the time. In the first two months after Barack Obama was sworn in as president, around 60% of Americans approved of the job he was doing, according to538’s historical polling average. And when he was sworn in again four years later, his approval rating was around 53%. The NPR/PBS News/Marist College poll has other warning signs for Trump. Just 31% of Americans say thetariff policyTrump plans to enact would help the economy. That should be a flashing red warning light for Trump, showing that Americans will likely blame him if those tariffs cause prices toskyrocket, as economists expect. What’s more, 62% of Americans oppose Trump’s plan to pardon people who either pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for their role in the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It’s not just Trump who is unpopular among voters. Trump's Cabinet nominees are also underwater. Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, has just a 19% approval rating in the NPR/PBS News/Marist College survey. And the survey was conducted before Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, when Democratic senatorslaid barethe nominee’s abhorrent behavior of alleged sexual assault, womanizing, on-the-job drinking, and misogynistic remarks. Twenty-six percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hegseth, with the remaining 55% not knowing who he is or having no opinion of him. However, Trump’s co-president, Elon Musk, is broadly unpopular. Only 37% of Americans have a favorable view of him, while 46% view him unfavorably, according to the poll. That’s also a warning sign for Trump, who is allowing Musk to hog the spotlight and even letting the awkward billionaireoccupy an officein the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next door to the White House. Ultimately, while it’s awful that Trump will be sworn in for a second time, polling suggests that he will have no honeymoon phase and that backlash to his agenda could be a serious problem for Republicans in the 2026 midterms.

Fox News host celebrates lack of diverse inauguration performers,"Fox News host Jesse Watterscelebratedthe news that Carrie Underwoodwill be performing“America, the Beautiful” at Donald Trump’s inauguration, citing her sexual orientation and blonde hair as a sign of America’s return. “I'm just happy Carrie Underwood is performing. When a straight, blonde female is singing at the inauguration, I think we're back. I think we're definitely back,” he said during a Tuesday episode of “Jesse Watters Primetime.” His guest, conservative comedian Nick Di Paolo added, “Thank God Kamala didn't win, we would've had to see Lizzo's ass for 45 minutes.” Watters’ and Di Paolo’s comments echo longtimeconservative complaintsthat President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and other Democrats are too “woke,” meaning they have embraced diversity. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the performers were in fact diverse. Lady Gaga—who was blonde at the time—sangthe national anthem, Jennifer Lopezalso performed, and so didGarth Brooks—a straight white man. Watters has spent years at Fox espousing racist and misogynistic comments, and the network expanded his platform whenhe receivedhis primetime show in 2023, replacing the extremelybigotedTucker Carlson. During the recent presidential campaign, Watterslobbed multiple sexistand racist attacks at Harris, who made history as the first woman of color to secure a major party’s nomination. “She's just like your typical girl's girl that talks behind everybody's back and then says nice things to your face. She's just not at the level of what you would think would be a president,” he ranted. In another instance, Watters called Harris a “frightened woman too insecure to tell us who she is” and claimed the media supported her because “they love a Black woman taking on a white man.” Fox has beenall in for Trump—and racism—for years, and with comments like Watters’, there’s no sign the network will stop any time soon.",Daily Kos,2025-01-15 19:00:07,Category not found,Polarised,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/1/15/2297080/-Fox-News-host-celebrates-lack-of-diverse-inauguration-performers
Biden spends final days in office tackling another important crisis,"In one of his final moves in office, President Joe Biden is aiming to eliminate some bureaucratic hurdles that have historically forced homeowners and renters into expensive mortgages and sky-high rental rates. On Tuesday, the Biden administrationunveileda $100 million grant program from the Department of Housing and Urban Development aimed at helping local communities identify and remove barriers to the production and preservation of affordable housing. “The United States faces a shortfall of millions of affordable homes that has driven up home prices and rents and has made finding a quality and affordable home out of reach for too many Americans,” the White House statement said. The grant will remove red tape and modernize local permitting procedures to facilitate the construction of new housing, finance the construction of new homes for renting and owning, and repair and revitalize existing buildings. New plans will be developedacross 14 states, including in the cities of San Francisco, California; Austin, Texas; Cincinnati, Ohio; Portland, Oregon; and St. Louis, Missouri. The White House also approved the first residential transit-oriented development (TOD) loan under the Department of Transportation’s lending programs. The new initiative will fund the creation of more than 300 new housing units near Florida’s Boca Raton Tri-Rail Station, which is expected to generate an annual $2 million in land lease revenue for the commuter rail system. This would help ensure that public transportation is accessible to people living in affordable housing, removing a potential barrier to employment. Housing experts from platforms like Zillowargue thatthe lack of housing supply is one of the main driving forces behind the soaring costs that have prohibited millions of Americans from entering the housing market. For many,skyrocketing rents and home pricescombined withstagnant wageshave made it nearly impossible to save for a down payment, locking an entire generation out of homeownership. Biden’s push to address the housing shortage is an extension of his 2022Housing Supply Action Plan, which aimed to reverse years of underbuilding and stimulate housing growth by offering incentives to state and local governments. For many Americans, the dream of homeownership has been squashed by the harsh reality of rising rents and unaffordable home prices. The pandemic-era boom in the housing market only exacerbated these trends, leaving many feeling like homeownership is an impossibility. During the2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump presented vastly different visions for tackling the housing crisis. Harris proposed a bold plan to offer $25,000 in down-payment assistance and to expand the supply of housing—focusing on practical steps to help people get into homes. Trump, on the other hand, was far less detailed. He suggested that curbing immigration could somehow ease housing costs. This was widely debunked, as immigration does not significantly impact housing prices. He also called for lowering mortgage rates, whichcurrently sit ataround 7.25% for a 30-year fixed loan. Though it remains unclear how he planned to achieve that, as the president is independent of the Federal Reserve, which dictates rates. Biden’s latest move is part of a series of sweeping policy decisions made during his final months in office, including signing a record number ofcommutations,cutting billionsin student loan debt,protecting landby designating two new national monuments, andbanning medical debtfrom impacting credit scores. As Biden moves forward with his efforts to ease the housing crunch, he seems to understand that boosting the housing supply and cutting through bureaucratic red tape are two crucial steps in making housing more affordable and accessible for millions of Americans. Time will only tell if Trump is on the same page.

GOP senator ditches skepticism and backs Pete Hegseth to lead Pentagon,"Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa announced late Tuesday that she’d vote in favor of President-elect Donald Trump’s utterly unqualified pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth—a move that suggests the former Fox News host has a high chance of being confirmed. During an appearance on anIowa radio showon Tuesday, Ernst said she believed that Hegseth adequately answered all her questions during his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. “He pointed out the woke issues at the Pentagon, and I think we’re at a point where now we can start moving forward. People know where he stands on these issues,” Ernstsaid. “I will be supporting President Trump’s pick for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth.” Ernst’s support is a huge boon for Hegseth’s odds, practically ensuring he’ll lead the Pentagon in Trump’s incoming administration. Assuming all Democrats oppose his nomination, Hegseth can afford to lose just three Republican senators. And while some in the GOP, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, stillhaven’t said how they’ll vote, Tuesday’s confirmation hearing demonstrated thatmany are on board with Hegsethand are willing to give hisabhorrent alleged behaviora pass. Part of what makes Ernst’s raving endorsement notable is her history as a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor whopreviously raised concernsover Hegseth’s ability to lead the Pentagon. In December, she cited unease over Hegseth’s past opposition to women serving in combat roles, though hewalked this backduring Tuesday’s hearing. It was also unclear how Ernst, who has crusaded for years to address sexual misconduct in the military, would respond to allegations that Hegseth raped a woman in 2017. (Hegseth maintains that theencounter was consensual.) Perhaps Ernst can stomach Hegseth’s nomination because sheintentionally distanced herselffrom some of the worst charges against him. According to new reporting from The New Yorker, Ernst declined an invitation to meet with the woman whom Hegseth paid to settle that 2017 sexual assault claim. Or maybe Ernst simply bowed to outsized pressure from the GOP base. After meeting with Hegseth in December and voicing doubts about whether she’d vote in his favor, she was relentlessly bullied by hardcore MAGA adherents. Not only did some of Trump’s most ardent supportersrun adsin Ernst’s home state of Iowa, but they alsoquestioned her conservative bona fideson social media. Mega-billionaire Elon Musk also pledged tobankroll primary challengesto Republicans who went against the president-elect. It appears that threats to primary Ernst worked. Following another December meeting with Hegseth, Ernstsignaled more opennessto his nomination. Thispressurevery likely helped change Ernst’s tone on Hegseth. Notably, on Tuesday, asDemocrats slammed the defense nomineeover his alleged drinking problem and past comments toward women, Ernsttossed him softballs. “As secretary of defense, will you appoint a senior-level official dedicated to sexual assault prevention and response?” she asked. “Senator, as we have discussed, yes I will,” Hegseth responded. Ernst is up forreelection in 2026in a statethat went for Trumpby more than 13 percentage points in November. Given that, it’s likely she would’ve been targeted by MAGA followers had she not kowtowed to the president-elect and refused to back Hegseth. That type of politicking might work for the likes of Collins or even Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who isalso on the fenceabout confirming Hegseth, but not the bulk of Senate Republicans who need Trump’s base of loyal Republicans to retain their positions in Congress. Ernst’s onetime arms-length attitude toward Hegseth signaled that some Senate Republicans would attempt to maintain independence under a second Trump administration, but the Iowan’s changed tune suggests that for Republican lawmakers, Trump is still king.

Nancy Mace threatens Jasmine Crockett during House proceeding,"During a hearing of the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace threatened to fight Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett after she called out Mace for anti-transgender bigotry. Crockett was attempting to get the committee to reinstate its subcommittee on civil rights when she took note of Mace’s recent anti-trans rhetoric andpromotion of billsmeant to restrict transgender rights. “Somebody’s campaign coffers really are struggling right now. So [Mace] gonna keep saying ‘trans, trans, trans’ so that people will feel threatened, and child, listen—” Crockett said. Mace interjected, saying, “I am no child, do not call me a child, I am no child,” then told Crockett, “If you want to take it outside, we can do that.” Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost objected to the call for violence, but Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican, ruled that the threat could merely have meant going outside to “have a cup of coffee or perhaps a beer.” Following the incident,Mace postedabout it on social media at least a dozen times but claimed that her response to Crockett was not about instigating a fight. “Please explain to me how the same damn Karen that called Cap[itol] Police on a child who shook her hand wanted to act like she wanted to fight me?!”Crockett wrote. “Republicans incite violence from the highest levels of government & ALSO claim to be the party of law & order.  The two cannot be true! Do yourself a favor, decide to require better of your electeds. Last I checked, threatening members in a committee room doesn’t exactly reduce the cost of eggs.” Mace has been widely criticized forpushing House Republicanleadership to adopt a rule that prevents transgender members of the House from using a restroom corresponding to their gender identity. The adoption of the rule followed the successful election of Rep. Sarah McBride, the first (and so far only) openly transgender member of Congress. After being criticized for her bigoted stance, Mace has spent months attacking transgender people. A recent fundraising text for Maceallegedthat a “Trans Mob” wanted to kill her. The comment from Crockett comes as the Republican-led Housepassed legislationto ban transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports at schools that receive funding from the federal government. The bill also changes federal law to say “sex shall be recognized based solely on a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.” Republicans pushed the bill through—only two Democrats supported it, and no Republicans opposed it—even as concerns have been raised that it would empower predators. “The House Republican Child Predator Empowerment Act does not promote fairness and safety in sports,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffrieswrote. “It will unleash horrific child predators on girls and young women throughout America. Unacceptable.” Frostnotedthat if the Republican bill became law, it would allow young children to be subjected to invasive questions about their genitals from strangers and that inspections could occurwithout parents present. “We must protect children. This bill is disgusting and puts every girl in this country at risk,” he wrote. Republicans,led by Donald Trump, have attacked transgender rights as a unifying rallying cry for bigots to support the party’s candidates at the polls.

Trump's tech sugar daddies bestowed VIP seats for Inauguration Day,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, and oh-so-”masculine"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be very special guests at Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. An official involved with the event planningconfirmed to NBC Newsthat three of the United States’ wealthiest men will be seated together on the platform as theconvicted felontakes the oath of office. The tech bros will be cozied up right next to Trump’s Cabinet nominees and other prominent elected officials. Given the billionaire trio’sseven-figure donationsto the inaugural fund, this naked display of favoritism on Trump’s big day doesn’t come as a surprise. As Daily Kos previously reported, a bunch of tech moguls have lined up tokiss Trump’s ring, offering sizable donations ahead of his second term. But as the three stooges kiss up to the incoming president and throw money at his feet, Musk, Zuckerberg, and Bezos also share something else in common: personal interests to protect. Online shopping mogul Bezos has alarge stake in defense contractswith his aerospace company Blue Origin—and he also has some trouble ahead with the Federal Trade Commission, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Amazon founder in 2023. The case made headlines last year when the government agency accused Bezos of concealing evidence by using the disappearing messaging service Signal amid the ongoing lawsuit. Despite multiple attempts by Amazon to get the lawsuit thrown out, the hearing is set to go ahead inOctober 2026. And while Bezos butted heads with Trump in the past, it’s clear he knows having Trump on his side this time around can only benefit him. As for Musk, the wealthiest man in the world has multiple investments hinging on his blossoming relationship with Trump—not to mention that Trump’s win aloneboosted Musk’s(and other billionaires’) wealth. Of course, Musk alreadyhas his own Trump-backed vanity projectto keep him and fellow tech bro billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy busy during the next four years: the very unofficial Department of Government Efficiency, which claims it will cut spending by $2 trillion. Zuckerberg also has some concerns about his empire that having a friendship with Trump might alleviate. The Meta owner is set togo to trial with the FTCin April over an antitrust lawsuit regarding his purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg allegedly purchased the apps at an exorbitant price in order to push out any possible competitors. The social media scion seems to be playing up his MAGA support in light of the new administration. As previously reported, Zuckerberg has called off the use ofindependent fact-checkerson Facebook, altered thehateful conduct policyto allow harassment of women and the LGBTQ+ community, announced that content moderation efforts willmove to the famously unbiased Texas, and is dismantling his company’sDEI initiatives. To really drive home his ass-kissing, Zuck is alsoreportedlycohosting a black-tie Inauguration Day reception for his new bestie. Billionaire oligarchs aside, Trump appears to be pulling out all the stops for his big day, booking country music singer Carrie Underwood to sing “America the Beautiful” as well. But given the incoming president’s obsession withcrowd sizesand big introductions, Trump wasn’t satisfied with a simple inauguration ceremony. The Republican will also be hosting three inauguration balls following the morning ceremony:the Commander in Chief Ball, the Liberty Inaugural Ball, and the Starlight Ball. Trump will also throw a so-calledVictory Rallyin D.C.’s Capital One Arena the night before. Given the millions of dollars that billionaires have lavished on his inaugural fund, the guy can certainly afford to throw multiple ego-stroking celebrations.
