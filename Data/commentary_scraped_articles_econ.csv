Eyes Wide Shut,"Three in four people in Britain polled support a national inquiry into the prolific and harrowing rape of the nation's children by insatiate "" grooming gangs ."" Yet, contrary to public will, the UK Labour Government last week voted against commissioning an investigation into this enduring horror. Public consciousness of child sexual exploitation in the United Kingdom reached an inflection point this winter after victims shared account after gut-churning account of sexual savagery and careless murder being perpetrated against underage white girls by Pakistani-Muslim men up and down the country. These brave survivors recount how police and social workers were complicit in their abuse, losing evidence, asserting that children could consent , and failing to investigate rapes for fear of being called racist. In one instance, a girl had a morning-after pill forced into her mouth by a police officer . Significant constituencies of the public believe that attempts are being made to cover up the historic failures of both local and national authorities, including 65% of Labour voters. These accusations of corruption, galvanised by high-profile political figures like Elon Musk, have been branded ' far-right' by Keir Starmer, which has only caused the public's attention to shift toward the prime minister and his record as Director of Public Prosecutions . The prime minister fueled speculations of a cover-up when he issued a three-line party whip--the most stringent form of party discipline--against Labour MPs, forcing them to vote against the investigation or risk expulsion from the party. When the vote came, therefore, MPs from the top 50 towns known to be sheltering grooming gangs either abstained or voted against the investigation. Only 3 MPs living in these grooming gang hotspots favoured an investigation. In each instance, the member came from the Conservative Party. No Labour MP voted in favour of an investigation, with around one-fifth abstaining or absent. The result produced a seismic backlash, including from angry victims , in whose names Labour claimed a national investigation would be counterproductive to change. The party line is, ""The investigation has already been had"" and ""It is time to get to work."" This has proven to be one of these sleight-of-hand truths intended to cover all manner of sins. As Reform MP Nigel Farage highlighted for the House, this preexisting inquiry--all 459 pages of it--fails to mention ""grooming gangs"" and of the over 50 towns in England known to be harbouring this scourge, only the infamous Rotherham is mentioned. It is thought that the number of girls who have been victims of child sexual exploitation, sexual assault, and rape by these gangs could be a quarter of a million--at the most conservative estimate. In twelve months alone, a Grooming Gangs Taskforce helped UK police identify and protect ""over 4,000 victims."" The towering ambiguity of just how many girls have been affected should, alone, give cause for a comprehensive, rigorous, and far-reaching investigation. The need is unambiguous and the public mandate is indisputable. Some within the Labour Party are coming to this realisation. MPs have begun to break ranks to side with the opposition in calling for an investigation, including Dan Carden , Paul Waugh , and Sarah Champion --MPs for the infamous Rochdale and Rotherham. But the cynic in me believes this limp 'I am Spartacus'-moment struggles to amount to more than career protection. I do not believe there is the desire or the passion to put an end to the ritual rape of these girls by gangs of foreign men. For decades, MPs have had their eyes wide shut to this scourge. The cold, unfeeling truth is that these girls have been dismissed because their abuse is a political inconvenience. The facts of this atrocity contradict the tenets of 'inclusivity' and 'tolerance' that characterise our modern age. From infancy until death, the public is schooled that diversity is--and can only ever be--a strength. If an immigrant living in a Western nation engages in criminal or grotesque behaviour, he does not reflect the customs and attitudes of his home nation. Nor is he to be included in the ranks of the 'DiverseTM'. He is to be viewed as an innocent--a child--lashing out at a cruel and misunderstanding people. Whether he emerges from a war zone or a paradise, he is to be understood as suffering an impenetrable trauma that gifts rationality to his barbarity. All of which is to say, it is impossible for one to identify a pattern of perversity in any one community, religion, country, or culture. It is in this vein that the British public is charged to ignore the demographic shift in their constituencies--ignore how this might influence a politician's vote. They are forbidden from noticing that the fast-food economy which sustains the middle-class lifestyle also sustains the perpetrators in these rape gangs. They must blind themselves to the incontrovertible. Labour is no longer the party of the white working class because the white, working-class vote is no longer useful to them.It is not the rape of the nation's children the UK Government is trying to cover up, nor is it the endemic failures in local councils and child protection services. What they wish to deny is an attitude: that the life of a white, working-class girl--much like her consent--is surplus to requirements.",The European Conservative,2025-01-14T14:20:20,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/eyes-wide-shut/
Europe Is Giving in to the Censorious Demands of Islam,"In July 2023, an Iranian man burned copies of the Bible and Torah outside the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen. The Danish authorities granted Medhi Zaman permission, and the demonstration was mostly disregarded by the general public. However, in both Denmark and Sweden, insulting Islam is treated differently. Last month, Salwan Momika, an Iraqi asylum seeker living in Sweden, was awaiting trial for a series of public burnings of the Quran. The 38-year-old anti-Islam activist did not attend court because, on January 29th, Momika was shot dead in what appears to be a retaliatory attack. Although Momika's protest is supposedly protected under Swedish law--the country scrapped its blasphemy laws in 1970--exceptions are made if the protest is viewed as incitement. He was awaiting a verdict on a charge of 'agitation against an ethnic group.' The protest sparked outrage in muslim-Majority countries. The Scandinavian Quran burnings were cited by Turkey as why they delayed Sweden's NATO membership for months. The Swedish embassy in Baghdad was attacked and its ambassador was expelled. Denmark was once a shining example of Enlightenment rationalism. When the government abolished all types of censorship in 1770, it asserted its citizens' right to free speech. This was demonstrated when it vigorously defended Jyllands-Posten , a Danish newspaper that published a dozen satirical cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in 2005. Despite the potential backlash and the threat to life, the administration remained steadfast in its protection of journalistic freedom.Things have changed, and it appears that certain accommodations have been made for Islam. In response to a series of book burnings, the country introduced what is widely referred to as ""t he Quran law "" in December 2023. Those who burn or defile holy texts face a fine and a maximum sentence of two years in prison. In January, two Danish citizens were the first to be charged under the new law. Both were accused of 'inappropriate treatment of a Quran' at a political festival in June of last year. Despite the European Court of Human Rights having stressed on numerous occasions that freedom of expression constitutes ""one of the essential foundations of a democratic society"", and that ""it is applicable not only to 'information' or 'ideas' that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population,"" there are still several EU members states that still punish 'insult to religion,' as noted on the website of End Blasphemy Laws. Britain has also formally abolished its blasphemy laws. However, the police's attitude towards those who ridicule Islam's holy book has remained mostly unchanged since 2008, when blasphemy was removed from the statute books. Last month, a man in Manchester was arrested on suspicion of a 'racially aggravated public order offence' after live-streaming himself burning a Quran. Then, just a few days ago, Metropolitan police charged a man with the same offence after a Quran was allegedly burned outside the Turkish consulate in central London, despite the activist being attacked by a man wielding a knife who objected to his protest and reportedly spat on him. In 2023, an autistic 14-year-old boy was suspended from a school in West Yorkshire when a copy of the Quran was scuffed. So great was the anger in the local Muslim community that the boy's mother appeared at a local mosque begging for forgiveness after his life was threatened. To compound the humiliation, her 'sinful' hair was covered to avoid any offending worshippers. The Batley Grammar School teacher who drew the wrath of Muslims in 2021 for displaying his students an illustration of the prophet Mohammed is allegedly still in hiding. When Labour MP Tahir Ali urged Sir Keir Starmer to prohibit the desecration of the Quran and other Abrahamic religious texts during Prime Minister's questions, it was obvious which faith he was talking about. Ali is ideologically captured by the electorate--57.5% of Ali's Birmingham constituency of Hall Green and Moseley are Muslim. Between 2011 and 2021, the Muslim population of England and Wales increased by more than a million, reaching almost 4 million, or approximately 6.5% of the population, and is estimated to rise to 17.2% by 2050. In response to Ali's proposal for a law to safeguard Islam from mockery, Prime Minister Starmer stated: ""I agree that desecration is awful and should be condemned across the House. We are ... committed to tackling all forms of hatred and division, including Islamophobia in all its forms."" Our ruling class's support for state-mandated multiculturalism has culminated in the creation of a new de facto blasphemy law: Islamophobia. During its time in opposition, the Labour Party adopted the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims (APPG) definition of Islamophobia, a version of which looks likely to be implemented by the government, according to the Sunday Telegraph . An APPG report defined it thus: ""Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness."" Following a string of Quran burnings in Scandinavia, the Guardian described the stunts as evidence of a 'racism crisis.' One of the Muslim women interviewed called book burning an example of 'Islamophobia.' However, Islam is a belief system, not a race. There are nearly two billion Muslims in the world, many of whom come from different ethnicities. When you criticise Islam, you are criticising an ideology, not a specific racial group: conflating race and ideas is an efficient technique to silence opposition. The real problem for Europe is definitely not imaginary Islamophobia, but Islam itself. Many convincingly argue that Islam is a religion that is inherently opposed to Western values. This was also evidenced by a survey done in March of last year: 52% of Muslims in the United Kingdom support legislation outlawing the display of images of the Prophet Mohammed within the next twenty years. If you live in the West, you must adhere to its laws and values. If this means tolerating somebody burning a religious text, then so be it. Living in a free society demands a trade-off. However, European countries, once the foundation of enlightenment thinking, have opened their borders and collectively accepted the censorious demands of Islam. Britain--the birthplace of liberty philosopher and advocate John Milton--has a long history of liberty, free expression, and the right to blaspheme. But after importing large numbers of people from countries with dictatorships or theocratic regimes, we seem to be forced to give up on these historically European principles.",The European Conservative,2025-03-01T08:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/europe-blasphemy-laws-censorious-demands-of-islam/
Hillbilly Meets Europe: A New Transatlantic Vision for the West,"Over the decades, the Munich Security Conferences have produced many famous and memorable speeches. Few of them have been as unusual as the one U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivered last Friday. Much of the audience, composed of high-ranking politicians and experts from EU and NATO countries, expected detailed policy outlines on transatlantic security and the war in Ukraine. But Vance focused on the basics, the common heritage, freedom, free speech, and true democracy. Although not many in the audience may have been receptive to these messages, there is certainly a growing number of people in Europe who are willing to work with the backbone, the patriots, the "" hillbillies "" of America on these fundamentals: the conservative sovereigntist forces of Europe such as the Patriots for Europe. What do these values have to do with geopolitics and security? Everything. They point to three main principles that unite the new American and European conservative movements: faith, national sovereignty, and peace through strength. Patriots on both sides of the Atlantic are convinced that our values are ultimately rooted in the principles of our Western civilization, in our faith, in our Christian heritage. It is the most cherished value to be preserved. Because of its uniqueness, Patriots do not believe that any other culture or nation outside the West should or could apply all of our values, principles, or laws. We take it for granted that all men are created equal--it's a Christian idea, after all--but we have learned the lessons of our own recent history about the dangers and costs of "" searching for monsters overseas ,"" even when doing so in the name of liberal democratic values. Patriots believe that we are in this world to have a home somewhere, to be part of a nation. National sovereignty is about solidarity and inclusion. The nation-state is the largest and most successful community of peoples bound together by common history, culture, and norms. When people question the value of the nation and either fantasize about globalist universalism or try to transcend national boundaries with imperial ambitions, they always end in disaster. Faith and national sovereignty recognize the realities of this world. America first, Europe first, Italy first, Hungary first also means that our interests in security, economics, and trade sometimes differ. But despite the critics, at their core, today's patriots have much more respect for other nations than liberal Western elites because they understand the fundamental value of national sovereignty. Finally, peace through strength. Patriots recognize power as the driver of international politics, so they see strong defense and deterrence as a necessity. At the same time, deterrence is enhanced not only by military strength, but also by clearly defining the boundaries of our genuine fundamental interests based on proper risk and cost assessments. Fighting endless unwinnable wars only undermines deterrence. As the Cold War taught us in the Koreas or Vietnam, winning the peace is sometimes more important than winning the war. The West faces daunting challenges. There is much common ground on both sides of the Atlantic among those who believe that the West needs a new kind of Reformation--one that looks boldly to the future, nourished by the wellsprings of original truths. At a recent meeting of the Patriots, Prime Minister Viktor Orban quoted another famous Hungarian, Ferenc Puskas, the greatest soccer player of all time, referring to conservative forces in Europe, ""The team is very much together."" When it comes to bold and powerful solutions in the Western political arena, an American quarterback in the team could change the name of the game for the better.",The European Conservative,2025-02-20T08:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/hillbilly-meets-europe-a-new-transatlantic-vision-for-the-west/
"‘You’re Not Too Conservative, Right?’—Election Weekend in Berlin","There were two types of Germans we met in Berlin while trying to gauge the public sentiment in the last days leading up to the election: Those who believe only the AfD can save Germany from its endemic problems, created by past governments; and those who think the only thing the country needs saving from is the AfD. There seemed to be no in-between, and most disturbingly, no willingness to listen to the other side, which was especially apparent on the Left. The election was rightly called historic for multiple reasons. Both big establishment parties (the CDU and the SPD) delivered one of the worst performances in their history, while the parties on the far sides of the political divide doubled their share of votes--all with a record-high voter turnout. But there has been much said already about the results and why Germans abandoned the center, so let's make an additional point instead, namely that the results you saw mark only the beginning, and not the end, of the process. Yes, AfD broke through the psychologically important 20% threshold for the first time, but there is no sign of them getting anywhere near a glass ceiling yet. To understand why, you have to look at the two primary factors driving the AfD's growth: the establishment's willful ignorance of the people's legitimate concerns--whether about energy prices, immigrant crime, or something else--as well as its insistence on the cordon sanitaire , the undemocratic firewall, against those calling for a change. ""The firewall will collapse, because it has to,"" we heard from AfD supporters time and time again. AfD fights for democracy, freedom of speech, security, and peace, they said, and deserves to participate in the public discourse as much as anyone else. Needless to say, AfD also has some homework to do before it can truly consolidate itself as a force not only able to shape but to lead the public discussion about Germany's future. And that means distancing itself from some of its more radical elements. For instance, Bjorn Hocke's Der Flugel faction might have a place in German politics, but AfD must decide whether it's possible to push them to be more aligned with the rest of the party or if it's better for the two to go their separate ways. The same could be said for Maximilian Krah--whose China spy scandal was first broken by the europeanconservative.com --and whose recent readmittance into the AfD might not have been the wisest choice. Still, the frustration about the isolation of the Right is entirely justified: the entire political establishment essentially told every fifth German that their opinions don't count. Expecting people to just give up after this would be utterly naive: they will keep voting AfD until the party reaches a critical threshold where exclusion is simply not an option. Check out what voters had to say about the #GermanElections ""We stand for democracy, freedom of speech, and security within our borders."" pic.twitter.com/cHHwBrV9sE Yet, a significant portion of society seems bent on denying them the chance to finally get their voice heard, regardless of who ends up in government or what damage to social cohesion and democratic integrity the firewall causes. ""The only thing that matters now is that the far-right is stopped. Nothing else comes close,"" one person told us while we were standing next to Berlin's famous Holocaust memorial, where a radicalized asylum seeker nearly fatally stabbed a Spanish tourist the night before after weeks of plotting to ""murder Jews,"" according to police. Yet, when we tried to ask this person what he thought about the increase in violent crime--a perfectly reasonable question given that the police cordons around the memorial were a visible reminder of the night's attack--he quickly cut the interview short. ""Are you a far-right media?"" No, just conservative. ""But not too conservative, right?"" What is 'too conservative' in today's Germany? Many make the point that AfD's program is nothing more than what mainstream right-wing parties, such as CDU, were advocating just a few decades ago. Given the left-wing shift that establishment center-right parties have undertaken, particularly since the early 2010s, perhaps it's better to flip the question. If one claims to represent conservatives but is unwilling to recognize the harm that uncontrolled migration has caused to our nations, then they're not conservative enough . We were expecting similar interactions with antifascist protesters outside the AfD's Lichtenberg headquarters. The East Berlin district has been voting for the far-left Die Linke since 2005, with the AfD now coming within touching distance of flipping it, finishing in second place with only a one percent difference. But when we tried to talk to anyone from the two protesting groups that completely surrounded the AfD's little rally--one organized by Die Linke and the other by hardcore 'Antifas'--we only received silence, or worse: violent threats. A few of them even began pushing us around , and we owe it to the intervening police that it didn't escalate further. Everywhere we looked, we met these two sides of Berlin: the 'only AfD' and the 'anything, but AfD.' And it's somewhat understandable, given that the party has been enduring unprecedented demonization from both mainstream media and politics. AfD's opponents don't waste time nitpicking through their program; instead, they just carelessly throw around the Nazi card, and the historical guilt deeply embedded in German society takes care of the rest. But, again, this will inevitably lead to two things. One is the further polarization of Germany's political landscape and the fragmentation of its society, and the other is the unavoidable collapse of the firewall. For a few weeks, the CDU's tactic of posing as more right-wing did more to preserve the firewall than years of propaganda. Yet, voters were once again slapped in the face when Merz took a U-turn on migration and called reports on his previous commitment on border control ""disinformation."" The possible impact of this betrayal in the coming years should not be underestimated, as you can only ignore your voters for so long. The firewall will collapse, because it has to.",The European Conservative,2025-02-27T14:42:19,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/youre-not-too-conservative-right-election-weekend-in-berlin/
The Spectre of Populism Is Haunting the EU,"Sunday's German elections showed the likely future direction of European politics. An uncertain future in which the old right and left parties of the establishment are struggling to hold their ground, and hold onto power, in the face of a growing populist revolt. And if the establishment forces cannot contain the revolt in Germany, the powerful heart of the European Union, what chance will they have elsewhere? When it became clear that his party had topped the polls, Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Germany's next chancellor, tried to declare an ""historic"" victory. The results did indeed make history, though not in the way that Merz claimed. The CDU, with its ally the Christian Social Union (CSU), won just 28.5% of the vote--the Christian Democrats' second-worst result in a modern general election, up only 4% on its lowest-ever result last time. The ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) under Olaf Scholz received 16.4% of the vote--its worst-ever result. The truly history-making positive results were for the right-wing populist party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) which came second after doubling its share of the vote to 20.8%. The Left opposition party also doubled its vote, to a more modest 8.8%. What's more, this breakthrough was achieved in an election with an historically high turnout of more than 80%, confirming voters' enthusiasm for something different. The German political establishment has spent years crying ""Nazi"" at the AfD, and doing all in its power to isolate, censor and even ban the upstart party. Yet it could not stop more than 10 million German citizens voting AfD. The national-populist party defied all the media caricatures, winning support not only in its strongholds in the former Communist east but also in the more prosperous west; winning votes not just from bitter, older Germans, but also from young people who want a better future. How did Merz, Scholz, and the rest of the elitists respond to the AfD's electoral success? By swearing that they would never cooperate with the ""far-right"" and blaming ""foreign interference"" for causing the rise of the populists, specifically the pro-AfD tweets from X boss and Trump ally Elon Musk. The bad news for the Berlin elites is that those millions of Germans did not choose to vote AfD because a U.S. tech titan told them to. Contrary to what their rulers apparently believe, ordinary Germans and other Europeans are not an ignorant herd to be commanded by an online pied piper. The real issue was not Musk, but migration; not online ""disinformation,"" but the real-world truth about the damage the EU's disastrous Net Zero religion has inflicted on German industry and agriculture. They decided for themselves that the old Germany is not working. No amount of bluster and Musk-blaming can disguise the historic crisis of the German political centre. In 1990, the first all-German elections after reunification, the CDU/CSU won with 44.3% and the SPD came second with 37%. Now the twin powers of German politics can barely muster 44% between them. More recently, in 2013, Angela Merkel's CDU could still command 41.5% of the vote. But that election was shortly before Germany's globalist queen opened its borders to mass migration from Muslim-majority countries, and opened the way for a national sovereigntist insurgency. Germans have voted for change. Yet they are most likely to get more of the same, via another 'Grand Coalition' of the two old parties. A CDU-SPD coalition, possibly with the inclusion of the Greens, would be a government that nobody intentionally voted for. Let's be clear: in shunning the AfD and clinging to the centre, Merz is not ""betraying"" conservatism. He is showing the CDU's true colours, as part of the old order, not a serious player in forging something new. Germany is the latest frontline in the battle between Two Europes: the official Europe of the Brussels elites and their allies, and the real one where millions of Europeans live, work, and suffer the consequences of their policies. It is a battle that has seen the rise of national-populist movements across the continent. The political and media elites have sought to make populism a dirty word. We should not be afraid of what they call us. The populist surge is a democratic revolt of those who have had enough and want to put the demos--the people--back into democracy. As MCC Brussels director Frank Furedi has observed, populism rejects not just those in power but also the elite values they espouse--their attempts to impose everything from open borders and Net Zero to trans ideology on Europe's traditional way of life. The populist revolt is reshaping European politics. It is potentially on a par with Europe's ""People's Spring"" or ""Spring of Nations"" in 1848, when national democratic revolutions brought major changes such as the abolition of serfdom in Hungary. Writing before last year's elections to the European Parliament, I observed that , ""At the time of the People's Spring of 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote their infamous Communist Manifesto , the opening of which captured the fears of the ancien regime : 'A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: pope and tsar, [Austrian imperial statesman] Metternich and [French prime minister] Guizot, French radicals and German police-spies.'"" ""If we were to write a revolutionary manifesto today,"" I went on, ""it might begin by capturing the fears of the left-liberal elites in response to the new Spring of Nations: 'A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre of populism. All the powers of the old EU have entered into an unholy alliance to exorcise this spectre: climate pope and Commission president, Chancellor Scholz and President Macron, French Islamo-leftists and German thoughtpolice.'"" The electoral success of the despised AfD confirms that the terrifying spectre of populism is haunting the EU elites even more powerfully today--and swapping Chancellor Merz for Scholz is not going to banish it. Merz has sworn to make a new Europe that is ""independent"" from the US. We need a new Europe of nations that are independent from the failed old EU elites.",The European Conservative,2025-02-24T16:29:09,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/democracy-watch/the-spectre-of-populism-is-haunting-the-eu/

The original job posting can be viewed here . Would that this were an aberration, but it's been a long time coming. Spy chiefs were reportedly clamouring for a b lack, female James Bond a while back, in a bid to ""drive diversity."" Facts driving fiction, or the other way round? Whatever it is, the intelligence services are way behind the curve; the latest in a long line of British institutions mistaking diversity for competence. In fact, in order to save time you'd probably be better off compiling a list of British institutions which haven't been infected with the diversity bug. All sections of the Armed Forces have made the suicidal decision to discourage or outright ban white men from applying for positions. The BBC of course is staunchly anti-white in its hiring practice, as are large swathes of the mainstream media. The police discriminate against white applicants, whenever they think they can get away with it. Schools are being encouraged to discriminate against white teachers , while white students are routinely excluded from opportunities all the way from primary school to university level. The only time the insatiable lust for diversity failed to materialise was the recent push for assisted dying adverts on the Tube, where whites celebrating their own untimely death were mysteriously back in demand. Make your own mind up as to why that might be. This matters. It's one thing for dyed-in-the-wool anglophobes like the Beeb to indulge in the exclusion of whites (and of course, equally unacceptable), but the authorities signing up to such practices is a far more sinister problem. Demography is only moving one way in Britain, engineered deliberately by successive administrations, as Keir Starmer recently admitted. Muhammad is now officially the most popular baby name for boys in England and Wales, a fact even the Office for National Statistics can no longer deny. Of course, this has been the case for at least a decade; it's just that the convenient 14 variants of the name (Muhammad, Mohammed, Mohammad, Muhammed, Mohamed, Mohamad, Muhamad, Muhamed, Mohamud, Mohummad, Mohummed, Mouhamed, Mohammod, and Mouhamad, if you're curious) have allowed the statisticians to pretend that this was not so. If you believe the ONS then, various incarnations of Muhammad are the 1st, 33rd, and 68th most popular names in Britain. Alas, we are no longer a serious country. The long-term effect of Muslim babies dominating the maternity wards has yet to be observed. What has been witnessed in the space of my lifetime, however, is the demographic transformation of the country. Whites are a minority in the capital, a minority in major cities, and will eventually be a minority across the nation (without serious course correction). The timeline for which is estimated at something like 2050 , the only caveat being that however lunatic the demographic projections appear to be, they always turn out to have underestimated the speed of replacement. The establishment customarily gerrymander the figures until the practice is untenable, at which point the mood shifts to aggressive questions as to why such an eventuality would be problematic. As a case in point, consider 2022 when Nigel Farage was roundly lambasted for the claim that ""London, Birmingham and Manchester are all now minority white cities."" The BBC took him to task, as did the ONS , as indeed did the fact-checkers at Full Fact . Except Nigel Farage was not wrong, which is why Sajid Javid decided to change tack and simply said ""So what?"" So what indeed, just get on with it. Except, this isn't merely something to 'get on with.' Britain is one of, if not the most, tolerant societies in the world. The same is unlikely to be true of the populations it has suicidally imported in recent years. Anti-white critical race theory is being taught secretly in Britain's schools , while anti-white government policies are the norm. Indeed, being pro-white is effectively illegal, as anything which celebrates whiteness is either investigated as a hate crime, e.g. ' It's OK to be white ,' and in some cases determined a jailable offence. That white native Brits may soon be a minority in their own homeland is not nothing, however there's no reason to speed up the process. Actively denying white Brits access to education, employment, and indeed free speech is not just immoral, it's also no recipe for social cohesion. Furthermore, denying them access to the levers of power on the grounds that they are not sufficiently diverse, is little more than an invitation to civil war. Reverse colonisation may currently be a joke made during after-dinner speeches , but there are those with prominent voices who would support such a policy in Britain. It's not so long ago that these Isles were run by Rishi Sunak, Humza Yousaf, and Vaughan Gething--none of whom are now in situ. That might tell us something about our predilection for diversity, and perhaps also the invalidity of such nonsense.",The European Conservative,2024-12-16T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/no-whites-please/
"Trump, Putin, Zelensky, and the Geopolitics of Resources","The Ukrainian nation is fighting for its sovereignty, yet it lost independence. Ukraine's economy, military apparatus, and political decisions have become subordinated to the interests of the United States and its allies in the EU. This reality is fundamental in international relations, and yet it is hardly ever acknowledged in any of the ""profound"" debates or articles about the Russo-Ukrainian war. The hypocrisy in international relations has allowed Russia and China to grow exponentially at the expense of a self-absorbed West. Washington has also fallen prey to this blindness, especially with the Democrats in power. U.S. President Donald Trump's recent diplomatic offensive has highlighted what has long been suggested, but rarely openly spelled out: Kyiv has no real autonomy in negotiating peace. What is surprising is that despite years of reporting on Ukraine's corruption or on the curbing of the rights of the country's national minorities , Zelensky is still portrayed as a hero. There are many arguments to defend Zelensky, without a doubt, but they are certainly not the ones being used by Brussels and its satellites. One of the most controversial aspects of Zelensky's governance has been his refusal to hold elections, using martial law as an excuse. Since the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian president has suspended opposition parties, banned critical media outlets, and concentrated more power in his administration than any other Ukrainian leader in recent history--not even the pro-Russians under Moscow's protection dared to go this far. This situation, and the fact that Zelensky's presidential term expired in 2024, led Trump to label him a ""dictator without elections,"" a statement that sparked outrage in Brussels. pic.twitter.com/PMcrOwXejI Does it make sense not to hold elections during war? Undoubtedly. But why tell only part of the story? Washington's involvement in Ukrainian politics did not begin after the 2022 Russian invasion. Since the 2014 coup known as the Maidan Revolution--actively supported by the U.S. and the EU--Ukraine has been used as a pawn in the West's geopolitical strategy against Russia. The New York Times published an extensive report last year explaining how the CIA has controlled the country for the past ten years. The piece was published in 2024--subtract ten years, and you land in 2014... Add to this Victoria Nuland's infamous ""f*ck the EU"" comment (the actual U.S. shadow operator in Ukraine at that time), Hunter Biden's Burisma scandal, and the explicit support for Ukrainian oligarchs by Brussels and Washington authorities. Zelensky's rise to power in 2019 was presented as a change, but his administration has proven just as dependent on Washington as his predecessors. It has been revealed by multiple players that several peace agreements were already in the pipeline when they were blocked by Biden's Washington and Boris Johnson's London. This, too, seems to have been conveniently forgotten. But Robert F. Kennedy has now reminded us of it. RFK JR. DROPS BOMBSHELL--BIDEN BLOCKED UKRAINE PEACE DEAL IN 2022! Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has just EXPOSED the truth about the war in Ukraine: The conflict could have ended in April 2022, but Biden STOPPED IT! According to RFK Jr., Joe Biden sent Boris Johnson to... pic.twitter.com/jezZ9ngnny The volume of U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine since 2022 exceeds $350 billion. Then add the dollars spent by the CIA in the ten years since 2014 to this figure, and even Elon Musk's Starlink. During EU coordination meetings in 2023 , the bloc even proposed ""climate taxes"" to finance aid to Ukraine. Yes, you read that correctly. Climate change is an excuse to impose more taxes on European citizens to fund Ukraine's war efforts. And yet, all this money has not secured a military victory. What you get is numerous European reports pointing to the misallocation of funds and a lack of transparency in the Ukrainian administration. The recent resumption of the U.S.-Russia negotiations in Riyadh without Ukraine's presence demonstrates that the country's fate is not being decided in Kyiv but in Washington and Moscow. Zelensky may have rejected in advance any peace plans that do not involve his participation, but his voice carries little weight in key decisions about Ukraine's future. Indeed, it did not take long for the Ukrainian leader to start toning down his rhetoric. Just a couple of days ago, he spoke in an already friendlier voice to Washington, knowing that it is unwise to bite the hand that feeds you. A lot of meetings and briefings--military command, intelligence, ministers--all in preparation for talks with President Trump's representative, General Kellogg, who is already in Kyiv.

European leaders ignore the consequences of this stance. With a defense industry incapable of matching Russia's production capacity and an economy weakened by sanctions that have hurt the EU more than Moscow , Europe continues down an unsustainable path. Russia is still producing and buying more weapons than the entire EU combined . Brussels must wake up. The question is not whether Ukraine should win or lose but whether it can continue to exist as a viable nation. The strategy must change--before it is too late. On the other hand, for Europe to remain a global power and stay relevant on today's changing geopolitical stage, relations with Russia must be reactivated. This should not be viewed as some 'pact with the devil,' as many do, but pure ""resource geopolitics.""

Establishment Is Panicking as Germany’s Firewall Crumbles,"Less than three weeks before the general elections in Germany, calls to ban the right-populist AfD have reached a fever pitch. Last week, a proposal, supported by 123 MPs was brought to the Bundestag (German Parliament), demanding that a ""Verbotsantrag""--an application for a party ban--be urgently pursued. Marco Wanderwitz , a CDU parliamentarian and one of the initiative's leaders, defended the proposal saying: ""They are enemies of the constitution... they are the enemies of democracy... the German state cannot tolerate the AfD without suffering long-term, irreparable damage to its very foundations."" The push to ban the AfD isn't new. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser of the left-wing Social Democrats (SPD) floated the idea in 2023, with other leading government members supporting it. But now, the ban's advocates find their influence waning. Faeser, one of Germany's least popular politicians, faces dim prospects for another term, while her SPD party languishes at around 15% in the polls. Meanwhile, Wanderwitz--who lost his seat to the AfD in the 2021, but was still returned to the Bundestag via his party's regional list--isn't even seeking reelection. His urgent plea that the Bundestag ""shouldn't wait any longer"" betrays a stark fear: once voters get to decide, the pro-ban faction will likely lose any chance of gaining the necessary majority. The AfD's seemingly unstoppable rise has shaken the German establishment to the core. Polls suggest the party could secure over 20% in the election. Yet the fear of populists--and by extension, their voters--has also been amplified by fractures within the establishment itself. The mainstream parties long maintained a united front against the AfD, operating under an iron-clad consensus: any AfD legislative proposals would be automatically rejected, while mainstream bills receiving AfD support would be withdrawn. This ""firewall"" strategy has now been breached by Friedrich Merz, the CDU opposition leader and chancellor candidate. In a move described as a ' taboo-breaking gambit ', Merz last week pushed forward proposals for stricter migration measures despite AfD support. This marked a significant shift in Germany's establishment, where the practice of cordoning off the AfD had been treated as sacrosanct. His proposals included implementing permanent border controls, limiting family reunifications, and expanding detention for illegal immigrants. He advanced them in the wake of yet another deadly knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg , in which an illegal immigrant from Afghanistan killed a toddler and a 41-year-old man. Facing sharp criticism Merz responded: ""Deciding what is right does not become wrong because the wrong people--i.e. the AfD--agree... How many more people need to be murdered?"" He also rejected the 'firewall' terminology, stating: ""The word firewall (...) is not used by me. Firewall is the wrong image. I don't want the fire behind the wall to become a conflagration throughout Germany."" Merz's initiative sparked immediate hysteria. On Saturday, thousands--including prominent politicians from the Greens, SPD, and Left Party--protested against Merz in several cities. In Leipzig, demonstrators chanted "" We all hate the CDU. "" The protests continued on Sunday when 160,000 people marched in Berlin under the slogan "" Uprising of the decent--We are the firewall."" Former chancellor Angela Merkel has also entered the debate with sharp criticism of Merz, her successor as CDU leader. Yet calling for a firewall against--or the outright banning of--a party supported by a fifth of voters is profoundly anti-democratic. Proponents justify this using the distinctly German concept of ""defensive democracy,"" which advocates preemptively combating extremist movements. Under this doctrine, the Federal Constitutional Court can ban parties after a parliamentary majority vote. Only twice has this occurred since World War II: against a neo-Nazi party in 1952 and the Communist Party (KPD) in 1956. A party ban remains a complex, lengthy process, but the establishment's anxiety already extends to future electoral cycles. Mainstream media outlets claim the AfD is orchestrating a path to power by 2029, with Stern writing: ""As a chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel aims to lead the AfD to second place in the Bundestag elections. Then the final stretch to government will begin. Target year: 2029 ."" Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) meanwhile, pointed to Austria where the right-populist FPO recently won an election and is now set to form a coalition with the conservatives. He warned that ""Germany is about to go the same way"" and that Merz couldn't be trusted. While the election will show whether Merz's initiatives have won back disaffected voters, one thing is clear: the advocates of firewalls and bans abandoned the pursuit of majorities long ago. Their only path to continued governance lies in marginalizing ever-larger segments of the electorate. For the CDU, the firewall strategy has proven catastrophic, forcing dependence on the SPD and Greens on crucial issues like migration. The tactic has also led voters to despair, with many doubting, as polls show, that much will change , even if the despised current government coalition loses power. Merz is right to reject the firewall; now it's time to similarly reject the undemocratic calls for a party ban.",The European Conservative,2025-02-03T11:52:33,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/germanys-firewall-is-crumbling-and-the-establishment-is-panicking/
Racial Vengeance Gets a Free Pass in Grooming Gang Britain,"Finally, after decades of silence enforced by Britain's elites, a long-overdue debate has erupted about the rape gangs that stalk the streets of far too many towns in the United Kingdom. An outraged backlash has been growing since GB News reported that the Labour government's Safeguarding Minister, Jess Phillips, had rejected calls from grooming gang survivors in the northern town of Oldham for a public inquiry into the abuse they suffered and the way it was covered up. The interventions of Elon Musk, J.D. Vance, Nigel Farage, and Kemi Badenoch have made it difficult to ignore the depravity of organised grooming gang activity in England. For more than 20 years it has been an open secret that, in numerous English towns and cities, 'Asian'--principally Pakistani--rape gangs were operating in plain sight of the local police and officialdom. The 2013 sentencing report into the Oxford grooming gang leaves no doubt about the moral depravity of these criminals. These gangs were given a free pass to carry on with their monstrous crimes because neither the local nor the national elites were prepared to acknowledge the fact that multicultural Britain was in big trouble. Anyone who tried to expose the activities of these grooming gangs and highlight the ethnic origins of the criminals and the victims was immediately denounced as Islamophobic and racist. I still remember the vilification of Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley in Yorkshire, for daring to publicise horrific stories of abuse from a group of seven local mothers in 2003. These women told Cryer about how their young daughters were being abused repeatedly by their Asian 'boyfriends.' For trying to publicise the staggering scale of these crimes, Cryer was denounced as an Islamophobe and branded a racist, a liar, and a fantasist. Faced with such a ferocity of hatred, Cryer was forced to install a panic button in her own home. It has been more than two decades since a group of multiculturalist entrepreneurs and their collaborators in the media and the political establishment attempted to shut Cryer down. Since that time, any politician who dared to tell it like it is has faced a similar reaction. Even former Labour home secretary Jack Straw was accused of 'stereotyping' when he spoke in 2011 of ""a specific problem which involves Pakistani-heritage men ... who target vulnerable, young, white girls who they regard as 'easy meat.'"" Last year, the former Tory Home Secretary Suella Braverman sought to call out the many Labour Councils who refused to clamp down on the rape gangs because they did not want to ""come across as racist ."" She was immediately branded as Islamophobic and accused of pandering to the 'far right' and dog-whistling to racists. A veritable army of academics, race relations experts, and media pontificators respond to revelations about the hideous behaviour of Asian rape gangs by arguing that these crimes have nothing to do with their ethnic backgrounds. They have dreamt up 'facts' that supposedly show that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white. According to their version of events, the problem of grooming gangs is invented or inflated by Islamophobes. No doubt if they were confronted with pictures of the Oxford gang responsible for the most hideous of crimes their report would make no mention of their ethnic background. So why are these gangs given a free pass to carry on with their hideous exploitation of young girls? First of all, it is electoral calculations that lead many Labour politicians such as Jess Phillips to betray the victims of the rape gangs. There are numerous reports of Labour politicians ignoring or downplaying the threat posed by these gangs to their communities. As far as they are concerned, they don't want to do anything that may upset their Muslim constituency. In the 2024 general election, Labour was defeated by 'pro-Gaza' candidates in several former strongholds with large Muslim populations; Phillips very nearly lost her Birmingham seat. However, the cowardly behaviour of Labour politicians is matched by their Conservative colleagues. Conservative ministers and politicians have tended to go along with the reassuring noises of multicultural entrepreneurs and have been reluctant to draw attention to the ethnic background of the criminals and of their victims. They too believe that the myth of multicultural harmony must prevail. And they too do not want to be accused of Islamophobia. Political opportunism coexists with anxiety about the consequences of fully revealing the truth about the rape gangs. Local officials and the police have opted to ignore the problem because they are worried about their capacity to deal with potential accusations of Islamophobia. They fear protests from the Muslim community, and a backlash from the white working class, and are far from certain about their ability to maintain law and order. The political conspiracy of silence around the rape gangs is ultimately founded on the belief that telling the truth would unleash a chain of events that could expose the fragile foundations of multiculturalism. Most attempts to explain the grooming gangs miss what is distinctive about this form of inter-community crime. Commentators have drawn attention to the misogynous behaviour of the gang members. Obviously, they are misogynous, but a general hatred of women cannot account for the kind of systematic evil that these men inflict on their victims. Misogyny alone does not lead to such intense group brutality and the total dehumanisation of their victims. Nor does it explain why the victims are not just any young girls, but children and teenagers who happen to be white. Some have argued that what is most significant is the question of class, since these predators mostly prey on working-class girls. It is certainly true that the victims of these gangs tend to come from relatively poor and underprivileged backgrounds. No doubt, young girls from economically insecure and socially fragmented communities are easier prey than those who come from stable middle-class homes. However, it is not their class background that interests grooming gangs, but their accessibility. And what they are interested in is not just girls but those who happen to be white. Others have suggested that these crimes are a reaction against the strict sexual mores that prevail in Muslim communities, and that frustrated Muslim men are simply taking advantage of the availability of non-Muslim girls. But looking for sexual partners from a non-Muslim background does not lead to committing horrific crimes of abuse. Most Muslim men who have sex with women outside their community are simply having sex and not committing a crime. Sexual opportunism should not be confused with the brutish activities of the rape gangs. That the rapist gangs happen to be mainly Pakistani, and their victims white, is not an accident. Why? Because these men are not simply motivated by misogyny nor by sexual domination, but also by racial vengeance. Indeed, the most distinctive feature of the grooming gang phenomenon is its racial dimension. Anyone who is interested in understanding the dynamic at play should listen to the dehumanised language used by members of these gangs when they discuss the 'white sluts' who they dominate and rape. As far as they are concerned, it is through their domination of these 'white sluts' that they feel that they have struck a blow against a society and a culture that they despise. Every time they inflict a sordid act of humiliation on a young white girl, they imagine that they got one back against a system that fails to esteem them. It is only when you grasp the motive of racial vengeance that the unrestrained and dehumanised brutality of something like the Oxford rape gang becomes understandable. From this perspective, the more disgusting the act inflicted on a 12- or 13-year-old child, the greater the sense of accomplishment. Left to their devices, these men would not be averse to emulating the kind of total brutality and degradation that Hamas inflicted on Israeli women on 7 October. The sexual exploitation and abuse perpetrated by the rape gangs has little to do with the quest for sexual pleasure or even sex. For these men, sexual domination serves as a way of taking revenge on white society. The refusal to publicly acknowledge the racial dimension of these crimes constitutes a betrayal of the victims. The most powerless section of British society is sacrificed on the altar of multiculturalism. Unless we grasp this reality and expose these hideous activities for what they are, these criminals will escalate and expand their activities on the streets of England. What should really worry us is not only the willingness of groups of men to embrace such extreme forms of morally depraved behaviour. It is also the reaction, or the lack of reaction, to it from Britain's political and cultural elites. As far as they were concerned, it was better that the victims of the rape gang accepted their horrible fate than that the public was made aware of some very disturbing inconvenient truths about multicultural Britain. Their shocking response and institutional collusion with the rape gangs continues. But hopefully not for long! This article was published on the author's Substack on January 4, 2025.

Free Speech: What Are They Afraid Of?,"Looking back at the troubled but in many ways exhilarating year of 2024, one important lesson we conservatives had to learn was that our liberties cannot be taken for granted. In self-proclaimed liberal societies, fundamental freedoms such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech came under an unprecedented attack last year, right here in the ""heart of Europe."" The first slap in the face came when an overzealous Brussels mayor, emboldened by years of demonizing and ostracizing the Right, attempted to shut down the National Conservatism (NatCon) conference in April, despite the event being Europe's most prestigious conservative gathering (proudly co-sponsored by The European Conservative ). He labeled attendees as dangerous ""far-right"" extremists and made it clear that we were ""not welcome"" in the city. Even though common sense prevailed in the courtroom where the late-night appeal that we lodged against the mayor's order was upheld, the fact that this could happen was truly surreal. After the NatCon conference had been barred from two venues, the third venue was surrounded by police as if the attendees and speakers--such as Suella Braverman, Nigel Farage, Mateusz Morawiecki, or Viktor Orban--were criminals or, rather, public enemies. The conference organizers and the proprietors of the Claridge Hotel stood firm in the face of such intimidation and the event was a great success. But the outrageous attack on free speech was a clear sign to us all of which way the political wind is blowing in Brussels. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo did slam the attempted use of Brussels police to censor public debate as ""unacceptable"" and reminded his rogue mayor that banning political meetings is unconstitutional in Belgium. However, the overall response from Brussels' left-liberal establishment was that, while the mayor might have overplayed his hand this time, the ""far-right"" really was ""not welcome"" in the capital of the EU. The #Brussels police is trying to shut down @NatConTalk ! It seems there is no place for #FreeSpeech in the 'heart of Europe.' pic.twitter.com/yEo6NNmFL4 Then came September, when the bookstore that was supposed to host the launch of MCC Brussels' executive director Professor Frank Furedi's book The War Against the Past canceled the event a few days beforehand. The bookstore cited concerns about the ""political connotation"" of collaborating with MCC, and ironically justified its decision by highlighting its commitment to being ""an inclusive space."" Apparently, 'inclusive' means exclusive of anything conservative. November was not without cancel culture stunts in the capital of Europe either. As europeanconservative.com reported , a mob of violent Antifa-style protesters clashed with Belgian riot police after an attempt to scare organizers into shutting down the launch of French National Rally leader Jordan Bardella's new bestseller at the House of Hungary in Brussels. The book launch did take place, as the organizers refused to cave to pressure, despite attendees being branded as ""fascist scum"" on social media for daring to turn up to a book launch. In fact, the pervasive cancel culture demonstrated by these 2024 incidents is evident in the Left's grip on language. This is a sort of semantic autocracy in which certain words are expropriated so that they can be used against whoever dares to think differently. Typical examples are 'disinformation,' 'far-right,' or 'inclusive.' Decoding these words, it is obvious that 'disinformation' often refers to any unwelcome truth, 'far-right' equals any conservative viewpoint outside the center, and 'inclusive' means anti-conservative, anti-native, and anti-Christian. This false dichotomy manifested through language was also used to justify blatantly anti-democratic decisions in the name of defending democracy, such as excluding the only conservative candidate due to take part from the final TV debate before the EU elections. Presumably pressured by the mainstream parties, the European Broadcast Union banned the one real opposition speaker from being on the same stage as Commission President Ursula von der Leyen--resulting in something that can hardly be called a debate. At a time when Big Tech is often operating in cahoots with Brussels, removing 'offensive' posts from social media, conservatives have often felt obliged to exercise self-censorship for fear of their message being suppressed or outright canceled by hostile algorithms and biased authorities. This is a less visible but equally detrimental form of attacking free speech. These and other examples of fundamental freedoms being threatened last year did not materialize out of the blue. They were the logical consequence of an advancing trend perceptible for some time: an assault on free thought by several actors, led from the top down by the EU's ""technocratic oligarchy,"" as MCC Brussels' Dr. Norman Lewis put in in his report on how the EU elites are striving to ""control the narrative"" and thus thought-police their own citizens. A major milestone on the road to silencing dissent in the EU is the Digital Services Act (DSA) of 2024. This road to hell may allegedly be paved with good intentions, with the apparent aim of preventing 'hate speech' and incitement, but what we see in practice is the disproportionate restriction of the freedom of expression on social media platforms based on people's political or religious beliefs. While this type of censorship is now legally imposed on digital corporations by the European Commission, discriminating against individuals and content these same companies deem undesirable has been their standard practice for years, as demonstrated by the scandals around Facebook , pre-Elon Musk Twitter , and Google . The DSA gives Big Tech the license to censor dissident posts harder and faster. These assaults on our basic freedoms--relativized and trivialized by the mainstream media--were shocking, but they also served as a wake-up call and a rallying force for the Right. The attempt to silence what conservatives have to say has helped us see our adversaries' true colors and catalyzed a new defense of free speech on the Right. I am even tempted to say: ""Bring it on, keep it coming."" But since democratic discourse fundamentally relies on the unrestricted exchange of ideas, let's wish that common sense and decency prevail in 2025 for the benefit of us all--while being ready to defend free speech whenever and from wherever fresh threats arise.",The European Conservative,2025-01-02T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/free-speech-what-are-they-afraid-of/
"""If you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you""—JD Vance’s Challenge to Europe’s Leaders","This is the text of U.S. Vice President JD Vance's speech to the Munich Security Conference on Friday, February 14th transcribed by europeanconservative.com. I want to say that I was fortunate in my time here to spend some time outside the walls of this conference over the last 24 hours, and I've been so impressed by the hospitality of the people, even as, of course, as they're reeling from yesterday's horrendous attack. And the first time I was ever in Munich was with my wife, actually, who's here with me today, on a personal trip. And I've always loved the city of Munich, and I've always loved its people. I just want to say that we're very moved, and our thoughts and prayers are with Munich and everybody affected by the evil inflicted on this beautiful community. We're thinking about you. We're praying for you, and we will certainly be rooting for you in the days and weeks to come. We gather at this conference, of course, to discuss security, and normally we mean threats to our external security. I see many great military leaders gathered here today. But while the Trump administration is very concerned with European security, and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense, the threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America. I was struck that a former European Commissioner went on television recently and sounded delighted that the Romanian government had just annulled an entire election. He warned that if things don't go to plan, the very same thing could happen in Germany too. Now, these cavalier statements are shocking to American ears. For years, we've been told that everything we fund and support is in the name of our shared democratic values. Everything from our Ukraine policy to digital censorship is billed as a defense of democracy. But when we see European courts canceling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others, we ought to ask whether we're holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard. And I say ourselves, because I fundamentally believe that we are on the same team. We must do more than talk about democratic values. We must live them. Within living memory of many of you in this room, the Cold War positioned defenders of democracy against much more tyrannical forces on this continent, and consider the side in that fight that censored dissidents, that closed churches, that canceled elections. Were they the good guys? Certainly not--and thank God they lost the Cold War. They lost because they neither valued nor respected all of the extraordinary blessings of liberty, the freedom to surprise, to make mistakes, to invent, to build. As it turns out, you can't mandate innovation or creativity, just as you can't force people what to think, what to feel, or what to believe--and we believe those things are certainly connected. Unfortunately, when I look at Europe today, it's sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the Cold War's winners. I look to Brussels, where EU Commission commissars warn citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they've judged to be 'hateful content.' Or to this very country, where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of 'combating misogyny on the internet.' I look to Sweden where, two weeks ago, the government convicted a Christian activist for participating in Quran burnings that resulted in his friend's murder. And as the judge in his case chillingly noted, Sweden's laws to supposedly protect free expression do not, in fact, grant, and I'm quoting, ""a free pass to do or say anything without risking offending the group that holds that belief."" And perhaps most concerningly, I look to our very dear friends, the United Kingdom, where the backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic liberties of religious Britons, in particular, in the crosshairs. A little over two years ago, the British government charged Adam Smith Connor, a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an Army veteran, with the heinous crime of standing 50 meters from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes. Not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own. After British law enforcement spotted him and demanded to know what he was praying for, Adam replied simply, it was on behalf of the unborn son he and his former girlfriend had aborted years before. Now, the officers were not moved. Adam was found guilty of breaking the government's new buffer zones law, which criminalizes silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person's decision within 200 meters of an abortion facility. He was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution. Now I wish I could say that this was a fluke, a one-off, crazy example of a badly written law being enacted against a single person, but no. This last October, just a few months ago, the Scottish government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law. Naturally, the government urged readers to report any fellow citizen suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and across Europe. Free speech, I fear, is in retreat and in the interest of comedy, my friends, but also in the interest of truth, I will admit that sometimes the loudest voices for censorship have come not from within Europe, but from within my own country, where the prior administration threatened and bullied social media companies to censor so-called misinformation. Misinformation, like, for example, the idea that coronavirus had likely leaked from a laboratory in China. Our own government encouraged private companies to silence people who dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth. So, I come here today not just with an observation, but with an offer. Just as the Biden administration seemed desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, so the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite, and I hope that we can work together on that. In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town, and under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square. Agree or disagree. Now we're at the point, of course, that the situation has gotten so bad that this December, Romania straight up canceled the results of a presidential election based on the flimsy suspicions of an intelligence agency and enormous pressure from its continental neighbors. Now, as I understand it, the argument was that Russian disinformation had infected the Romanian elections. But I'd ask my European friends to have some perspective. You can believe it's wrong for Russia to buy social media advertisements to influence your elections. We certainly do. You can condemn it on the world stage, even. But if your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with. Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear, and I really do believe that allowing our citizens to speak their mind will make them stronger still. Which, of course, brings us back to Munich, where the organizers of this very conference have banned lawmakers representing populist parties on both the left and the right from participating in these conversations. Now, again, we don't have to agree with everything or anything that people say, but when people represent, when political leaders represent an important constituency, it is an incumbent upon us to at least participate in dialogue with them. Now, to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don't like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion, or, God forbid, vote a different way, or, even worse, win an election. Now, this is a security conference, and I'm sure you all came here prepared to talk about how exactly you intend to increase defense spending over the next few years in line with some new target. And that's great because, as President Trump has made abundantly clear, he believes that our European friends must play a bigger role in the future of this continent. We don't think you heard this term 'burden sharing', but we think it's an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up, while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. But let me also ask you, how will you even begin to think through the kinds of budgeting questions if we don't know what it is that we are defending in the first place? I've heard a lot already in my conversations, and I've had many, many great conversations with many people gathered here in this room. I've heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that's important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me--and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe--is what exactly it is that you're defending yourselves for. What is the positive vision that animates this shared security compact that we all believe is so important. I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions, and the conscience that guide your very own people. Europe faces many challenges, but the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis I believe we all face together, is one of our own making. If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump. You need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years. Have we learned nothing that thin mandates produce unstable results? But there is so much of value that can be accomplished with the kind of democratic mandate that I think will come from being more responsive to the voices of your citizens. If you're going to enjoy competitive economies, if you're going to enjoy affordable energy and secure supply chains, then you need mandates to govern, because you have to make difficult choices to enjoy all of these things. And of course, we know that very well in America. You cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail, whether that's the leader of the opposition, a humble Christian praying in her own home, or a journalist trying to report the news. Nor can you win one by disregarding your basic electorate on questions like who gets to be a part of our shared society. And of all the pressing challenges that the nations represented here face, I believe there is nothing more urgent than mass migration. Today, almost one in five people living in this country moved here from abroad. That is, of course, an all time high. It's a similar number, by the way, in the United States--also an all time high. The number of immigrants who entered the EU from non-EU countries doubled between 2021 and 2022 alone. And of course, it's gotten much higher since. And we know the situation didn't materialize in a vacuum. It's a result of a series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world over the span of a decade. We saw the horrors wrought by these decisions yesterday in this very city, and of course, I can't bring it up again without thinking about the terrible victims who had a beautiful winter day in Munich ruined. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and will remain with them. But why did this happen in the first place? It's a terrible story, but it's one we've heard way too many times in Europe and unfortunately, too many times in the United States as well. An asylum seeker, often a young man in his mid twenties, already known to police, rams a car into a crowd and shatters a community. How many times must we suffer these appalling setbacks before we change course and take our shared civilization in a new direction? No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the flood gates to millions of unvetted immigrants. But you know what they did vote for? In England, they voted for Brexit, and, agree or disagree, they voted for it. And more and more, all over Europe, they're voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out-of-control migration. Now, I happen to agree with a lot of these concerns, but you don't have to agree with me. I just think that people care about their homes, they care about their dreams, they care about their safety and their capacity to provide for themselves and their children. And they're smart. I think this is one of the most important things I've learned in my brief time in politics. Contrary to what you might hear, a couple mountains over in Davos, the citizens of all of our nations don't generally think of themselves as educated animals or as interchangeable cogs of a global economy. And it's hardly surprising that they don't want to be shuffled about or relentlessly ignored by their leaders. It is the business of democracy to adjudicate these big questions at the ballot box. I believe dismissing people, dismissing their concerns, or worse yet, shutting down media, shutting down elections or shutting people out of the political process, protects nothing. In fact, it is the most surefire way to destroy democracy. Speaking up and expressing opinions isn't election interference, even when people express views outside your own country, and even when those people are very influential. And trust me, I say this with all humor, if American democracy can survive ten years of Greta Thunberg scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk. But what German democracy, what no democracy, American, German or European, will survive, is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered. Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There's no room for firewalls. You either uphold the principle or you don't. Europeans, the people, have a voice. European leaders have a choice. And my strong belief is that we do not need to be afraid of the future. You can embrace what your people tell you, even when it's surprising, even when you don't agree, and if you do so, you can face the future with certainty and with confidence, knowing that the nation stands behind each of you. That, to me, is the great magic of democracy. It's not in these stone buildings or beautiful hotels. It's not even in the great institutions that we have built together as a shared society. To believe in democracy is to understand that each of our citizens has wisdom and has a voice, and if we refuse to listen to that voice, even our most successful fights will secure very little. As Pope John Paul II, in my view, one of the most extraordinary champions of democracy on this continent or any other, once said: ""Do not be afraid."" We shouldn't be afraid of our people, even when they express views that disagree with their leadership. Thank you all. Good luck to all of you. God bless you.",The European Conservative,2025-02-17T09:24:01,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/jd-vance-speech-munich-conference-full-text/
Trump Points the Way to a Future for Israel and the Arabs,"In one short statement, U.S. President Trump has opened the door to a settlement of the Israel/Palestine conflict which, in the long term, has more chance of creating a peaceful future than the fantasies currently perpetrated by some Western leaders of a two-state solution, Talking about Gaza, Trump said, You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing. I don't know, something has to happen, but it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there, so I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location. The possible implications of Trump's statement are far-reaching. Taken to their conclusion, they imply that the whole postwar programme for Palestine statehood should be dismissed and replaced by a peaceful dispersal of Palestinians who do not wish to live in Gaza and the West Bank into other Arab countries. It would mean an end to the 'right of return' which has applied since the UN-backed creation of the state of Israel in 1948. It would mean an end to the permanent refugee status of not only the original Arabs who left or fled from Israel in 1948, an event Arabs refer to as the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe', but also their descendants. The granting of refugee status to the descendants of refugees is an anomaly, as it does not apply to refugees anywhere else in the world. Nor should it. If all the various peoples displaced by the wars and conflicts of the 20th century were granted the right of return, it would lead to endless chaos and conflict globally. This applies in spades to the Palestinians who wish to 'return' to a state that does not even exist. What makes this two-state, right-of-return fantasy even more ludicrous is that Hamas itself has no interest in a Palestinian state, except as a base to launch attacks on Israel. It is committed to an Islamist global caliphate, in which the Jews are just the first victims. Hamas has demonstrated, for all the world with eyes to see, its barbarism and intransigence, its desire to eliminate Israel and all the Jews who live there 'from the river to the sea,' and its determination to repeat the October 7th pogrom in Israel 'again and again.' Yet, Hamas retains the leadership of Palestinians in Gaza, who voted overwhelmingly for the Islamists to rule them in the last election Hamas allowed, in 2006. Look at the pictures of the crowds in Gaza chanting their Jew-hatred in 'celebration' of the recent ceasefire. Many Arabs living in the West Bank also supported the Hamas massacres on October 7th, as did the supposedly 'moderate' Palestinian Authority that formally governs there. How could Israelis think of allowing a state that openly threatens their very existence to exist on their borders? In all the various peace talks since 1948, the Palestinians have rejected any forms of statehood offered to them. Since 1948, the closest thing Palestinians have ever had to a state has been Gaza, after the Israeli military and civilians pulled out in 2005, but it could only function with the aid and support of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA), itself heavily infiltrated by Hamas supporters. During that time, under the leadership of the elected Hamas government, instead of focusing on the well-being and economic development of the people of Gaza, the Hamas government used the billions of dollars it was granted by the West to build a vast underground infrastructure to support an offensive against Israel. Through its war on Israel, using Palestinian civilians as human shields and celebrating their deaths as martyrdoms, Hamas has wrought death and destruction on Gaza, delivered a true 'catastrophe' for its own people, and left them with only the 'demolition site' Trump referred to. There will be Gazans who want to escape the destruction and the likelihood of further conflict. Whether Trump can find the means and the resolve to get Egypt to open its closed borders to Gazans, or get Jordan and other Arab countries to grant citizenship to them, something they have always refused to do, remains to be seen. My instinct is that the Arab countries will not happily respond to Trump's suggestions. They have been loath to accept Palestinians from Gaza until now, revealing the hypocrisy of their supposed 'concern' for Gazans. But at least Trump's comments mean some realism is entering the discussions about the future, rather than the magical thinking of the two-state solution. And maybe he can make them an offer they cannot refuse.

Trump’s Ukraine Power Play Exposes EU Impotence,"Nobody knows exactly how President Donald Trump's bid to end the war in Ukraine will work out, or whether he can fulfil his worthy ambition to save ""millions of lives."" But here in Europe, one thing should be immediately clear. Trump's direct overture to Russian President Vladimir Putin has exposed the irrelevance and impotence of the European Union, not only in wider global power politics, but in ending a bloody war on its own doorstep. Trump's call to Putin proposing that the two should work ""very closely"" together to achieve peace looks like an attempt to reassert America's hegemony over international affairs. That will be tricky to achieve in an increasingly multi-polar world; as if to illustrate the point, when news broke of Trump's overture to Putin, China was quick to throw its own hat in the ring as a potential peace-broker. What Trump has already achieved, however, is to destroy the pretensions of the EU to be a major player. All of the big talk of Europe standing rock solid in support of Ukraine, and making no concessions to Putin's Russia, has been revealed as empty political posturing. As this truth dawned, there was an obvious sense of panic in Brussels, where a meeting of NATO defence ministers is being held this week. The Weimar Group, a defence association that includes the European Commission and leading EU members Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Poland, alongside the UK, issued a hurried statement. It declared that ""Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations."" They are obviously right about Ukraine. Asked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be directly involved in his peace talks, President Trump only replied: ""Interesting question. I think they have to make peace."" But any attempt by the big powers to impose a deal over the heads of the Ukrainians is unlikely to bring a lasting peace. Unless both Ukraine and Russia can seriously sign up to a real agreement, any paper deal seems more likely to be a prelude to another round of conflict. The Weimar Group leaders are on shakier ground, however, when they claim that ""Europe must be part of any negotiations."" Alongside former U.S. President Joe Biden, the EU has spent the three years since Russia invaded grandstanding about its promised support for Ukrainian sovereignty, yet without ever really putting military muscle where its mouth is. Instead, former British Army Colonel Richard Kemp writes in the Daily Telegraph, ""a self-deterring West, led by the vacillating former President Joe Biden, failed to provide Kyiv with sufficient arms or the freedom to use them to greatest effect""--notably around its faltering 2023 counter-offensive. The EU leaders' tough talk now stands exposed as vacuous political virtue-signalling, largely for domestic consumption. Little wonder it looks to some as if they were pledged to fight to the last Ukrainian. Behind the braggadocio, there was never any prospect of NATO getting involved and escalating the conflict. The future prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, which is a red line for Russia, has long been held out by Europe as the ultimate safeguard. Now Trump simply says it is not ""practical."" EU foreign ministers are trying to insist that Ukraine's NATO membership is ""still on the table."" The pressing question for them, however, is whether they will be sitting at the negotiating table at all. A bloody war like this cannot be managed by high-minded press releases and photo opportunities in Brussels. The EU's posturing has only served to raise the stakes and make matters even worse on the ground in Ukraine. On the other hand, ordinary Ukrainians' brave resistance against the Russian invasion of their homeland has highlighted once again the need for people to defend their own national sovereignty. That is a lesson we should all take to heart. From Israel to Ukraine, we live in a world of conflict where, as President Trump has demonstrated in his first weeks in office, the old, failed rules and nostrums need no longer apply. To be prepared for the unexpected, the nations of Europe surely need to get their own defences in order now. But that cannot mean putting trust in the Brussels elites and their talk of a centralised EU Army, or a bureaucratic defence union that drags in the UK. Do we really want the empty vessels of EU politics, who made so much noise about standing with Ukraine until the end, to determine the defence of Europe's borders? Would you trust an unelected Brussels bureaucrat such as ""Queen"" Ursula von der Leyen to decide Europe's policies on war and peace, as she has effectively tried to do over Ukraine? We cannot entrust our future to great powers or grandstanding globalists. Instead, let the sovereign states of Europe forge their own foreign and defence policies. And let us take inspiration from those such as the Israeli people who have shown that, if you want your nation to live in peace, you must sometimes be ready to stand up for it, no matter what the rest of the world might say.",The European Conservative,2025-02-13T18:23:32,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/trumps-ukraine-power-play-exposes-eu-impotence/
Why the Workers Have Abandoned the Establishment,"Just over a week after Germany's general election, the shock of the populists' strong showing remains raw. Under pressure from his own party, Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor, has promised a thorough review of the results. ""We have won the election, we won them with a clear margin, but our expectations weren't met,"" he admitted after his party won 28.5% of the vote--its second-worst result ever. One glaring problem is that workers have abandoned the CDU. ""When the previous government loses twenty percentage points and the CDU/CSU only gains four, we must question why people with low incomes, who work hard yet struggle, are hardly found in our electorate,"" conceded Dennis Radtke , chair of the CDU's Employees' Association (CDA). The AfD's emergence as Germany's new ""workers' party""--capturing 38% support among laborers--has rattled the establishment for good reasons. Together with the populists' remarkable performance among younger voters , this represents a seismic shift. For the SPD, which historically emerged as a workers' party, it is merely the final chapter in a long story of decline. With a dismal 16.4% of votes, it is even unclear whether the party will survive or follow in the footsteps of other social democratic parties that, as in France, have been reduced to insignificance. The consequences for the CDU are equally severe, particularly in southwest Germany--the engine of the German economy. In Baden-Wurttemberg, home to German industrial giants like Mercedes and Bosch, the AfD has surged to become the second strongest party. In some regions of this former CDU stronghold, the AfD now dominates, winning significantly more votes than the CDU. In Rastatt, for instance , the AfD captured 39.7% of votes, and in Pforzheim, 29.3%. The magnitude of the CDU's decline becomes evident when recalling that this is the region where the CDU used to win absolute majorities, and still gained well above 45% in the 2000s . Back in 1976, when it still received nearly 57% of the votes, party leaders didn't need to analyze voter sentiment--they understood it intuitively and shaped policies accordingly. Merz's promise to analyse the result only highlights the party's disconnection from voters. Voter desires aren't mysterious. It's clear that German voters--particularly the 10 million (a quarter of the electorate) who supported the AfD--want change. It's also the case that the era when established parties could simply swap power between themselves is irrevocably over. Only by clinging together can these two fading parties maintain their grip on power. By pursuing a coalition with the floundering SPD, Merz however demonstrates how trapped he is in the past. It now appears almost ironic that when he first sought the CDU leadership in 2018, he vowed to cut the AfD's support in half. After Angela Merkel's leaden years, Merz was perceived as a rebel and reformer. Having left politics in the late 2000s over differences with Merkel to pursue a private sector career, he was actually supposed to represent a break from past mistakes. That the AfD's support has doubled rather than halved however demonstrates the spectacular failure of this strategy. In reality, Merz remains firmly anchored in the establishment. During the election campaign, he promised to close borders upon becoming chancellor, knowing full well that most voters wanted an end to uncontrolled mass migration. He also talked about necessary economic reforms, addressing many voters' concerns about Germany's decline--an understandable concern in Baden-Wurttemberg: Following VW's radical cuts, Mercedes announced 16,000 job losses , with Bosch shedding thousands more. And despite demographic aging, official unemployment already exceeds 3 million. Yet, regrettably, a Merz government is unlikely to implement the changes many yearn for. While claiming to want to reduce bureaucracy, Merz paradoxically embraces the EU with its expansive regulatory framework, including its demanding sustainability reporting requirements. His promise of effective border controls already faces credibility challenges, particularly given their inevitable conflict with EU regulations. ""The CDU will continue to pursue green politics"" was the aptly titled recent piece in the FAZ newspaper. Indeed, the party appears committed to maintaining Germany's contentious climate policy, steadfastly pursuing net-zero emissions by 2045. It will further advance the multi-billion euro transition to wind and solar energy sources. A meaningful reassessment of Germany's nuclear exit, however, remains improbable--despite Germany already shouldering the EU's highest electricity prices, which constitute a significant competitive disadvantage for the nation. Working-class scepticism of Merz was well-founded. With net-zero policies, the average German household will pay at least EUR1,000 for heating by 2027, FAZ has calculated. Is it any surprise workers are abandoning the party? Populism advances across Germany--not just in eastern states but in its ""deep,"" western industrial heartland too--because the establishment lacks the courage to implement necessary reforms in economic and migration policies. Merz has highlighted the 1.7 million votes he gained from the SPD and pointed to polls suggesting most Germans prefer a CDU-SPD coalition to other government configurations (and certainly over a CDU coalition with the AfD). But this represents only half the story. The other half comprises the 10 million citizens who voted for the AfD, arguably representing the future trajectory of German politics, as they exert the essential pressure for change while mainstream politics remains ensnared in conventional groupthink. Yet on critical issues--migration, energy costs, and nuclear power--majority public opinion aligns closely with the AfD's positions. Most Germans want controlled borders . A majority also thinks Germany's nuclear phase-out was a mistake . And most voters also want a reform of the Citizen's Income ("" Burgergeld "") introduced by the old SPD government--the increasingly unsustainable cash payments for people who do not work, seen by many as a disincentive to looking for work. By demonizing the AfD and maintaining the cordon sanitaire --effectively attempting to permanently exclude populist voters--mainstream parties have not weakened the populists, but rather themselves. But they won't be able to do politics against a majority forever. It is the establishment's profound fear of change that has granted the AfD its greatest momentum. If, as Marx famously observed, revolutions are the locomotives of history, then populism has become today's driving force of disruption. It demands precisely the transformation that the establishment so deeply dreads--yet which society increasingly requires.",The European Conservative,2025-03-03T22:14:27,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/why-the-workers-have-abandoned-the-establishment/
Christian Heritage: Worthy of Celebration,"It is ""Christian Heritage Month"" in Toronto, and some progressives in Canada's largest city aren't happy about it. The designation is part of a new campaign to have December recognized nationally as Christian Heritage Month, and the organizers--Jay and Molly Banerjei of the Christian Music Festival--are carefully curating their pitch by emphasizing that their multi-denominational organization is united by the ""values of inclusivity, unity, and faith."" The province of Saskatchewan has signed on; forty other cities, towns, and villages have done so thus far, as well, including Ajax, Mississauga, Ottawa, Niagara Falls, Red Deer, Whistler, and Prince George. It is revealing that some progressives see this anodyne project as such a threat. ""How do you take over an empire?"" Carl Trueman wrote several years ago , ""That is a question that I used as a title for a lecture I have each year in my Ancient Christianity class. The answer is simple to state but somewhat more difficult to achieve in practice: You simply need to control time and space."" Trueman observes that the LGBT movement understands this well, which is why they push constantly to colonize the calendar and insist that ""Pride proclamations"" be issued by small towns and villages and the rainbow flag be hoisted everywhere. In Canada, in addition to the now four-month long Pride Season , there are another 20 dates or weeks dedicated to LGBT causes. But adding Christian Heritage Month to the calendar, it turns out, is a bridge too far (unlike, say, ""Celebrate Bisexuality Day,"" which occupies September 23). During the debate at the Toronto City Council, Councillor Gord Perks unleashed a foam-flecked tirade , insisting that other religious ""heritage"" days and months were merely an ""effort to rebalance"" Canada. Perks noted that the Constitution begins with the phrase ""Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law."" He went on to state that, in our country, ""Every day, every minute, every second, every law, everything we do is Christian time. It is the law of this land."" Perks' objection to Christian Heritage Month, it turns out, is that it might more accurately be called ""Canadian Heritage Month."" Perks ranted about abortion, the Christian Heritage Party (""that party is anti-abortion, anti-same-sex marriage""), residential schools, and the very validity of Canada's founding. ""Language matters,"" he asserted. ""The phrase 'Christian heritage' is not a neutral phrase in the Canadian political landscape."" Councillor Lily Cheng rose to respond, saying, ""This is actually a very difficult debate to me because I feel like we're putting a whole faith on trial here ... Christianity saved my life."" Sharing some of her own struggles, she added tearfully, ""Kind, gracious people loved me and showed me that I was worthy to be loved, and they walked with me so patiently, and who I am today would not be without this faith that has carried me."" The debate at the Toronto City Council is a microcosm of a debate unfolding across Canada between those who despise Canada's heritage, and those who see it as essential and worth celebrating. Perks, for his part, recognizes that Canada was founded as a Christian nation--but he sees those values as our original sin. To people like Perks, Canada's embrace of LGBT ideology, the destruction of children in the womb, and assisted suicide are what we should be celebrating. According to Canada's annual ""MAID"" report , 15,343 people died by euthanasia in 2023. Your view on whether that is a tragedy probably tracks pretty closely with your view on ""Christian Heritage Month."" I am all for studying history. What I am tired of, however, is progressives weaponizing history by cherry-picking a handful of examples for the purpose of deliberately discrediting Christianity and Western civilization itself. The sins of Christian civilization are much discussed; the sins of pre-Christian cultures and post-Christian society, not so much. Politicians like Perks are as disinterested in discussing the slave-trading practices and other barbarisms of Canada's indigenous peoples as they are in discussing the magnificent Christian campaign, which lasted from 1787 to 1833, to wipe out first the slave trade and then slavery itself from the British Empire, of which Canada was then still a part. It is not rare that cultures accepted the sin of slavery, as a study of Canada's First Nations reveals. It is extraordinary that an empire at the height of its power would reject this ancient wickedness on purely Christian, moral grounds. That, surely, is worth celebrating during Christian Heritage Month. It is an easy thing to damn a civilization by highlighting the wrongs of those who enacted policies or committed deeds that were at odds with Christian principles. For every politician to condemn, there is one to celebrate. Take John Graves Simcoe, who as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada in 1793 championed the ""Act Against Slavery,"" telling the Legislative Assembly that: ""The principles of the British Constitution do not admit of that slavery which Christianity condemns. The moment I assume the Government of Upper Canada under no modification will I assent to a law that discriminates by dishonest policy between natives of Africa, America, or Europe."" That, I suspect, is a better day's work than Perks has ever done--and the Act, it should be noted, came 14 years before British Parliament outlawed the slave trade, and fully forty years before they banned slavery entirely. If Simcoe isn't an acceptable candidate (perhaps he is too white?), then maybe Perks would instead assent to celebrating the Reverend Josiah Henson during Christian Heritage Month. Henson was the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin ; he escaped slavery for Upper Canada in 1830, settling in what is now Dresden, Ontario. The magnificent little museum there is well worth visiting and provides ample testimony of the great abolitionist and pastor who often thanked God for Canada, that haven from slavery. I've often thought he should be put on a banknote. Canada's Christian heritage is not the sad, sordid saga that Perks has attempted to convey, and only ignorance and bigotry (I suspect both) could produce such bile. The only reason we know so much about the sins of the men and women who inhabited Canada, and so little about their virtues, is because many progressives hate Christianity. John Graves Simcoe, incidentally, is the founder of Toronto, establishing what was then known as York in 1793. He should be remembered this month, in the city he founded. And we should remember his words: ""Let the groundwork of your whole conduct be a just respect for and love of God; know that with such respect, every man must necessarily be brave."" In the Year of Our Lord 2025, Christian Heritage Month should be celebrated across Canada.",The European Conservative,2024-12-18T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/christian-heritage-worthy-of-celebration/
The Ukraine War Requires a Negotiated Settlement,"There is no doubt that the goal of war is to win. War aims may differ considerably depending on the context, but at the end of the day victory is the ultimate aim. This is why the struggle during conflict is long and arduous, because the aims can lead to great rewards. Yet there comes a time when one side, usually the losing side, must begin to consider realistically its future ability to carry on. Indeed sometimes this applies to both sides, as the cost of continued fighting outweighs the geopolitical benefits. Initially, there may only be private utterances among senior officials, or classified communiques between diplomats, yet they begin to form the basis of a 'get out' strategy as prospects decline. In the medieval period, deals were very common after rebel barons failed to defeat the king in battle. The monarch may take the head of the leading conspirator and attainder his lands, but most of the co-rebels would be free to return to their estates if they reaffirmed their commitment to the king. In the 19th century, British gunboats would bombard relentlessly, yet they didn't necessarily do this to conquer; instead, they sought to force China or other states to open their ports to trade or acknowledge their status as vassals of the empire. Britain never sought to conquer China during the Opium Wars, because there were other ways of acquiring victory and achieving a lasting peace. This methodology still applies in the present day. Currently, Ukraine is approaching three years of full-scale war with the world's largest nation, Russia. Over the last year, they have been pushed back in the southeast, after failing to make a decisive breakthrough in their 2023 summer counter-offensive. Zelensky's decision to invade the Kursk region, when his troops were badly needed elsewhere, has probably ended any chances of recovering the Donbass and the land bridge to Crimea. Many supporters of Ukraine praised this act of risk; yet it has turned into a quagmire, and now North Korean troops are reportedly fighting there as well. Personally, I cannot understand why such a decision was taken, as countless western forays into Russian territory have throughout history been decisively defeated. Moscow knows its territory is big enough to absorb such offensives without it affecting their economy or major cities, unlike most other nations. With the election of Donald Trump to his second term as president of the United States, there is a higher chance of the conflict being brought to a more realistic conclusion. This is certainly not popular on social media or in politics, where Ukrainian supporters want the Russians thrown out and Putin overthrown. On the other hand, Russophiles either want all the Russian-speaking and Russian-populated areas annexed, or the downright ridiculous idea of marching all the way to the Polish border. The reality is that neither side has the strength to accomplish what their supporters really want, as they both continue to fight a 21st-century version of the Western Front in 1914-18. Putin committed too few troops in his initial invasion in 2022 and ended up having to retreat from the north of the country. Yet despite Western aid--the most critical factor keeping Zelensky's troops in the war--Ukraine cannot match Russia's larger population reserves and military-industrial complex. If things continue the way they are going, we are looking at years of war in which the Russians slowly crawl westwards towards Kiev and the Dnieper river. Considering how slow their progress has been thus far, it would take them a decade to conquer the whole country. With this in mind, would it not be better for Ukraine to sign an agreement that ends the conflict before they lose even more territory? Would a repeat of the Minsk 2 accords--essentially freezing the conflict and implementing a ceasefire--be a worthy option? Donald Trump, who has claimed he would end the conflict in one day (a boast which is not particularly realistic), has several options he could pursue. The one outlined above is the most likely, because it does not require military force from Washington, and it has already been attempted with partial success. Putin would be able to save face by appeasing his supporters with some new territory, yet Ukraine would be able to (correctly) claim they had managed to thwart him from taking most of the country. Considering the hundreds of thousands of deaths that have occurred--and the atrocities that always accompany such conflicts--it would give both sides breathing space and some return to normality. The citizens of both countries have endured the threat of conscription for quite a while, and although their governments can only draft a certain amount each year so as to ensure their economies keep functioning, they are both beginning to feel the strain. This is why Putin signed a military pact in Pyongyang which gave weapons to North Korea in return for their soldiers, and why Zelensky was granted clearance by President Biden to use long range missiles for the first time. Although both of these developments have been perceived as an escalation (which they are to some degree), they bear the hallmarks of desperation as well. The battle of Bakhmut may have grabbed the headlines and shown the public the true nature of 21st century warfare, but it distracted from the reality that this war has been one giant slog. Every Ukrainian or Russian victory has taken months of trench warfare and unprecedented artillery fire, which have levelled towns like Mariupol and Chasov Yar. Entire regions of farmland have been reduced to muddy squalor and will take years to recover. The war could feasibly continue for a decade or more, but Ukraine's demographics would suffer greatly as its dwindling population of 18-45 year olds is used up. There is currently a huge deficit of teenagers and children in the country, as so many fled with their parents during the initial campaigns, and thus many Ukrainians are growing up in other countries . Zelensky's administration could sign deals with other nations to bring them back to serve as they mature, but it's difficult to see how this could be policed over the long term. Meanwhile, Russia has the benefit of a larger population to dip into, as well as central Asian migrants to fill labour shortages whilst soldiers are away. Yet, politically speaking, Putin cannot keep this going on indefinitely, as his people will need to witness results, especially as the casualties continue to mount. Donald Trump could be a saviour to both of the leaders, allowing both sides to save face whilst ending a war which is eating away at the world's geopolitical stability. He may just be the right president at the right time, though he will face stiff opposition from Europe. Many nations on the continent, but most specifically Britain and Germany, have spent untold billions keeping Ukraine in the war, and they will not favour a deal that removes the prospect of total victory. For three years, they have viewed the idea of compromise as traitorous, and they have sharply criticised opposition parties for suggesting any form of negotiations. Indeed, even Hungarian President Viktor Orban's common sense diplomatic 'peace mission' earlier this year was greeted with bizarre levels of hostility from London and Brussels. It will be hard for European governments to change tack and promote a different narrative. Yet Europe's security relies on NATO and thus the United States, and therefore they will have no choice but to acquiesce to whatever Trump's White House eventually decides. There is no doubt that the tectonic plates--culturally speaking--have shifted quite significantly over the last few months in regards to woke culture and immigration. Yet in regards to foreign policy, it's this war more than anything that needs a pragmatic, long-term solution. This will only come with a shift to the political Right as well, and hopefully we are about to experience that transition. There's an alternative path that is still possible despite the longevity of this conflict, it will just take willpower to embrace it. The perceived wisdom is to support Ukraine, and I can sympathise with people wanting to help a country that has been invaded. Yet this war, like many others, is vastly more complicated than many realise, and it has the potential to escalate into something very dangerous. Wanting an end to the war does not, as some argue, mean favouring Russia. It simply means understanding the complexity of the conflict, understanding the situation on the ground, and wanting to spare Europe years of further instability. Acknowledging the fact that neither side can win an outright victory is a viewpoint that is steadily gaining traction in diplomatic circles. As realism seeps into the geopolitical narrative, hopefully President Trump can lead the way during his second term and bring the war to a sensible conclusion.",The European Conservative,2024-12-06T20:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-ukraine-war-requires-a-negotiated-settlement/
Mozambique—The Roots of Violence,"Though the alleged widespread voter-fraud of Nicolas Maduro's Venezuela is widely-discussed (as is the people's revolt against it), it is hardly the only nation to have dealt with this problem. Such things are also well-documented in Africa. The recent case of Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony on the east coast of Africa, is worth considering. It has a political and social history similar to that of many countries on the continent--a history of hope, disillusion, oppression, repression, corruption, and incompetence. In 1960, Harold MacMillan, the British Conservative prime minister, gave a famous speech in Cape Town called the ""winds of change speech."" In that speech, he made clear that London was going to renounce the Empire and join the Commonwealth. This speech was the signal that Europeans would soon be saying goodbye to their possessions in Africa. The France of the Fifth Republic and General De Gaulle would do the same in French Colonial Africa, the Dutch had already done so, and the Spanish had only a relic of Moroccan possessions. But the Portuguese prime minister, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, resisted the wave of decolonization. Portugal had been the pioneer of overseas navigations and conquests and, unlike the English and Dutch who had essentially dedicated themselves to the economic exploitation of the territories, the Portuguese, in addition to trade, had ""exported the State."" In other words, they had been concerned from a very early stage with the political-administrative grid and had carried out the occupation and settlement of Brazil, even promoting 'mixed' marriages in Goa. Salazar was convinced that without the colonies Portugal would be a very weak state in Europe, with its independence at risk. That's why he defended them, forcing the independence movements into war. The war began in Angola in 1961, spread to Guinea-Bissau in 1963 and Mozambique in 1964. In Mozambique, the independence movement was called FRELIMO, created in 1962 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, under the patronage of Julius Nyerere. FRELIMO did not win militarily but, like the other movements in the Portuguese colonies, it received power from Lisbon when, on April 25, 1974, a group of officers carried out a coup d'etat to end the war. In FRELIMO, the relatively moderate Eduardo Mondlane had been assassinated in February 1969 and replaced by the radical populist Samora Machel. During the war, FRELIMO was mainly supported by Mao Zedong's China and heavily influenced by Beijing's Marxist-Leninist model. Thus, starting after independence on June 25, 1975, it followed a line of radical communism. This was characterized by fierce repressions for dissent, persecution of Christian and Muslim religious communities, and even concentration camps to detain all suspects and outcasts according to Marxist-Leninist logic. Uria Simango, vice president of FRELIMO; his wife; and other non-FRELIMO independents died in these camps. The 250,000 Portuguese settlers in Mozambique were expelled and the companies nationalized, as made sense in a regime that prided itself on Marxism-Leninism. From here came the rebellion of RENAMO--Mozambique's National Resistance. The rebellion was initially supported by the Rhodesians and South Africans. It spread throughout the country and forced the FRELIMO government to negotiate peace with RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama in the Rome Accords of October 4, 1992. From then on, a democracy was theoretically established in the country, but FRELIMO always managed to win the elections, following the methods of Venezuelan chavismo. Dhlakama died and was replaced by Usufo Momade at the head of the party, but FRELIMO kept winning elections. At the same time, economic and social life deteriorated, and today Mozambique is among the 10 poorest countries in Africa. This is despite the fact that, at the beginning of the 21st century, important natural gas reserves were discovered along the northern coast of Cabo Delgado in the far north of the country. However, since 2017, this region has been the target of attacks by jihadist groups that have made it impossible for major oil companies such as France's Total and the U.S.'s Exxon-Mobil to operate. It was against this backdrop that the presidential and parliamentary elections took place on October 9 of this year. President Filipe Nyusi, having served two terms, was constitutionally unable to stand for re-election, and so FRELIMO presented Daniel Chapo, an almost unknown lawyer who has been governor of Inhambane province since 2019, as its presidential candidate. Everything was running in parallel to the election in Venezuela: a left-wing government, installed and immovable since independence, despite the discontent and degradation of the country, but which manipulates the election results. The candidates in the October 9 elections were Daniel Francisco Chapo, for FRELIMO; Lutero Simango son of Uria Simango for the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM); Ossufo Momade for RENAMO; and Venancio Mondlane supported by the Democratic Alliance Coalition (CAD). In an election in which abstention (56.5%) was the biggest factor, Chapo was declared the winner with 70% of the vote, Mondlane second with 20%, Momade third with 6% and Simango last with 3%. But Mondlane (who is grand-nephew of Eduardo Mondlane) didn't accept this and went into open and public opposition to the results and to FRELIMO. Things got worse when two of the candidate's close collaborators, Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe, were murdered in Maputo, in an attack that was to have Venancio Mondlane himself as its target. Then, fearing for his life, Venancio clandestinely left the country. He was in South Africa, then possibly in Malawi (whose president is an evangelical theologian of the same faith and church as Mondlane). His location is currently hidden for security reasons. Venancio Mondlane is a true political phenomenon, a man who, practically alone, has been confronting a regime that has ruled his country for half a century. He was born in 1974 in Lichinga (Vila Cabral, in colonial times). He is a forestry engineer by training; in 2019 he was the MDM's candidate in the elections for the city council of Maputo, the country's capital, where he got 42% of the vote, and then joined RENAMO. In 2023 he ran again for Maputo City Council, lost, didn't accept the results and kept up street protests by his supporters indefinitely. In the meantime, he left RENAMO. This time he is following the same process, only from a distance, on social media. The leader of the popular resistance, a tribune of the first rank, he never stops inciting his compatriots to bring the country to a standstill, being followed and obeyed by a significant part of the population, especially young people and teenagers. In this way, the movement of popular opinion is growing, in the face of a power that appears to have no strategy, oscillating between repression, absence, and tolerance; not least because it seems to be unsure of the loyalty of the military and police forces. Here and there, they have fired on the demonstrators and, so far, there have been more than 250 deaths. The demonstrators are not being gentle either, and in some towns, they have stormed and burned FRELIMO party headquarters and police stations. On the other hand, they have occupied the streets and blocked the entrances, interrupting traffic with South Africa. The resulting paralysis of economic activity has led the Confederation of Economic Associations of Mozambique to ask the president of the Republic not only to provide military escorts for civilian trucks, but also to urgently negotiate a truce with Venancio Mondlane until an agreement is reached on the elections. Officially, between October 21 and December 11, 110 people were killed as a result of the demonstrations. The number included some police officers. However, violence broke out again on December 23rd when the Constitutional Council announced the results of the presidential election, confirming the victory of Daniel Chapo, even if with a slight correction on his share of the vote--from 70.67% to 65.17%, with the difference attributed to Venancio Mondlane, raising his share from 20.32% to 24.19%. These updates did not appease the people's anger; instead, the amended results seem to have doubled it. Violence has continued, not only in Maputo but also throughout the center and the north, in Beira and Nampula. Casualties have increased, totaling 261 deaths as of December 27. So, in past few days, there have been more victims than in the prior two months. To add to the already chaotic situation, there were massive breakouts from three or four prisons, including the high security prison near Maputo, from which 1,500 criminals escaped. According to reliable sources, their escape was facilitated and provoked by the guards. Some of the recaptured were killed. Mondlane's appeal was successful because the majority of Mozambicans are desperate. Like any formerly colonized people, at independence they were subjected to intense propaganda, which promised that with political independence would come a better life. Instead, they have experienced extreme sufferings: first with the civil war, then with a profoundly corrupt government. There is also widespread drug trafficking and regular kidnappings of businessmen and members of their families, a threat that even hangs over senior security and police officials. Speaking to Agencia Ecclesia , a Catholic news media, Father Tony Neves, of the congregation of the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit, used the term ""institutionalization of anarchy,"" saying that ""the people are desperate, the country has not been developed, the lords of the system have become unbearably rich (...) Now the people have no more fear and take to the streets to protest against what they consider to have been a fraudulent election."" Also, the Ordem dos Advogados, the bar association of Mozambique, condemned in severe terms the way the authorities dealt with the escapees of Machava Central Prison, as some of those recaptured were slaughtered. They said that the authorities were ""criminal"" and ""disgusting,"" a symbol a ""sick society"" where leaders have completely lost their authority. This powerful language illustrates that not only the people in the street but also the middle and upper middle classes are ready to speak out against corruption. Many personalities linked to political life and to FRELIMO have criticized the lack of strategy on the part of the ruling party. It is also known that important figures in the ruling party have criticized the party and Nyusi discreetly and have noted the party's isolation from the country, especially the youth. Some have left the country, expecting the worst. And significantly, President Joao Lourenco of Angola, at the opening of the 8th Extraordinary Congress of the MPLA in Luanda, called on the Mozambican government and opposition to find a peaceful solution.",The European Conservative,2024-12-30T20:25:36,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/mozambique-the-roots-of-violence/
Scotland: No Country for Young Men,"Scotland recently took a giant step towards becoming one of the most restrictive countries in Europe. The adjective 'Orwellian' trips too easily off of the lips these days, but with severe and significant restrictions to free speech being introduced in the contents of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 , which came into force on 1 April 2024, it is hard to imagine a more apt description. According to the Scottish government's own website , the Act ""creates new stirring up of hatred offences for protected characteristics including age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, and transgender identity."" At face value, this seems reasonable. It is not nice to express hateful feelings towards people on the basis of their characteristics, immutable or adopted, and it cannot be pleasant to be at the receiving end of hateful abuse. But to elevate verbal abuse and hurt feelings to the status of a crime is to pave the way towards a police state or, as is the case of Scotland, to take another step towards a police state. Scotland already has a unitary police force, Police Scotland , formed in 2013. The formation of Police Scotland abolished the regional police authorities in Scotland and put policing across the whole country under the control of the Scottish Police Authority , a body of the government. Police Scotland has enthusiastically taken to its role in policing hate crime. They have developed a training package which contains the apparently contradictory statement that the package includes ""examples of a range of scenarios where offences might take place, but this does not mean officers have been told to target these situations or locations."" If so, then why include those ""situations or locations""? The precise nature of the ""situations or locations"" is not in the public domain. However, leaked documents suggest that police training goes beyond the already wide-ranging bounds of the Act to include public performances such as plays and comedy acts where the content could be deemed offensive. The Act already covers not only the generation of speech, writing, or performance considered hateful, but also the sharing of it by any means, including social media and private emails. In fact, as explained recently in The Spectator , the Act ""covers anything said anywhere--even in your own home. Children will in theory be able to report their parents. Scots can inform on each other anonymously, through an expanded network of 'third-party reporting centres'."" Mao's Cultural Revolution meets 1984 . Police Scotland have signalled how seriously they will be taking hate crimes , saying ""Police Scotland treats all hate crimes seriously. We want you to report it."" But so vague is the notion of hate crime that they urge the public, ""If something happens and you are not sure if it is a crime, please remember, if it feels wrong, report it and let us help."" Their proclamation that they will investigate every complaint must be reassuring to the perpetually offended, but is probably less so to the victims of vandalism or theft, crimes which, under their investigation policy , will no longer be investigated where there are "" no witnesses or evidence ."" It is estimated that there is a burglary every two hours in Scotland. The policy is intended to free up police time so that they may tackle more serious crimes , but this seems unlikely if they are going to be constantly engaged in following up on reports of 'hate crimes,' many of which will be subjective and without witnesses. Police Scotland have made it clear whom they will be targeting in their campaign, which seems itself akin to a campaign of hate. According to the 'Hate Monster'--a cartoon character which drew so much ridicule from the people of Scotland that it was downplayed within days of first appearing but which is being used to promote their hate crime action --they will be targeting young, white, working-class males. In their own words: ""We know that young men aged 18-30 are most likely to commit hate crime, particularly those from socially excluded communities who are heavily influenced by their peers. They may have deep-rooted feelings of being socially and economically disadvantaged, combined with ideas about white-male entitlement."" Thus, Police Scotland, presumably at the behest of the Scottish government, have shown their hand early. They have already decided who is guilty of a hate crime that, at the time the campaign launched, did not exist. Developments in Scotland should be viewed against the backdrop of the economic and social disaster that has become a hallmark. Scotland depends on financial aid from England, particularly the southeast of England, for its survival. The block grant delivered to Scotland under the Barnett formula currently amounts to PS41 billion a year for 2022-2025, outweighing most other sources of income to the Scottish government such as oil, whisky, tourism , and income tax . Simultaneously, Scotland has a burgeoning drug problem and its drug-related deaths are the highest in Europe . Tragically, while drug deaths amongst men are higher than amongst women, the drug death rate among women is growing , indicating an increasing use of illegal drugs by women. Concomitant with this increasing use of drugs amongst women is the birth of more drug-dependent babies , with over 1,300 born since 2017. Meanwhile, the Scottish government pursues policies which it can ill afford, such as welcoming refugees and asylum seekers (at least the ones who can stand the climate), and adopts policies which defy logic, such as insisting that tampons are available under their Period Products Act --at public expense--in all male (as well as female) toilets in government buildings. In another move that was quickly reversed, the ruling SNP party appointed a man to the position of "" period dignity officer ."" Scotland has been at the forefront of gender recognition rights and aimed to be the first part of the United Kingdom to permit self-identification followed by rapid legal recognition of that status under its proposed Gender Recognition (Scotland) Bill . Unfortunately for the Scottish government and the SNP, they discovered that they were still part of the United Kingdom when, under section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998, the Secretary of State for Scotland prevented the Act from receiving Royal Assent. Those on the political Left, where the SNP firmly sit, are not renowned for their sense of humour , and they clearly lack a sense of irony. But it is hard not to contrast the emphasis within the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act 2021 that blasphemy laws are no longer on the statute book in Scotland while, in the meantime, they create a new law which establishes what amounts to a new set of blasphemies . While religion is included as a protected characteristic, it is strongly suspected that this will favour Islam--the religion of Scotland's current First Minister Humza Yousaf --while ignoring hate against Christians. The Scottish Catholic Bishops, not prone to hysteria or exaggeration, already fear that, under the 2021 Act, owning a bible or Christian catechism could become illegal , since these texts contain forthright views on the practice of homosexuality. I am certain that Muslims will have little to fear for having the Quran in their homes, containing as it does all manner of advice on how to treat both women and those of other faiths. However, against the bleak landscape that is Scottish politics, all may not be lost in Walter Scott's land of 'brown heath and shaggy wood.' Jim Telfer , a legend of Scottish rugby with 22 caps for Scotland, is clearly not in accord with recent developments. He has called for that dreariest of dirges, the 'national anthem' of Scotland, Flower of Scotland , to be banned due to its anti-English content . This would be a great service to sport and politics--and to music.",The European Conservative,2024-12-09T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/scotland-no-country-for-young-men/
The Virtue That Enables All Others: A Conversation with Ayaan Hirsi Ali,"For the past several decades, Ayaan Hirsi Ali has been everywhere. She has been a New Atheist, a Dutch parliamentarian, and a public intellectual living under Islamist death threats; now, to the shock of many, she has converted to Christianity and launched her own media platform to advocate for the restoration of the West called Couarge.Media . In retrospect, there were indications that Hirsi Ali was considering Christianity. In 2021, I interviewed both Hirsi Ali and her husband historian Niall Ferguson within a few weeks of each other. Both had just released books; I was reviewing Ferguson's Doom: The Politics of Catastrophe for The American Conservative and Hirsi Ali's Prey: Immigration, Islam, and the Erosion of Women's Rights for this publication . Later, going over my transcripts, I noted with interest that both Ferguson and Hirsi Ali had brought up--and defended--Christianity during the interviews unprompted. Ferguson had noted that despite his atheism he believes Christianity is essential to the West and stated that people should go to church. Hirsi Ali mentioned that she admired many Christians and that the death of Christianity has left a catastrophic civilizational void. I thought it strange, got on with writing my reviews, and didn't think much of it until Ayaan Hirsi Ali's now-famous 2023 essay "" Why I am now a Christian "" was published in 2023. Hirsi Ali has expanded on her essay since then, sitting down with a disappointed but affectionate Richard Dawkins at Dissident Dialogues and atheist Alex O'Connor on his podcast , in which she clarified that her conversion was not a merely aesthetic or political one (an impression some had gleaned from her UnHerd essay). Then, in October, Hirsi Ali announced her next major project: a new platform called Courage.Media . According to the founding statement : Courage.Media is founded on the principle that courage is bold action in the face of threats to individuals, culture, and the pursuit of truth. Courage is the endeavor to be honest, even when conformity is easier. Inspired by my journey from tribalism to civilization, Courage.Media is a place where ideas are openly discussed and challenged; a community that values freedom of thought and expression. Hirsi Ali's own story--summarized later in the founding statement--is itself a testament to courage. Born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1969, she was subject to female genital mutilation at the age of five and fled to the Netherlands to escape a forced marriage in 1992. She worked as an interpreter in asylum centers, earned a degree in political science at the University of Leiden, became a critic of the Islamic world's treatment of women, and served as a Dutch MP from 2003 to 2006. Christopher Hitchens called her perhaps the most important public intellectual to come out of Africa. In 2004, her friend Theo Van Gogh was stabbed to death by a Dutch-born Moroccan Islamist. She and Van Gogh had created a short film titled Submission , which detailed the abuse of women in Islam. A death threat to Hirsi Ali was pinned to Van Gogh's chest as he died in the street. Twenty years on, this threat still looms. Indeed, 31 years after being targeted by a fatwa from Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Salman Rushdie was brutally stabbed by an Islamist attacker in 2022 in New York. Rushdie says his first thought when he saw the man rushing the stage was: ""So it's you. Here you are."" Hirsi Ali remembers the Rushdie fatwa well. ""I had been brainwashed enough to agree with that fatwa, and to actually go out and protest along with the people who were dumb enough to buy the book and burn it,"" she told me. She, like Rushdie, now lives with perpetual security--even before Van Gogh's murder, she was a target. ""At first, it's shocking, it's all you can think about, it is frightening. I have to admit that I was and still am very frightened. But as time goes by, you learn to live with it, you learn to protect yourself, you learn to survive."" ""By the time Theo was killed, I lived in the Netherlands and was surrounded by armed men protecting me, moving me from address to address. So you just get into this: What if? What if? And it is so mentally, physically, and spiritually daunting."" ""It isn't just the toll that it takes, in my case, of having my freedom of movement highly constrained,"" Hirsi Ali said. ""It is the toll that it takes on you mentally, this constant fear that's hanging over your head. I also had feelings of just awful guilt towards Theo. It's a constant replay in my head of: What if things had gone differently? What if we didn't make the film? What if he had just taken a different route to work? What if he didn't have his address in the telephone book? What if the mayor of Amsterdam had protected him?"" Despite this threat--which, as the Rushdie stabbing grimly reminded us, always remains--Hirsi Ali refuses to stop speaking the truth as she sees it. She has published several explosive memoirs (the first defiantly titled Infidel ) and is now making her mark with Courage.Media . This platform, she says, is a place where people can engage in the marketplace of ideas without the threat of being vilified, cancelled, or censored, and she hopes it will also be a corrective to the self-censorship so many have imposed on themselves as the result of the Islamist violence. Hirsi Ali says she is grateful for many alternative media platforms-- The Free Press , UnHerd , Substack, and X--but she believes there is room for more. She sees Courage.Media as ""a quest for the restoration of what makes the West great ... for us to be able to embark on the mission of restoration. We also want to be able to articulate what is a threat, what are the termite-like forces chipping away at Western thought, Western institutions, Christianity--and I want to do it unabashedly, unapologetically. I think Western civilization is the greatest civilization that ever was, and we need the courage to say that and the courage to try and restore it."" There are still major challenges facing platforms seeking to provide an alternative to the mainstream press. Few organizations outside of traditional media have the budget or the staff to put reporters on the ground to provide coverage from conflict zones to other crises. The collapse of the mainstream media's credibility has created conditions rife for the proliferation of conspiracy theories, and many reputable foreign correspondents see their work dismissed by those who no longer trust the masthead. Few alternative media platforms have the capacity--or ambition--to replace this key journalistic function. Hirsi Ali sees this challenge as an opportunity. ""At the moment, it's messy,"" Hirsi Ali told me. ""It's going to continue to be messy until, yes, we have enough resources to be able to afford [to do this work]."" There is room, she noted, for a ""news organization that reports primarily on war zones and dangerous zones and does that type of work"" without being ""beholden to some narrative they're trying to push or some political angle they want us to see instead of just the plain truth. The market for that is wide open."" Ayaan Hirsi Ali has been at the forefront of public debate for decades. Now, with her conversion to Christianity and her new media platform, she approaches our turbulent times--which she, more than most, has experienced personally--with fresh eyes. ""My conversion to Christianity now plays a role in everything I do,"" she told me. ""It's a way of life, and it is how I live. I [am always] praying to God for guidance in how I do it, and in doing it in the right way.""",The European Conservative,2024-12-31T18:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-virtue-that-enables-all-others-a-conversation-with-ayaan-hirsi-ali/
After U.S. Exit It’s Time To Reform the Failing WHO,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) exists to fight deadly diseases, coordinate pandemic responses, and improve global health. But instead of focusing on these core priorities, it has expanded into lifestyle regulations-- pushing sugar taxes, alcohol restrictions , and vaping bans . With Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini threatening to exit the WHO, and the organisation already in financial trouble after the United States pulled its funding , Europe needs to step up to issue a public demand for accountability and refocusing the WHO on its original mission. The WHO has a staggering budget of $6.83 billion for its 2024-25 fiscal year, which should be spent on genuine health threats where governments need coordination and where state action can make a real difference, like on communicable diseases. However, instead of investing in research, vaccine development, and emergency preparedness, the WHO has focused on controlling personal lifestyle decisions--increasing taxes on tobacco and alcohol, for example--taking the organisation away from its founding purpose. This has raised widespread doubts about its effectiveness and role in global health governance. The WHO's inefficiency was never more visible than during the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed critical gaps in preparedness, such as delayed responses and an absence of decisive measures at crucial early stages. The fact that two separate institutions-- UNAIDS and the Global Fund --were set up reveals the long-standing lack of confidence in the WHO to address the world's most pressing health concerns. Donald Trump's re-election is a huge blow for the WHO. The United States has traditionally been a major contributor to both the WHO's emergency appeal fund and its broader budget, For the current two-year period, the United States provided about 34% of the funding available for health emergencies. In the past, its contribution has been as high as 50%. However, that financing could be at risk. In his first stint in the White House, Trump moved to cut funding to the WHO and announced the U.S. withdrawal from the agency after criticising it for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and closeness to China. Concerns about the WHO's caving to China during the pandemic was exposed already back in 2023 by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic of the U.S. House of Representatives, which found that The World Health Organization caved to political pressure from the Chinese Communist Party and placed CCP interests ahead of global public health. But it is not just the United States that has found fault with the WHO. According to a European Parliament think tank briefing paper from 2020, ""Even before coronavirus, the WHO already had a mixed track record."" The document concluded that The WHO also failed to hold China to account for its initial cover-up, and even praised its transparency. As for European leaders, they should take three clear steps to ensure their WHO contributions (their citizens' hard-earned tax euros) are well spent. First, they should pause extra funding until the WHO recommits itself and its entire budget to disease prevention, vaccines, and pandemic readiness. Second, the European Union must establish an independent oversight body to audit WHO spending and ensure transparency. Third, if the WHO refuses to reform, Europe should redirect its contributions to more effective global health initiatives like Gavi or the Global Fund. These steps would finally push the WHO to prioritise urgent health threats instead of lifestyle policies. Beyond funding concerns, there is also a need for structural reform within the WHO. The organisation lacks clear mechanisms for accountability, which leads to inefficiencies and policy decisions based more on ideology rather than science. EU member states, particularly those that provide significant financial contributions, should push for strategic changes that emphasize transparency, performance evaluation, and stakeholder accountability. This would ensure its policies serve a genuine global health purpose. The need for reform is urgent. The world is facing an era of heightened health risks, from emerging infectious diseases to antimicrobial resistance. Resources should be directed toward tackling these threats rather than policing dietary habits and nicotine alternatives. Especially when the WHO's favoured interventionist approach does nothing to improve health outcomes while exacerbating cost-of-living crises by increasing the cost of food. Europe must take the lead in demanding change, using its financial influence to push the WHO back toward its original mandate. If the organisation refuses to evolve, it risks becoming irrelevant and actively harmful to global health. Europe has the power to demand these changes. It must act now, before the next global health crisis proves how unprepared the world still is.",The European Conservative,2025-03-02T10:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/after-u-s-exit-its-time-to-reform-the-failing-who/
"Trump, Vance Shake Europe Awake From Liberal Dream","After watching the shocking Oval Office contretemps between Ukraine's Volodomyr Zelensky and the U.S. President and Vice President, I left to join a group of friends for a party in a Budapest pub. Everyone there had seen the clash. It was all anybody could talk about. ""Maybe that had to happen,"" I said to an expatriate friend who is from an EU country, ""but I wish it had not happened in front of the cameras."" ""No, it had to happen that way,"" he responded. ""That's the only way European leaders will learn. Trump has been trying to bring them to reality, but they won't listen."" Later, a shell-shocked group of top European leaders tweeted a joint statement pledging support for Zelensky and Ukraine. ""You are never alone, dear President @Zelenskyyua,"" they said. Well, yes he is--and this is the reality with which Donald Trump and JD Vance brutally smacked Europe. That is, European countries may stand with Ukraine in words, but absent American money, arms, and hard power, what do they have to offer? European armies are small and relatively weak. Since his first term, Trump has been urging European governments to spend more on their own defense. They have been reluctantly doing so, because it's hard to find the money to spend on weapons when your economies are not doing well, and you have a welfare state to uphold. European social spending has for decades rested on the willingness of the United States to pay for Europe's defense. Eighty years after the end of the Second World War, and nearly forty years after the end of the Cold War, the American president has decided that enough is enough. It is time for Europe to grow up. But Europe faces a much worse problem. The Flemish nationalist activist Dries Van Langehove captured it in this tweet: European countries are all increasing their Defence budgets, but they can't seem to buy a willingness to fight. Nobody wants to defend Western-Europe anymore. Right-wing youth feel betrayed by their hostile ruling elites. Left-wing youth are weak and selfhating. Meanwhile,... pic.twitter.com/6i7KcCVBMg Van Langehove's brutal point recalled a conversation I was part of last summer, at a private conference in Sweden about the future of NATO. An older British defense expert spoke at length about NATO's future, as if nothing had changed on the ground since around the year 2000. A Spanish academic intervened, telling the Brit that the UK and other NATO countries are hopelessly weak in terms of personnel. Fewer and fewer native-born Europeans are willing to fight, he said, and the large and increasing population of migrants--especially Muslim ones--not only won't fight for their new countries, but many of them are actually eager to fight against them. The Spaniard did not point out, though he might have done, that more UK Muslim men signed up to fight for jihadist groups in the Middle East than serve in the British military. It would be surprising to learn that the situation is any different in continental Europe. Indeed, a source well-informed on the security situation in the UK and Europe told me recently that police and other government agencies responsible for domestic order are all terrified now of Islamic uprisings and ""race riots,"" by which they mean clashes between Muslims and non-Muslims. ""They are all reduced to hoping that nothing will happen,"" said the source. Hope is not a plan. In Britain, police arrest peaceable people, including elderly women, for praying silently near abortion clinics--in Scotland, you even face arrest for praying against abortion inside your own home--but repeatedly allow British Muslims to say the most appalling things without facing charges. Indeed, we now know that UK authorities turned a blind eye as Pakistani Muslim rape gangs sexually assaulted thousands of working-class English girls. Whether it is out of a mindless devotion to multiculturalism, or fear of provoking Muslim violence, the fact that the British state runs a two-tier justice system is undeniable. I brought up the shocking recent interview that podcaster Louise Perry conducted with David Betz, a professor at London's King's College. Prof. Betz studies modern warfare, and explained how modern Britain is accelerating towards civil war. The academic explained that an outraged peasantry, with no prospects of getting out of what they regard as a failed state, and fed up with a government and an establishment crushing them culturally and economically, are likely to revolt violently. My interlocutor agreed, and gave examples. This person--like all those with whom I spoke informally, a member of the educated middle class--quoted a line from the notorious 1970s French novel The Camp Of The Saints , which presented a dystopian future in which mass migration conquers Europe while European establishments do nothing: ""Your universe has no meaning to them. They will not try to understand. They will be tired, they will be cold, they will make a fire with your beautiful oak door."" That old novel is routinely cited as an example of far-right hate literature, and indeed it has unseemly racist elements. But the truths it told fifty years ago about the civilizational threat from mass migration are now being realized today. People who say such things openly now--like Dries Van Langenhove--are denounced as ""far right,"" and even, like the Flemish activist, face prosecution for things they say. Bigots they might well be (and if so, shame on them), but the fact that only figures the establishment demonizes as ""far right extremists"" are willing to tell the blunt truth about the mounting crisis is less an indictment of them and more an indictment of the cowardly ruling classes who refuse to face hard facts. Indeed, the migrants are making fires with Europe's beautiful oak doors, and the ruling class is taking the doors off the hinges. When and if civil wars come to Britain and Europe, the fault will lie squarely at the feet of the ruling class. David Betz, who studies the roots of civil wars, told Louise Perry that the current Labour government, through its policies, is inexplicably doing all that it can to fuel one. This, then, is the way to understand the rude confrontation that Trump and Vance had with Zelensky. One doesn't have to side with Russia in that war to recognize that Ukraine, which has fought valiantly, has no prospect of victory. Since the war began in 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been saying that Ukraine cannot hope to win, and explaining why. Of course Washington, Brussels, and the media smeared Orban as a Putin apologist, but Orban didn't say those things out of a love for Russia, which enslaved his country for nearly half a century. He was simply being realistic. Dreams die hard. The dream of a secular, progressive, multicultural paradise so beloved of European leaders has come to an end. One year ago, European leaders gathered at the Munich Security Conference cold-shouldered Sen. JD Vance, angry at him over his skeptical views of NATO's Ukraine policy. But this year, Vance returned as the U.S. vice president, and told the audience that the greatest threat to Europe's security was its own decadent policies, including its criminalization of free speech that offends the ruling class's sensibilities. Vance's speech was correct and necessary, but it left European leaders appalled. The chairman of the Munich Security Conference even wept publicly over Vance's words. Well, there is much more wailing among European elites today, after Vance and Trump's dressing-down of the sainted Zelensky. But as my friend in the Budapest pub said, there is no other way to wake Europeans up from their ideological slumber, and force them to deal with the world as it is, not as they would like it to be. The same is true with Americans. On Saturday, U.S. newspapers filled with columns of outrage from establishment voices denouncing Trump and Vance as barbarians. These are the same elites who have hated Trump from the beginning, and have never tried to understand why so many ordinary Americans voted for a rough man like him. As in Europe, the U.S. has long been led by a ruling elite--politicians of the left and right alike, and both in government and private institutions--that has been narcotized by its own illusions. They have behaved with the same logic of Pope Francis, who tirelessly calls for the doors of Europe and America to open wide to mass migration, while living in safety and comfort behind Vatican walls. Reality is biting back. It is rude, it is ugly, but it has the virtue of being, well, real. The reality Trump and Vance shoved in poor Zelensky's face is that after throwing 350 billion dollars behind his country's resistance to Russia, America's patience has run out. The reality Trump and Vance simultaneously shoved in Europe's face, both in that Oval Office confrontation with Zelensky and at the Munich Security Conference, is that your long, American-provided holiday from governing responsibly has come to an end; it's time to return to the office and work. The reality the American leaders are battering US elites with--not only on Ukraine, but across the board--is that their model of how the world works, with its forever wars, its open borders, its woke insanities, is no longer fit for purpose. The new government is not going to live by those shopworn lies anymore. We will now see if Europe's leadership class can rise to the responsibilities Trump has thrust upon it. Do they want to help Ukraine keep fighting its unwinnable war against Russia? Then they have to pay for it themselves. Do they want to raise armies to defend ""European values?"" Then they had better reform, and create political and cultural orders that actual Europeans are willing to sacrifice for. It will no doubt take more shocks like the one Trump and Vance delivered from the Oval Office to wake Europe's sleeping leaders up from their dream, which has become a nightmare for so many ordinary Europeans. And let's be honest: those European leaders did not elect themselves. They have been returned to office repeatedly by European publics who also enjoyed living the dream, subsidized by America's willingness to pay for Europe's defense. Surveys show that most Europeans side with Ukraine. Fine--then make the hard choices necessary to defend your principles. That which cannot last forever, won't. Europe is at the end of something. What comes next is up to Europeans. As it always should have been.",The European Conservative,2025-03-01T16:46:03,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/trump-vance-shake-europe-awake-from-liberal-dream/
Trump’s First 3 Days: A Bold Blueprint for Europe’s Conservatives,"Donald Trump's return to the Oval Office has changed the political playbook. For Europe's conservatives and sovereigntists, looking on in envy across the Atlantic, the 47th president is offering a crash course in bold governance. With an unapologetic focus on national sovereignty, cultural conservatism, and tough border controls, Trump's actions show just how fast a determined conservative government can get things done. Here's why his measures are a roadmap for Europe. Why should taxpayers fund ideas that destabilise the world and hurt national interests? That's the question Trump answered with his 90-day moratorium on foreign aid. By hitting pause and ensuring every dollar aligns with American goals, he's putting Uncle Sam back in charge of the chequebook. Meanwhile, Europe continues to fund globalist, pro-immigration NGOs meddling in domestic affairs. The solution is simple: prioritise your people first. With a stroke of his pen, Trump declared there are only two sexes--male and female. The move wasn't just policy; it was a statement. Banning the rainbow flag from federal buildings worldwide also sends a clear message: the U.S. government will no longer bend to gender ideology. For years, centrists and bien pensant know-it-alls have told Europeans that this is impossible--that it's just the way society is heading. Not anymore. Biology isn't up for debate, and governments don't need to apologise for standing by it. Trump didn't just end affirmative action and racial preferencing by rescinding Lyndon B. Johnson's executive order from 1965; he tore down the infrastructure propping it up by shuttering federal DEI offices. By making merit the standard again, he's championing fairness over division. Europe's conservatives could learn from this decisive action. Policies that prioritise race or gender over skill and effort only breed resentment. Instead, governments should reward hard work and talent, restoring unity and trust in public institutions. Sending the military to the border and fast-tracking deportations. That's Trump's way of saying enough is enough . His unapologetic stance on illegal immigration is a wake-up call for Europe, where porous borders and multiple migrant crises strain economies and cause chaos in communities. Borders matter. Sovereignty matters. When leaders treat illegal immigration as a crisis, they're not being cruel--they're protecting their people. It's a lesson Europe can't afford to ignore. Trump's energy policy is refreshingly straightforward: drill, baby, drill . By prioritising affordability and reliability, he's ensuring America's energy needs aren't hostage to foreign interests or utopian green policies. Europe, with its ludicrous Green Deal, is struggling with energy crises and far too dependent on renewables, and could benefit from this realism. Secure, affordable energy is the backbone of any thriving economy--especially for emerging sectors such as AI. Trump has now given the U.S. a big headstart over Europe. In just three days, Trump has shown what is possible when leaders prioritise their nation's interests without hesitation. For Europe's conservatives and sovereigntists, his example is both inspiring and actionable. Focus on your people, secure your borders, and reject divisive progressive ideologies. Policies that the Establishment told us were impossible are now reality. The question for Europe is not whether to follow Trump's lead. It's whether they're ready to embrace the clarity, conviction, and courage needed to put the people first. The path forward is clear--all that's left is to take it.",The European Conservative,2025-01-23T17:50:38,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/trumps-first-3-days-a-bold-blueprint-for-europes-conservatives/
Should We Have Faith in Zuckerberg’s Free Speech Conversion?,"Who would have guessed that Mark Zuckerberg is a free speech champion? In a video shared widely across social media, the Meta boss announced that it was time for Facebook to return to its ""roots around free expression."" The billions invested in algorithms to detect 'hate speech' and the employment of fact-checkers, all aimed at curtailing 'disinformation' across his social media apps, are now apparently being replaced by users adding community notes to posts. No more AI-driven policing of speech. When a powerful Big Tech baron comes out of the censor's closet to declare his belief in free speech, we should welcome it. The alternative is worse. However, our freedom of speech should surely not be in the gift of any government, judge or Big Tech titan. Zuckerberg has tremendous power: he owns and runs Facebook, which has around 3.07 billion users; Instagram, with around 2 billion; and WhatsApp, with at least 2 billion. His decision in favour of freedom will impact the policing of billions of people's speech online. But excuse me for raising a sceptical eyebrow. Zuckerberg's U-turn might have something to do with his beliefs, but the history of Facebook and censorship should not generate uncritical confidence. It is a sordid history of commercial expediency rather than upholding political principles. Unsurprisingly, the New York Times reported that human resource workers quickly removed posts by employees who disagreed with the new free speech line after Zuckerberg's video announcement. Free speech, indeed. Zuckerberg has been a political chameleon who has changed colour as the political and cultural tide around him has fluctuated. Business interests rather than a deep attachment to freedom of expression have driven and continue to drive Mr. Zuckerberg. In the immediate aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, for example, Facebook became an enthusiastic participant in the disinformation-is-destroying-democracy narrative, which was held responsible for Donald Trump's shock win. In addition to instituting the fact-checking partnerships he has just announced he will abandon, Zuckerberg apologised to Congress for Facebook's role in the election. He then set up and even invited the press to tour a Facebook war room dedicated to fighting 'false information' on the platform. During the Biden administration, Facebook succumbed to pressure to take down COVID-19 content that challenged the official narrative, behaviour Zuckerberg's later said he regretted. He was so attached to the Democrat elite's disinformation narrative that he, in the name of defending U.S. democracy, banned Trump from Facebook when he was still the elected President of the United States. More recently, when Elon Musk exposed the attempt by the EU Commission to censor political content in the run-up to the EU elections, Meta remained silent when asked if it had co-operated. Meta's censorious behaviour has policed the speech of millions of people. Figures from a report by its Oversight Board are revealing. In response to apparent 'hate speech' transgressions, Meta developed an automated system to detect pre-publication content that potentially violated its policies. This notified users to review their posts before publishing them. Over 12 weeks in 2023, more than 100 million pieces of content triggered these user notifications, 17 million related to the Bullying and Harassment policy. This report also notes that in February 2024, Meta received more than seven million appeals from people whose content had been removed under its rules on 'hate speech'. Meta's AI-driven automated 'hate speech' and disinformation systems (in which he has invested billions) remain the largest online language policeman on the planet. This is not going away. Indeed, Zuckerberg has announced his commitment to improving their accuracy, not curtailment. And this is a critical point. Zuckerberg's ability to control speech online has not been diminished. What has changed is the cultural and political climate. These potent systems remain under the control of unaccountable Tech titans. But now it appears they will be deployed in line with the new Trump administration. Zuckerberg was upfront about this in his video announcement. He proudly paraded his commitment to work with President Trump ""to push back on governments worldwide that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more."" Europe's ever-increasing laws institutionalising censorship--most notably the Digital Services Act, which Zuckerberg has happily co-operated with until now--may now become a target in a U.S. campaign against the EU's digital regulation. For those who take freedom of speech seriously, these developments raise questions for the future. The key one is its impact on free speech in Europe. Online speech regulation will become part of the new geopolitics of the Trump administration, which means it will be an area of increased tension and contestation. These developments are also potentially dangerous, particularly for Europe's rising conservative political movements. The most significant danger is that it distracts the populists from the urgent need to build a political free-speech movement across Europe. Relying on U.S. Big Tech to do this would be naive and self-defeating. For years, Europe's political elite has promoted the narrative that ordinary people lack the moral fibre or intelligence to distinguish truth from disinformation. Their hateful narrative, which Big Tech has supported until now, rests on the idea that ordinary people cannot shape their nations through democracy and are thus in need of guidance, protection, and censure when they stray from the status quo script. The EU's censorship operating system is a top-down technocratic authoritarian conceit by an elite that thinks they know what's best for the rest of us. It is designed to ensure that they determine what can and cannot be said online. Relying on U.S. Big Tech to fight this war on our behalf would replace one technocratic elitist narrative with another. Placing faith in unaccountable tech titans to lead the battle against censorship and for free speech is not only naive and distracting. It would simply morally rehabilitate technocratic managerialism--the very thing populist politics needs to destroy. It is not a newly- converted free speech Tech titan we need to have faith in, but the wisdom of ordinary people. Unlike the Left, we need a movement that defends free speech for all, not just the views we agree with. Free speech is too important an issue to be left to the vagaries and interests of fickle technocrats.",The European Conservative,2025-01-13T15:55:23,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/should-we-have-faith-in-zuckerbergs-free-speech-conversion/
EU Plays Trump Card To Advance Its Globalist Agenda,"The reappearance of Donald Trump on the international political scene has left Brussels in a state of panic. Considering the current international context, it could well signify a revolution within the European Union. However, the European Union, under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, is using the American magnate's return to power as a golden opportunity to strengthen its own supranational integration agenda, further weakening the sovereignty of member states and promoting a centralized vision of the European bloc. If the last term was an example of the 'new Europe' designed for us, the next four years will bring more of the same, but now tinged with a particular European patriotism in the face of the expansionism of the 'Eagle Empire.' During her speech at the Davos Forum in January this year, von der Leyen made the EU's new approach clear: continuing climate policies and protecting ""our European way of life"" (whatever that means to EU leaders) against external threats, particularly those stemming from Donald Trump's United States and China--after years of declaring that the main enemy was Vladimir Putin's Russia. ""The world is in a 'race against time' to tackle global challenges such as climate change and seize the opportunities of AI,"" she stated during her speech at the World Economic Forum. Brussels' stance is clear: continue decarbonizing at any cost. ""Europe will continue to seek cooperation and is 'open for business' to those who wish to improve clean technology and expand digital infrastructure."" It is no coincidence that this rhetoric aligns with Brussels' attempts to reform the EU's founding treaties, granting even more powers to European institutions at the expense of member states. Although the call on the Commission to initiate these reforms passed in the Parliament with only a paper-thin majority, there's no doubt the efforts will continue in both institutions. Among the reforms under discussion is the elimination of the unanimity principle in the European Council, the only tool blocking Brussels from making key decisions without the consensus of all member states. There is also talk of creating new powers in taxation, defense, and energy policy, which would significantly curtail the autonomy of countries reluctant to follow the European Commission's lead. After Trump's ascent, the U.S. is continuously being portrayed as an 'imminent threat' to European stability, enabling the EU to strengthen its control mechanisms and discipline countries that resist its directives. The European Commission is now promoting a narrative in which only a stronger and more united Europe can withstand the 'winds' of populism, protectionism, and the so-called far right. However, this strategy is not only aimed at consolidating power in Brussels. It also serves as a weapon to weaken patriotic and sovereignist movements that have gained strength across the continent. Growing public outrage over mass immigration, draconian climate policies, and the imposition of ideologies alien to national traditions has led to the rise of parties challenging the EU's globalist consensus. In response, the European establishment has intensified its offensive: any movement that questions Brussels' agenda is immediately labeled as ""far right"", ""fascist"", or even ""Nazi"". This phenomenon is not new but has become more aggressive in recent years. Censorship attempts, media persecution, and the systematic exclusion of dissenting voices from public debate have become normalized. Anyone opposing the EU's policies is presented as a threat to democracy when, in reality, what is at stake is the ability of European peoples to decide their future--if such a possibility even exists today. The tactic is cheap but at least transparent: use the figure of Trump as a scarecrow to justify the centralization of power in Brussels and delegitimize political movements that challenge the EU's ideological hegemony. What we are witnessing is, in essence, a perfect excuse to push forward a project of forced integration that many Europeans have neither voted for nor approved. The supposed fight against populism is nothing more than a strategy to consolidate a political elite that refuses to accept that European societies are changing and that more and more citizens reject the progressive dogma imposed by Brussels. This is not the first time the EU has taken advantage of an external crisis to strengthen its control. It happened with the euro crisis when centralized austerity measures were implemented, with the COVID-19 pandemic, which facilitated the expansion of bureaucratic control, and with the war in Ukraine, which was used to justify energy and military policies without the necessary widespread consultation. Now, Trump is the new excuse. Will it also be an opportunity for change in the Old Continent?",The European Conservative,2025-02-04T18:28:19,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/eu-plays-trump-card-to-advance-its-globalist-agenda/
For a Kiss? The Left’s Double Standards on Trial,"We live in an era of blatant contradictions, where the narrative matters more than reality, and the identity of the person committing the act weighs more than the act itself. The Rubiales case in Spain is proof of this. Luis Rubiales was the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation and UEFA vice president. After the Spanish women's football team won the World Cup in 2023, during the victory celebration, in a moment of emotion, he kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips, one of the best players in the tournament and an influential figure on the team. A non-consensual kiss, criticizable and reprehensible, but far from any serious sexual assault, has been turned into a scandal of historic proportions. A disproportionate media and judicial lynching could potentially result in a man serving more than two years in prison. In England, for decades, the horror of sexual exploitation networks in cities like Rotherham, Rochdale, or Telford, where thousands of girls were raped and abused by gangs of Pakistani origin, was covered up. The media and authorities looked the other way for fear of being labeled racist. In Germany, France, and Sweden, hundreds of women have been victims of sexual assaults during events such as the 2015 New Year's Eve in Cologne and in other systematic attacks, yet these incidents do not receive the same outraged media coverage as a kiss at a sports celebration. Why? This double standard is one of the most significant aberrations of our time. Selective justice and outrage have created a system where the crime does not matter as much as the identity of the perpetrator. If the offender is a white European man of a certain status, the machinery of cancellation and public condemnation is unleashed without restraint. If, on the other hand, the aggressor belongs to a group considered vulnerable under the progressive dogma, accusations are minimized, victims are left unprotected, and indignation vanishes. We are witnessing the destruction of values and social cohesion based on hypocrisy and political convenience. In this dystopia, the truth is hidden, justice is selective, and equality before the law has become an illusion. The message is clear: the crime does not matter; who commits it matters. Throughout history, justice has been a fundamental pillar of societal stability. However, today, the legal and media system seems more concerned with complying with the ideological dictates than with ensuring equal standing before the law. The criminalization of specific sectors of the population while absolving others under the premise of ""historical oppression"" only generates divisions and resentment. But let's not fool ourselves: this is not accidental. They know that resentment is a powerful weapon that, when well-nurtured and directed by the usual media propaganda, can yield electoral victories for aligned politicians. Today's Left thrives on resentment; it needs it to remain in power. Spain also saw a similar case involving one of the leaders of the radical left: Inigo Errejon. The former leader of Podemos, later one of the key figures of the Sumar party led by Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz, was accused of sexual abuse by a woman he allegedly tried to sleep with. Following the accusation, it was revealed that Errejon is addicted to sex and drugs while simultaneously being a staunch feminist--or so he claimed. The entire Left quickly covered up the case, which, although discussed and commented on, did not affect his political sphere. Why? Well, Errejon does not fit the idea they want to impose on, white, heterosexual, men of a certain status. But Rubiales does. He is white, heterosexual, a man with some power and influence. In a way, tearing down certain towers sends a powerful message: if they have fallen, anyone can fall. It is a perfect way to instill self-censorship and fear of others. These narratives affect justice, security, and trust in institutions. When specific perpetrators are protected for ideological reasons, the entire system is delegitimized. The victims of these crimes are doubly silenced, first by their aggressors and then by a society that refuses to acknowledge the problem. True equality starts with everyone being judged by the same criteria, regardless of race, gender, or social status. Until this happens, we will continue to live in a distorted reality where justice is nothing more than a farce serving a political ideology that prioritizes its agenda over truth and fairness.",The European Conservative,2025-02-06T13:59:31,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/rubiales-case-spain-football-sexual-harassment-double-standard/
Trump’s NGO Apocalypse,"In popular culture, the word 'apocalypse' means 'the end of the world,' as portrayed in the Book of Revelation. But etymologically, it comes from the Greek word meaning 'unveiling.' What Donald Trump is doing to the unelected NGO-cracy in Washington now is an apocalypse in both senses of the term. His team, led by Elon Musk, is uncovering massive state funding, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), of NGOs and activist groups that serve as de facto arms of globalism, and destroying them by taking their taxpayer money away. Most Americans have never heard of USAID, and if they have, imagine that it is a humanitarian agency dedicated to providing disaster relief and doing things like helping poor Africans build hospitals and water wells. And some of its massive budget ($40 billion in 2023) does go to worthy projects like that. But that's not why Trump has targeted USAID, whose funding has been put on temporary hold, and which is in the process of being shut down by executive order, with its responsibilities relocated to the State Department. Trump's people have uncovered a sprawling network of funding for NGOs that advance not humanitarian relief and development, but activists who spread globalist progressivism worldwide, and who even work to undermine elected governments disfavored by Washington. It's the use of soft power to effect regime change. In a long, must-listen interview with podcaster Joe Rogan , the former State Department official and free speech crusader Mike Benz outlines in detail how the Deep State uses USAID to spread globalist ideology, including progressive cultural values, and shut down populist politicians and initiatives. Here's how it works. In 2023, then-USAID administrator Samantha Power visited Budapest, and met with activists opposed to the elected government of Viktor Orban. She left a $20 million gift to be distributed among ""pro-democracy"" and ""transparency"" groups, including those that ""improve the lives of LGBTQI+ people in Hungary."" That's a chunk of change that can go very far in a small country of only 10 million. And it was clearly an attempt to seed a Color Revolution in this democratic NATO ally, whose nationalist government has been a thorn in the side of globalists in Washington and Brussels. Over the years, USAID has committed millions to George Soros's Open Society Foundation to effect political and cultural change in Eastern Europe. One of the targeted countries was the Republic of Macedonia, a culturally conservative nation that is two-thirds Orthodox and one-third Muslim. Between 2012 and 2016, the Soros Army in that country received $5 million from USAID to field culture-war mercenaries to fight what it termed ""the ruling party's promotion of a socially conservative, exclusionary agenda that relies on traditional gender ideology."" Were the American people aware that $300,000 of their tax dollars were going to queer Macedonia? Not likely. But there's more. Back in 2015, USAID partnered with Soros to translate, publish, and distribute Rules For Radicals , the notorious Saul Alinsky revolution manual, in the Republic of Macedonia, which at the time was governed by conservatives. That year, Macedonia was roiled by anti-government protests, some of them violent. Again, USAID has not only spent a fortune to advance globalist politics. It has also been a financial generator of cultural revolution. The White House recently released a selected list of far-left initiatives the agency has funded, including: Last year in Bratislava, at a conference after the U.S. election, a Slovak conservative told me he hopes the incoming Trump administration will wake up to how the U.S. funds a network of progressive NGOs advocating against what he believes are Slovak national interests. For just one small example of how 'development' money goes from USAID to back cultural revolution, The American Spectator reports that USAID has given money to the heavily Catholic country: Ireland is not a country one would have expected to need American development grants, but as the White House accurately said, $70,000 in U.S. taxpayer money paid for a musical show that, in the words of the USAID grant , advocates ""the U.S. and Irish shared values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility."" The tentacles of USAID's funding of the NGO industrial complex go incomprehensibly far. It turns out that the second-largest funder of BBC Media Action, the philanthropic arm of the British state broadcaster, was--surprise!--the American taxpayer. A BBC Media Action statement this week said 8% of its annual funding comes from USAID . According to BBC Media Action , its purpose is to work in 30 countries globally to build ""stronger democracies, a safer, more habitable planet and inclusive societies."" The organization's website says, ""We also [address] discrimination and harmful social norms affecting people in LGBTQI+ communities, and [strive] for diverse and meaningful representation of these groups."" Of course they do. But one doubts very much that they care about ""diverse and meaningful representation"" in the media of any group whose values would be alien at Davos or at meetings of university faculties. While BBC Media Action emphasizes that it is separate from the BBC's news division, USAID has also given money to the mainstream liberal online media outlet Politico , which is highly influential in Washington circles. The media company received a total of $8.1 million in USAID money under the Biden administration, which it also covered. Though it might have been a coincidence, after Trump suspended USAID funding, Politico temporarily could not meet its payroll. In any case , in this Tuesday report about Trump's mass layoff of USAID workers, Politico neglected to mention that it receives millions in USAID funding. You get the idea. What Donald Trump and Elon Musk are doing is gutting the globalist hydra by cutting off its lifeblood: U.S. government funding. It is to be hoped that funding will be restored for USAID projects that truly serve humanitarian purposes: hospitals, vaccination programs, infrastructure, and more. But whenever you hear wailing and gnashing of teeth over how heartless Trump is taking charity away from the world's poor, remember that those stories are written and broadcast by the kind of people who define 'democracy' as outcomes that they and their social class prefer. It should not have come to this. But then, if USAID had not given itself a role as a worldwide funder of cultural and political revolution to support globalism and the American Empire, it would not have. This is not the end of the world, but it is the end of a world, in which unaccountable left-wing activists and their captured institutions advance radical programs with no accountability to the taxpayers funding their folly.",The European Conservative,2025-02-05T14:10:13,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/trumps-ngo-apocalypse/
Beyond Francis: Will His Controversial Legacy Be Continued?,"The film Conclave (2024), directed by Swiss filmmaker Edward Berger and nominated for eight Oscars, depicts a ""secret"" Church with atheist, libertine, and homosexual cardinals who must elect the next pope after the death of the predecessor, a liberal Catholic with the highly improbable name of Gregory XVII. The race for the papacy addresses many themes that are not exclusive to the progressive fantasies of the director but are indeed topics that keep the pre-conclave debate alive: female ordinations, the end of clerical celibacy and the overcoming of male-female dichotomy, the queer agenda, and transgenderism ideology. The film ends with the revelation of the intersexual identity of the newly elected Pope, who is forced to undergo a surgical removal of the uterus. What an unexpected twist. Here we are beyond the feminist dream of Pope Joan; we have directly Pope Androgynous. The film is unsettling because, by exaggerating reality, it describes (and normalizes) the dreams of a now not-so-insignificant portion of the contemporary Catholic clergy, which is preparing--this time for real--for the election of Francis's successor. The last twelve years of the pontificate have been characterized by an agenda radically opposed to traditional Catholic values. To understand Francis's agenda, one must look at the speech given by the ultra-modernist Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini (1927-2012), the ' antepapa ' ('the one before the Pope'), as he liked to call himself, who sought to promote Bergoglio's election during the 2005 conclave. In 1999, during the Synod of European Bishops, the former Archbishop of Milan identified four ""knots to untie"": These four knots have been central to Pope Francis's governance, even though they have not been fully ""resolved"" as hoped. Regarding the first knot, the Amazon Synod (2018) turned out to be a fiasco, and the introduction of viri probati faded away. Regarding the second knot, rather than issuing striking and divisive magisterial documents, it was decided to act directly by placing women from the Bergoglian entourage in more or less important positions in the Curia (for example, in 2025, the case of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life , or the case of the Vatican Governorate , going against the Fundamental Law of the Vatican State promulgated by Francis himself). Regarding the third knot, the publication by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith of the controversial document Fiducia supplicans (2023) opened the possibility of blessing LGBT couples ""as couples,"" thus paving the way for their normalization within the Catholic Church. Regarding the fourth knot, the publication of Amoris Laetitia (2016) effectively initiated a revolution in traditional theology concerning not only Marriage but also two other sacraments fundamental to every Catholic's life, namely Confession and the Eucharist. Another very important document, to be understood as a ""necessary corollary"" of this entire agenda, is certainly Traditionis custodes (2021), which, by prohibiting the Traditional form of the Roman liturgy, has effectively sought to block any attempt to restore Catholic doctrine and morality. Progressives, indeed, know well, just as conservatives and traditionalists do, that the liturgy reflects and transmits a precise way of understanding the deposit of faith. In short, the reign of Francis (which now seems to be coming to an end, but is in fact a long sunset that has been ongoing since at least 2023) has meant, following an hermeneutic of rupture from the Second Vatican Council, the relativization of morality after a previous phase of relativizing ecumenical relations . A necessary step to arrive at the relativization of doctrine . A new phase, therefore, of the ""revolutionary pastoral"" initiated, more or less consciously, by Paul VI and interrupted--but not resolved--during the reigns of John Paul II and Benedict XVI. A phase that will not end with the death or abdication of Francis because it remains incomplete, and has been effectively countered from several fronts, not only by those ecclesiastics presented by the media as 'enemies' of Bergoglio but also by many who initially, out of naivety, conviction, or convenience, appeared to be 'friends' of Francis. An example of this is the revolt of the high-ranking African prelates against Fiducia supplicans . Who will take the reins of this Revolution after Francis? Many names of potential popes have been mentioned in recent days. Remembering the well-known Roman adage that says, ""He who enters the conclave as pope, leaves it as a cardinal"" (and hoping it applies in this case as well), we must recall what happened during the 2013 Conclave, which saw the election of the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires, to try to hypothesize what might happen during the next one. At that historical moment, the conservatives proposed the Italian Angelo Scola (behind suggestions and hopes of the abdicated Benedict XVI), while the progressives proposed, more skillfully, the Brazilian Odilo Scherer. I say skillfully because Scherer was actually a 'decoy name,' a diversion to be exposed in the media to conceal the real candidate, namely Bergoglio. Scherer appeared, all in all, as a moderate, enough to attract the sympathies of Bertone and Sodano, but some hidden sympathies were also known, which then suddenly emerged after the Amazon Synod . Scherer soon took a back seat, and Jorge Mario Bergoglio was proposed as a 'compromise pope,' known at the time for being a centrist, if not even a conservative, given his pro-Peronist and officially anti-Marxist past. The media played a very important role, spreading insinuations and false news that found credibility among many cardinal electors. A similar strategy could be implemented during the next Conclave. In the media, for example, much is said about the Filipino Tagle and the Italian Zuppi, two extremely progressive cardinals very close to Francis, who, however, are unlikely to gather the necessary votes for election, given the widespread discontent after twelve years of authoritarian, repressive governance that disregards the laws governing the Church. The media exaltation of their (real) neo-modernist positions could frighten conservative cardinals and, in general, those disappointed by Bergoglio. Tagle and Zuppi, therefore, could be the new 'decoy names,' behind which the real candidates of the heirs of the St. Gallen Group could be hiding. We can propose two hypotheses: the Italian Pietro Parolin , current Secretary of State, and the influential Portuguese Jose Tolentino de Mendonca . Both have been presented as centrists or even close to the 'conservative cause' (let's not forget the decisive role apparently played by Parolin in stopping the blasphemous exhibition in Carpi, Italy , promoted by the local bishop). The problem is that these prelates are anything but centrists, certainly not moderates. Let's start with Pietro Parolin. A skilled diplomat and man of power, he was trained at a young age under the wing of Achille Silvestrini (the true mastermind behind the St. Gallen Group ) and was recommended by him to Bergoglio as the ideal man for the governance of the Secretariat of State. He is the heir and continuer of the Ostpolitik implemented by Casaroli with the Soviet Union, now with Communist China. Parolin is, in fact, the true architect of the still-secret agreements between the Vatican and Beijing. He is also one of the minds behind Traditionis Custodes and--significantly--participated in the secret meetings of the Bilderberg Group in 2018, a globalist lobby known for its 'woke' and socialist agendas. One of the main themes of that year was the ""alarming rise of populism worldwide."" As for Mendonca he has expressed favorable positions towards the inclusion of various realities in the Church, including remarried divorcees and homosexuals. Praising Amoris Laetitia , he said , ""We live in the midst of the city, in this space full of borders, full of invisible walls and existential blocks [...]. Whether it is remarried Christians, wounded by failed marital experiences or the reality of new families, or homosexuals, they must find in the Church a place of listening, welcome, and mercy."" He is also the author of the preface to the book La theologie feministe dans l'histoire (Fragmenta Editorial, 2007) by his friend, the French feminist nun Teresa Forcades. He enjoys great influence among South American prelates, especially Brazilians, as well as within the Sant'Egidio Community (to which the aforementioned Zuppi belongs) and the Society of Jesus, from which Bergoglio himself comes, and which could push him as an alternative to another great favorite of the Jesuits, the Maltese Mario Grech.",The European Conservative,2025-03-01T15:56:46,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/pope-francis-legacy-progressivism-succession-catholic-church/
The Murdered Bibas Children Are Finally Home,"On February 26, 34-year-old Yarden Bibas laid his wife and two little boys to rest in the Tsoher Cemetery near Kibbutz Nir Oz in Israel. Shiri Bibas was 32 when they were taken. Ariel was four. Kfir was only 8 months old. The mother and her two red-headed sons were buried in the same casket, a short distance away from where they were kidnapped by the sadists of Hamas on October 7, 2023. For over a year, those who cared wondered what had happened to the Bibas family. On October 7, the world saw the gut-wrenching footage of Shiri clutching her two boys as she looked about with a terror-stricken face at the gun-toting killers surrounding her; on February 19, 2024, the IDF released a short clip of surveillance footage from that same day of Shiri, still clinging to her sons, being herded through a street in Khan Younis, Gaza. Then, for more than a year, nothing. Yarden Bibas, who had been separated from his family when he left the saferoom of his home in an attempt to distract the invaders, was finally released on February 1 with two other hostages in exchange for 183 Palestinian convicts after 484 days of imprisonment. Hamas claimed that Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were dead. The family--and all Israel--clung to hope. Orange--the color of the Bibas boys' hair--became a potent symbol: This week, commemorative orange light illuminated landmarks from the Israeli Knesset to the Empire State Building . We now know the savage truth about what happened to those two precious boys. Hamas claimed that they had been killed by an Israeli airstrike, and their Western cheerleaders desperately cling to this cruel fiction as if it exonerates the kidnappers rather than condemns them. Why were they in Gaza to begin with? According to Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine, the two children were killed by terrorists in ""cold blood"" with ""bare hands"" sometime in November 2023. Or as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put it: ""They strangled the tender boys with their bare hands."" On February 20, Hamas hosted a raucous rally to turn the murdered children and their mother over to the Red Cross. There was cheering and pounding music. Four coffins--including one containing the corpse of 84-year-old peace activist Oded Lifshitz--were placed on a stage with a mural of Netanyahu dripping blood behind them. Hamas put the baby and the boy in adult-sized coffins to avoid the visceral visual of child-sized caskets. On each coffin, Hamas affixed a label : ""Date of Arrest: October 7, 2023."" In one final, sickening twist, Shiri's coffin turned out to contain the body of someone else, and Hamas quietly returned the correct corpse on February 21. In return for these bodies, Hamas secured the release of approximately 600 live criminals. Let me pause here to remind you: Around the world, Western academics and activists, to our everlasting shame, for they feel none--leapt to defend the orgy of rape, torture, murder, and kidnapping of October 7 at the time , long before Israel's military campaign to recover the kidnapped and punish the baby-killers began. I detailed their bloodthirsty celebration here at europeanconservative.com on October 10 . These people saw the terrified Shiri and her two red-headed babies, and they rejoiced . They showed us who they are, and we should never, ever forget the day the mask fell away. We should treat them with the utter contempt and revulsion they deserve. In the year between their kidnapping and their return to Israel in coffins, people tore down hostage posters featuring the faces of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir. As Douglas Murray grimly noted, that would never happen to posters of missing pets. But for Jewish children? Yes. That happened , and that fact should fill us with shame and rage. I was at the Toronto Holocaust Museum earlier this week, and the young woman behind the desk told us that she'd been nearly incapacitated with grief all week over the fate of the Bibas family. She thanked us, repeatedly, for coming to visit. There are so few non-Jewish allies during this incredibly dark time, she said. I asked an older volunteer, who told me that both of his parents were Holocaust survivors, what it has been like in Canada since October 7. ""Very bad,"" he replied, his eyes welling. ""Very bad."" He's right. A wave of Jew-hatred--antisemitism seems too feeble a word--has swept Canada and other Western countries since the massacres in Israel over a year ago. Some Jewish people are actively hiding their identity in public for fear of being targeted. The Bais Chaya Mushka Girls Elementary School has been shot at twice. Yarden Bibas chose to have a private funeral, but thousands of Israelis packed the streets to watch the funeral procession , and his eulogy was posted online. He told his wife that he had loved her from the very beginning; that his sun-washed memories with her were ""wonderful""; that all Israel loved her and mourned with him. ""Shiri, this is the closest I've been to you since October 7, and I can't kiss or hug you, and it's breaking me."" And to his son Ariel: ""You made me a father. You transformed us into a family ... thank you, beloved Ariel. I hope you're not angry with me for failing to protect you properly and for not being there for you. I hope you know I thought about you every day, every minute. Ariel, I love you 'the most in the world, always in the world,' just as you used to tell us."" And finally, to the beautiful baby boy who lived less than a year but captured the heart of his nation: You brought more light and happiness to our little home. You came with your sweet, captivating laugh and smile, and I was instantly hooked! It was impossible not to nibble on you all the time. Kfir, I'm sorry I didn't protect you better, but I need you to know that I love you deeply and miss you terribly. I miss nibbling on you and hearing your laughter. I miss our morning games when mom would ask me to watch you before I went to work. I cherished those little moments so much, and I miss them now more than ever. Kfir, I love you the most in the world, always in the world! I have so many more things to tell you all, but I'll save them for when we're alone. Then, Yarden Bibas took a shovel and helped bury his wife and children . May their memory be a blessing, and may God grant him the strength he needs in the lonely years ahead. We will never forget.",The European Conservative,2025-02-28T13:24:26,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/kfir-shiri-bibas-funeral-hamas-gaza-israel/
Why Greenland's Independence Terrifies Europe,"In recent days, mainstream media and social media have been circulating exaggerated claims about an imminent U.S. invasion of... Greenland! These absurdities are based on statements by Donald Trump expressing his interest in this overseas territory of the Kingdom of Denmark--a U.S. ally and a founding member of NATO. The penny-a-line journalists and their followers, lacking humor and perceptive ability, genuinely believe that such a possibility exists. Even Danish officials have commented on these absurdities. But what is really happening? Are people so naive as to truly believe that the U.S. will invade Greenland? Or are they afraid of something else? The truth is that Denmark has many valid reasons to fear the resurgence of a separatist movement in Greenland. The otherwise peaceful and democratic Scandinavians subjected the inhabitants of Greenland to inhumane torture, humiliation, child abductions, forced sterilizations, and rapes. And we are not talking about centuries ago, but just a few years ago. So the memories of the Inuit who endured the horrors of Danish colonialists first-hand remain painfully vivid. It was only in the second half of the 20th century that at least three official programs from the Kingdom of Denmark came to light, each of which violated the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 260 (III) A on December 9th, 1948. The first official social experiment program was the ""Little Danes"" experiment in 1951, during which 22 Inuit children from Greenland were sent to foster families in Denmark to be re-educated as ""little Danes."" Although the children were supposed to be orphans, most were not but were forcibly taken from their families. Six were adopted while in Denmark, while the rest returned to Greenland and were placed in orphanages where they spoke Danish. The experiment had severe consequences for the children, with half facing mental health issues and half dying at a young age. The Danish government never showed remorse for this Soviet-style experiment until it officially apologized in 2020. Beyond the abuse of Inuit children, Danish law until 1974 considered children of unmarried Greenlandic women who had been raped by Danish settlers as juridisk faderlose (legally fatherless). These children had no right to know or inherit their biological fathers, effectively protecting Danish men from responsibilities towards their children in Greenland, creating a form of racial segregation. Not until 2014 did Denmark overturn these provisions, giving children the right to claim paternity and inheritance from their fathers. In addition to social experiments, child abductions, abuse, and apartheid-like legislation, Denmark also implemented population control programs in Greenland. The Spiralkampagnen was a birth control campaign conducted by the Danish government in Greenland during the 1960s and 1970s. As part of this campaign, Danish doctors implanted intrauterine devices (IUDs) in thousands of Inuit girls and women, often without their consent. The campaign aimed to reduce the birth rate in Greenland. During the first five years of the campaign, about half of the women of childbearing age in Greenland had IUDs implanted. The Spiralkampagnen had serious consequences for affected women and girls, many of whom had not given consent or were not properly informed. From the above, one can conclude that the long-suffering Inuit people have endured much inhumane treatment from the Danes, justifying any thoughts of Greenland's independence or annexation to another state. This is precisely what Europeans fear--and why they take Trump's comments seriously. If the 'democratic' Danes were at peace with their conscience, they would take Trump's proposal for Greenland's annexation to the U.S. as a joke. However, given their deep understanding of the extent of oppression, humiliation, and exploitation endured by native Greenlandic Inuit over so many years, they fear the potential for an independence campaign through a referendum. Although the 2009 law allows for a referendum in Greenland, Denmark's Constitution requires parliamentary ratification. In any case, even if Parliament rejected a potential popular demand for Greenland's independence, the social impacts would be incalculable. Donald Trump is well-versed in geopolitics, Arctic issues, and security. Despite mainstream media's attempts to portray him comically, his strategic moves and targeted statements reveal a different aspect. It remains to be seen what developments are triggered by his exploratory statements as President-elect. For now, however, Greenlanders take them seriously.",The European Conservative,2025-01-18T10:59:41,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/why-greenlands-independence-terrifies-europe/
The UK’s Shotgun Clampdown Is Indicative of Much More,"In their latest search to find some part of British life on which they haven't yet rained down misery, Labour is seeking to discourage shotgun ownership. From the time of the 1689 Bill of Rights, it has been the law of the land that Englishmen may bear arms. Since 1870, modest laws have incrementally come in to qualify this old liberty, but the latest decision of Labour is in keeping with their obsessive desire to crush all remaining liberties in these isles. 'I'm leaving the UK' has become a genre on YouTube. An astonishing number of short videos, usually made on smartphones, show people standing in a field or sitting in the car, explaining to their viewers why they are leaving the United Kingdom. These videos have appeared in the last six months, and the reasons given for leaving the UK are invariably that the country's infrastructure is collapsing, the National Health Service isn't working and no one will reform it, the streets are unsafe, the police do not address crime, taxation is too high, houses are too difficult to obtain, quality of life is getting ever worse, cost of living is too expensive, the government interferes with every aspect of private life ... the list goes on. People are miserable--that much is clear. One of the few redeeming aspects of life in the UK is the old-fashioned pub. But with over 400 pubs every year closing across these isles, these are oases of everyday culture that are fast drying up. When I go and sit quietly in the corner of my local pub and eavesdrop on the townsmen and countryfolk, there is a common theme to all the conversations I overhear: this country is going to hell in a handbasket. Certainly, part of the problem is that the current government has combined extreme centralisation with acute incompetence, which, if you think about it, is probably the worst possible combination of any given government. Senior front benchers in parliament have been found to lie about their former careers, the cabinet cannot put together a workable budget, Ed Miliband wants to cover what's left of England's internationally admired countryside in solar panels and wind farms, and the government is coming after the poor, the retired, and the farming community with a wrath of which no one can make sense. As words like 'remigration,' 'repatriation,' and 'deportation' are fast mainstreaming across Britain's public square, Labour continually fails to address the country's serious immigration problem, and meanwhile, Prime Minister Starmer has publicly dismissed rising concerns about the rape of British children and vulnerable young people by Pakistani gangs as a ""far-right bandwagon."" Astonishingly, despite their manifest incompetence, the government continues to look around for anything left in the UK that they haven't either crippled via badly drafted legislation or destroyed altogether. Hence, they're coming after home educators , as the number of children moving from school- to home education has doubled recently in most regions of the UK, more than tripled in the Northeast, and risen by 85% in the East of England. They're coming after the churches, axing funds for their upkeep. They're coming after rural folk, not only by forcing small farms to fold due to the new inheritance tax imposition, but by persecuting the fieldsporting community with plans to outlaw trail-hunting--the very sport Labour told hunters to switch to when they persecuted houndsports two decades ago. It is as if our powerholders lie awake at night, terrified that there might be some remaining part of British life that they have not regulated or destroyed. The latest in their attack on the countryside is that of interfering with shotgun certificates. This is a remarkably stupid thing to do, given that rural tourism in the British countryside is largely lucrative on account of the country's famous shooting heritage. With wild fowl like duck, snipe, and woodcock, and reared game like pheasant, French 'red-legged' partridge, and the slowly re-emerging English 'grey' partridge, Britain is a much-coveted shooting destination for fieldsports enthusiasts all over the world. A typical day of shooting red grouse--a bird unique to these isles--on the Yorkshire moors costs around PS15,000, with an addition of around PS200 per brace, and wealthy Saudis like to come and put eye-watering amounts of money into the local economy at such shoots. Hence, on inspection, it is no surprise that game shooting annually contributes PS3.3 billion to the economy and supports tens of thousands of rural jobs. And yet, in its pathological appetite for destruction, Labour is coming after it. The government's plan is to introduce restrictions by ""aligning the control on shotguns with other firearms,"" it announced. The proposed policy would license shotguns in the same way as rifles. In turn, an applicant would need to provide good reason for owning a shotgun, with each gun having to be licensed separately. The purchase and holding of ammunition would also be limited and there may be additional restrictions around the storage of shotguns. There is even talk of each region having a centralised firearms storage centre to prevent people from keeping their guns on their properties. The government already announced late last year that it would more than double the cost of firearms applications, and now with this new policy of more tightly regulating the ownership of shotguns, firearm ownership in the UK looks to be challenging to the point of near-impossible. There are over 610,000 legitimate gun owners in the UK, nearly all of whom hold firearms because they either shoot gamebirds or clays. The government is coming after them and their way of life whilst police routinely fail to deal with the issue of illegitimate gun possession by those who unlawfully retain arms for bad reasons. Rather than frustrating the lives of illegally gun-possessing miscreants, the government's focus is on tweed-clad fieldsportsmen who readily declare all their guns. So, again, the Labour government of the United Kingdom has found an aspect of life in these isles which it has not yet rendered miserable, and has predictably moved in. Little wonder that Brits are fleeing this ancient kingdom in shocking numbers. According to one estimation , almost a quarter of UK adults are looking to leave the country in the next five years. Hopefully, when Reform UK gets into power four years from now, as it most probably will, there will be enough of the country left following Labour's scorched earth strategy for Brits to consider returning. For now, I don't blame anyone who's buying a one-way ticket out of here.",The European Conservative,2025-02-21T18:40:42,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-uks-shotgun-clampdown-is-indicative-of-much-more/
Trump Broadened the Tent; Europe Must Follow Suit,"The most remarkable political story of 2024 was surely Donald Trump's victory, and the most remarkable aspect of that story was the strong support Trump earned from a variety of minority groups which had previously leaned Democratic. Trump won 46% of Hispanics and 40% of Asians . Although African Americans remain stubbornly Democratic, he did make inroads with young black men, and it appears that younger minority voters more generally are increasingly willing to vote Republican . Trump's uniqueness distracts from how significant this is. A decade ago, in the wake of Barack Obama's successes, the consensus view was that the increasing diversity of the American electorate would ultimately lead to Democratic hegemony. John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's book, The Emerging Democratic Majority , appeared prophetic. Now, Trump's election has exploded this myth completely. Any European conservative wishing to understand the house that Donald built should closely study Patrick Ruffini's outstanding and criminally overlooked 2023 book, Party of the People: Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP . Ruffini is one of the most astute observers of American politics in the business and his book's relevance extends far beyond American shores. In it, he describes how possession of a college degree has become the fundamental class divider in contemporary America. He goes on to outline the evidence detailing how both white and non-white non-college graduates have been shifting towards the Republicans, thereby creating a conservative-minded working-class coalition. The opposing force to this coalition are white college graduates: the only category of voter which has been trending leftwards, and a group which is often drawn to the major metropolitan areas where knowledge industry workers tend to congregate. As Musa Al-Gharbi outlines in his insightful new book, We Have Never Been Woke , these 'symbolic capitalists' are defined by their non-manual work in sectors like academia, journalism, law, and tech. Their income levels and lifestyles set them apart from most of their compatriots, and it is within this group that Woke ideology has come to predominate. ""Wokeness,"" Al-Gharbi writes, ""can be fruitfully understood as the ruling ideology of this increasingly dominant elite formation."" Luckily for Trump's Republicans and similar-minded parties on this side of the Atlantic, working-class voters continue to shun the secular religion preached by their lifestyle liberal overlords. Ruffini's analysis of pre-2024 trends makes all this very clear. Hispanics in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas--a region which straddles the Mexican border and which is traditionally more Latino than Anglo in culture--are the most spectacular example of a community which has abandoned the Democrats and embraced the Republicans. Yet there are plenty of others; Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Colombian-Americans, Venezuelan-Americans and others moving to the GOP. Ruffini outlines many of the reasons for this including: disgust at elite Democrats' embrace of the socialist ideology which has often ruined minority voters' homelands; widespread irritation at Woke terminology like 'Latinx'; and the practical impact of the progressive assault on merit-based admissions in education (which hurts Asian children especially). Patrick Ruffini is not the only writer to spot what is happening. On the Democratic side, the aforementioned John Judis and Ruy Teixeira sounded the alarm in 2023 about the exodus of working-class voters from their party, while pointing the finger of blame at the far-left ideologues who have pushed race-based quotas, open borders, transgenderism, and misguided environmental policies which increase energy costs. It is of great benefit to examine the wealth of social science data emanating from the States in the last decade or more. The combined insights of researchers like Charles Murray ( Coming Apart ), Anne Case and Angus Deaton ( Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism ) and Tim Carney ( Alienated America ) paint a picture of a society which has fractured economically, socially, and culturally. The new socio-economic elite is cut off from 'flyover country' and is incapable of understanding why so much of their country's election night map appears bright red. For many years, the most common explanation for the voting patterns of the white working-class was the easiest one: racism. Liberals living prosperous lives in very multicultural cities on America's east and west coasts often saw the reluctance of many Americans to embrace rapid cultural change (in the form of mass immigration and changing social mores) as something arising from prejudice against minorities. To question any of the changes taking place was to risk being shouted down, smeared or cancelled entirely. In America as in Europe, those on the Right were placed in an impossible situation where the terms of the debate were structured so as to prevent commonly-held views (like a preference for less immigration) from being put forward. That is what makes the nature of Trump's victory so historic. Growing Hispanic, Asian, and African-American support for the Republicans has shattered core assumptions of America's progressives. A politician whose rhetoric is the antithesis of politically correctness ( labelling Kamala Harris as a 'DEI hire,' calling a self-declared Native American politician 'Pocahontas,' etc.) attracting large-scale minority support shows that it is possible to discuss race and immigration, in admittedly inelegant ways, without self-immolating. A whole popular narrative of America's past and future has just been vapourised. Republicans can now survey an electoral map which looks highly favourable to them in the coming years. Longstanding demographic patterns and ongoing immigration means that the United States will become 'majority minority' (meaning that non-Hispanic whites will be less than 50% of the population) in the next 20 years or so , but just as Republicans already dominate 'majority minority' Texas, there is no reason to believe they cannot win national election victories also. The victory of Trump's multi-coloured coalition--all colours united around a flag which is red, white, and blue--points to an optimistic future. What does this mean for European parties on the centre-right? Clearly, a similar ethnic transformation is taking place in Europe. Surveying the demographic data in his 2019 book, Whiteshift , Eric Kaufmann outlines various projections for the future racial make-up of England and Wales which suggest that whites will become a minority in the next century, even if immigration is reduced significantly from current levels. Such an eventuality need not be feared. As Ruffini writes in his book, the ""white majority isn't being replaced; it is being blended into a new multiracial mainstream majority."" This is bad news for both white supremacists and leftist race hustlers whose status in American life depends on amplifying ethnic tensions. But it does not need to be bad news for principled conservatives. Woke ideology, like some of the less admirable aspects of American popular culture, crossed the Atlantic and took root here quickly in recent years. At the heart of this worldview is an emphasis on group status and perceived power inequities between such groups. Even some politicians who were ostensibly on the European Right embraced such thinking wholeheartedly. In 2020, Ireland's Taoiseach Leo Varadkar bemoaned the fact that Ireland's civil service was ""very white,"" while adding that the same problem existed in the Irish police, military, and education sector, and calling for special targets for recruitment of ethnic minorities. Granted, this was a special case. Ireland remains abnormal for the continued domination of a left-liberal worldview which other countries are now abandoning, and Varadkar's Fine Gael are on the Left wing of the European People's Party grouping. Yet similar beliefs could have been expressed across other EPP parties without too many eyebrows being raised. European conservatives should have the strength to oppose all racial quota initiatives in future, while also opposing any efforts to enshrine a self-loathing oikophobia within their educational systems or wider historical narrative. Europe is somewhat deficient when it comes to the civic nationalism and widespread patriotism with which America is blessed. At the same time, the vastly older European nations can rely on bonds of language, customs, and religious heritage. Promoting a greater understanding of these should be at the heart of each country's system for naturalisation of the newcomers and education of the young. Likewise, equality before the law is a treasured principle which may not have developed without Europe's rich intellectual tradition. It needs to be upheld--and that means that proposals for racial discrimination against native born Europeans should be viewed as every bit as immoral as racial discrimination against non-white immigrants or their descendants. Given that Trump's campaign was centred around the need for more secure borders, it should also be clear that Europe's conservatives can be vocal about tightening up Europe's external borders and strengthening their nations' asylum processing and deportation systems without alienating voters from minority backgrounds The progressive elites in capital cities often emphasise the need to maintain a major flow of low-skilled, low-wage immigration on economic grounds. Aside from the question of whether they are right about this socio-economic model--and the recent economic track record in post-Brexit Britain is far from positive--this kind of dependence on foreign labour allows policymakers to ignore the problems which ail the native working-class. A strong case can be made that decreased immigration could force governments to invest more in training and educating people in regions which have often been left behind. History teaches that a more restrictionist approach can help to promote internal social cohesion and progress in a way that both the Left and Right should welcome. David Roediger has noted that America's restrictive immigration policies between the 1920 and 1960s, for instance, coincided with major advances for black Americans, who moved to the industrial cities of the north to fill the gaps in the labour market. Recent developments suggest that America is still succeeding in integrating newcomers, but it needs to be acknowledged that the U.S. enjoys a major advantage given the cultural similarities--particularly relating to religion--between America and the Latin American countries from which so many immigrants originate. Relatively few Muslims are moving to America. Only 4% of immigrants in 2022 were born in the Middle East and North Africa . Being much closer to those regions, Europe attracts far more Muslim immigrants, and it is undeniable that the groups which have proven hardest to integrate in various European countries (Germany's Turks, France's Algerians, Britain's Pakistanis, and so forth) have shared one crucial commonality. Geography is America's friend when it comes to attracting migrants with a similar culture. The same is not true of Europe, and it is time to face that difficult fact. While it is right that race should not be a criterion for determining whether potential immigrants are admitted, politicians should make an unapologetic case for considering the importance of culture and acting accordingly. Aside from cultural questions like immigration, Patrick Ruffini's analysis of the situation in America suggests that a new policy approach should be undertaken to keep working-class voters inside the Republican Party. He proposes steps which would benefit workers without a college education and those on lower wages, like a more expansive vocational education system and a move away from regressive taxation. The death of public debate about working-class concerns in Europe says a great deal about the domination of media, politics, and academia by college-educated progressives. Not only does this mean that some topics are downplayed in public discourse, it also ensures that issues which are of concern to a narrow stratum of society are given excessive consideration. Climate policy is one such example. In their analysis of where the Democrats have gone awry, Judis and Teixeira reference a poll showing that climate change was the sixth biggest issue for college-educated respondents (i.e., the new Democratic base) but only the fourteenth biggest issue for working-class respondents. Those seeking to identify the reason for Trump's broad class appeal should not underestimate the importance of his plan to unleash American oil and gas production. Not only will this create employment opportunities across the country for manual workers, it could also be a key part of reducing the cost-of-living pressures which helped to sink Biden and Harris. A new conservative coalition can be built in Europe. It will certainly not be American conservatism, which is too individualistic and modern to ever be completely reconciled with its more communitarian and ancient European variant. Nevertheless, the lessons from America suggest that an agenda of strong borders, traditional values, national patriotism, affordable energy, and economic opportunity for all can be a recipe for electoral success here, just as it already has been for the next American president.",The European Conservative,2024-12-23T12:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/trump-broadened-the-tent-europe-must-follow-suit/
The Revenge of the Normies: Donald Trump Retakes Washington,"Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C. dawned white, windy, and bitter cold as the city braced for a winter storm and the return of Donald J. Trump. The optimism was palpable; the day felt like a collective catharsis. There were big-bearded men in full camo; Uncle Sam costumes; countless Trump shirts and MAGA hats. One featured Trump in front of the White House: ""Daddy's Home!"" The cheery idolatry was very gauche, somewhat disturbing, and slightly infectious. Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA"" blasted across the crowd. Pro-life activists with the Ohio-based group Created Equal were out with signs featuring abortion victims; the crowd was friendly. ""We're with you!"" one of the red hats called from the crowd. The lineup swarmed with press, and for once, MAGA was eager to talk to them. One teenager wore a garbage bag with a sign reading ""Trash for Trump,"" a jab at President Biden calling Trump voters ""garbage."" Others wore hoodies featuring the blood-red 2024 election map: ""Trump: Better Coverage than Verizon."" Buskers did a brisk trade selling every imaginable form of MAGA swag: commemorative kitsch, shirts reading ""Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President""; posters and flags of Trump's famous post-assassination fist pump; hand-painted portraits of Trump riding an elephant to the White House; even shiny chains with golden Trump heads. The 2024 election was the Revenge of the Normies, and they arrived in droves for souvenirs. The inauguration was moved inside the Capitol due to freezing temperatures, meaning that the 220,000 issued inauguration invites--including mine--were reduced to fancy souvenirs. Watch parties were set up across the city to accommodate the massive influx of MAGA voters flocking into the city, where hotel rates soared to hundreds of dollars per night. (The last indoor inauguration was Ronald Reagan's second in 1985, when temperatures dropped to -14 degrees Celsius.) Early Monday morning, the lines to get into the CapitalOne Arena stretched for over two miles as people tried to get spots for the rally scheduled to replace the cancelled Inaugural Parade. Despite the cold, the crowd was jubilant. We headed to the Hard Rock Cafe next to the Ford Theatre to watch the ceremony. The restaurant was packed, with half a dozen screens livestreaming the events. Inside the Rotunda, the Republicans beamed and the Democrats sulked. The Clintons, Bushes, and Barack Obama were in attendance alongside former vice-presidents Mike Pence and Dan Quayle; behind them sat Javier Milei, the wild-eyed libertarian president of Argentina, who flew in to celebrate the victory of a fellow populist outsider. Tucker Carlson was near the front with his wife Susie, smiling hugely. As the cameras switched to those filing in, the crowd alternated between boos and cheers. CBS briefly interrupted the running commentary on the arriving guests to announce that with 19 minutes left in his presidency, Joe Biden granted unprecedented ""pre-emptive pardons"" to much of his family, including his brothers James and Francis, their wives, and his sister Valerie. The pardon was backdated to the oddly specific date of January 1, 2014. Biden had already handed out blanket pardons to his son Hunter, Anthony Fauci, the entire January 6 Committee, and General Mark Milley. Biden's final days in office have been an orgy of norm violation, including a farcical ""declaration"" that the Equal Rights Amendment, defeated decades ago, is ""the law of the land"" in a bizarre attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution by verbal fiat. Biden and Kamala Harris appeared onscreen to an eruption of heckling. ""At least Joe doesn't know where he is!"" bellowed one fellow to a roar of laughter. Barron Trump towered over Melania, who sported a blue navy coat with a brimmed hat and resembled a feline Mary Poppins. Most amusing were the chastised oligarchs: Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, TikTok's Shou Zi Chew, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, whose latest avatar is that of free speech champion. The flame of power has moved, and the moths have followed. They once used their vast tech empires to prop up the progressive Left; now, they beamed at Donald Trump like defeated tribal chieftains greeting an American Caesar. Time will tell who changes whom. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York offered the first invocation. ""Be still and know that I am God,"" he began. ""Remembering General George Washington on his knees at Valley Forge, recalling Abraham Lincoln at his second inaugural, 'with malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right,' remembering General George Patton's instructions to his soldiers as they began the Battle of the Bulge eight decades ago: 'Pray! Pray when fighting. Pray alone. Pray with others. Pray by night. Pray by day.'"" Rev. Franklin Graham began by turning to Trump: ""Mr. President, the last four years there were times I'm sure you thought it was pretty dark, but look what God has done!"" Kamala Harris visibly grimaced. It reminded me of a moment on the campaign trail, when someone called out ""Jesus is Lord!"" at one of her events. Without missing a beat, Harris shot back: ""Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally!"" This time, however, there was no mistaking it: She was at the right inauguration. The most poignant moment was when JD Vance stepped forward to be sworn in by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He was joined by his wife Usha, looking beautiful in pink cashmere, and her expression radiated pride and adoration. His three young children were ushered in to witness the moment, and the 40-year-old Millennial dad took the oath as his two small sons stood beside him and his little girl sucked her thumb. Vance's story is pure America: from his dysfunctional hillbilly upbringing to the vice-presidency of the United States. I met him less than five years ago at a conference, where he was discussing his memoir. He was beardless, brilliant and hadn't yet declared his senate run. Now, he's a heartbeat (or four years) from the presidency. Donald J. Trump's swearing in completed a political comeback of truly historic proportions. Every institution tried to stop him--and yet he is back. ""The golden age of America begins right now,"" he began. ""From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation. And we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer."" As Biden and Harris looked grimly on, Trump swore that ""vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end."" Then, he addressed the gathered elites to their faces: As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, the radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens. While the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair, we now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalog of catastrophic events abroad. Half the room rose in raucous applause; the crowd at the cafe followed suit. The cheers continued as Trump said he would declare the border crisis a national emergency and start deportations; that a task force would begin work to drive down inflation; that the Green New Deal would be abolished; that he wanted to take back the Panama Canal. The loudest applause came when Trump claimed a divine calling: ""Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then, and believe even more so now, that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again."" Harris seemed to have swallowed a lemon whole. Her husband, girlboss feminist Doug Emhoff, looked like he'd happily lean in front of a bullet. Trump, to his credit, did amend this slightly later in his speech, noting: ""We will not forget our country. We will not forget our Constitution. And we will not forget our God."" Cynics will call it lip service, and fair enough. But as Franklin Graham stated: ""We know that America can never be great again if we turn our backs on [God]."" Amen to that. In a moment that perfectly showcased the absurdity of the progressive elites and of our times, Trump made a declaration that all but the last two presidents would have considered ludicrously obvious. ""From today forward, it will be the policy of the United States to recognize that there are only two genders: male and female,"" he said. There was a standing ovation; the Democrats, again, remained rooted to their seats. The crowd at the CapitalOne Arena went wild. Outside, I saw protestors hoisting ""Trans Rights are Human Rights!"" signs; for the first time in four years, they are out in the cold. Biden gave them everything. Trump rolled it all back with a single executive order recognizing only two sexes less than an hour after returning to the White House that evening. The Democrats insist that they are the defender of ""norms,"" but they have spent two administrations making war on fundamental biological realities. It is ridiculous that Donald Trump had to affirm that there are only two sexes. But it was the Democrats, not Trump, who made it necessary. This is a welcome return to sanity. After the ceremony, the Trumps bid farewell to the Bidens outside the Capitol. Joe and Jill boarded the helicopter, and I watched Marine One growl past the window. People stopped in the streets to gaze upwards and cheered as the helicopter bore the Bidens out of Washington and public life. Biden was elected to the Senate 53 years ago at age 29; he departs at age 82 in a flurry of scummy pardons and plagued by media reports of his failing faculties. Trump joined the crowd of 20,000 at the arena, gave one of his signature rambling, trash-talking speeches, and then signed a stack of executive orders, beginning with an omnibus repeal of 78 Biden executive orders and an order prohibiting government censorship and protecting freedom of speech. I headed through a roadblock to Pennsylvania Avenue and watched Trump's motorcade drive to the White House as the streets, already clogged with Humvees and soldiers, began to fill up with men and women in tuxedos and fancy dresses heading to the Inaugural balls. Across Washington, a massive federal bureaucracy awaits the Trump revolution, which he has vowed to deliver with speed and none of the chaos that characterized his first term. He is prepared to dominate a government filled with people who actively attempted to sabotage him with a sweeping mandate, a young, ambitious vice-president, and an organized army at his back. It is a new era in America. You can feel it in this city--in both the jubilation of the MAGA crowds and the foreboding that permeates the federal buildings of concrete and marble squatting in the snow.",The European Conservative,2025-01-21T15:06:16,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-revenge-of-the-people-donald-trump-retakes-washington/
"Institutions, not Values: Salvaging Modern Britain","""Britain is about values, not institutions,"" the unelected and never re-elected Prime Minister Gordon Brown was fond of saying during his three years as head of Her Majesty's government. (Under Kier Starmer, I now look back with affection to such years.) To think that Britain is about values rather than institutions is to get things completely the wrong way round. The fact that so-called conservatives now go around talking incessantly about values is illustrative of the fact that their minds have been considerably taken possession of by the ideological prejudices among which the Left are ordinarily at home. It is precisely the conservative proficiency for calling the populace back to the actual and the concrete, over the ideational and ideological, that gave them their importance in the political arena, which they have now all but entirely lost. Having forgotten that Britain is about institutions, rather than values, we have all entered the relentless battleground of ideological squabbling that characterises modern social discourse, and it's likely that there is no way out. Worse still, having lost a sense of the primacy of the institutions, whatever might have been a coherent conservatism of the Anglo kind is fast morphing--especially among the young--into a new ethno-nationalism in a final attempt to grab hold of something concrete over the passion-charged abstractions that are otherwise constantly flung about. If we don't recover a sense of the primacy of the institutions, and do so very quickly, I fear that all moral and political discourse of the future will be characterised by a competition to root arguments in the concrete in the most nightmarish ways. What we might be heading towards is the clash of two undefined worldviews, a Leftist worldview based on unending moral transgression as emancipation from a spectral white supremacist colonial patriarchy, and a Rightist worldview based on a Darwinian racial hierarchy that's terrified of immigration because of what it might do to genetic purity, prefrontal cortex size, and average national IQ. And as these two grisly groups have it out, mostly online and progressively in the public square, the actual country in which we live will quietly become a desolate Islamist slum. Thereafter, perhaps in only a decade or less, tweedy Englishmen will hide out in the Shropshire Hills or the Wye Valley wondering what the hell just happened to their homeland while everyone was busy quarrelling about values. What Britain in particular desperately needs is a public conversation--coinciding with public action--not about values but the actual health and functioning of its institutions. Reflecting upon his father's working-class patriotism at the end of England: An Elegy , Roger Scruton wrote that his father ""knew in his heart that England was not a nation or an empire or an enterprise but a country, whose law was the law of the land."" Certainly, the ancient common law of England, embodied in a network of courts, dependent on a guild system of legal inns, is probably the most important example of this land being one of institutions. But it is a land of institutions all the way down--from the Monarchy, the Houses of Parliament, and the Established Church, through the Royal Navy and the regiments of the Army, the police forces, and the Royal postal service, all the way to those most local and organically emerging institutions like local clubs for hobbyists and the thatched pub on the street corner. England in particular and the United Kingdom in general is a land in which a certain way of life is represented in concrete institutions. And a way of life is an initiatory pathway into an existent social organism, it is not a hodgepodge of 'values.' It is precisely the noxious values-speak of centralising commissars, like Gordon Brown for example, that has turned the monarchy into a pitiable celebrity family, the Church into a juggernaut of anti-Christian Marxist progressivism, Parliament into a competing Church of the religion of DEI, and the Armed Forces into the military wing of glob-homo, while the police forces have morphed from Peelite uniformed civilians into the secret Watch who covertly monitor thought-crime and appear in the dead of night to punish Tweeters. There is a reason why it has been beaten into us that everything is about values, not institutions: because if everything is about values, then progressives--who naturally treat the ideological as more real than the actual--will always win. Institutions, not values, are what render explicit and official what is otherwise a received and settled way of life. No Englishman ever said he would die for British values. He said he would die for King and Country. Since we have insisted that everything is about values, no Englishman will die for anything, and now the government is pressing--with a view to passing--new laws so that if Englishmen won't die for a cause, they can at least be killed. Britain probably has under a decade before it entirely slips into the void, and bringing it back from the brink of annihilation where it is presently--if indeed that's now possible--will not be achieved by values-speak. Modern Brits should not fixate on the rise of sundry skin pigments among them or names that not long ago would have seemed exotic--even if such things have contributed to the disruption of their particular way of life. What Brits should be worried about is the eclipsing of that way of life, which was always expressed in its institutions, whose existence in turn protected and conserved that way of life. What we have now is not a way of life, but many parallel ways of life--largely caused by implementing the 'values' of multiculturalism and diversity--which the institutions have been co-opted into protecting. The institutions, therefore, are corrupted and must be brought back to a state of health, that they may achieve their purpose, namely conserving the way of life that brought them into being. The visible transformation of Britain's ancient cities and towns into settlements for alien populations is bad enough. To walk down an English high street and hear every language and accent except those that belong to these isles is now very common. But that is nothing compared to the much darker side of this deconstruction of our way of life: English girls offered up by our corrupted institutions to the insatiable appetites of conquering hordes of Moguls. If anything should awaken the people of these isles from their slumber of indolence and defeatism, it should be the torture and rape of their daughters. And if that's not sufficient to stir them to action in defence of their way of life--which begins and ends with the recapture of their institutions--then this ancient kingdom deserves its bleak future. 'Values' are not going to salvage the United Kingdom, which--as I say--on its current trajectory probably has under a decade left before it entirely slips into the abyss. The reform and recovery of our institutions is what is desperately needed, and that means filling them with good men and women who have not only inducted themselves into our way of life, but who will do all they can to protect that way of life. That all means, of course, a future with a very, very different kind of elite.",The European Conservative,2025-02-01T08:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/institutions-not-values-salvaging-modern-britain/
Franco Lives!,"In Total Recall , the 1990 hit film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone, a liberation movement confronts tyranny on the planet Mars. The leader of the rebels, Quato, is completely inaccessible to the authorities, who watch in frustration as his legend grows and more and more walls are painted with the phrase ""Quato lives."" The truth is that the rebel leader may or may not be alive, but it doesn't matter because he has become a myth. In fact, Quato dies, but Arnold saves the day and frees Mars from oppression. I'm not sure if Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in his infinite narcissism, imagines himself as a kind of Schwarzenegger single-handedly defeating the Francoist hordes trying to rob us of our right to a dead-end job, to live in a shared apartment until retirement, or to have to emigrate because starting a business here is impossible, but like the protagonist of Total Recall , he is forging a myth. Francisco Franco died in bed on November 20, 1975, almost 50 years ago, but thanks to Sanchez and his Socialist Party acolytes, he is more alive than ever. Five years ago, in October 2019, the government exhumed Franco's body from the Valley of the Fallen (later doing the same with the Falange founder Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera) and reburied it in the municipal cemetery of Mingorrubio-El Pardo, where he now rests alongside his wife, Carmen Polo; curiously, this was the General's wish. Since then, the government of Pedro Sanchez has relentlessly used Franco as a joker to deflect attention from the countless corruption scandals in his party, while accusations of Francoism or proposals to ""resignify"" the Valley of the Fallen (renamed the Valley of Cuelgamuros by the Law of Democratic Memory) have been deployed with astonishing ease. The Valley has been the object of a furious campaign by the most radical leftists, who seem intent on tearing down the largest cross in the world--some things never change. Sanchez himself was photographed in April surrounded by skulls at one of the exhumations in the Valley, where more than 30,000 fallen from both sides of the Civil War are buried. But as with everything this government does, one must always expect worse. ""Fascism, which we thought we had left behind, is already the third political force in Europe,"" Pedro Sanchez condemned with gravity when he announced the hundred--yes, the hundred--actions to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Franco's death. Not even the most pro-Franco people have talked so much about the past. In an anti-Franco rally held on January 8th at the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid, in the presence of PSOE and Socialist ministers, Sanchez presented Francoism as a dark age of intolerance, pointing out that today, the Spanish GDP per capita is twice what it was in 1975, and that the average income has more than doubled, rising from EUR15,000 to EUR31,000. This is, of course, a half-truth, because Sanchez conveniently ignores the fact that public debt has multiplied over the past fifty years, meaning that, in reality, Spaniards are poorer than before. But the leftist narrative does not care about the data (which, as we all know, are extreme right-wing), no, only the message matters: Fascism is back; only Sanchez can save us. Stirring up the ghosts of the past may pay off, but it does not seem to resonate with young people. According to a Center for Sociological Research (CIS) survey, in the last European elections, VOX was the party with the highest support among young first-time voters, and, to the surprise of many, more and more young people have lost their fear of openly declaring themselves right-wing. There are also an increasing number of reports of left-wing teachers being outraged by the Francoist sympathies of their students. This is not really an ideological issue; what is happening is that young people, fed up with progressive indoctrination, have discovered that mentioning Franco provokes the same reaction from their teachers as holy water provokes from vampires. For these reasons, the celebrations of Franco's death will include contests, exhibitions, comics, and games for the youngest. There will even be ""itinerant escape rooms"" (Francoist zombies?). The strategy of confrontation has deep roots in the Spanish Left, and the truth is that it has been successful in mobilizing its electorate by raising the spectre of the return of fascism or the comeback of Franco. However, Pedro Sanchez' obsession with Franco and everything tied to him is sparking a renewed interest in the past that could backfire on a Left that has much to hide about its role in the Civil War and dictatorship. As shrewd politicians in the worst sense, they are blinded by short-term gains, failing to see the long-term consequences of all this agitational propaganda. Sanchez, who undoubtedly saw himself as Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon, should heed the danger of creating a myth and recall the slave who accompanied the victorious generals in their triumphal entry into Rome, constantly whispering: ""Remember that you are mortal."" Yes, Pedro, remember that you, too, will pass away like everyone else--but myths never die.",The European Conservative,2025-01-19T14:29:30,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/franco-lives/
Over Dead Bodies—Europe’s Endless History Wars,"Yesterday, Italy commemorated the anniversary of the Foibe massacres, the killing of civilians of Italian ethnicity by Yugoslav partisans at the end of WWII in retribution for the crimes committed by Italian fascists. The commemoration was overshadowed by the vandalising of the Basovizza monument to the victims , committed on the eve of the national memorial day called 'Il Giorno de Ricordo', the Day of Remembrance. Unknown perpetrators sprayed the graffiti "" Trieste is ours. Death to fascism, freedom to the people "" on the pedestal of the monument on Sunday. The slogans were painted over personally by the mayor of Trieste, Roberto Dipiazza, on the same day. Prime Minister Meloni strongly condemned the incident in a statement , describing it as ""trampling on the memory of the martyrs."" What happened in Basovizza more than 80 years ago was part of a larger wave of repression unleashed on ethnic Italians in territories controlled by alternating powers before and during the war. In two separate waves of terror, first in September 1943 and then in 1945, all those viewed as enemies of the new revolutionary order to be instituted in Venezia-Giulia, Istria, and Dalmatia were targeted following the defeat of Nazi-fascism. Large swathes of the Italian population were expelled, deported, locked up in concentration camps, starved or simply killed in the spirit of 'collective guilt.' The perhaps most brutal retribution was the murdering of thousands in the Trieste area, with the bodies of the victims thrown into the sinkholes (many still alive, according to testimonies), then used as mineshafts, on Trieste's Karst Plateau. The national memorial day was instituted in 2004 by the second Berlusconi government. What might seem like a non-controversial gesture of remembrance for the victims of illegal reprisals is still at the centre of significant controversy, both in Italy and in the post-Yugoslav states of Slovenia and Croatia. As with many other instances of what are believed to be settled narratives of historical events, reminders that what happened decades or centuries ago was not necessarily black and white are met with scepticism, irritation, or outright hostility. A classic example is how the memorial day and its commemoration are framed by the mainstream press. Balkan Insights ' most recent coverage is typical in this respect. Their February 9th headline reads ""How Italy's Government Polices Teaching of 'Foibe' Massacres"". Clearly, that was the most important thing the publication felt compelled to share, stressing that ""While historians from the three countries mainly affected by the massacres--Croatia, Slovenia and Italy--agree on every major aspect, right-wing Italian politicians dismiss the historical analysis and have been pushing nationalistic narratives to fire up their voters and appeal to far-right movements."" Translation: history (like science in general) is settled, stop overblowing what happened, forget it, shut up, and sit down. The expulsion of more than 14 million (!) Germans from their homes in various parts of Europe, including Yugoslavia, following the Second World War, with nearly two million ethnic Germans being deported to forced labour in the Soviet Union as ""reparations in kind"" is a little-publicized fact of history. Few are aware to this day that more than two million ethnic Germans perished as a result of their expulsion , either as victims of lethal violence or as a consequence of exposure, hunger and disease. The ""my victims are the only victims"" attitude that characterizes a large part of the so-called antifascist Left continues to poison Europe, Central and Eastern Europe in particular. This is most salient in post-Communist countries where more than forty years of Soviet-type, anti-nationalist historiography have been quite successful in making public discourse exclusively conductible around the fascist versus anti-fascist dichotomy. This mindset is reflected in the defacing of the Basovizza monument, too. There is the nationalist-chauvinist element as well (""Trieste is ours""). Trieste has seen the kind of changing of sovereigns that is only rivalled by the once-Hungarian regions of Transcarpathia. The town used to be under Venetian and then under Habsburg rule for centuries, and was at one point called the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy's Gate to the Sea. It has always had an ethnically diverse population, the majority of which, however, has consistently been Italian. The claim to Trieste by the (presumably) Slovenian defacer therefore is not very well-founded. But the more troubling part of the inscription is the second part. Why would commemorating the victims of unlawful reprisals in any way undermine the legitimate fight against Italian fascism and German Nazism? Why would paying respect to the victims, whose only guilt was being Italian, threaten the morally fundamental tenet that Nazism and fascism were wrong and the peoples of the countries and regions occupied by Mussolini's and Hitler's armies needed to be liberated? Europe is a continent of many nations, all with distinct histories, national identities, languages, cultures, and heritage. It is inevitable that the way history is officially narrated will differ from country to country, given the differing perspectives and points of view of those telling the stories. However, for the sake of social peace, cohesion, and the ultimate reconciliation of European nations, historical truth must be unearthed, shared, respected, and taught. Victims are victims, and perpetrators are perpetrators, and they should be recognized as such.",The European Conservative,2025-02-11T16:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/over-dead-bodies-europes-endless-history-wars/
Don’t Mention Islamism: Deflection and Moral Posturing Rule in Germany,"It was the most brutal attack on a trade union event in the history of post-war Germany. Last Thursday, just days before the general election, a man drove a car into a group of striking members of the service workers' union Verdi in Munich. The attack has so far claimed the lives of a mother and her two-year-old daughter, and injured at least 30 others. The suspect is a 24-year-old Afghan national who arrived in Germany eight years ago as an unaccompanied minor and was subsequently granted residence status. According to police reports, he had previously shared Islamist content on social media. Upon his arrest, he shouted ""Allahu akbar"", leading authorities to classify the incident as ""most likely"" Islamist-motivated . Anger is surely the right response to such a barbaric attack on workers and their families who were exercising their democratic right to campaign for better working conditions. Yet, almost immediately after the incident made headlines, the Verdi leadership issued a statement condemning any ""misplaced passion"" that might arise from the act: ""We stand for solidarity and togetherness. In its darkest hour, ver.di defends itself against the attack on ver.di colleagues during a token strike in Munich being used for division, hatred and incitement,"" the statement said. A statement by Frank Werneke , the Verdi leader, which carefully avoided any mention of the word 'Islamism', was similarly muddled. This is no coincidence. Werneke is a member of the ruling SPD, and the brutal attack has intensified pressure on Germany's coalition government, once again exposing critical failures in security and the asylum system. Just days earlier, following another deadly attack by an Afghan asylum seeker that claimed the lives of a toddler and a man, Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) himself admitted being ""fed up with such acts of violence happening here every few weeks."" Yet now, government allies like Werneke appear determined to silence legitimate concerns, suggesting that anyone who points to specific migration issues is somehow exploiting tragedy. The public messaging, both by the union and sectors of the media , quickly emphasized that the murdered trade unionist, an engineer, had a ""migration background"" herself (having arrived in Germany at age four from Algeria) and that her family requested ""restraint,"" noting her advocacy for tolerance. All this manoeuvring is deeply disingenuous. It shouldn't matter whether the victims have a migrant background or not--this distraction misses the fundamental point. It's not about identity; it's about the basic duty of the state to protect all its citizens. In truth, even before last Thursday, migration had become the dominant and most controversial election issue. The growing pressure on the government was reflected in its announcement, after the Aschaffenburg incident , that it would speed up deportations and extend the border controls introduced last September for another six months. Polling suggests these measures have failed to restore public confidence. The ruling SPD now struggles below 15% , battling its coalition partner, the Greens, merely for third place. The public's distrust of the government on migration issues isn't hard to comprehend. The reactions to this latest attack have followed a predictable and revealing pattern: despite expressions of shock after each incident, there's always a coordinated effort from establishment voices to control the public narrative and deflect criticism of migration policies. Their primary concern appears to be containing populist pressure rather than honestly and seriously addressing the underlying issues that fuel it. For many weeks now, pro-government demonstrations have swept through German cities, directed against the right-populist AfD, and campaigning to exclude both the party and its voters from government participation. There's a stark and dark irony in the fact that, just days before Thursday's violence, some 250,000 people gathered at nearly the identical location in Munich, rallying for the ""democratic firewall"" against the AfD under the slogan ""Democracy needs you."" Verdi was prominently among the organizers supporting this demonstration, which was triggered after Friedrich Merz (CDU), the opposition leader, introduced bills in Parliament to strengthen immigration controls. Merz's initiative was sharply attacked by the government, with Scholz declaring, ""He can't be trusted "" and the SPD parliamentary group leader hysterically claiming that Merz had ""opened the gates to hell "". Maintaining the firewall has become the main election message of the government since then. There should be no doubt in most voters' minds that these demonstrations are essentially pro-government rallies. An investigation by the German newspaper Die Welt revealed that every single NGO mobilizing the demonstrators had received either direct or indirect funding from government ministries--specifically from the Family Ministry under Lisa Paus (Greens), the Interior Ministry under Nancy Faeser (SPD), or Chancellor Olaf Scholz's own office. Verdi, which represents workers in the public sector, media, health, and finance is also closely linked to the Social Democratic (SPD) and Green or Left parties. Mobilising for the demonstrations, its website states: ""ver.di calls for resistance against the AfD. We stand against the enemies of democracy. We are the firewall"". The fact that the demonstrations continued this weekend shows the extent of the fear on the pro-establishment side. This fear was blatantly expressed a few weeks ago, by one of the organisers, a spokeswoman for a group called Omas Gegen Rechts (Grannies Against the Right): ""Never before has the danger been so great that our democratic achievements and thus the basis of our social coexistence could be endangered by new majorities in the Bundestag,"" she said. There were moments of silence for the victims at last this weekend's demonstrations, but combined with the predictable message that there must be no hate even after Munich. A trade union spokeswoman at the Berlin rally said: ""They have the hate, we have the attitude."" Of course, she was not referring to the hatred of the Islamist attacker, but to the alleged hatred of those who would now 'exploit' the incident. It would be wrong to believe that these rallies have no impact. Their aim is to stifle crucial debates on asylum, migration, and Islamism--topics that desperately need open examination. The establishment's strategy of deflection and moral posturing--showing ""attitude"" as the activists call it--betrays a deep distrust of voters' capacity to engage with complex issues. It also reveals a fundamental contempt for ordinary citizens, treating them as potential extremists who must be monitored and managed lest they transform into ""crazy racists."" This Sunday's election will reveal what voters think of all this.",The European Conservative,2025-02-17T18:51:50,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/dont-mention-islamism-deflection-and-moral-posturing-rule-in-germany/
Erdogan’s Hour of Triumph,"Even the most audacious of analysts would have refrained from betting on such a turn of events. Syrian President Bashar al Assad had long seemed triumphant, his seat secure. After years of a brutal civil war that had once seen him close to defeat, Russia's military intervention, in 2015, turned the tide and enabled Assad to retake, in a series of grueling campaigns, the majority of his devastated nation. Yet when his power appeared impregnable, it simply melted away. When the Al Qaeda-led militants--who had until then controlled only a tiny piece of northern Syria--decided to go on the offensive, in late November, Assad's Army imploded. There was barely any resistance as thousands of Islamist rebels marched on Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. A week later, they were in Damascus, and President Assad, his military crushed, was boarding a plane to Moscow. It was a surreal sight. If there are indeed weeks where decades happen, then the Middle East just witnessed one of them. At the time of his ouster, the Syrian President was busy trying to reduce his dependence on Iran: he was normalising ties not only with the Gulf Monarchies but even with some European states-- Giorgia Meloni's Italy chief among them. Iranian wrath at these developments may have played a significant role in Assad's political demise. The wheel of history has now moved--and not necessarily for the better. While few would claim that Ba'athist Syria was a haven of liberty, the saner among us will agree that the country's prospects under Islamist rule are hardly merrier. The future seems particularly agonising for Syria's Christians. While professed by well over 10% of the population just a decade ago, Christianity in the country faces extermination under the yoke of totalitarian Salafism. When Syria's northern capital fell, the Catholic Bishop of Homs, Jacques Mourad, depressingly announced ""the end of the great history of Christians in Aleppo."" His warning is likely now just as pertinent for the rest of Syria, a country inhabited by Christian communities still speaking and praying in Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ. Even as the media toils to whitewash the reputation of Syria's 'diversity-friendly jihadists,, the truth is that the nation, a bastion of civilisation and sophistication for millenia, will henceforth be ruled by a coalition of some of the world's vilest fanatics. The new strongman, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, is more than a tad unsavory: nominated as leader of the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda by no less than Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the defunct 'caliph' of ISIS, he once reported directly to 9/11 mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri. To now presume that this is the man who will transform Syria into a multiparty, liberal democracy marks a disgraceful new height in the spectacular gullibility of the Western commentariat. Instead, what seems likely is that the unity and viability of the Syrian state has finally been ravaged for good. The myriad Jihadist militias that now stand triumphant hate each other almost as much as they once loathed Assad and, in the new vacuum, will carve up Syria amongst themselves. Europe will have to contend with a dystopian constellation of tiny Islamist bantustans in a state of permanent bellicosity. As a vortex of violence and chaos, it seems inevitable that Syria, like Afghanistan twenty years ago, will now become a global haven of terror--all this a mere 100 kilometres away from Cyprus, an EU member state. Indeed, it has only been days since Assad's ouster and the ISIS flag is already flying in Latakia, Jihadist propaganda is broadcast on state TV , terrorist gangs kill people with impunity , Christian girls are forbidden from leaving their homes without male company, and the country's new prime minister is busy formalising a Taliban-like Shahada flag as the nation's new symbol. It won't get any better from here. What has also been irrevocably transformed is the Middle Eastern balance of power. Following the horrifying attacks of October 7th 2023 by Palestinian terror organisation Hamas, tensions between Israel and Iran escalated to a bitter, if indirect, clash for regional supremacy. With Hamas crushed, Hezbollah in tatters, and Bashar al Assad deposed, Israel stands victorious--and Iran comprehensively defanged. As recently as two years ago, Tehran seemed to be well on its way towards achieving hegemon status between the Mediterranean and the Indus. Those dreams are now a smoldering ruin. Iran will find it difficult to project power further than Iraq or Yemen. For the Mullahs, it is a strategic disaster that leaves the regime weakened--not just externally, but internally as well. The collapse of Iran's ambitions might be good news for Israel's Prime Minister, Bibi Netanyahu. But it is Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan that stands to gain the most in the new Middle East. It isn't merely that the implosion of the Syrian regime marks the Turkish President's complete triumph over his old nemesis, Assad. More profoundly--and here begin Israel's problems--it brings Turkey to its strongest point since the 18th century. With Assad no longer serving as an obstacle to his neo-Ottoman project, the Turkish leader might soon have his minions on the Israeli border. His power will extend from the Golan to the Black Sea, and from Libya--where Ankara's proxies rule over Tripoli--to Baku and the Caspian. Encouraged by his previous successes in Armenia, he will press for more--Turkey desires a land border with its Azerbaijani ally, and there isn't much to stop it. With Syria, Northern Cyprus, and Libya as obedient beylerbeyliks , Erdogan now enjoys immense power over the Eastern Mediterranean. This ascendant, assertive Turkey is dreaming ever higher, as plans for the 50,000-ton MUGEM aircraft carrier amply make evident . Ankara's thirst for geopolitical grandeur is enabled by solid material foundations: a large economy that the World Bank evaluates as only marginally smaller than Britain's or Italy's; a sophisticated industry whose military drones have impressed the world in Ukraine, Armenia, and elsewhere; NATO's second largest armed forces; and a large, youthful population numbering almost 90 million. At the helm of a Sunni power, Erdogan finds it much easier than Shia Iran to project power--soft and hard--among the estimated 85 to 90% of global Muslims who are also Sunni. Turkey is no longer 'the sick man of Europe,' as it was once derisively known. With Tehran all but expelled from the Levant, it is Turkey and Israel that remain as the preeminent centres of power. The rivalry between them will likely now be the dominant factor of regional life. How will these developments affect the broader region--and what implications will they have for the world? The new Israeli-Turkish rivalry will determine both nations' broader geopolitical strategies, as well as those of regional and extra-regional players. As it had done against Iran, Israel will court the Arabs and try to woo them away from Erdogan's embrace. Although they all subscribe to rigoristic forms of Sunni Islam, the Gulf Arabs fear the reestablishment of Turkish dominance and deplore Turkey's sponsorship of the anti-monarchical, revolution-loving Muslim Brotherhood. Such fears, if intelligently exploited by Israeli strategists, might make Turkey's assertion of influence considerably more difficult--and continue to encourage an Arab-Israeli rapprochement in the spirit of the 2020 Abraham Accords. The return of President Trump to the White House--together with an expected improvement of U.S.-Israeli relations, much damaged during the Biden era--will likely see America take a strong stance against Turkey's rising regional influence. As Tel Aviv and Ankara trade blows in their quest for supremacy, so will ties between Turkey and the U.S. weaken. This will prove a substantial challenge to Turkey's NATO ties. Hopes that U.S. arms and technology transfers--namely, for instance, sales of F-35 stealth jets long desired by the Turks --can placate Ankara seem shallow and ignore how the upcoming Turkish-American rift is systemically-driven, and thus unavoidable. In the meantime, U.S.-Israeli--and, as we have seen, possibly Arab--alignment against Turkish interests will lead Erdogan to take an even more anti-Western direction than he has done thus far. Few should be surprised if, although they were recently adversaries in Syria, Turks, Russians, and Iranians now see their interests better served by a grand partnership. Indeed, Moscow has a strong desire to keep its military bases in Syria--the naval facility in Tartus and the air base in Hmeimim, both close to the coast. It can only do so with Erdogan's good will--either through pressure on the new regime in Damascus or, more dangerously, by fomenting Alawite separatism and reestablishing the old 'Alawite state' as a Russian protectorate in the Mediterranean. Iran's Ayatollahs are eager to preserve a direct land route to their allies in Lebanon, Hezbollah--they, too, now need the Turks more than ever. Turkey, meanwhile, will inevitably turn to Russian weapon deliveries as U.S. reluctance to arm it grows. Beyond their shared grievances, these three powers will not find it difficult to discover fields of cooperation, particularly now that their main point of friction--the fate of Syria--has been closed. Just as Russia continues to benefit from Iranian drone technologies for its war in Ukraine, so too are the Iranians eager to modernise their air forces with cutting-edge Russian Su-35s, the first of which have now started to arrive in the Islamic Republic. Where there are common interests, there will be common strategies. None should underestimate the potential of this budding partnership. Western strategists and Israel face a daunting task. But it should not be forgotten that the new, dangerous, and developing coalition is defined by its common opposition to the West rather than by any shared vision. A combination of strength and smart diplomacy--limiting the incentives for these powers to cooperate amongst themselves, while all the time highlighting their differences--offers the West ample opportunities to diminish and overcome the threat. One hopes our leaders can navigate the tricky waters ahead.",The European Conservative,2024-12-19T20:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/erdogans-hour-of-triumph/
"Boris Johnson, The Man Who Lost the World","As a child, Boris Johnson dreamed of being crowned 'king of the world.' Barring a run at the American presidency, to which he was entitled as a dual national--the closest he could come was to hold the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. His lifetime's ambition was realised in July 2019--and just 3 short years later, the sun had set over a reign remarkable for its tragic waste of terrific potential. Boris Johnson is, contrary to his bumbling persona, an artful politician. Behind the mop of hair, the ill-fitting suits, and the gaffes is concealed a Machiavellian operator. As the Conservative MP for Henley, one of Britain's richest towns, Johnson was a dyed-in-the-wool liberal Tory. Johnson spent the early 2000s attacking the NHS and failing to attend over half of the votes in the House of Commons while moonlighting as editor of The Spectator . He described his parliamentary speeches as ""crap,"" missed meetings of the Standing Committee to which he had been appointed, and was sacked from the Shadow Cabinet for lying about having an extra-marital affair. Despite a dismal performance in Westminster, Boris was winning fans in the country. When he wasn't embrangled in affairs, alleged or otherwise, he was playing the clown. Highlights included his rugby tackling of former Manchester City player Maurizio Gaudino at a charity football match and comments linking Papua New Guinea to ""cannibalism and chief killing."" He appeared on and presented his own television shows, wrote books, and published endless copy--sometimes pseudonymously and almost always controversially. His regular guest hosting of the then-popular topical panel show Have I Got News For You made Boris a household name. Boris' popularity with the general public was seen as a threat by his erstwhile schoolmate and then Conservative party opposition leader David Cameron. In 2007 Cameron endorsed Boris' run for the mayoralty, an election bid that looked like a charge into the valley of death. The high profile and public defeat to follow would decommission the blonde bombshell for good. Boris rode up the line to death with aplomb, content to take on the popular incumbent Labour mayor Ken Livingstone. But Boris, like Monty Python's Black Knight, doesn't go down easily. He fought the 2008 mayoral campaign promising to build 100,000 affordable homes a year, to reduce crime, and to make the functioning of City Hall more transparent. He pledged to launch a review into awarding amnesty to 400,000 illegal immigrants living in London. He pledged to slash knife crime. And he won the election. Come 2012, the Conservative mayor was up for re-election. By now, his party was in government and taking a drubbing in the polls. Public opinion was low thanks to David Cameron's austerity programme. A back-to-work scheme plagued by ineptitude and idiocy saw the terminally ill all but dragged into employment. London had suffered its worst riots in decades after the police shot dead a gun-wielding criminal. Despite it all, Boris won again, beating Ken Livingstone and 5 other opponents with 51.5% of the vote. Boris was flying high--even before the London Olympics boosted him into orbit. At a concert in Hyde Park held to celebrate the arrival of the Olympic torch in the capital, Boris gave a speech better than any he had delivered before or since. He told a swollen crowd that ""The excitement is growing so much I think the Geiger counter of Olympo-mania is going to go zoink off the scale!"" He took aim at then American presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who had disparaged London's Olympics. Boris channelled the nascent anti-Americanism of the English into a great thundering chorus of vim. ""I heard there's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready. Are we ready?"" The assembled crowd burst into rapturous cheers, which got impossibly louder as the mayor predicted ""We're going to win more bronze, silver, and gold medals than you'd need to bail out Greece and Spain together!"" Boris was again to Parliament for the London constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the surprise Conservative election victory of 2015. Returned to the halls of power he could play courtier to King Cameron, all the while eyeing the PM's throne. His chance to snatch the crown would come with the Brexit referendum of 2016. David Cameron never wanted a referendum on Brexit. He had assumed, like everybody else, that the Conservative's best-case election result would be a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. He knew they would veto the referendum, killing it forever. But the promise, he calculated, would have won him enough UKIP votes to maintain his grip on power. Unexpectedly, the Conservatives won a majority in the House of Commons. Every mainstream political party queued up to support the Remain campaign. Virtually every trade union, corporation, business consortium, lobbying group and 'expert' joined the politicians in opposition to exiting the European Union. But Boris Johnson, who had once written that Brexit would mean ""a worrying loss of influence"" for the UK, jumped headfirst into the Brexit campaign and assumed the role of its de facto leader. What makes somebody likeable? It's likely ineffable, but a sign of it is the feeling you get when you're with him, hear from him, or even hear about him. If a person has made a positive impression on you in the past, you'll be biased in favour of him. The positive associations you have with a person becomes instinctual over time, and that instinct can make invisible any of the liked person's failings and indiscretions. The vast majority of Britons might not have remembered Boris's famous Whiff Whaff speech, his popular Conservative Party conference appearances, or even quite what he said on Have I Got News For You or Top Gear . Most Britons might have forgotten his award-winning poem declaring that President Erdogan was a ""wanker."" But they associate him with the feelings they themselves had when hearing these. And when he resurfaced to lead the Brexit campaign, he was able to draw on the general British goodwill that he had cultivated. Pundits have spent years variously explaining and excusing the defeat of the Remain campaign. They have blamed Russian influence, Cambridge Analytica, Rupert Murdoch, and even a big red bus. Barring Putin's hand, all of the bogeymen played their parts. But fundamentally it was a rebellion of the left-behind, a rejection of unabashed globalism and a backlash against capital 'P' Progress that led to the referendum's result. And the energy that led to this rebellion needed a figure to corral around--that was Boris. Thanks to a cock up by the BBC, Boris Johnson was called upon to give the closing speech at its televised Great EU Debate. The Leave side had delivered the opening remarks of the debate, so the Remain side was set to conclude. But in error, the spotlight was shone on Britain's luckiest politician. Backstage, phones began buzzing like a swarm of angry hornets, as text messages flew in from the Remain campaign, containing lots of four-letter words. But it was too late, Boris was on his feet and marching into history . His rousing final remarks conclude with the following hopeful message: ""If we vote leave and take back control, I believe that this Thursday can be our country's independence day."" The crowd shot to their feet in ovation. The debate moderator David Dimbleby appealed for calm as the crowd began to chant ""Boris! Boris! Boris!"" Prime Minister David Cameron had backed the Remain campaign to the hilt. He had all but said World War III would erupt if Brexit were to happen, so when Leave emerged victorious, he found his political position untenable. He announced his resignation early in the morning, just hours after the result became clear. The ball had come loose from the back of the scrum, just as Boris had always hoped it might. But with the try line in sight and the opposition in disarray, his erstwhile ally Michael Gove hooked his ankle from behind. The great blonde mop crashed into the ground, and as Boris stirred from his lowly position, he looked up to see Theresa May carrying the ball over the line. Theresa May, as has been well chronicled, was an unreconstructed disaster. She called a snap general election and lost the majority she had inherited. Her performance was so poor she almost put Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. Three years on from the Brexit vote Britons were dragging themselves to the polls to elect MPs to the European Parliament they had voted to quit. The Conservative party came in 5th place in the 2019 EU elections, winning just 8.8% of the vote--their worst-ever national election performance. May followed Cameron out the door shortly afterwards. Now there was no choice but to bet on Boris. He took over Theresa May's minority government and was no less stuck in the mud than she was. But in the quagmire, he saw opportunity. He took to the bully pulpit of the dispatch box to damn the European Withdrawal Act--which he dubbed ""the surrender act."" This Act had been introduced by a Remainer Labour MP and passed by a contemptuous Parliament. Boris prorogued Parliament, calling an end to the session until the decision was declared undone by that great Blair creation, the Supreme Court. He was accused of lying to the Queen and acting unlawfully. His attempts to get Brexit done were thwarted by both houses of the legislature, the judiciary, and even his own party. The establishment thought they had him beat and Brexit blocked. But in the real-world Boris's fight to pass Brexit was a thing of admiration. He was seen as the people's champion, taking the fight to a zombie parliament, corrupt judges, and distant technocrats. The man who had once damned blue-collar workers as 'likely to be drunk, criminal, aimless, feckless, and hopeless' had become their champion. Having proved beyond all doubt there was no way to deliver on the Brexit referendum, Boris called a December general election. We had seen Boris the Thatcherite, Boris the liberal, and Boris the populist. Now Boris the social democrat would take to the stage. His campaign was unlike any other Tory election bid since Harold Macmillan. He teamed up with Labour MPs to talk up the ways his government could exploit state aid to the benefit of British firms. He promised big spending on health and infrastructure. There were to be more hospitals, nurses, and police. But the social policy would shift Rightwards--immigration was pledged to be cut via the introduction of an Australian-style points-based system, and there would be tougher sentences for criminals. The result was the biggest parliamentary majority for the Conservative party since Thatcher's 1987 victory. Boris won 43.6% of the vote, more than Tony Blair won in his historic 1997 landslide win. Labour suffered its worst performance since the 1930s and was thought to have been wiped out for a generation. Conservative staffers celebrated with chants of '10 more years.' Like Macmillan, Boris had won his victory with the support of working-class voters in the north. He pledged his newly rebranded ""people's government"" would repay their trust. And then COVID hit. Whether the British response was the right one will be known in the fullness of time. But for his part, Boris stuck by those voters who had lent him their support. He introduced generous 80% furlough payments, loans and grants for shuttered businesses, subsidised food, and rolled out vaccines faster than any other European country. This he said, was a Brexit bonus. And it was widely accepted as such. The Prime Minister did, however, take a lot of flack throughout the pandemic. His chief advisor Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown he had helped devise, and Boris refused to sack him. With his characteristic bombast, he shook hands with patients in a COVID ward to the dismay of his scientific advisors. He fumbled press conferences, was accused of locking down too late and was blamed for a PPE (personal protective equipment) shortage. Despite mistakes--some avoidable, others catastrophic, many both--Boris remained incredibly popular. In 2021, a by-election was called in the Hartlepool constituency after the incumbent Labour MP Mike Hill stood down following sexual assault allegations. Labour had held the seat since 1964--it having only been lost previously to Macmillan. But the Conservatives, despite putting up an unimpressive candidate, romped home in the contest, winning 52% in the Labour stronghold. Boris could not be beaten, and the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was fated to lead his party into a fifth consecutive defeat. Taking place on the same day, the Conservatives won a stunning victory in Tees Valley mayoral election, winning 73% of the vote in the Labour heartland. Conservative mayor Ben Houchen, who had barely pipped the post in the previous election, won by a landslide in every local authority area. The Conservatives were now as much the party of former miners as they were of millionaires. And then it all went wrong. The Conservative MP for Wakefield was jailed for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy, and the Tories lost the subsequent by-election. Neil Parish MP was forced to resign for watching pornography in the House of Commons, and his seat too was lost. Rob Roberts was suspended for unwanted sexual advances against a male member of his staff. The Dover MP was convicted of sexually assaulting two women. The MP for Somerton and Frome had the party whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual assault and cocaine use surfaced. An unnamed Tory MP was arrested for rape. Then the Conservative MP for Tamworth, and the party's Chief Whip, Christopher Pincher, was alleged to have groped two men in a private members club. It was alleged Pincher had exhibited this kind of behaviour previously, that Boris was familiar with the allegations, and appointed him to the powerful position all the same. The PM refused to deny that he had joked his Chief Whip was ""Pincher by name, Pincher by nature."" Worse still, as if it could get any worse, Boris was slow to sack Pincher. Pincher was the straw that broke the camel's back. It was a scandal that came after the Prime Minister had squandered his treasure trove of political capital. When Conservative MP Owen Paterson was found to have breached Common's rules in relation to his consultancy work, Boris moved to rewrite them. After a great row, and with his own MPs threatening to revolt, Boris admitted defeat, and Paterson resigned. His seat was, like the others, lost in the subsequent by-election. There was Partygate , which on one level was puerile and on another spoke to this emerging feeling that there was one rule for the government, and another for everyone else--not helped by the abundance of crooks and sex pests who occupied its ranks. But the saga was made excruciating by Boris's repeated assurances as to his behaviour, which were repeatedly disproven. The slow drip of leaked photographs of Downing Street toasts landed on the PM as Japanese Water torture. He would ultimately be fined for breaching his own COVID regulations. All this, not to mention a questionable loan Boris took out to finance an expensive refurbishment of his Downing Street flat (or his Caribbean Christmas getaway funded by a party donor). He was alleged to have said in a rage that he would ""let the bodies pile high"" rather than institute further lockdowns. PPE procurement was fraught with controversy as party donors and MPs' mates ended up winning lucrative government contracts they had no earthly right to. A friend of the health minister--the same minister who would resign after breaking lockdown rules to carry out an affair--won a PS40 million contract to supply vials. He was a pub landlord. This sort of sleaze should come at the fag end of a tired regime, not beset the beginning of a new government. Tory MPs were carrying on as though it were the fall of Rome and Sodom and Gomorrah all at once. All the while illegal immigration was rising to a deafening crescendo, inflation was on the up, fuel prices were soaring, and wages were falling. The billions earmarked to 'level up' had been spent on COVID, leaving little to go around for the planned scientific and infrastructure revolutions. Debt had exceeded 100% of GDP, the UK slumped from the 5th to the 6th richest economy in the world, the Brexit deal had yet to be ironed out, and NHS waiting lists were reaching all-time highs. So, when Boris' comments about Pincher surfaced, there were few arguments left to draw upon in support of the Prime Minister's continued tenure. His MPs mutinied, and they threw out their most electorally successful leader in over three decades. Liz Truss went on to be the shortest-serving Prime Minister in British history. Rishi Sunak lost the election to Labour. It's not especially important that the upshot of all this is that the Conservative party lost (Who cares? They're terrible). It's important because the end of the Boris project represents the failure to consolidate a historic and lasting pro-worker, pro-nation consensus. After World War II, the Labour party established a new consensus. The Conservative party would sing to their tune until 1979, after which Margaret Thatcher remade the political landscape in her image. The results of the 2019 election should have cemented a generational realignment. But they didn't. Labour lost the support of the voters their party had been founded to represent. Though the party performed well in urban centres and university towns, they were routed across the post-industrial towns and villages of England and Wales. White working-class voters turned their backs on the Labour party in numbers previously thought unimaginable. Labour had been ignoring working-class voters for decades. They could afford to neglect them because, the logic went, those voters had nowhere else to turn. Through the 2000s, voter turnout dropped to record low levels. Working-class voters abstained from the ballot box, making them still easier to ignore. A great political war was fought between the Tories and Labour over the 'Waitrose Shopper' demographic. The Brexit vote reawakened millions of voters who had slipped in their apathy into disinterested hibernation. 17.4 million Brits voted for Brexit--for comparison just 9.5 million voted to elect Tony Blair with a big majority in 2005. Workers had attained something like a class consciousness. And come the 2019 election the Waitrose Shopper had been forgotten--now the so-called Workington Man took centre stage. He was between 30 and 50, living in a large town, likely to be self-employed and working a trade. He put Boris Johnson into number 10 Downing Street to get Brexit done. The shock result threatened to force the Labour party to embark on a radical metamorphosis. They would have to bend to the socially conservative mean of the British people and acquiesce to the so-called Blue Labour tendency in their party. Radical stances on gender, speech, reparations, culture, crime, and immigration would have to be jettisoned. The economic settlement would have to put British people first. Similarly, the Conservatives were now supported by a radically different coalition than had backed them before. Their approach to the economy would have to become more equitable, with a focus on localism. Mass immigration to fuel growth would have to give way to the upskilling of British workers and wage increases. As a fan of the classics, Boris might like to be compared to Alexander the Great. Like the Greek, Boris conquered the world and then had no idea what to do with it. When his armies rebelled, he led them on a death march through the desert, destroying his own legacy and failing those who had held him up on their shoulders. Consequently, both parties have been let off the hook. The Tories are free to return to being the uncaring party of the Home Counties that is content to laud over the ruins of the UK as money is siphoned into the South East, and Labour can again embrace without restriction the most radical social policies that the maddest Californian professor could dream up in an acid trip. Boris Johnson isn't the messiah; he's a very naughty boy. It might be he rose in spite of himself, riding a series of fortuitous events to the top of global politics. Or his supporters might have him right in saying it was for him that his triple triumph--of London, Brexit, and 2019--was won. But none could credibly deny he was a lousy governor. With a large parliamentary majority, an unquestioned mandate from the people, and a track record of winning, Boris could have remade British politics. But while BLM riots ran roughshod through the streets, extreme climate protestors blockaded ambulances, and illegal immigrants piled into 5-star hotels, he busied himself at climate summits, with Ukraine, and with online censorship. That's not to say Boris might not be remembered for saving Ukraine--as well he might and a good thing too--but that's not what he was elected to do. Ultimately, he lacked the stamina and discipline to see his project through. He imagined he could surf a tidal wave of public support into eternity as the father of the nation. Yet here we are, Boris set to become a footnote in Chinese history and voters lamenting their choice between red technocrats and blue. So ended the reign of King Boris.",The European Conservative,2024-12-17T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/boris-johnson-the-man-who-lost-the-world/
Elon Musk and the “Second Career” of Adolf Hitler,"What is a Nazi in 2025? If you ask progressive activists and many in the media (but I repeat myself), Elon Musk is the Dr. Goebbels of Silicon Valley. When the pro-MAGA tycoon extended his right arm waving to the crowd at a Trump inauguration event, mainstream media went berserk speculating about whether or not he had given a ""Heil Hitler"" salute. Never mind that images of politicians like Emmanuel Macron and Tim Walz making the same gesture are easy to find on the Internet. If Musk does it, he must be sending a fascist signal to his followers, right? NAZI SALUTE? Wait so this is a thing? Will @EmmanuelMacron resign after giving a Nazi salute or is this just the way people engage large crowds when they are excited? And it has NOTHING to do with Nazis? Anyone who thinks Elon gave a Nazi salute is being disingenuous. h/t... pic.twitter.com/11p8RpXrqZ In Germany, Musk's support of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party makes him Nazi-adjacent. Even though AfD is now the second-biggest party in Germany, it remains a total pariah among the German establishment, which regards them as ""far right."" Anybody can read AfD's platform in English , on the Internet. Musk has called it ""common sense,"" and that's how it reads to me. But I actually read the thing. People who depend on the liberal media will have no idea what AfD really believes. The 'Nazis 2.0' narrative is incorrect and malicious, but it plays into deep historical stereotypes people have about Germans, so few people question it. For far too long, merely being accused of Nazi sympathies has been enough to discredit and exile someone from the community of respectable people. The French writer Renaud Camus--author of the 'Great Replacement' concept--is a left-wing gay atheist. But his questioning mass migration and framing it as an elite plot to displace the French people brought upon him the immense stigma of being some kind of Nazi. Camus has pointed out that it is impossible to deny that European civilization is being radically changed by mass migration policies supported by generations of elites, on both the Left and the Right. He writes: It is perfectly fine to acknowledge it as a reality if one celebrates it. If, on the other hand, you do not like the Great Replacement, then it does not exist, you are the one inventing it and you are a fascist, a racist and a propagator of conspiracy theories. If you like it, it exists, and it is an opportunity for France, an opportunity for Flanders, a blessing for Belgium, a lifeline for Europe; and you are a benefactor of humanity. What Camus has called ""the Second Career of Adolf Hitler"" is how effectively leftists and others can condemn anyone who opposes them as modern-day Nazis to humiliate and discredit them without having to deal with their arguments. This tactic has been immensely successful in marginalizing the non-tame Right. On a recent flight, I sat next to a pro-Trump American, the child of a couple who fled the Soviet bloc for America. His father prospered and, in the 1990s, sent his son to study at one of the most elite U.S. preparatory schools. As a student, he was shocked to hear teachers and fellow students openly praising Communism. When he stood to tell them what Communism actually is, and how his family had suffered, he was denounced as a ""fascist."" In a single day, he had become a Hitlerite outcast, simply for challenging their narrative about Communism. This experience taught him a hard lesson in how effective Hitler could be in his 'second career.' In Hungary, we are quite used to this. Ordinary people in Western Europe, Britain, and North America, if they know anything at all about Hungary, it's that it is an authoritarian hellhole ruled with an iron fist by Viktor Orban. They know this because that's what their media have told them. Should they visit the actual existing Hungary, they would understand how they have been lied to. Two British expatriate friends who live in Budapest both told me that when they tell friends back in the UK that they are more free to speak their minds in Orban's Hungary than in Starmer's Britain, nobody believes them. But it's true! I often wonder if the media and elites in other countries keep up the lies about Hungary to prevent their own populations from realizing the benefits of reduced mass migration and demanding similar policies. When Donald Trump first took office in 2017, the media filled with dark predictions of the descending dark night of fascism. Noted academics warned grimly that this is just how Hitler got started. Even though it was perfectly obvious that whatever Trump was, he was no Nazi, it did not matter. The Left, which controls academia and the media, stuck to its vile story. Indeed, as A.H. himself wrote, in Mein Kampf , people can be brought to believe a ""big lie"" if you tell it often enough, and with enough confidence. They believe it ... until they don't. The United States is now undergoing de-Nazification, in the sense that 'second-career Hitler' is facing unemployment. His work is increasingly ineffective. The liberal sports broadcaster Stephen A. Smith, a black Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris, explained it last week on Bill Maher's HBO program: Democrat Stephen A. Smith ROASTED the Democrats -- right in front of Ro Khanna, and applauded by Democrat Bill Maher -- on Real Time last night. Absolute pic.twitter.com/YAJ99Kia57 Smith observed that even though Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts, he still won the popular vote, because to most Americans, ""he's closer to normal"" than what the Left offers. What voter out there can look at the Democratic Party at this moment in time and say, 'There's a voice for us, somebody that speaks for us, that goes up to Capitol Hill and fights the fights we want them to be fighting, on our behalf? ...They didn't do that, and that's why their behinds are home, and that man is back in the White House. Unlike 2017, when the Left successfully trashed Trump and his team as crypto-Nazis, this year, they are exhausted. Nobody listens to them anymore. For one, Trump has already been president, and whatever his failures, only fools, journalists, and professors still claim he was a fascist. Plus, four years of Joe Biden's rule brought disaster after disaster, especially on mass migration. Voters assessed the cost of believing the Big Lie about Trump and American fascism and decided not to be intimidated by it anymore. Will European voters reach the same conclusion about their own right-wing politicians who are routinely denounced as 'Hitler helpers'? One can only hope. The reason that so many European politicians and media figures are eager to demonize Elon Musk and censor his X platform is that Musk refuses to live by the Big Lie. And on X, Europeans can hear from these pariah politicians and make up their own minds. A Czech businessman told me in Prague last fall that Trump offers hope to European conservatives like him. He said that the fact that Trump refuses to be bullied by the media and establishment opinion shows people like him that it is possible to resist the liberal ideology that is slowly killing Europe. It is certainly true that Europe should be vigilant against the return of Nazism, but it is also true that the ruling class has become so fanatical that it prevents Europe from embracing sensible policies that protect their liberal democracies from grave threats. The ""second career of Adolf Hitler"" is leading to the demise of Europe. Fear of Hitler, and of being accused of being fascist, has left Europeans paralyzed in the face of mortal threats to their civilizational existence. When people are more afraid of Elon Musk waving to his supporters in a certain way than they are of mass migration, Islamization, economic stagnation, and cultural decline, then they have drunk an ideological poison that, mark my words, is going to kill them.",The European Conservative,2025-01-27T16:05:34,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/dreher/everyone-i-dont-agree-with-is-a-nazi/
Historic French Theatre Falls Victim to Pro-Migrant Zeal,"In the heart of Paris stands a historic theatre , the Theatre de la Gaite Lyrique. This emblematic venue for Parisian festivals has seen many adventures in recent decades. After its heyday, it fell into near-abandonment before undergoing a major overhaul a few years ago . But now it's in the process of giving up the ghost, thanks to the very people who claim to be the staunchest defenders of 'culture.' Transformed into a reception centre for migrants , it is in decline and on the verge of bankruptcy. Whatever the Left may say, culture and the reception of migrants don't mix very well. On December 10th last year, a group of migrants, supported by one of the many immigrationist groups proliferating in Anne Hidalgo's Paris, headed for the Theatre de la Gaite Lyrique with the intention to take up residence there. The migrants, who claimed to be 'minors,' numbered 250, then 300, came to squat in the theatre, forcing the establishment to close. Temporarily, they thought. The theatre management was sympathetic to the squatters' approach. It's the middle of winter, it is cold, and there's no question of throwing these migrants--whose request seems perfectly legitimate to anyone sensitive to human rights--out on the street. According to Le Figaro , while deploring ""the sudden nature of this occupation""--which the prefecture has described as ""illegal""--the theatre recalls ""the legitimacy of the collective's demand for a roof over their heads."" A banner emblazoned with the accusatory slogan ""Housing emergency, unaccompanied minors on the streets"" can be seen on the facade of this Haussmann-style theatre. The presence of the squatters is making it impossible to hold the events scheduled at the Gaite Lyrique. As a result, shows scheduled for the venue had to be cancelled, postponed, or rescheduled, resulting in considerable irreversible losses for the establishment, which relies on shows for 70% of its income with 'only' 30% coming from public subsidies. In December, David Robert, the institution's spokesman, estimated the cost of cancelling private and public events at ""several hundred thousand euros in direct losses."" Let's face it: the famous theatre is on the verge of bankruptcy, and for the moment, there is no solution in sight. Since the squat began, it has emerged that many of the so-called ""unaccompanied minors"" are over the age of eighteen, which automatically excludes them from the child welfare system. It is normally up to the owner of the premises to refer the matter to the authorities for eviction and restoration of order, but the management cannot bring itself to do so. The Gaite Lyrique is an old and honourable Parisian institution, where Jacques Offenbach's operettas and Diaghilev's Russian ballets once triumphed. But the theatre has long since succumbed to the sirens of political correctness. Two years ago, the theatre took part in 'Refugee Day 2023,' and last year organised a discussion with a former socialist minister under the evocative title of ""Migration: an opportunity for France?"" Needless to say, in the minds of the organisers, the question mark there was purely rhetorical. To add insult to injury, since November, the Gaite had been hosting a "" Fresque de la migration ,"" which was due to run until January 15th before it, too, was cancelled. The programme consisted of an ""educational"" approach designed to ""deconstruct prejudices"" and ""redefine terms that are often incorrectly used in everyday language, particularly in the media, such as 'refugee,' 'migrant' or 'exile.'"" Today, the management is caught in the trap of its good feelings and is proving incapable of getting out of the imbroglio into which it has voluntarily plunged itself. It's losing money, a little more every day, until it's time to close the doors. The Theatre de la Gaite Lyrique thus becomes a formidable metaphor for a country, France, and a capital city, Paris, once a beacon of civilisation and a model of the art of living which, for want of knowing how to organise public generosity, indiscriminately welcomes people who are digging the grave of that civilisation and that art of living. And the very people who profess all day long to defend the 'extra soul' that is culture in the ferocious world of globalised capitalism find themselves the first victims of their disordered philanthropy. We could rejoice at the lesson they have been cruelly taught. But we'd be wary of doing so. In reality, it is almost certainly the city of Paris and Anne Hidalgo's tax-funded socialist coffers that will bail out the theatre... until the next influx of migrants. Absent the organisation of roundtables on migration, we can only advise the theatre's administrators to delve back into classical literature and ponder Bossuet's stainless adage: ""God laughs at the prayers we make to him to avert public misfortune, when we do not oppose what is done to attract it.""",The European Conservative,2025-01-16T19:15:23,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/migrants-ruin-french-theatre-defending-migrants-rights/
Immigration vs Political Correctness: French Interior Minister Picks Up the Gauntlet,"French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau's shock statements are multiplying. Since his appointment in Michel Barnier's previous government, this 'respectable' man from the government's right wing has been saying out loud what many French people are thinking, but dare not say publicly for fear of being branded 'fascists' or 'supporters of the Rassemblement National (RN)'. While his words may be devoid of any practical effect for the time being, they are nevertheless playing a decisive role in shaping public opinion and paving the way for what's to come. For several months now, Retailleau has been riding the battle horses of the national Right on the issues of immigration and crime . After denouncing the excesses of state medical aid (AME) granted indiscriminately to migrants, he also came out in favour of a referendum on immigration . At the time of the murder of the young woman Philippine, a murder that moved the whole of France , he said he wanted to put an end to public subsidies paid to pro-migrant associations , which were both 'judge and party.' Retailleau recently raised his voice against Algeria , accused it of ""humiliating France,"" and ordered the expulsion of Tiktokers making terrorist threats. In the press, he defended a drastic ban on the full veil in public spaces and universities--only to be rebuked by a government reluctant to follow his hard line on militant Islam. On Sunday, January 19th on BFM TV, Retailleau put the question of ethnic statistics back on the agenda. This year, INSEE, France's national statistics institute, included a simple question in its multiannual population census: ""What is the place of birth of your parents?"" Needless to say, this provoked reticence and criticism in France, where such statistics--in principle--are banned. Ignoring potential backlash, Retailleau believes that the introduction of 'ethnic statistics' would be a good thing, as they would finally make it possible to avoid ""hiding reality."" Like the harsh reality of the over-representation of immigrants in prisons and delinquency, stubbornly denied by the Left. These statements demonstrate a certain lucidity regarding the dramatic situation in France caused by decades of uncontrolled immigration and lax policies. The Left has made no mistake, making Retailleau one of its new favourite targets, accusing him of 'playing into the hands of the far Right' and working for the RN. All his comments were immediately vilified and caricatured by left-wing elected representatives, proving that he had hit the nail on the head. Unfortunately, we know that these statements will have little or no effect. For the moment, it's all talk and no action. But one can hope that through his renewed affirmation of a firm line on these issues, he is helping to pave the way for other political figures who have the courage to take action. What is considered an 'authorised' and 'acceptable' discourse in the media has changed considerably over the last few decades. The minister of the interior is providing the latest step in a multi-year process, largely led by the Front National and (now Rassemblement National), to acclimatise public opinion with the issues of immigration and insecurity. The death of Jean-Marie Le Pen at the beginning of January 2025 highlighted this shift in the press and the political class. His death revived many of his media appearances and political speeches on these issues, which today no longer carry the scandalous reputation they once did. The national Right still suffers from a lack of credibility with certain sections of the electorate, particularly pensioners. Seniors over 65 still hesitate to trust the RN and continue to rely heavily on the mainstream media, which often labels RN statements as ' populiste '--in French, a solidly derogatory term. But what can they say when those same words come out of the mouth of a 'decent' minister? The question that arises is the medium-term effects of Retailleau's stance. What will happen in the next elections? There are several possible scenarios. The right-wing electorate, stuck in its quest for respectability, could continue to turn to the parties of the so-called 'government' right, but with stronger demands for real results to match their promises. Alternatively, factual circumstances and shared interests could compel the right-wing parties to permanently break down the cordon sanitaire that has artificially divided them since it was placed there by the left in the 1980s, and unite around a common programme. That's the best we can hope for.",The European Conservative,2025-01-24T13:07:21,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/immigration-vs-political-correctness-french-interior-minister-picks-up-the-gauntlet/
Under Siege: How the War on Farmers Threatens Western Values and Global Food Security,"Farmers are the backbone of society, ensuring that our tables are filled with food three times a day, every day of the week. Yet, in the modern world, their indispensable role is often taken for granted. We rarely pause to consider that the contents of our refrigerators connect us directly to those who labor tirelessly to sustain us. What happens if the farmers disappear? The answer is simple and stark: our refrigerators remain empty. Food security, once a cornerstone of national policy and identity, is now being eroded by globalist ideologies and bureaucratic overreach, threatening not just agriculture but the very fabric of Western civilization. The historical significance of food security cannot be overstated. After the devastation of World War II, European nations understood the fragility of their food supplies. Hunger, shortages, and economic instability plagued the continent, prompting the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC). A key component of this new cooperative effort was the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), established in 1962. Its purpose was clear: to ensure stable, sufficient food production, reduce dependence on imports, and protect citizens from the specter of future shortages. It succeeded in turning Europe into a self-sufficient agricultural powerhouse while upholding high standards of food safety and quality. Fast forward to today, and the situation could not be more different. The European Union (EU), driven by unelected bureaucrats in the European Commission, has turned its back on its founding principles. Under the guise of environmental sustainability and climate policy, the EU has declared war on its farmers, implementing measures that force them off the land. These policies, varying by country but united in their destructive outcomes, are choking the life out of European agriculture. In the Netherlands, nitrogen emissions are the scapegoat; in Germany, farmers are being taxed into oblivion. The result is the same: despair, financial ruin, and a troubling rise in farmer suicides. The assault on farmers is not confined to Europe. Across the globe, agriculture is under siege. In the United States and Australia, water regulations are driving farmers to the brink. In Canada, fertilizer restrictions are crippling productivity. New Zealand targets methane emissions, while South American farmers face an onslaught of environmental and economic pressures. From a broader perspective, these trends suggest a coordinated effort to dismantle the traditional foundations of food production in Western societies. Why is this happening, and who stands to benefit? These questions point to a deeply troubling agenda. History provides a grim warning. Stalin's collectivization policies in the 1930s decimated the Ukrainian peasantry, leading to the Holodomor--a man-made famine that claimed millions of lives. Similarly, Mao's Great Leap Forward in the 1960s wreaked havoc on Chinese agriculture, causing widespread starvation. In both cases, the destruction of farmers paved the way for the consolidation of Communist power. The parallels with today's assault on agriculture are chilling. At the heart of this assault lies a globalist agenda spearheaded by the United Nations (UN). Cloaked in the rhetoric of sustainability and equality, the UN's policies often serve the interests of unelected elites rather than the citizens they claim to represent. Through initiatives like Agenda 2030 and the woke climate agenda, the UN advances a vision of top-down control that sidelines national sovereignty and democratic accountability. The role of powerful NGOs, funded by wealthy philanthropists with vested financial interests, further illustrates how unelected actors dictate policy. These oligarchs, shielded by their philanthropic facades, wield immense influence over supranational organizations, bypassing the will of the people. The climate narrative is a prime example of this manipulation. Fear of climate catastrophe is being weaponized to impose draconian restrictions on farmers while conveniently ignoring the hypocrisy of global trade policies. If climate concerns were genuine, why does the EU continue to sign trade agreements that import food from regions with lax environmental standards? Beans from Kenya, for instance, are shipped across the globe despite being grown under far less stringent regulations than those faced by European farmers. This exposes the true agenda: control, not conservation. Moreover, the climate-driven assault on agriculture is part of a broader effort to dismantle Western values. The UN's Immigration Replacement agenda floods Western nations with non-Western immigrants, diluting and disrupting our cultural heritage which is organically and carefully crafted over the centuries on Judeo-Christian values and Greek philosophy. Simultaneously, traditional farming communities are being undermined, eroding a way of life that has long been a pillar of national identity and economic stability. The aim appears to be the creation of a homogenized, compliant global citizenry, stripped of cultural and economic independence. For conservatives, the stakes could not be higher. Agriculture is more than an economic sector; it is a cornerstone of sovereignty, community, and tradition. The farmer is not just a food producer but a steward of the land, a guardian of heritage, and a bulwark against the encroachments of globalism. When farmers are forced off their land, society loses more than food security--it loses a vital connection to its roots and values. The path forward requires a reassertion of national sovereignty and a rejection of globalist overreach. Governments must prioritize local food production, support farmers through fair and reasonable policies, and resist the siren song of supranational organizations. Trade policies must reflect environmental realities, encouraging local and sustainable farming practices rather than outsourcing food production to distant, poorly regulated regions. Ultimately, the attack on farmers is an attack on the freedoms and values that define Western society. An empty refrigerator is not just an inconvenience; it is a symbol of dependence, vulnerability, and submission. To protect our farmers is to protect our freedom, our heritage, and our future. Let us not repeat the mistakes of history by allowing ideological zealotry and bureaucratic hubris to destroy the foundations of our civilization. Because--no farmers, no food, no future.",The European Conservative,2025-01-12T12:11:02,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/under-siege-how-the-war-on-farmers-threatens-western-values-and-global-food-security/
Southport: A Public and Private Affair,"Southport never seems to be out of the news these days--and for all the wrong reasons. Until recently, Southport was a lesser-known northern English seaside town. Sadly, since last July when three little girls were murdered and others were injured at a holiday club, the name now elicits wary expressions of knowing recognition. The heightened exposure is further compounded after a spate of rioting that occurred in the wake of that event. In addition to the savagery of the event and its continuing aftermath, the name Southport has now become synonymous with the so-called 'two-tier-Keir' phenomenon of sentencing harshly otherwise law-abiding citizens for online tweets or likes and the release of violent offenders from prison to make room for them. Normal protocols have been upended so that people were branded as criminals before any due process was observed. Additionally, there is now a ubiquitous labelling of moderately conservative and liberal people as 'far-right' for daring to ask questions or to speculate about the perpetrator of the attacks. Southport is now firmly in the world's purview. Even Elon Musk has expressed opinions relating to Southport. The two-tier configuration is interesting if only to expose the truism that in a mediated existence, there is a world that we see, inhabit, or experience and another one, carefully curated for appearances' sake. Away from the headlines, Southport is a place of some eccentric contradictions and paradoxes. Southport, notwithstanding its name, is neither in the south nor is it a port. It got its name from a hotel called the South Port built in 1797. The town's founder was a William Sutton who regarded the town as his indulgent ""folly"" and the present-day Duke's Folly Hotel is a stone's throw away from the original situated on the town's main Lord Street. Southport occupies that liminal space between town and country, being surrounded by farmland and sandy beaches. Thus, if you are from Southport, you are known as a Sandgrounder . The town is equidistant from both Liverpool and Preston and is regarded by both as a rather quaint and old fashioned relative, somewhere to go for a 'day out.' Southport is the more modest and sedate version of Blackpool, and a place where Hasidic Jews arriving by train from Manchester can occasionally be seen visiting. Paradoxes abound, Southport is a seaside town and yet the tide rarely comes in. Notwithstanding, there is a lifeboat station, provided not by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution rather from local fundraising. Incongruously, it is frequently used, not least to rescue those who fall prey to quick sands or get caught by the incoming tide when wandering too far across the sands towards the illusory nearness of Blackpool. Sandgrounders tend to bristle at the Liverpudlian association of ""Merseyside,"" and much prefer to be identified as belonging to the historical county of Lancashire, which of course, traditionally (and paradoxically) includes Liverpool. The town is the product of Victorian endeavours, yet its northernmost village of Churchtown is referred to, somewhat obliquely, in the Domesday book, the historical record of England and Wales dating from the year 1086. There, adjacent to the village green, is a set of punishment stocks carefully preserved outside St Cuthbert's, one of England's oldest churches. In more contemporary times, the town's eccentric tourist offerings include such things as a Lawnmower Museum, a model railway village, an annual flower show, as well as an air show. Small town or not, Southport has its own airport at RAF Woodvale. Additionally, the town is also renowned as the golfing capital of England hosting the Royal Birkdale Open tournament. Furthermore, Southport forms the northernmost aspect of the Sefton Coast with wildlife reserves, pinewoods--home to red squirrels--and Crosby beach's renowned art installation, Another Place by Anthony Gormley. The weather is invariably mild, and it is no coincidence that Southport is a place where people come to retire. And this aspect has also shaped its townspeople who are mild mannered and gently conservative (small 'c') and liberal. Voting patterns since 1885 show the town as broadly alternating between Conservative and Liberal. This was until the last election, where the town elected its first ever Labour member of parliament. However, the town is now showing signs of decline. Competition from Liverpool and Manchester, coupled with online e-commerce, have not helped this once rather elegant shopping centre. Many retail units along the renowned Lord Street are empty and the once immaculate verandas are unkempt and neglected. The town is administered by Sefton Council, which is Labour-led and based in the nearby district of Bootle. Locals grumble that Southport is treated as a cash cow that can be milked ad infinitum . Yet these days, it is difficult to sense much in the way of prosperity with dilapidated buildings and a burgeoning plethora of tattoo parlours, Turkish barbers, nail bars, and take-aways. It would seem that the further politically leftward the town has travelled the poorer the town has become, and the poorer it becomes, the further leftwards it travels. As will doubtless now be familiar, within weeks of the general election, the town was plunged into a sequence of horror, despair and infamy, and was shoved rapidly into the world's spotlight. Come those terrible events of July, two tiers of reality (so to speak) could be discerned. There was the stage-managed portrayal with the now familiar routine of carefully curated public vigil and another more cloistered version proceeding in concert. The outward-facing vigil attempted to combine sympathy for the families of the victims alongside some anti-racist sentiments written on placards. In hindsight, it is difficult to discern from which direction this supposed racism had emanated. From the earliest moments of the debacle when this small town was trying to process the greatness of the shock, speculation was rapid, emotional, angry, and fearful. Notwithstanding its population of around 90,000, Southport is nevertheless a small town, and everyone knows someone who knows someone connected to everyone. I am not sure if anyone perceived or articulated the violent attack as itself an act of racism. It could be that some merely allowed their inner thoughts to ponder upon the many incidents British people have encountered involving violent Islamism. A wary officialdom seemed keen to present a narrative that pointed away from the victims and their agony and towards what we might call the new world order's cult of anti-racism and a Left-leaning, avowedly secular dogma. On the evening following the murders, there was an initial public vigil that preceded a more colourful gathering that took place a week later amongst poignant and fulsome floral displays with toys and balloons, along with public bubbles blowing to commemorate the three lives lost. There were some genuinely moving moments as the bubbles filled the boulevard of Lord Street, rising high and travelling further than expected. I happened to be driving towards the gathering from Birkdale when a lone bubble came into view, inducing a spasm of recognition. It was telling that the various memorial displays and events were situated outside the local arts centre, a decidedly secular venue. At the initial vigil taking place on the day after the murders, the lacuna opened up by the lack of any substantial Christian focus was unsettling. This hastily convened vigil confidently presented itself as the progressive and liberal way of doing things these days. I recall a time when the Reverend Rod Garner of Southport's Holy Trinity Church, Southport's erstwhile 'go-to' vicar, would have been on hand to guide the town with the wisdom borne of a religious framework. Alas, long since retired, in his place a local hospital chaplain offered some kind words and platitudes. As I reflect more deeply upon the events of the summer and their still-unfolding aftermath, it occurs to me that we seem to be grieving for more than the loss of three young innocent lives. Enmeshed within the grotesqueness is the slow withering of a public-facing Christian world we are losing to a secular imitator with its performative gestures made for the sake of 'appearances' in various media outlets. It is as if we have forgotten how things ought to be done. In times of shock such as these it was to God via faith and religion to whom we would turn for comfort, strength and meaning. Without the guidance and poetry of scripture, there is no protocol, no structure, no words of substance that strengthen our spirit and nourish our souls. As if to illustrate this, in the haste to avoid offending non-Christians, and this now (of course) includes secularists, the chaplain at the initial vigil eschewed all authentic Christian language for the sake of tepid phrases about not being alone, sticking together, and showing solidarity. He introduced an accompanying Catholic priest whose words were similarly constrained and limited to comment about the turnout--to which some forced applause ensued. At this, it felt as though some were effectively applauding their own presence at the vigil. Was it the case that the priest simply had no words upon which to draw at this time? Or was there a sense that his repertoire would now be misunderstood, misconstrued or simply deemed offensive? Under these circumstances, the secular utterances of Christian ministers diminished the symbolism of the dog collar to that of a mere fancy dress costume in a melancholy game of dressing up. The gathering was encouraged to observe a minute's respectful silence, to reflect and remember amid the cawing of the seagulls. But there was no prayer, no poetry of psalms, just faint traces of Christian rituals such as candle lighting, meditation and prayer. In what could have been an afterthought, the chaplain's closing remarks ""for those who pray"" invited the assumed minority of the religious to offer prayers to "" their God."" This surely represents the public-facing afterglow of a Christian culture. Paradoxically, the new insurgent secular pseudo-religion can only take its emblems and signifiers from what went before and from that which has sustained us for centuries: that is to say, the Christian tradition. Yet as if to confound this new ideological progressivism, the responses to events in Southport bear witness to an actual Christian ethos that has left its indelible trace upon people here. In the alternate version of events that Southport saw and lived through, rather than what the mediated 'news' chose to convey, there was the quiet, spontaneous blossoming of displays of pink bows and ribbons cascading all around the town from lampposts and gate posts. Many of these displays consisted of three simple bows, one for each of the murdered girls. This formed a peaceful yet powerfully feminine gesture of solidarity for their families. There appeared to be a dignified, steady determination on the part of many to participate in this simple gesture. And as the days went by, more and more of these ribbons were seen on gateways, doorposts and street furniture of all kinds until the town rippled in fluttering pink. Additionally, below the media radar, the wider public most likely did not see the clean-up operation and rebuilding of the mosque wall, begun by locals first thing the next morning after being damaged in the ensuing riot. They were also unaware of the mosque's Imam giving out flowers to random passers-by on the days of the girls' funerals. Nor were they aware of the customary good relations between the mosque and the community. Nor was there much in the way of publicity for the emphatically heartfelt and positive notice by the shopkeepers whose shop had been looted and damaged. The public notice displayed in their window thanked the many Southport people who had donated funds and helped to restore them to normality. Additionally, there were also prompt offers of help from various tradesmen on the online ""Next Door"" Neighbours app and some Facebook groups. And it can go without saying that the wider world knows little of the overall shock on the part of the locals, horrified at events so untypical and never before witnessed by Southport. There has been intuitive speculation on the part of the Sandgrounders that the now infamous frenzy of damage was inflicted from without, not within the town. Strangely, the much-publicised rioting, shown live on social media, seemed to invite the very responses that have since landed some people in prison. And the two-tier focus continues to be deflected away from the violence of the murders only to land firmly upon the conjured spectre of the 'far Right.' As the weeks and months have gone on, there have been further revelations concerning the status of the perpetrator and his two-tier identity, comprising, on one hand, a Doctor Who child actor and Welsh choirboy and, on the other, an alleged radicalised Muslim whose face we must not see. Moreover, there is continued speculation about the part Prime Minister Keir Starmer has played in the unfolding of events. His expressions of sanctimony over the riots betrayed a deep lack of concern for the fears of people deeply affected by the murderous attack upon innocents. Furthermore, there is no shared vision for dealing with vast numbers of incomers from places in the world with radically different outlooks and values than those of the mild-mannered inhabitants of this northern seaside town. There is still such a lot to assimilate and work through, and the only remedy on offer is crass name-calling and ridicule. One thing strikes me as pertinent. This town is as far from any notion of the 'far Right' as it is possible to be. In Western Culture: Today and Tomorrow (2007), the late Pope Benedict XVI as Joseph Ratzinger wrote that it is the obvious thing for politicians of all parties to do is to offer change, ""and change for the better."" In his election campaign, Starmer had repeatedly stood upon such a platform. Yet as Ratzinger alludes, there is a deep sense of dissatisfaction that predominates notwithstanding this continual drive to revolutionise in all but name. The Marxian revolutionary project is arguably one that is set upon changing human nature and the overthrow of religion. Yet in the modern world, we seem to know that there is something missing, something that is incrementally being removed for the sake of good appearances and, as Ratzsinger puts it, ""the liberal dogma of progress."" Making the case for the spiritual foundations of Europe and the West in its widest sense, Ratzinger reminds us of our heritage as fostered from the three pillars of Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome. This is especially pertinent given that there will be some who will want to blame religion as a blanket cause for the violent Southport murders in addition to a cynically crafted construction of the 'far Right.' In case anyone needed reminding, religious Christians, no matter their actual politics, are now construed as 'far-right' in the secular progressive worldview. The unrest that has now come to represent Southport to the world forms a painful betrayal of the many decent local people whose unfaltering kindness and care has been shuffled out of view. There is a sour taste that lingers due to the harsh sentencing of some, whose crimes consisted largely of being in the vicinity of the mosque in St Luke's Road or commenting online in an immediate emotional response. This adds additional heartache and sadness to this sorry affair. It is difficult to see when closure can come. There are rumours of efforts to put back the perpetrator's trial for political reasons, meaning the lingering of painful associations for some time to come. The onward trudge of secular progressivism continues with its efforts to supplant the Christian underpinnings of our society. Southport's local council recently issued a request for both public and private displays of pink ribbons to be removed suggesting that it is time to ""move on."" Despite the request, many remain in place. We are not all quite so anxious to ""move on."" Certainly not just yet. It is perhaps worth giving some thought to the ongoing effects that the July attacks provoked. Many children are fearful and anxious, and as one head-teacher has reported, the children's emotions are reignited at each fresh news item associated with that fateful day. The deeply embedded legacy of Christianity shone forth in one particularly splendid example of the Holy Spirit at work. In the immediate aftermath of the murders, Richard Vernon, pastor of Southport's Lakeside Church, had what he described as a ""what if?"" moment. He dared to ask the question: what if we could bless every child in Southport and let them know we (as churches) are here for them and that God loves them? What resulted was audacious: a ""blessing in a backpack"" project. The idea was to create a backpack, filled with goodies, gifts and toys, to be given as a blessing for every primary school age child in Southport. Seeking donations from the congregation and other churches, pastor Richard received offers of help and support from Scripture Union, a local businessman, the Liverpool One church, the Elim churches nationwide and many others. With local volunteers joining in from around Southport, the church managed to organise 6,400 backpacks for the children, a considerable feat of logistics in itself. The children were thrilled at receiving their surprises and one can only hope the impact that this gift has had upon them has gone some way to assuage some of that residual anxiety. For younger children, the love of God has to be translated into something tangible. In the case of this particular gift and blessing, the intended message was the gift of a backpack for life's journey. In yet a further paradoxical turn, it took a pastor (""shepherd"") who does not even own a dog collar to exemplify the meaning of the ""Lord is my shepherd who leads me in right paths for his name's sake"" for that life's journey. Southport, now my adopted home for three decades, will remain a place of paradoxes. It is a duke's folly, a seaside with no sea, and a place of mild weather and even milder-mannered, decent folk. The two-tier religious response, one public yet hesitant and the other private yet dynamic, teaches us all that what the secular media conveys is rarely the whole story. In this two-tier framework, the Southport that is mediated, with its selective versions of events and a cynical funnelling of a narrative, leads only to falsehood. Only the Southport that exists, the one that is , can lead to truth. The frequent spontaneous and authentic Christian responses to the episodes of hatred were not those diluted words performed in costume for the camera. Along with those who rolled up their sleeves or donated money, the blessing in a backpack project, borne of a ""what if"" moment, shines forth as emanating from the One that is . Here is the hidden power of the Holy Spirit, however paradoxical, that shows us clearly that the answer to hatred has to be love.",The European Conservative,2024-12-31T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/southport-a-public-and-private-affair/
"Ten Years After Charlie Hebdo, Let’s Make Free Speech Our Weapon","If the 2015 Charlie Hebdo massacre happened today, would the Western establishment declare ' Je Suis Charlie '? Or would they lecture us not to look back in anger, and threaten to arrest protestors for the crime of Islamophobia? Exactly ten years ago, two crimes were committed against the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. First, on January 7th, 2015, Islamists committed mass murder at the paper's Paris office, in retribution for Charlie daring to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The terrorists shot dead eight cartoonists and journalists, two police officers, and two others, in a bloody demonstration of their hatred for free speech and freedom of the press--the lifeblood of our democratic civilisation. Then, in the days and weeks that followed, the elites of Western society conspired to commit a free-speech fraud. They posed behind ' Je Suis Charlie ' banners and declared their support for the victims. Yet, they were soon demonstrating their contempt for the real freedom of expression that allows such a provocative publication as Charlie Hebdo to exist in the first place. It soon became clear that the threat to free speech in France and the West came not just from a few Islamist barbarians at the gate. Freedom had more powerful enemies within the citadels of civilisation itself. Many politicians and public figures could hardly wait to stop paying their rhetorical respects to Charlie's satirists and again start demanding their own restrictions on Charlie-style offensive or 'hateful' words and images. An unusual international consensus emerged, almost implying that the Charlie satirists were not innocent victims. At one end of this unholy alliance, Pope Francis condemned the murders, but added that ""there is a limit"" to free speech, that ""you cannot make fun of the faith of others"" and that it was ""normal"" for those who do so to ""expect a punch."" At the other end, the official voice of the Chinese Communist regime agreed with His Holiness that ""there should be limits on press freedom"" and that ""unfettered and unprincipled satire, humiliation and free speech are not acceptable."" And in the middle of the consensus, this Vatican-Beijing-endorsed idea that there were ""limits"" to what the likes of Charlie should be allowed to say and that ""unfettered satire and free speech"" was unacceptable also became the conformist party line for many in the supposedly liberal West. Where the Islamists aimed to kill free speech outright with bullets, these liberal voices sought to smother it slowly with ""buts"", as expressed in the mantra, ""Of course I support free speech, BUT not for hate speech/insults/provocations"" etc. At the time of the Paris massacre, I wrote in the Prologue to my book Trigger Warning : is the fear of being offensive killing free speech?: Perhaps we need to face the hard fact that the Islamic gunmen who attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo acted not just as the soldiers of an oldish Eastern religion but also as the armed extremist wing of a thoroughly modern Western creed .... From the official censors of the police and the political elite to the army of unofficial censors online, the cri de Coeur of these crusaders against offensive speech is You-Can't-Say-That. The Islamist gunmen took that attitude to a murderous extreme. As I also wrote there, the response to Charlie Hebdo signalled the end of the age of Voltaire, the eighteenth-century French writer whose views on tolerance and free speech were famously summarised (by his British biographer) as ""I disprove of what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it."" Instead, in the 21st century, we have entered the age of those I called the reverse-Voltaires, whose slogan is, ""I know I will detest what you say, and I will fight to the end of free speech for my right to stop you saying it."" In the ten years that have passed since the Charlie Hebdo murders, the attacks on free speech have got worse. We have witnessed sporadic Islamist assaults: from the 2020 beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty after he allegedly showed pupils Charlie cartoons in a class on freedom of expression, to the 2022 stabbing of Salman Rushdie, British-American author of The Satanic Verses, on a stage in New York State where he was giving a talk on literary freedom. The more damaging and sustained assaults on free speech over the past decade, however, have come from powerful reverse-Voltaires within European and Western society: from many of the same politicians and public figures who have again crept out of their bunkers and paid lip service to freedom around the tenth anniversary. Europe has become preoccupied with the nonsense idea that there is ""too much"" free speech, especially online. We have seen the advance of formal censorship from governments, courts, and EU institutions, seeking to control public debate and silence dissenting, especially conservative, voices under the pretext of combatting 'hate speech,' 'fake news' and 'disinformation'. And the cowardly imposition of effective blasphemy laws to protect Islam from criticism, a self-loathing act of surrender to Islamism. The latest stage of this censorious crusade is European politicians declaring war on Elon Musk, not primarily because of what he says on X/Twitter, but because of what he allows others the freedom to say. We have also witnessed the advance of informal censorship online, as practised by Big Tech giants and their woke 'fact checkers,' backed by leftist twittermobs. And, in response, we have seen the insidious spread of self-censorship among those who are fearful of expressing a non-conformist opinion or simply unsure of what they are 'allowed' to say these days. All of which makes free speech an even more pressing issue today. It should not only be defended as a foundational value of free societies, but also wielded as a weapon in the culture war against woke authoritarians who want to police what we say as a step towards controlling what we think. Some conservatives have not always been comfortable with free speech, partly because, like democracy, it involves putting faith in the wisdom of ordinary people. From the Inquisition to right-wing regimes of the twentieth century, conservative forces have often tried to suppress free speech as the stuff of dangerous heresies. Today, however, the stamping boot is very much on the other foot. As I wrote in a Democracy Watch column for europeanconservative.com last year, after the Brussels mayor and police tried and failed to close down the National Conservative conference , conservatives are ""the new heretics now"", the ones being persecuted for expressing ideas that go against the grain of the conformist You-Can't-Say-That culture. Both for reasons of political principle and practical self-preservation, national conservatives should take up the banner of free speech discarded by their opponents. But without making the same mistake as the Left, who--like Josef Stalin or the Ayatollahs--will happily defend free speech only for those who agree with their prejudices. With the exception of direct incitement to violence, we need to uphold free speech and open debate for all--or none at all. As part of our commitment to reclaim and advance the founding principles of European civilisation, europeanconservative.com stands for the Enlightenment values expressed by the likes of Spinoza, who in the 17th century set a standard that we are still struggling to achieve: ""In a free state, every man may think what he likes and say what he thinks."" As for those cowards and charlatans who share the Islamists' underlying fear of free speech while pretending to support Charlie Hebdo, let us leave the last word to one veteran cartoonist who survived the massacre, Barnard Holtrop, who declared ten years ago that ""We puke on all these people who suddenly say they're our friends."" Free speech, with no ifs and no buts. Now more than ever, Je Suis Charlie--et Voltaire.",The European Conservative,2025-01-07T18:36:17,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/ten-years-after-charlie-hebdo-lets-make-free-speech-our-weapon/
Are Net Zero’s Days Numbered?,"There is a great deal of talk on the British Right about how best to capitalise on Donald Trump's historic victory. Some have suggested that the mere presence of a pro-free speech Anglophile in the White House will limit Keir Starmer's room for manoeuvre: continuing to lock up intemperate old ladies for their Facebook posts will generate more of a PR headache under an anti-woke, Elon Musk-supported Trump administration than was the case with a doty Joe Biden at the helm. Others have speculated that the real advantage of having a fearless, patriotic government across the Atlantic can only serve to stiffen the spines of British right-wingers, otherwise prone to doomerism or over-caution. While this is all very plausible, the most immediate benefit will likely be a financial one. Everyone should by now be familiar with the reports that Musk is on the verge of turbo-charging Nigel Farage's efforts to break the frame of British politics with an appropriately large injection of cash to Reform UK. Just days ago, Farage met the tech titan for as long as an hour--to ""discuss money,"" among other things--at Trump's famed Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. Less well-known is the fact that, fresh off the plane after jetting back to Britain, Farage swiftly joined a London social gathering, with many other high-fliers in attendance, to celebrate the UK launch of another heavy-hitter from the United States: The Heartland Institute. Held at the Brooks's Club and organised by Touchpoint Politics, the event marked the start of a new endeavour. The Heartland Institute is the world's leading think tank promoting 'climate realism.' Founded 40 years ago in Arlington Heights, Illinois, it now has established a 'beach-head' in the United Kingdom, from which it may then expand into Continental Europe. Heartland UK/Europe is officially up and running, with broadcaster and activist Lois Perry as the new director. This expansion, as the Institute's president, James Taylor told the audience, marks an important moment in the organisation's mission to fostering transatlantic cooperation advancing individual liberty and economic freedom. In his role as the night's keynote speaker, Farage made a typically rousing address, peppered with jibes at the Westminster consensus, and informed the audience of his intention to make the economic self-harm of net zero a central issue in British politics. Given that he managed to raise the salience of Britain's membership in the European Union--at one time a very niche concern among boffins obsessed with constitutional arcana--by linking it to mass immigration, so too he may have luck pulling off a similar feat with net zero by relating it to less technical, more bread-and-butter concerns like the cost-of-living. The resources that Heartland UK/Europe can provide, both intellectual and financial, are bound to be invaluable. In truth, this kind of American presence in Britain could neither be better timed nor more sorely needed. Evidence suggests that the UK is currently engaged in a mortifying contest with Justin Trudeau's Canada to see who can claim the ultimate nagging rights as the most poorly governed, declining nation in the Anglosphere. Nowhere is our bid for this title stronger than in the British state's quixotic, utopian obsession with 'achieving' net zero emissions. Cheap, efficient, dependable energy is the lifeblood of an advanced industrial economy. Without it, capital is harder to come by, homes are more expensive to heat, and people's overall quality of life goes down. It was in 2019 that the wretched Conservative Party committed Britain, as a matter of law, to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Initially carried out under Theresa May, the cause was enthusiastically taken up by Boris Johnson and seems to be even dearer to the hearts of the cosmopolitan trendies now running the Labour government. The problem with such rigid targets, of course, is that even the most high-minded ends do not generate their own means. Very often, we cannot know in advance whether pursuing a specific goal decades hence is possible. Even if we do know it to be possible, is it practicable? And even if we can say with confidence that it is practicable, what are the costs? Are they worth it? Who will bear them? Net Zero is framed by its cheerleaders, whether in government or in the media, as the answer to a question. Rarely does anyone pause to consider the interminable list of further questions it provokes about its potential impact on the economy and the lives of ordinary people. Yet rather than attending to such 'inconvenient details,' the Labour government under Keir Starmer has instead dutifully hacked away at the UK economy--and weaponised science--in the hope that some path to this legally in-built destination may emerge. Since entering office, Labour have banned the awarding of new oil exploration licences in the North Sea, committed to spending PS8.3 billion on Great British Energy over the course of this parliament, presided over the closure of the last coal-fired power station, instructed the Bank of England to give climate change equal consideration alongside monetary stability, unveiled plans to intensify 'green' efforts by turning the electricity grid net zero by 2030, vowed to outlaw new petrol cars by the same year, reinstated a 'boiler tax' with heat pump targets for installers and fines for anyone who misses them, and imposed stringent eco-standards on landlords, driving up the cost of rent. It is little wonder that Britain now has the most expensive industrial energy costs in the world. The Heartland Institute is a long-standing opponent of such weaponisation of science. They view the scientific enterprise as a process and a method, not a moment or a catechism. This is because all true scientists proceed, as the philosopher Karl Popper urged, by ""conjecture and refutation""--the idea being that any scientific knowledge we believe ourselves to have grasped, while it may have proved itself against attempts at falsification, should be treated as provisional. Managerial politics is what happens when claims to scientific knowledge are instead treated as unquestionable certainties and enlisted to justify large-scale social engineering projects. And, in textbook managerialist style, the central planners conscripting the rest of us into whatever mission they happen to prize will for the most part be insulated from the unglamorous consequences of their grand designs. In the case of the net zero agenda, it is ordinary working people--those for whom the Labour Party claims to speak--who are suffering, and will continue to suffer, most of all. One saving grace is that this means their political loyalties will be up for grabs over the next five years. With the intellectual heft and scientific firepower of the Heartland Institute now behind him, Farage stands an even greater chance--not just of winning people over, but keeping them on-side with practical results if he ever makes it to No. 10.",The European Conservative,2024-12-20T12:35:09,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/are-net-zeros-days-numbered/
Our New Year Message: No Surrender,"Welcome to the new europeanconservative.com . We are the Brussels-based daily news and comment website with a difference, committed to reclaiming and advancing the founding principles of European civilisation--and fighting for the future of a free and democratic Europe. As we enter 2025, there is good news and not-so-good news for us to report about the changing world. On the downside, the world economy is teetering on the edge of crisis again, not least in the European Union. And global geopolitics is becoming an unstable minefield, with rival power blocs manoeuvring against the background of war in Ukraine and the Middle East. The good news is that politics in Europe and the West is also changing--for the better. We are witnessing a growing national-populist revolt against the old discredited political establishment. europeanconservative.com aims to give a voice to the populist revolt from the EU and the UK to the U.S. The daily coverage from our Brussels news bureau and international writers will be informed by the principles on which europeanconservative.com stands: for democracy, national sovereignty, free speech, and the values of Judeo-Christian civilisation. We stand for democracy as defined by its Ancient Greek inventors: the union of the demos-- the people--and kratos-- power or control. We will oppose and expose the political elitists in Brussels and beyond who would keep those two elements as far apart as possible. We are at the dawn of a new European 'Spring of Nations' or 'People's Spring.' The first one, in 1848, was marked by a series of national-democratic revolutions against the ancient regimes that led to important reforms, such as the final abolition of serfdom in Hungary. Europe's new People's Spring is a democratic uprising against the leftist Brussels oligarchs and their allies, who have imposed destructive policies from mass immigration to Net Zero on millions of ordinary Europeans, whom they see as little more than modern-day serfs. Our daily coverage will tell you what the conformist mainstream media won't, expose the truth about what is happening within the Brussels 'bubble,' and decode what EU policies really mean for the lives of Europeans. We will judge Europe's leaders by what they do, not what they say about themselves. We stand for national sovereignty, the only basis on which democracy has ever thrived, by allowing a people to take control of their own affairs. We will insist that the national governments of Europe exist to serve those who elect them, not to follow the orders of unelected Brussels bureaucrats who hate national borders as a barrier to their globalist agenda. We stand for unfettered freedom of speech, as the lifeblood of a free and democratic society. europeanconservative.com will defend the right to express unpopular and ""offensive"" opinions, against the rising tide of censorship and cancel culture. In particular, we will continue to expose the political elites' war on ""fake news"" and ""disinformation"" online as simply their latest attempt to control and curtail democratic debate. Policing the language we use is their first step to controlling how we think and act. And europeanconservative.com stands ready to fight the culture wars against Europe's powerful woke zealots, on everything from trans ideology to 'decolonising' education. We will uphold real freedom and equality against the repressive and divisive bigotry of identity politics. While reporting and commenting on these big issues, europeanconservative.com aims to be much more than a passive observer. We will stand with the people against the establishment; with farmers, parents, and all those trying to defend basic European traditions and freedoms against woke culture warriors; and with the Israelis against Islamists and their useful idiots in the West, as the front line in the war between civilisation and barbarism. The stakes are high in 2025. Every belief that has been fundamental to the development of our civilisation--from Western history to human biology, from Judeo-Christian culture to Enlightenment values--is now being called into question or condemned. It has never been more important to uphold and develop the heritage of ideas that emerged through the historic evolution of Western society. Not because we dream of returning to the past, but to defend today the foundations on which we can build for tomorrow. As an English journalist and editor of more than 40 years standing, I am proud and privileged to have been asked to take up the cudgels and become the new editor-in-chief of the new europeanconservative.com , raising a Europe-wide voice for freedom. I am also something of a veteran of the struggle for democracy and national sovereignty, having worked in communications for Nigel Farage with both the Brexit Party, when we won the 2019 European elections, and Reform UK, during the breakthrough 2024 UK general election. Alongside deputy editor Zsofia Toth-Biro, we will be developing a lot of new features and audio-visual content over the coming months. Watch this space, every day. The wars that matter in 2025 are not only in Ukraine and the Middle East. We are also engaged in a political war for the soul of Europe, against those who would erase its past in order to control its future. It is a war that we can win, if we recognise what is at stake, stand by our principles, and refuse to be intimidated by those who will try to slur any opposition as ""far-right"" and want to turn populism into a dirty word.

Inside the Centrist Battle for Europe: Is Macronism on its Deathbed?,"European centrists are in the midst of a quiet but fierce battle for ideological dominance within the European Union, and at the heart of this conflict lies French President Emmanuel Macron. His attempts to push a liberal rebrand of Gaullism, ""strategic autonomy,"" has run headlong into the Atlanticist neo-liberal priorities of European Commission (EC) President Ursula von der Leyen. Macron's audacious dream--to position the EU as a global geopolitical player in its own right--has been thwarted by the EU Commission's attempt to double down on its neoliberal fantasy of becoming a regulatory superpower. From the forced resignation of French Commissioner Thierry Breton to the passage of the Artificial Intelligence Act and EU-Mercosur free trade agreement, Macron is increasingly unable to combat the authority of the EC, largely because of his own weakness. Unable to mount the Gaullist muscle of his predecessors against the EC, Macron has failed to push back against the Commission's ever-tightening grip. His commitment to the European project has essentially tied his hands in a fight that requires far more than diplomatic niceties. Macron's recent political woes are linked to his failure to secure vital French interests against the overreach of the Commission, such as the EU- Mercosur free trade agreement. Macron condemned it as ""unacceptable,"" warning of its potential to flood France's agricultural sector with cheap South American imports. Yet, despite his objections, the deal sailed through. His failure to prevent its passage is a clear reflection of the power imbalance between Paris and Brussels--one that has added to his plummeting domestic support. Macron's popularity, as of February 6th, sits at a 76% disapproval rating according to Politico . The European Parliament elections on June 9th saw a humiliating loss for Macron's electoral support in France and Renew Europe's influence in Brussels. Failing to compete with the European People's Party, the Macronist spearhead into European institutions has lost its lustre because of its spineless approach to negotiations with Brussels. The French President's Faustian bargain to call snap elections after such a defeat only accelerated his plummeting influence in Europe as his party came in second place after the left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire. Then there's the case of Thierry Breton. The French Commissioner resigned on September 16th after a bitter clash with Commission President von der Leyen, over her centralising style of governance through the control of individual Commissioners' actions, and Breton's rogue letter to X CEO Elon Musk regarding the platform's non-compliance with European censorship regulation. Breton's forced resignation wasn't just a clash of personalities, but stark evidence of Macron's diminished influence and ability to combat the EC's demands even with regard to the appointment of Commissioners, a right ostensibly vested in individual member states. Macron's credibility took another hit in February with the French AI Action Summit held on February 10th. Designed to secure European involvement in the emerging industry, Macron's event was pre-emptively sabotaged by von der Leyen's Artificial Intelligence Act, which Paris failed to change. Such Commission regulations, contrary to Macronist goals, have reduced the competitiveness of the European economy and allowed American firms such as Microsoft to poach valuable tools such as the French AI start-up Mistral AI. As Franco-German leadership has become too weak to stand up against Ursula von der Leyen's cadre of unelected technocrats in Brussels, their economic interests are at the mercy of destructive policy measures such as the Commission's commitment to ban petrol and diesel cars by 2035 in its quest to reach its 2025 net-zero carbon emission target. In the past, foreign leaders speaking to Europe did so through the French and German governments in recognition of their economic dominance of the EU. Today, the once unthinkable idea that even diplomatic authority might be controlled by bureaucrats in Brussels is a reality, with the Common Foreign and Security Policy increasingly in the Commission's hands. In a February 17th post following a meeting that included Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Macron stated work on European security would ""continue based on the European Commission's proposals, both in supporting Ukraine and in developing and investing in our defense."" Macron's subordination to the European Commission on security matters has shattered his prior independent diplomatic strategies, like the one that saw him meet with Vladimir Putin in February 2022 before the invasion of Ukraine began. Even Macron's February 24th meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was a diplomatic mission to directly express the opinions of the EU Commission towards the peace deal in Ukraine. With French leadership of the European project in decline and the EU Commission further centralising power and influence outside the hands of member state leaders, von der Leyen appears to have won the battle for European centrism. But the story may not be over yet. With President Donald Trump back in the White House and the trans-Atlantic relationship facing new strains, the Commission may seek to pivot towards its own brand of strategic autonomy--on von der Leyen's terms.",The European Conservative,2025-03-04T19:14:29,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/inside-the-centrist-battle-for-europe-is-macronism-on-its-deathbed/
Trump Breaks Spell of Liberal Enchantment,"Got this text from a European conservative friend on Sunday, referring to the Zelensky tea party in the Oval Office on Friday: ""The Europeans, including many conservatives, are going crazy. They are messaging me that the U.S. joined Putin and we need to build nuclear weapons asap."" Gosh. Well, they aren't going to like this Sunday night social media missive from the U.S. president: Meanwhile, after a weekend emergency summit of European leaders (plus Canada's Justin Trudeau) in London, Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the British people that his government is prepared to deploy troops and aircraft to defend Ukraine. Good luck with that. In 2023, a senior U.S. general told the then-Defense Secretary that the British army, which is at its lowest manpower level since the Napoleonic wars, had declined so much in recent years that it is "" an entire service unable to protect the UK and our allies. "" Mary Harrington, a prominent British conservative commentator, responded to Starmer by tweeting, ""Not a single one of Britain's sons should be sacrificed for a regime that won't defend Britain's borders."" Starmer, like his European counterparts, might have a different war on his hands before long. In a stunning podcast interview with Louise Perry, a King's College, London, scholar who studies civil wars, warned that Britain is rushing headlong into domestic strife, chiefly over mass migration and its disruptive effects. In fact, said professor David Betz, the Starmer government's policies are a textbook case of how to lay the groundwork for civil war. Betz added that conditions are the same across Western Europe. If only European leaders showed as much concern about stopping mass migration as they do about stopping Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, Europe might save itself. Besides, who are European governments going to enlist to fight for Ukraine? A 2024 Gallup survey found relatively small numbers of Europeans willing to fight in a war involving their own country. In the EU overall, 46% said they would not fight; only 31% said they would. 50% of Britons said they would not fight, along with 57% of Germans, and a staggering 78% of Italians would refuse to join combat. The number for the United States is much better (34% refuse to fight), but still alarming. This is no doubt an effect of two decades of astoundingly expensive U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that accomplished little or nothing, leaving many combat veterans permanently damaged. And, as the U.S. armed forces leadership has enthusiastically embraced DEI, an increasing number of American conservatives--long stalwart supporters of the military--have turned their backs on it. It turns out that the segment of the American population that disproportionately provides soldiers, sailors, and airmen would prefer that their sons not risk their lives to queer the Donbas. In polling done prior to the Trump-Vance-Zelensky showdown in the White House, European publics are mixed in their views about Ukraine policy. Europeans generally support continuing to stand with Ukraine, but the American president has now, to use the poker term, called their bluff. Will they do so if it involves the possibility of European troops on the ground there, risking direct conflict with Russia, with no guarantee of U.S. backing if the shooting starts? Are they prepared to pay higher taxes and see reductions in welfare for Ukraine's sake? We shall see. As an American living in Europe, who loves Europe, it is painful to see this breach between the U.S. and its NATO allies. But as I wrote here over the weekend , that which cannot last forever eventually won't. One does not have to admire Vladimir Putin or support his aggression against Ukraine to believe that the world has changed, and that continuing a losing battle against Russia in Ukraine is not worth it. Trump's turn on NATO is a shock too to many Americans, who have grown accustomed to the postwar arrangement. But Trump understands what establishment figures do not: that U.S. voters are no longer willing to allow Washington to write checks on the American people's account. Russia might be a threat to Europe, but it's not as big a threat as that posed by uncontrolled mass migration that brings into the continent unassimilated and hostile minorities. Moreover, the ability of governments and their liberal media allies to suppress discontent by demonizing Europeans who notice what their elites are doing to their nations, and hate it, is waning. It is terribly sad for Ukraine, but both the U.S. and its NATO allies have sent hundreds of billions of dollars in financial aid and weaponry to Kyiv to help it resist Russia--and after three years, the effort has stalemated. Meanwhile, the war has had dramatically negative effects on Europe's economy, especially Germany's. Should American and European publics continue to impoverish themselves and risk World War III for the sake of a lost cause? Or should Western leaders find another way? Sometimes in world affairs, the choice is not good policy versus bad policy, but bad policy versus worse policy. The United States, Britain, and their allies had to make common cause with Stalin, one of history's greatest monsters, to destroy another of history's greatest monsters, Hitler. After the war, the liberty of Eastern European countries was sacrificed to Stalin to keep the peace. As awful as that was, the alternative--more war--was even worse. It is Europe's right to decide where to go from here regarding Ukraine--but even Starmer recognized in his weekend statement that nothing is possible without the United States. As unpleasant as it is, Trump is forcing Europeans to face their own collective weakness and to make hard choices based on the world that is--not the world that was for the 50 or 60 years after World War II, and then immediately following the Cold War. Moral power is not the same thing as material might. In a story that might be legend, Stalin was supposedly told in 1943 that the Pope might be influencing Western diplomacy. ""The Pope?"" the dictator said. ""How many divisions does he have?"" A cruel and cynical remark? Of course. But Stalin had a point. The Ukraine conflict now calls into question--how many divisions does Europe have? That is, what are European nations, whose moral support for the Ukrainian cause is undeniable, prepared to sacrifice to continue backing Kyiv? Acerbic British historian David Starkey said over the weekend that, like it or not, the postwar order is over. The American-led West is no longer an unchallenged hegemon on the global stage. The failed wars to spread liberal values to Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have discredited the ""end of history"" worldview. ""We've been lying to ourselves,"" said Starkey. The conservative historian went on to say that the government of the United Kingdom refuses to defend its own frontiers and persecutes ordinary Britons for asserting traditional patriotic values. ""And yet,"" said Starkey, ""we are supposedly all going to line up and fight for patriotic values in another country when we're suppressing them in our own!"" He blasted successive British governments for living on moralistic vanities while presiding over the absolute economic decline of the country. Westminster follows, says Starkey, ""a policy at home and abroad of entire rhetorical fiction."" ""They somehow believe that incantating the right words will somehow bring about policy and change. ...What Trump is doing, and it's magnificent--he's crude, he's brutal, he's in many ways preposterous, this orange figure--but he's confronting people with the fact that there are brutal facts. The world is real . You can't magic it. Indeed. The spell of liberal enchantment is broken. Official Washington is learning this now, the hard way, under the new administration. Now, it's time for Brussels, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and everybody else on this side of the Atlantic to face brutal facts.",The European Conservative,2025-03-03T16:39:45,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/europe-ukraine-war-russia-trump/
Realism Vindicated,"Four years ago, the election of Joe Biden as America's commander-in-chief was celebrated by the left-wing press as the return of sanity to the White House. Trump, it was broadly claimed by the professional commentariat, had placed the world a step away from World War III. The old establishment, aptly personified by a geriatric Biden, would now use its capital of experience to rebuild global tranquility. The opposite happened-- and dramatically so. Instead of a world pacified under the torch of Washington's leadership, Biden's inept presidency now appears to have been the final nail in the coffin of the Pax Americana . If the Democrats had wished to preserve the so-called 'rules-based international order' -- that is, the hegemony of the United States under the ideological cloak of liberal internationalism -- they can, rather, pride themselves in accelerating its demise. Even the fiercest opponent of the Afghanistan war -- as was this writer -- will probably recognise that Biden's disgraceful, Saigon-like evacuation of Kabul did little to reassure the world of the permanence of American power. That was the harbinger of disasters to come: a resurgent Russia soon saw an opening to act on its grievances in Ukraine; Beijing has now made its regular sea-and-air blockades of Formosa the new status quo ; Hamas struck in Israel in October 2023, as have, repeatedly afterwards, Iran's long-range missile forces; the Red Sea remains blocked by the Tehran-aligned Houthis, with the U.S. Navy apparently unable to stop them . With Ukraine's defeat in the battlefield looming ominously near, Biden upped the ante by allowing Kyiv to hit internationally recognised, sovereign Russian territory with U.S.-made missiles -- thus putting an already chaotic world one step closer to nuclear armageddon. Trump's arrival at the White House can't come soon enough. Of course, not all of the world's recent catastrophes can fairly be blamed on Biden and his clumsy entourage. Ultimately, the global order is determined by the balance of power, and that balance had been shifting against the West -- and, crucially, America -- long before the Democrats won the 2020 election. Back in the 1950s, the U.S. alone was responsible for about half of the world's entire industrial output; today, China is the world's first, at around 31% of all manufacturing, and the U.S. is second, with 15%. The People's Republic is impatiently engaged in the largest naval buildup since the days of Gorshkov and Tirpitz, building the equivalent of Britain's Royal Navy every 12 months. The nation's shipyards produce 51% of all merchant shipping in the world; the U.S. produces 0.1%. In 2023, China's scientists registered almost two million patents. America's were second, with just over half a million. Indeed, it would have been unthinkable, just twenty years ago, that Europe would soon be begging the Chinese for technology transfers rather than the other way around--yet, as The Financial Times recently reported , that is exactly where we are today. Rumors of Russia's economic death, too, have been greatly exaggerated -- despite worries with inflation, the country's economy has performed strongly in recent years and will likely achieve a growth rate of over 4% this year. It's a new era of international politics -- a new order. Of course, Biden can hardly be blamed for these general trends. But the blob he represents -- the transnational, indeed anti-national, liberal establishment that has in recent decades ruled over us--has presided over an unprecedentedly fast transfer of power away from the West and towards its main geopolitical competitors. A large part of the process has been fueled by hubris. Even as they praised globalisation and, with it, the offshore-isation and desindustrialisation of the West, an exorbitant immodesty led the liberal elites to assume that the world longed to become like them : that the West's political and economic institutions were so superb, so insuperable, that the 'end of History' was at hand--that there would be no more to the future of humanity than the uninspired imitation of Western (liberal) recipes. Enriched by Western investment, softened by modern comfort, their middle classes would surely rebel against their authoritarian apparatuses. China, it was frankly believed, could well be empowered at a neck-breaking pace, transformed from an isolated communist backwater into the globe's primary industrial power in just a generation -- it would soon become a democracy-loving, LGBT-friendly, latte-sipping, pacifist Denmark of East Asia. Turns out it hasn't. Shattered by the unexpected implosion of the 'end of History' Weltanschauung , the liberal elites have flatly refused any effort at exegesis or introspection. At home, they blame the wickedness and gullibility of the common man--and, with it, the great evil of 'desinformation.' Abroad, they blame their failures on the 'malicious' intentions of their competitors, as if there is no more complexity to great power politics than are found in Batman . A more mature, realist-minded political class would have understood that states act in accordance to their perceived interest, seeking to preserve and expand their power; that, as accurately predicted by men of note such as George Kennan , William Burns , or John Mearsheimer , Russia would react energetically to Western attempts to vassalise its traditional sphere of interest--and, as Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in his 1997 classic The Grand Chessboard : Potentially, the most dangerous scenario would be a grand coalition of China, Russia, and perhaps Iran, an ""antihegemonic"" coalition united not by ideology but by complementary grievances. It would be reminiscent in scale and scope of the challenge once posed by the Sino-Soviet bloc, though this time China would likely be the leader and Russia the follower. Averting this contingency, however remote it may be, will require a display of U.S. geostrategic skill on the western, eastern, and southern perimeters of Eurasia simultaneously. If the avoidance of such a scenario necessitated ""a display of U.S. geostrategic skill,"" bringing it to life, too, is testament to the exceptional lack of foresight and talent that characterises the West's foreign policy establishment. None of the three great Eurasian states alluded to by Brzezinski is the others' natural friend: Iran has historically had little love for Russia, whose leaders, monarchical or communist, expelled Persia from Azerbaijan, threatened it during the Great Game, and invaded it during the Second World War. China and Russia, for their part, have overlapping imperial ambitions in central Asia and Siberia. Vladimir Putin once famously proclaimed, at the now distant beginnings of his reign, that China would be Moscow's greatest threat in the future--suspicion towards Asia is deeply ingrained in the Russian spirit, ever mindful of what it remembers as 'the Mongol Yoke.' So is a fascination with Europe. Russia is a great peripheral state whose destiny has always been to model itself after some form of Western civilisation, whether with Vladimir the Great converting his realm to Greek Orthodoxy, Peter I adopting the Dutch flag as his own, or the Bolsheviks implementing, through unmatched means of human suffering, the ideas of one famous German resident of London--Karl Marx. All in all, keeping these countries closer to the West than to each other was far from an impossible task. Yet the blob failed miserably at it. Even as Biden pompously mimicked Roosevelt by calling for a renewed ""arsenal of democracy,"" the practical consequence of his policies was to drain it. At the worst possible time, no less. Not only did neocon and neolib overextension help forge an otherwise unlikely anti-Western coalition, it continues, through its bungling, to weaken us to their advantage. While Russia's army has ballooned from a pre-war 200,000 men-strong force that was ill-trained and in many ways stuck in the '80s to a behemoth numbering 600,000 battle-hardened veterans proficient in drone warfare and other advanced technologies, Western militaries remain wholly untested in peer-to-peer conflict. Although we were repeatedly promised by the Biden team that war would militarily exhaust Russia, serious men in uniform warn, instead, that the Russian military is now larger and more capable than it has been in decades. It gets worse. In recent times, Western militaries have reported a crippling lack of all sorts of materiel, from the British Army barely having any artillery left to the country's overall stockpiles being essentially depleted . Indeed, the situation is so dramatic that two years ago, only a few months after the beginning of the hostilities, National Defense reported that U.S. stockpiles of ammunition and equipment had been left ""significantly depleted"" by the transfers to Ukraine. What Trump will find when he returns to the Oval Office, after three years of massive handouts, is anyone's guess. How he will be supposed to properly dissuade the Chinese from mounting an assault on Taiwan, the Iranians from engaging in further regional adventurism or, indeed, the Russians from expanding their ambitions in eastern Europe is surely one of the darkest questions of our time. One thing is certain, however: Biden's legacy is dire. Realism is vindicated, its urgency even more eloquently exposed by its detractors than by its proponents. The outgoing U.S. President's strategy of speaking loudly and carrying a small stick has failed to deter; it has emboldened and solidified anti-Western coalitions. It has brought Europe--and, indeed, the entire human species--to the brink of thermonuclear war. Trumpism 2.0. offers the hope of a different path. Trump's second term in office might yet usher in what could be described as a neo-Kissingerism: a program of peace through strength, but also through balance and intelligent consideration. As Western muscle has weakened, at least in relative terms, Western strategy must become sharper. Like the great diplomat and the admirable president whom Kissinger served, Richard Nixon, so too must the new America have the courage to spare itself the burdens that threaten to weaken it--in the '60s and '70s, Vietnam; today, Ukraine--to choose the path of clever diplomacy, drive Moscow away from Beijing, and direct its industrial and military resources towards realistic, attainable goals. Only these steps will allow the West to rebuild a balance of power that lowers global tension and safeguards its most crucial interests. Only by implementing them can Western strength and prosperity be protected, reinforced, and rejuvenated. But for that we must hurry--the clock is ticking.",The European Conservative,2024-12-13T12:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/realism-vindicated/
Beyond Trump v. Zelensky: A New World of Nation States,"People rushed to take sides in the row between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For many in Europe, it allegedly proved that Trump is some sort of cross between a Hitler clone and a Putin puppet. For others, especially in America, it apparently showed that Zelensky is an ingrate dictator unfit to be taken seriously. Never mind for now that neither of those caricatures is true. More importantly, the narrow focus on the personalities of the presidents risks missing the far bigger picture. Because that war of words in the White House was about more than Ukraine's bloody battle with Russia or America's ambitions to mine rare earths in eastern Europe. In dramatic fashion, it signalled the overdue end of the old world order. In tearing up the accepted etiquette of diplomacy on live TV, President Trump also signalled to allies and enemies alike that the established rules and conventions of international relations no longer apply. The question is now, what comes next? For 35 years since the end of the Cold War, we have been assured by Western experts and political elites that the globalist world order had brought the end of history, the end of major international conflicts, and the end of the importance of national sovereignty. Instead, global affairs would be smoothly managed by technocrats in supra-national institutions from the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World Health Organisation to the European Union (and especially the European Commission). We were assured that these globalists knew what was best for the rest of us, and that we should sit back and let them run the world. Over the past decade, however, we have witnessed a growing gap between globalist claims and the real world. The old U.S.-led unipolar order has been challenged by the emergence of regional blocs with the rise of China, India, and Russia. And even more importantly, the nation-state has reappeared on the world stage as a central player. There has been an upsurge of insurrectionary national populist parties across Europe and around the globe, a revolt against the globalist elites as people demand that their interests are represented and their voices heard. Trump's shouting match with Zelensky sounded the death knell for a world order that has been dying on its feet anyway. What now? An insightful article in the latest issue of the leading U.S. journal Foreign Affairs, entitled ""The World Trump Wants,"" outlines the future of ""American Power in the New Age of Nationalism"". We are indeed entering an era when nation-states will need to look to their own sovereignty and defence. The trouble is, however, that too many Western leaders today do not believe in the nations they rule over. The globalist elites have spent years telling us that national sovereignty--and by implication, national democracy--is an outdated idea in the modern world. In 2016, shortly after the British people showed what they thought of such globalist notions by voting for Brexit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker even declared that national borders ""are the worst invention ever made by politicians"". In the years since then, Western cultural elites have done all in their power to trash the history of their own nations and civilisation. When Putin's Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe's leaders suddenly and entirely unconvincingly claimed to have rediscovered the importance of defending national sovereignty. Yet in response to the current crisis, too many of them are still clinging to the wreck of the old supra-national order, with the likes of EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen claiming that 'Europe' needs to step up with more centralised defence spending and forces. As national conservative opponents have pointed out, globalist leaders who have shown they are incapable of defending their own national borders are in no position to fight to defend Ukraine's. The elites' bold talk is hollow. Belief in national sovereignty is not something you can turn on and off like a tap. Indeed, behind their empty bravado, the old European elites' true feelings of mistrust for sovereignty and democracy remain deeply ingrained. Thus they see Trump's disruption of their cosy world as a problem of populism. After all, he was elected to do this. Too much democracy! That prejudice is encouraging Europe's old centrist parties to huddle together, trying to form anti-democratic coalition governments in Germany and elsewhere that can keep the insurgent 'far-right' populists at bay. But no paper deals can turn back the tide of historic change. Those group pictures of European statesmen trying to appear determined over Ukraine this week looked (with the exception of Italy's right-wing premier Georgia Meloni) like a funereal shot of dead leaders walking. If we are entering a ""New Age of Nationalism"", we will need national leaders who can inspire their people to stand up for their sovereignty and democracy. This is far more than a question of spending more money on defence. It is about having the political will and determination to give some meaning to patriotism. There is much to be done. The years of woke indoctrination and failed globalist military adventures have taken a heavy toll on a generation; as our columnist Rod Dreher points out, polls across Europe show depressingly high numbers of young people now say they would not fight to defend their nations. Perhaps a genuine crisis might reverse that sentiment, as happened in Israel after the October 7th Islamist pogrom. But who wants to wait for disaster and take that chance? Europe's real hope still lies in the people, many of whom have shown that they have had enough of seeing their traditions and way of life rubbished by rulers who occupy another world. Our job now is to do all we can to advance the national populist revolt. We live in interesting, unstable, and dangerous times. President Trump has shown that all the old easy bets are off. We cannot leave it to failed globalist technocrats to gamble with the future of our sovereignty and democracy.",The European Conservative,2025-03-04T18:26:30,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/democracy-watch/beyond-trump-v-zelensky-a-new-world-of-nation-states/
Manufacturing Dissent in Eastern Europe: The Power of Foreign State Propaganda,"Eastern Europe has troubles--as do many countries East and West --given the geopolitics of today, but while some are internal, a fair measure of them is not. These externals tend to be driven by powerful political forces seeking to fulfill their own political agendas--and for the latter that''s about control: economic and political. It is beyond doubts that there are forces external to these countries. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico has formally requested that Elon Musk (head of DOGE ) disclose detailed information about American grants allocated to Slovak NGOs and media outlets through USAID , Washington's primary agency for funding political projects abroad. In a letter to DOGE chief Musk--who previously branded USAID a ""criminal organization"" --Fico voiced concerns over what he described as ""gross interference"" in Slovakia's political landscape. ""It is undeniable that funds originating from USAID were also used for political purposes in Slovakia to distort the political system and favor specific political parties,"" Fico wrote in a letter shared on X last Tuesday. He urged Musk to disclose which NGOs, media outlets, and individual journalists had received U.S. funding. Last week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban similarly announced that his government would seek full transparency regarding USAID grants to NGOs and media outlets critical of his administration, emphasizing the need to ""eliminate these foreign networks"" that interfere in the country's domestic affairs. In one of his first executive orders after taking office, President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid ($68.2 billion), pending a review of its alignment with U.S. national interests. Pursuant to these orders, President Trump's administration has frozen all funding to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the USAID. The NED has faced longstanding criticism over its role in supporting political movements to undermine sovereign governments. One example of such suspected undermining is Georgia's case. The Tbilisi government is currently dealing with external forces regarding the recent law just passed requiring media and nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit groups to register as ""pursuing the interests of a foreign power"" if they receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad. The republic's efforts to adopt its own law on the disclosure of foreign agent funding sources in the country has produced major pushback from the West , even to the point of threats of sanctions. The law, of course, will make ""influence peddling"" through corruption much more difficult for those countries with money to spread around, and that likely would be the West. As Reuters comments, ""Georgian parliament passes 'foreign agent' bill, prompting US anger, new protests."" Romanian politician Calin Georgescu, labeled as ""far right"" by the opposition, came seemingly out of nowhere to secure first place in the first round of the now-annulled presidential elections held on November 24 of last year. Georgescu's lawyer said that the annulment decision was a flagrant violation of the constitution. ""We are in a situation of a coup d'etat."" The decision came amid declassified reports alleging Russian involvement in cyber activities aimed at undermining the integrity of the electoral process. ""What is happening today in Romania, which is completely illegal, could set an extremely dangerous precedent worldwide. I hope that the law will be respected and that there will be no deviations from the will of the Romanian people,"" Calin Georgescu said . The official claim of Russian meddling rested directly and exclusively on a specific set of intelligence documents on the matter, first submitted in a closed National Security Council meeting on 28 November and then hastily declassified on 4 December by the sitting President in order to ""inform"" the Constitutional Court's decision. But the reports contained no actual evidence of the sort. Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state and presidential candidate, notably popularized the tactic of blaming Russia following her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election--a claim Moscow has consistently denied--and the FBI later admitted was a fraud. Western mainstream political parties continuously blaming Russian meddling for electoral failures are increasingly out of touch with voters, as U.S. Vice President JD Vance has rightly pointed out, criticizing the 'Russian meddling' narrative during his recent visit to Munich.. The truth is that all countries, irrespective of their political theater, attempt to influence voter preferences in other countries through their intelligence apparatus and its NGO and media assets. A fortiori, not every election that does not go the way of the EU ruling elite can be attributed to the machinations of the Kremlin. Clearly, the troubles in the countries of Eastern Europe are not necessarily internal,and certainly, not necessarily of their own making; these states have become a 'battleground' for powerful external forces seeking to exert a measure of control over them. The question is: Can these countries succeed as independent nation-states, given the external economic and political forces which plague their sovereignty? East European nations are at a crossroads in their history. There are either/or choices before them: e Either stay with the status quo of historical inertia or reclaim their identity. To do the former is easy. But to do the latter they must rely on being the courageous people they have always been - and rid themselves of their historical dependency on others.The East Europeans have a choice to make about their identity --about who they are: master of their own consciousness or slave to another's.",The European Conservative,2025-02-28T13:23:59,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/east-europe-western-interfering-usaid-eu-georgia-slovakia-hungary-romania/
Notre Dame Reopens: Ancient Glory vs. Modern Disaster,"After five years of hard work, Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris has finally risen from the ashes. A titanic task, which does justice to the extraordinary mobilisation and expertise of the French craftsmen and those who assisted them. But the ceremonies to reopen the building left us with mixed feelings. Speaking as a Frenchwoman, as a Catholic, there are many reasons to rejoice at this achievement. Like millions of people around the world, my heart sank as I watched the magnificent nave being devoured by tongues of fire one evening in April 2019, just a few days before Easter, and then the roof structure giving way with a terrible crash. A strong feeling of irreparable loss gripped us all that evening, to the point where many tears flowed. And yet. Notre-Dame de Paris was the strongest. At the end of an extraordinary construction project, France's most famous cathedral has risen from the ashes. A thousand and one stories, each more moving and powerful than the last, have accompanied its fall and its resurrection. The story of the indifferent fireman who entered the burning building out of duty, only to emerge a believer , touched by grace. That of the firefighters' chaplain who, at the risk of his life, took it upon himself to go and save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament. The carpenters who, as one man, asked for their axes to be blessed before they set about preparing the oaks for the carpentry. There were also breathtaking images, so full of meaning in our grey, mystery-free world. The immortal shot of a ray of sunlight illuminating the altar amidst the rubble. These photos of the restored spire , taken with exaltation by Parisians as it rose once again into the Parisian sky--like the needle of a compass showing them the only direction worth following, that toward Heaven. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's: when many doubted, President Macron believed in it, and put all his authority in the balance (which goes to show that where there's a will, there's a way) to make it possible within these deadlines, at the price, thank God, of a certain number of adjustments of regulations and red tape to work, quickly and well. Confidence and enthusiasm are always there when the objective is noble and exhilarating. He entrusted the project to a worthy man, retired general Jean-Louis Georgelin, who died in 2023, unfortunately without having seen the end of this immense project. There have been enough thunderous failures since Macron took over as head of France for us not to give him a good mark, for once, on the Notre Dame restoration. But the cathedral's rehabilitation has also had its dark side, and the sordid stories are no less numerous than the high points. The ludicrous discussions about the possible transformation of the building, with wild suggestions ranging from an integrated cafe-restaurant to a glass roof-top . The pettiness of the mayor , Anne Hidalgo, who, while not wanting to spend a penny on Notre Dame, has found a way of making the construction site pay a tax. The torrents of hatred that poured down on the wealthy citizens who had generously put their hands in their pockets to finance the work. A quelques jours de la reouverture de Notre-Dame, je n'oublierai jamais qu'alors que les familles Bettencourt-Meyers et Arnault faisaient chacune un don de 200 MEUR, #AnneHidalgo , toute honte bue, exigeait du chantier de restauration une redevance de 25,4 MEUR, avant d'y renoncer... pic.twitter.com/2PEyGhGN40 The questionable choices made, against the wishes of heritage protection associations, such as the removal of the stained glass windows by Viollet-le-Duc in favour of contemporary creations, stubbornly desired by the evil trio formed by Emmanuel Macron, his Minister of Culture Rachida Dati, and Archbishop Msgr. Ulrich. The installation of hopelessly dysfunctional liturgical furnishings , devoid of all grace and meaning. You might think that all that is now behind us, and that the only thing that matters is the reopening of the church and the resumption of worship, effective on the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, on a beautiful and cold Sunday in December 2025. But the ceremonies held on December 7th and 8th remind us that nothing is won, and that much is irretrievably lost. As a Frenchwoman, as a Catholic, I should be rejoicing, but my heart isn't really in it. The restored Notre Dame is whiter than it has ever been. But with the soot that has been stripped from the stones, the repentance of men and the prayers accumulated within these walls over the centuries have been washed away to create a smooth, uneven face at the image of a hygienic modern world too proud of itself. A little of the soul of Notre Dame has gone. And what about the opening ceremony? With two days to go to celebrate the anniversary of the separation of Church and State, President Macron could not stop himself from speaking inside the cathedral, despite promises to the contrary. And his wife, Brigitte Macron, took communion with the archbishop, even though she lives with a man in a union that is anything but canonical, to say the least--all in a blissful unanimity maintained by a Church in France that no longer really knows where it stands. The official festivities gave rise to gigantic nonsense, providing a formidable factory of memes on social media. The liturgical vestments designed by high-profile fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac gave the impression that the ceremony was in the colours of Google or Microsoft Office, as the case may be--blithely trampling all over the liturgical calendar in the process. Many people who were not 'traditionalists' noticed this. 'Trad' abbots wearing white lace are to be blamed for their putative non-compliance with the directives of Vatican II, but anything goes for the official clergy, who do what they want, when they want. Vetements des eveques a Notre-Dame de Paris : des reactions aussi vives que les couleurs Avec ses creations comparees au logo de Google Chrome ou aux cartes du Uno, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac en prend plein la chasuble https://t.co/0daPwUOOnH Fr. Clement Barre commented on X : Basically, the problem with this garment, beyond any aesthetic appreciation, is that it escapes the common language of the Catholic liturgy. For a Christian, it does not say what is being celebrated. Instead, it summons up another language, with other references, other meanings... that of the artist, who in effect silences the Church to speak for him. And we are summoned to enter into this new language, which does not belong to us. The ceremony was sadly characterised by the omnipresence of ugliness. In the words of Cyrano de Bergerac's father, the poet Edmond Rostand, ""I thought I saw a long slug slide over a flower."" It is appalling to see the extent to which the modern church strives to present a repulsive image. Let's make the best of it: it's a formidable technique for bringing out the radiant beauty of the past. It would seem that the French have had a problem with opening ceremonies. After the controversy surrounding the Olympic Games, the ceremony at Notre Dame was a huge missed opportunity to speak to the greatest number of people--so much so that the choice of mediocrity and ugliness is never likely to win over the crowds. The public was expected to flock to the building, but a storm blew in from Paris. As a result, many visitors stayed at home. If, like the ancient Romans, we like to read divine will in the signs of the weather, we could say that Heaven was--a little--annoyed at the way things had turned out and wanted to send a reminder. The gaudy colours of the liturgical vestments speak only to a small caste of initiates satisfied that they have paid their dues to the prevailing progressivism. Another example: the musical programme. For a moment, a splendid Magnificat resounded under the vaults. But the 'awakening' ceremony for the organ disconcerted many. Made up of improvisation sequences on the majestic instrument, the vaults resounded with dissonant pieces in the purest vein of twentieth-century music, designed for aesthetes trapped in intellectualism. As amateur organist and editorialist Olivier Babeau humorously put it: ""It's been going on for 50 years. Time doesn't help, it just won't go away. And that's a problem. If music is meant to uplift, it must speak to the senses. For many people, this kind of music is more likely to keep them away from the altar because it's the stuff of pro-virtuoso musicians tired of harmonies."" It would have been so simple to choose something harmonious that would appeal to the humble heart of the man in the street, who has often lost his way in the faith and just wants to be amazed. Too simple. Modernity has forgotten the old Racine adage: ""The main rule is to please and to touch."" The signal had been given from on high, by Pope Francis , who, by refusing to travel to Paris, failed to see what an extraordinary opportunity the reopening of Notre Dame provided to speak to as many people as possible, and who preferred to send a dull message when he could, by his presence, have bowed the knee to a multi-secular reality that is a reference point for millions of people throughout the world. The party is ruined. I would have liked to be there, but the Notre Dame of December 7th is not quite mine. Fortunately, what remains is the inexorable power of those who conceived it, built it and supported it with their prayers. Its immense beauty continues to shine through beneath the garments of gaudy modernity with which it has been dressed. This Notre Dame is still standing, against all odds. I'm going to pay homage to her when the official din has died down.

JD Vance Breaks Another Taboo: Europe’s Christians Are Being Persecuted,"Vice President JD Vance confronted the European elites with their hypocrisies at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. He detailed the democratic failings of Europe's leaders; highlighted their fear of dissident voters who stubbornly insist on voting for populist parties; noted the growing migration crisis across the continent. But perhaps most importantly, he addressed an issue that few Western leaders are willing to discuss out loud: the growing censorship and prosecution of Europe's Christians. Vance's speech has become something of a Rorschach test. For some, it was a deplorable and deliberately disruptive salvo aimed at the heart of the post-war international order. For others, it was a desperately needed and long overdue exercise in difficult truth-telling. The speech was effective because Vance brought in specific details. He cited the case of Adam Smith-Connor --the man arrested after praying for his own aborted child near an abortion clinic in the UK, the first conviction for a thought-crime in modern Britain--and the draconian ""exclusion zones"" in Scotland , in which even thinking pro-life thoughts is illegal. Those outraged by Vance's speech dismissed these examples, and this is no surprise--they have been doing so for decades. The same commentators who are reduced to wild-eyed babbling over the Hungarian government declining to subsidize institutions opposed to its values are content to dismiss the arrests and prosecutions of Christians as a bug (if not a feature) of the ""norms"" they seek to defend. But Vance could have cited dozens of additional cases from the past few years. Anne Applebaum, for example, is one of the most prominent public prophets warning about the ""twilight of democracy"" in Europe , but has yet to mention the years-long persecution of Finnish politician Paivi Rasanen for merely quoting the Bible --and Rasanen isn't just a veteran like Smith-Connor. She was Finland's Minister of the Interior for 2011 to 2015. One would think that the criminal prosecution of a political leader for citing Scripture in public media interviews would be precisely the sort of thing Applebaum and her comrades are so concerned about. You would be wrong. But there is little doubt that if Rasanen was defending LGBT ideology in Hungary or Poland, the elites would rush to the barricades and shriek about the coming darkness. Others are thrilled that Vance was willing to speak out. As Lois McLatchie Miller, a senior legal communications officer with Alliance Defending Freedom International, told me: Vice President Vance's speech was a much-needed reflection of the dire state of fundamental freedoms in Europe. Adam Smith-Connor was prosecuted and convicted on the basis of his silent thoughts--it doesn't get much worse than that in a society that claims to be free. When individuals can be interrogated, arrested, prosecuted, and convicted for silent prayer, we must conclude that the state of fundamental freedoms is in crisis. Smith-Connor's arrest and conviction for thought crime is egregious, but his case is by no means an exception--as Vance pointed out in his speech. It isn't just Christians, but any dissident who dares to disagree publicly with LGBT ideology, abortion, or other establishment sacred cows. A few additional examples: The list goes on; groups like ADF International are kept very busy defending the rights of the censored and the suppressed. Many of these stories are easily sensational enough to warrant a column or two from the commentators currently warning us that Vance's speech is ""dangerous."" An ex-soldier who fought for his country put in handcuffs because he doesn't think men can become women? A Greek soccer star convicted for social media posts condemning an ideology that gained cultural dominance less than a decade ago? A prominent cabinet minister quoting from the Book that gave birth to our civilization? Crickets. Where were the defenders of the liberal order then? Vance's speech was potent precisely because it was true--but this is the first time someone with hard power said it out loud in front of the very leaders responsible for these speech regimes.",The European Conservative,2025-02-26T14:44:27,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/jd-vance-breaks-another-taboo-europes-christians-are-being-persecuted/
It’s Not Just Trump and Musk They Fear—It’s You and Me,"The contrast between the new and the old could hardly have been starker. At his Washington D.C. inauguration, new U.S. President Donald Trump galvanised his supporters by banging the drum for all of the populist policies that won him the election in November: protecting America's borders and stopping mass illegal immigration; trashing Net Zero madness and the 'green deal'; resisting trans activism and woke ideology; ending the political weaponisation of the law; defending free speech vs. cancel culture. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in the exclusive Swiss ski resort of Davos, far away from any garbage voters or deplorable citizens, leading supporters of everything that Trump spoke against huddled together for warmth at their annual elite carnival, the World Economic Forum (WEF). Members of the old European political establishment gathered with the megarich and powerful at the WEF, seeking to reassure each other that their cosy, closed world order really isn't coming to an end, included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and outgoing German chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, alongside his likely replacement, Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz. All chinking glasses with the likes of UK Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves. President Trump might have had to take cover inside the Washington Capitol Rotunda for his inauguration ceremony to escape sub-zero temperatures on the streets of DC. But in a changing world, it was the globalist elitists in snowy Davos who really seemed out in the political cold. As I wrote on europeanconservative.com in November, Trump's defeat of Democrat Washington insider Kamala Harris ""marks a new high point in the democratic revolt against Western elites."" His remarkable return to the White House was made possible by the same populist upsurge that has swept across Europe, bringing national conservatives to power from Italy and the Netherlands to Hungary and Austria, and shaking the centre of the European Union. The Brussels oligarchy and its media supporters have reacted by calling Trump a fascist, branding anybody who questions them 'far-right,' and now blaming Trumpist convert Elon Musk for allegedly corrupting European democracy by spreading 'disinformation' and 'hate speech' on X/Twitter. Hours after President Trump's inauguration, attended by Musk and other Big Tech titans such as Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, many left, green, and centrist Members of the European Parliament were queuing up at their plenary session in Strasbourg to denounce Musk and Meta for interfering in European elections, and to demand more online censorship. Meanwhile, Spain's embattled Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez, saying out loud what other European leaders were thinking, called on the EU to defend democracy against Musk and Trump. (Although, as with the Harry Potter villain, evil Lord Voldemort, he did not mention the new president's name.) Speaking for the powerful European Commission, Henna Virkkunen reassured those MEPs that Brussels will enforce even more stringent rules online, to protect Europeans from nasty words by policing speech and removing ""disinformation"" around the clock. Let us be clear what is happening here. In the EU and beyond, the globalist establishment does not want or need to defend democracy against the 'far right' or what Sanchez called the ""technocaste."" It wants to defend its own power and systems against the demos--the people--who have dared to re-elect rebel presidents and prime ministers and to express uncontrolled opinions on social media. They do not just fear Trump and Musk. They fear people like you and me. Trump did not create populism, and Musk has not invented freedom of speech. There is a global mass movement of normal people who have had enough of being treated with contempt, and are demanding that their voices should be heard and their interests represented. The volatile president and his fickly eccentric online champion have certainly played an important role. Trump has proved a catalyst for that populist revolt in the U.S., and Musk has helped to provide an opening that ensures the concerns of many people in the U.S., Europe, and beyond can no longer be ignored. But, as ever with left-liberal attacks on 'disinformation,' it is an insult to the electorate to suggest that they are being manipulated by Big Tech or by big-headed demagogues. When millions of Germans turn out to vote for the anti-migration party Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) next month, for instance, it will not be because Musk told them to. It will be because of the crisis in German society created by the open-door policies of the political establishment. Musk is certainly no Nazi, however he might wave his arms around at a rally. Nor is he an unambiguous hero of democracy, with his demands that King Charles should suspend the elected UK parliament in order to get rid of Keir Starmer's failing Labour government. A leader such as Trump, and a figure such as Musk, are both the products and the facilitators of the populist revolt. We shall see how firmly they stick to their avowed principles in practice; President Trump did not make the best start in helping to impose the disastrous ceasefire deal on Israel, potentially letting Hamas off the hook, although he has pledged to back an Israeli offensive if the Islamists break the deal. But whatever becomes of a Trump or a Musk or any other individual in the end, we can be sure that the mass populist revolt against the old Davos elites is not going away. The millions who have stood up and said that enough is enough are not going to be somehow turned back into obedient children. For now, let us celebrate the populist win with those who have been partying in Washington, and ignore the miserabilism of those whose champagne has gone flat in their Davos chateaus. The future is up for grabs. But it surely does not belong to them, however hard they try to stop us saying so.",The European Conservative,2025-01-24T19:18:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/democracy-watch/its-not-just-trump-they-fear-its-you-and-me/
Leftist French Press Magnate Proud To Control Journalists—for a Good Cause,"The year 2024 was marked in France by a rare campaign against media owned by the conservative Catholic billionaire Vincent Bollore. His media outlets were accused of disseminating false information, manipulating opinion, and breaching the ethics of 'journalistic neutrality.' But it seems the rules are not the same for everyone: at the start of 2025, the French left-wing media have no qualms about publicly unveiling their agenda to control public opinion--this time, on their terms and in the service of their ideas--and they see no reason to be concerned about it. The French media--particularly the press and television--have over the last few years undergone a massive process of consolidation and are now in the hands of a few large fortunes that own and more or less tightly control the majority of the private press outlets and television channels, which also receive public funding. In this landscape, one man has set about methodically shattering the consensus of political correctness: Vincent Bollore. Born into an old Breton family known for its involvement in the service of Free France during the Second World War, and with deep roots in the Brittany region, Bollore has built a reputation as a solid man who cares little about what people say--or about pressure from the mainstream media. With his undeniable business acumen, he runs successful companies, which, in the eyes of the Left, is one of his greatest flaws. In recent years, he has focused on the media, building a small empire that allows him to broadcast an alternative viewpoint to that of public service outlets. After setting his sights on television with the CNews channel, which has become France's leading news channel ahead of the established BFM TV channel , he has conquered prime positions in radio with the Europe 1 station. Finally, he challenged the print media by buying the widely circulated Le Journal du Dimanche , typically used by politicians of all stripes to communicate with the French public through interviews. Crimes such as these are not easily forgiven by the dominant media court. Throughout 2024, the attacks on the 'Bollore galaxy' multiplied, to the point of leading to a parliamentary enquiry into its 'actions' and the danger it allegedly represents to French democracy. His group's media outlets have been hit with a host of sanctions, including warnings from the ARCOM media regulatory authority and the eviction of one of his channels from the DTT network . Bollore has taken note of this decision but is not a man to be taken lightly. In retaliation, Bollore announced that he was withdrawing all his pay-TV channels from DTT--including those that had not been convicted--thus saving more than EUR20 million each year in fees and taxes. Bollore is a free man, and his dazzling success obviously gives him the means to achieve this freedom. The owner of CNews has also become the prime target of attacks by the leftist media, draped in the dignified toga of the defender of democracy in danger. And any means are justified to accomplish this supposedly noble goal--including the use of the very weapons they accuse their adversary of employing. Case in point: on Monday, January 13th, a lengthy interview with newspaper owner Matthieu Pigasse by left-wing newspaper Liberation . Pigasse, a former investment banker, is a key figure in the French media landscape since he is the co-owner of the newspaper Le Monde , considered in France to be the daily reference in management circles. In this interview, Pigasse reveals his game with startling clarity. He explains: ""I want to bring the media I control into the fight against the radical right."" Nous sommes arrives a un moment critique, avec une polarisation extreme entre deux conceptions du monde : une, ouverte et progressiste, et une autre, fermee, qui repose sur la fermeture des frontieres, la fermeture des esprits et le rejet de l'autre. Cette vision est portee par... pic.twitter.com/raVuaY9gXB Every word of this statement needs to be weighed and assessed at its true value. Such words from Vincent Bollore would have caused a major scandal. ""I want""; ""the media I control""; ""the fight."" The objective is clearly stated, the ideological offensive carried out without shame or hidden agenda. Pigasse openly acknowledges what everyone already knows: the left-wing press, which hides behind the label of a generalist press with supposedly benevolent neutrality, is waging a merciless war against ideas it deems 'nauseating.' But he has the right to do so because he is on the side of 'good'--which is obviously not the case with Bollore. Matthieu Pigasse produces a number of news programmes on the French public television network, including ""C a vous,"" ""C ce soir , "" and ""C dans l'air,"" with another media magnate, Xavier Niel, a former friend of socialist President Francois Mitterrand. He has no qualms about ""controlling"" the journalists who appear on these programmes, which are also publicly funded, and putting ""his financial interests at the service of his ideas."" Neutrality is clearly not a requirement for everyone. Pigasse is revealing his cards because he has a vague feeling that the game is not as easy to play as it used to be. At the global level, the tide is turning under the blows of a triad he denounces, ""MMT""--for Milei, Musk, and Trump. In Europe, Musk's management of the X platform is forcing the European Union authorities, destabilised by a discourse that is no longer unequivocal, to openly admit that they, too, want to control public opinion . In France, the conservative camp, strengthened by the success of Bollore and his emulators, no longer intends to let this happen. Last summer, the activist group Les Corsaires , fighting for freedom of expression, attacked the TMC channel and its mainstream programme ""Quotidien""--known for its merciless treatment of right-wing contributors--for its misleading coverage of a press conference by Jordan Bardella. Les Corsaires succeeded in obtaining at the very least a formal reprimand from ARCOM against the presenter, on the grounds that he ""violated the integrity of the information."" This week, MEP Laurence Trochu, who belongs to the Identite-Libertes movement founded by Marion Marechal, referred the Matthieu Pigasse interview to ARCOM , the media regulatory authority, since Pigasse admits to using French people's money to support his own ideological struggle. Will ARCOM go after Matthieu Pigasse, a prey of a different calibre than the ""Quotidien"" host? It is to be feared that he will not be disturbed and that he will continue to receive public funds for the media he 'controls,' which dutifully distil the authorised doctrine. But let's rejoice: we can already say that the dominant consensus of political correctness has now been broken.",The European Conservative,2025-01-15T19:19:14,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/leftist-french-press-magnate-proud-to-control-journalists-for-a-good-cause/
Electoral Fraud and Illegal Migration: The Instruments of Neo-Marxism,"On the most recent meeting of the Christian Democratic Leader's Roundtable (Brussels, December 3), I was asked to speak on electoral fraud in Latin-America and on illegal migration as a weapon. These are two seemingly separate topics, but, as we shall see, they are conceptually interconnected. Modern electoral fraud was developed in my country, Venezuela, by Hugo Chavez, with the support of Cuba. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Castro-communism, which directed and supported the armed violence of the guerrillas throughout Latin-America, decided to change its strategy, founding political parties, financing them with drug money, and perpetrating electoral frauds as a new form of coup d'etat. In other words, guerrillas such as the Colombian FARC,and coup perpetrators such as Chavez, abandoned their weapons while maintaining their hatred for democracy, for capitalism, and for the values and principles of Western Christian civilization. Electoral fraud is an attack against democracy, because it destroys the last resource of a nation to settle its most important matters: to consult the opinion of the people. Suddenly, it is no longer the voters who decide, but those who control the automated voting and totalization system. The Latin-American Left perpetrates electoral frauds for the sake of a supposed higher goal: the socialist state. The members of the Sao Paulo Forum consider that the socialist state should not depend on the ups and downs of democracy and when the votes do not favor them, they are willing to pervert the electoral process. In my book The Electoral Frauds of the Sao Paulo Forum , now available in five languages, I explain the details of how this new method of fraud works and how it has been exported to the rest of the Latin-American countries. It is an integral fraud, because it covers all aspects of an election, from the selection of the electoral authorities to the validation of the results; it is an evolving fraud, because it is perfected with the passage of time; it is advanced, because it uses state-of-the-art technological tools; it is undetectable for many, because it requires specialised training to discover it; and, as if that were not enough, it is also exportable to other nations. The problem with the automated voting and totalization systems is that, first, they can be manipulated, as any other software; second, they are not democratic, because they exclude the common citizen, who is incapable of knowing what happens inside the electronic circuits; and third, sovereignty is taken away from the people, to hand it over to a small group of technicians who handle the intricacies of these systems. In Venezuela, during the past twenty years, there have been fraud denunciations, but in the last elections of July 28, a scheme to neutralize it through citizen participation was developed. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado organized one million Venezuelans to watch over all the voting centers, manually count each vote, compare the results with the tally-sheets, and deploy a verification process alternative to the one made by the electoral authorities. Through this mobilization, the opposition was able to obtain 83% of the voting tally-sheets, and then scan them and upload them to a robust webpage , so that both Venezuelans and the international community could verify the results that gave the candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner, beyond the false result announced by the electoral authorities, controlled by the dictator Nicolas Maduro. The great contradiction consists in spending millions of dollars to develop an automated voting and counting system, which can only be validated by manually counting each vote. There have always been migratory movements in the history of mankind. For example, in Latin-America, during the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War, millions of Europeans arrived and integrated perfectly into our societies. The same could be said of other migratory movements in the past. But nowadays, the European and North American Left want to eliminate the very concept of ""people""--based on a unity, with history, tradition, and identity, where minorities live together integrated with the same culture--and replace it with a variety of minorities in permanent confrontation among each other. It is a way of keeping alive the old Marxist class struggle, through the struggle between cultural minorities. In other words, the neo-Marxists seek to replace the concept of ""people"" with that of ""inhabitants"", that is, people living together in the same territory, although each one has its own culture and identity. This is what is meant by ""multiculturalism"". The Left boasts that it is interested in the welfare of migrants by promoting the policy of open borders, but the real result is that those who enter the United States and Europe illegally run the risk of being exploited, captured by mafias, or begging on the streets. The promise of an ideal world in the north becomes a tragedy both for the destination countries and for the migrants themselves, who often lack the skills to integrate and to live a fulfilling life. I am very sensitive to this issue, because the Venezuelan Castro-communist model has forced eight million of my compatriots to flee the country. It is a real drama that we live in our own flesh, and we are grateful for the welcome we have received in many countries. However, what we are seeing in Europe is not what the Dublin treaty sought--to help the politically persecuted and those in need of refuge--but an instrumentalization by the Left as a political weapon to weaken democracy and, in some cases, to establish platforms to support organized crime, especially drug trafficking and terrorism. A scandalous case is the exportation by the regime of Nicolas Maduro of a criminal organization linked to drug trafficking called ""Tren de Aragua,"" or TDA. The historical antecedent of this phenomenon can be found in Cuba, in 1980, when Fidel Castro's regime exported criminal gangs to the United States from the port of Mariel. To conclude, I would like to invite readers to make two reflections on what can be done to counteract these threats: First, to strengthen democracy, giving power to the people and taking it away from the electoral software companies, organizing citizen participation movements, so that they collaborate in the surveillance of the vote and in the totalizing process. And second, to guarantee that the true objectives of the Dublin treaty are fulfilled, avoiding the indiscriminate entry of illegal migrants and at the same time punishing the mafias that transport them.",The European Conservative,2024-12-10T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/electoral-fraud-and-illegal-migration-the-instruments-of-neo-marxism/
The Grandson of the Commandant of Auschwitz is a Pastor in Stuttgart,"In seventh grade, Kai Hoss discovered that his grandfather had overseen the murders of 1.1 million people. Holocaust education, including a visit to a concentration camp, is mandatory in Germany, and his class had just learned about Auschwitz. When he came home from school, Kai asked his mother why they had the same last name as the extermination camp's infamous commandant, Rudolf Hoss. ""That's your grandfather,"" she told him. Decades later--now serving as the pastor of the Bible Church of Stuttgart --Kai still grapples with that family legacy, which was brought to the world's attention once again last year in the Oscar-winning film The Zone of Interest . When he was 17, Kai pulled his grandfather's autobiography Commandant of Auschwitz off his parents' book shelf and read it. Written at the request of the Polish authorities prior to his execution by hanging on April 2, 1947, Hoss painstakingly details how he built the Third Reich's most effective killing machine, including the gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B. At one point, Hoss was gassing and burning 10,000 Jews a day; during ""Operation Hoss"" in 1944, 430,000 Hungarian Jews were liquidated in 56 days. Hoss's memoir is a confession. ""When I read that book, it broke my heart,"" Kai told me. ""It is the perpetrator himself giving witness to what he himself did in great detail. It's horrific when you read how he describes his work--in such a cold, clinical, calculating way."" He decided that if he ever had the chance ""to do good to Jewish people, to say sorry in some way,"" he would take it. An opportunity came when filmmaker Daniela Volker asked if he would participate in a documentary examining the intergenerational impact of the Holocaust. The Commandant's Shadow , released last year, is an extraordinary film . The documentary follows Kai and his 87-year-old father Hans Jurgen Hoss and Maya Lasker-Wallfisch and her mother Anita, who survived Auschwitz by playing the cello as the transport trains were unloaded. Hans, Kai told me, had never read Rudolf's book, and while ashamed of his family's legacy, he was in denial about the extent of its horror. Hans is one of the children in Jonathan Glazer's The Zone of Interest and grew up in the Auschwitz villa. In Rudolf's final letter to Hans, he writes: ""You'll always be Daddy's darling."" ""In some ways, he had a very nice childhood,"" Kai Hoss told me. ""They had the house. Rudolf behaved like a normal dad when he was not 'on duty.' He remembers an enjoyable, fulfilling childhood. So he was in denial."" Hans was only 9 when Hoss, who was working as a gardener under the false name Franz Lang, was tracked down by a Jewish Nazi hunter in 1946. On trial at Nuremberg, Rudolf admitted to all of it--although he characterized himself not as a key mastermind of the death camp system but as a ""cog in the machine of the Third Reich"" and shifted much of the blame to Hitler and Himmler. Hans agreed to return to Auschwitz with Kai for the documentary for the first time since childhood. Everyone, Kai said, was in tears. Even with the cameras, the drones, and the film crew crowding the experience, it was brutal. The platform where the sorting took place struck them most. ""Left, death; Right, life,"" Kai recalled. ""Left was little children, the aged, pregnant women. I have four kids. I couldn't imagine--children being separated from their parents, screaming, in shock. An hour later, murdered. I couldn't handle it. It was too much."" Hans, too, was struck dumb by the scale of the horror. After the war, Rudolf's wife Hedwig both denied the crimes of her husband and insisted that she and the children had been unaware of them, despite being ensconced in a villa staffed by slave labour. The families of other Nazi war criminals changed their names; Hedwig refused, stating firmly that ""Hoss will remain Hoss."" Back in Auschwitz, Hans faced the truth. ""He was no longer in denial,"" Kai told me. ""When he stood in front of the gallows, the place where his own dad was hanged, he said: 'He got his just punishment for his crimes.'"" Hans still blocks some memories. He cannot recall the human ash that fell like snow or the black smoke belching from the chimneys despite living in the eye of the storm; people in nearby towns reported the stench, the smoke, and the cinder being omnipresent, and it is impossible that Hans did not see and smell it. ""He probably suppressed that,"" Kai said. ""Children do. Children have an amazing capacity to suppress horrible experiences."" Kai has watched The Zone of Interest (which he became aware of after filming for The Commandant's Shadow was completed) and found it powerful. It is, after all, family history. Kai says that when Daniela Volker called him four years ago and asked him to take part in the documentary, he agreed on only two conditions. The first was that the Holocaust could not be sugar-coated or downplayed in any way. The second was that he could be open about his Christian faith throughout the film. Volker readily agreed, and Kai's faith became a largely unremarked on sub-plot that runs throughout the documentary; one of the final scenes shows his father Hans sitting in amongst his congregation, listening to Kai preach. Kai's own history is a powerful testimony. He trained as a chef, and then joined the NATO forces and got sent to the United Kingdom. He knew English because his family had rented rooms to American servicemen over the years. He spent two decades abroad, working at many of the biggest five-star hotels. He worked hard and played hard. ""I was Mr. Rolex,"" he told me. At age 28, however, he got a glimpse of mortality. A routine tonsillectomy went wrong, and he almost bled to death. In severe pain, Kai looked for something to read to distract himself. He found a Gideon Bible, and despite being a ""militant atheist,"" he read it. Kai was struck by Psalm 51, King David's cry of repentance after his sin against Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. He wondered, reading it, where his drive for wealth could lead him. ""I was in love with myself,"" he told me. He asked himself: If a dictator were to give him the kind of power his grandfather had possessed, could he have done what Rudolf had done? Kai read the Bible through, and then went back to his life of kitchens and clubbing. It was on one of those nights that he met a Christian who invited him first out for coffee and then, after months of conversation, to church. He began forgoing clubs on Saturday night to make it to Sunday morning services. Kai Hoss became a Christian on Easter of 1989 in Singapore. ""Salvation is grace alone, through faith alone, in Jesus Christ alone, plus nothing,"" he told me. ""I bring nothing to the table."" In 2000, he returned to Germany. He became an elder at the Bible Church of Stuttgart, which was led by three American pastors. Eventually, he became the full-time pastor of the church. They focus on expository preaching, working through the Bible verse by verse. It is the Bible, Kai says, that offers the greatest rebuke to the resurgence of antisemitism. The flow of history from the Garden to the Cross, Kai told me, emphasizes that ""God is not done with His people. The promises to Abraham were unconditional. If you read the Bible, you know that the Jewish people are God's chosen people. Christians who don't read their Bible don't understand this. Go back in the Bible, starting with the calling of Abraham. 'In your seed, all the nations of the world shall be blessed.' Of course, that points to the Messiah."" Throughout history, antisemitism has flourished, as Satan has ""a vested interest in killing God's people,"" and his tools--from Haman to Hitler to Hamas--have been many. ""God is faithful to His people,"" Kai Hoss said. ""I'm a gentile and the grandson of the greatest murderer of Jewish people--and I am saved by the Jewish Messiah.""",The European Conservative,2025-01-07T08:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-grandson-of-the-commandant-of-auschwitz-is-a-pastor-in-stuttgart/
Why the Battle Over Hungary's Child Protection Law Matters for Europe,"On November 19, a crucial hearing took place before the European Court of Justice regarding a case that, although currently going unnoticed, will undoubtedly spark significant debate: the European Commission, supported by no fewer than 16 Member States (an unprecedented fact), is suing Hungary over its child protection law. This national legislation recognizes identity based on biological sex and prohibits exposing minors to pornographic content, inappropriate sexuality, homosexuality, gender ideology, and sex changes. Just hours after its adoption, Ursula von der Leyen labeled the law a "" shame "" and immediately announced the launch of an expedited infringement procedure that, a year later (a record timeframe), culminated in a lawsuit against the Hungarian government. Some activists are already describing the case as the ""mother of all battles"" in the defense of human rights. Hyperbole aside, they are not entirely wrong--though not for the reasons they claim. More than a question of discrimination against sexual minorities, what is truly at stake here is the imposition of an ideology without any mandate, as well as the fight to protect the family, parents' rights to educate their children, and the innocence of children. This schism of principles is dividing the Union, and its judicial resolution will deepen the fractures between countries and electorates aligned with woke ideology (mainly in Western Europe) and those who reject it (Central and Eastern Europe). Has the European Union (EU) become a "" woke-only "" club where being conservative is no longer allowed? That is the question. The first question that immediately arises is: what on earth is the EU doing meddling in the sexual education of children? Is this a European competence? Not in the slightest. On the contrary, the EU Treaty makes it abundantly clear that education is a prerogative of the Member States, full stop. But, of course, in the name of ""European values,"" invoked with almost messianic zeal, it has become fashionable to disregard the rules of the game and find spurious excuses to interfere in national matters for purely political reasons. It's a technocratic version of Cardinal Richelieu's famous maxim: "" If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him. "" In today's EU, too many national laws that stray from the Brussels consensus are potentially on its radar, and it hardly matters that this amounts to an unwarranted appropriation of powers without any legitimate mandate. What stands out the most is the zeal with which the EU (and let's not forget, 16 other governments) champions gender ideology and promotes the sexualization of children--because that's exactly what this is about. There are now too many countries reversing course, too many voices from young people who are ""de-transitioning,"" and too many horrifying stories being published to ignore the truth: behind expressions like ""inclusive sexual education"" or ""affirmative care"" lies a sordid reality of mutilations, chemical castrations, hormone treatments, misogyny, irreversible harm, and suicides. It's a grotesque medical scandal , largely driven by the greed of clinics and pharmaceutical industries, the cowardice (or corruption) of medical and psychiatric associations, and the violence of ""trans"" activism, including cases of outright terrorism . And, of course, we cannot ignore the astonishing submission of the elites to the hegemonic queer ideology, which drives them to undermine the very foundation of their societies: the family. Let's not forget that this ideology also constitutes a direct attack on the family. It targets parents, undermining their authority in favor of the state and disregarding their right to educate their children according to their convictions (Article 14, paragraph 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU). And it targets children, robbing them of their innocence through premature sexualization and pervasive indoctrination that borders on pedophilia. This ideology promotes the idea that children have the right to an ""affective and sexual life"" and to "" have sexual relations with whomever they want, as long as it's consensual, "" following the abhorrent formula of Irene Montero, former Minister for Equality under Pedro Sanchez. Unfortunately, the Commission has embraced this notion of consent, albeit in more tempered terms. While the United States begins to turn the page on trans delusion, with young adults who were ""transitioned"" suing the surgeons who mutilated them in a historic legal case, the EU, completely out of step, is doubling down on efforts to turn this delusion into binding norms. Today, it's Hungary's turn--the usual punching bag of Brussels. The EU has already withheld billions of euros from Hungary over its child protection law, and now it faces a hefty fine and, who knows, perhaps even the suspension of its voting rights. Who will be next? Bulgaria and Lithuania, which already have similar laws? Slovakia, Romania, and Italy, which are considering taking the same step? Or any other country with a democratic mandate to distance itself from this ideology? So, yes, it's true--this latest Commission vs. Hungary case is of monumental importance. It will either confirm or refute the EU's increasingly centralist, dogmatic, and partisan tendencies, as it meddles in matters as intimate as the sexual education of children.

What Russian Literature Tells Us About the Muslim Rape Gangs,"I just came back from three days on Mount Athos, the Orthodox Christian monastic enclave on an isolated peninsula in northeastern Greece. To enter Athos and its archaic monastic culture is to leave time, at least for a few days. To come back down the mountain and go back to the world is to return to history. And these days, history is moving vividly and fast--and for Europe, towards some sort of cataclysmic reckoning. What more can be said about the Islamic rape gang scandal in the United Kingdom? Not enough. Not enough until something massive and substantial happens to right what has gone very, very wrong in that country, which has been cursed by its ruling class in government, academia, media, and other institutions. On Wednesday at Prime Minister's question time in Parliament, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch made a complete fool of Keir Starmer, who could only twist and turn as he tried to avoid accountability for the atrocities. But it is also true that Badenoch's party, which held power from 2011, when reporting in the Times of London first revealed the phenomenon--and there would be many more revelations to come--until last autumn's Labor victory, did nothing substantial to address the problem. This is a crisis that consumes the entire British establishment, even King Charles, who disgraced himself with a Christmas address in which he burbled the usual platitudes about diversity being our strength. The ongoing scandal in Britain stands for the crisis throughout Western liberal democracies, in which leaders and institutions, in the grip of ideology, failed both by commission and omission to deal forthrightly with the problems in front of them--and usually made them worse. The Catholic Church got there first. From the moment the extent of its cover-up of child sexual abuse by priests began to be uncovered in 2002, starting with the situation in Boston, the behavior of the Catholic hierarchy has been lamentable overall. Yes, there have been some needed reforms, and enough apologies to take up a shelf in the Vatican library. And yet, Pope Francis continues to indulge and protect alleged sex abusers favored by himself. Last week, he appointed the archliberal Cardinal Robert McElroy of San Diego to the archbishopric of Washington, even though McElroy unquestionably turned a blind eye to the sexual depredations of his mentor, the disgraced former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Meanwhile, the moral authority of the Catholic Church having crashed, the Church continues to hemorrhage members. And yet, the pope and the hierarchy carry on as if nothing could touch them. With Europe threatened by Islamic violence--both of the terroristic kind, and of the sort carried out by Muslim rape gangs--Francis persists in lauding Islam and condemning ""Islamophobia,"" and in hectoring Europeans to keep open the doors for mass migration. He is not alone. The rape gang scandal in Britain shows that UK officials--from the prime minister down to local council officials and police officers--repeatedly refused to come to the aid of working-class white British girls being drugged and gang-raped by Pakistanis. They did so out of fear of being racist, and being thought racist. They did so out of fealty to liberal ideology, one aspect of which is the belief that any culture other than one's own is right and good, and must be kowtowed to. To do otherwise is bigotry. We have been here before. In his extraordinary 2023 book Wonder Confronts Certainty , Gary Saul Morson, a leading scholar of Russian literature, writes of how Russian novelists and writers of the 19th and early 20th century dealt with the big questions that would haunt the 20th century--and our own. In Morson's telling, the conflict among writers of the period had mostly to do with reality versus ideology. That is to say: Should we strive understand life as it is, or as it should be? Those Morson calls the ""great realists""--Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and others--insisted on telling the truth no matter whose ideological convictions were offended. Their opponents--writers whose names have been all but forgotten in the West today--believed that art and literature should be judged by ideological criteria. In the mid-19th century there arose a class in Russia called the ""intelligents""--the equivalent of our woke scholars, journalists, and their sympathizers throughout institutions. Education does not make one an ""intelligent""; a shared dedication to progressive ideology does. Even if one does not agree with the intelligents , one keeps one's mouth shut to protect one's own career and reputation. As one Turgenev character says, ""today even those who dislike progressive ideas must pretend to like them to gain admission to decent society."" Sounds familiar, doesn't it? We see in that line an explanation for why so many otherwise sensible people--even conservatives--kept their mouths shut about the rape gangs, about mass migration, and so many other ills that mostly afflicted those outside ""decent society""--like working-class white English girls. As time went on, the intelligents came to idealize 'the People,' not based on who the Russian people actually were, but rather as a totem to help them deal with their own psychological feelings of guilt for their own privilege. Citing the work of two lesser-known Russian writers, Morson says that they ""exemplify the troubling consequences of basing politics on guilt, which may lead people to adopt whatever solution promises psychological relief even if it does not help--or even positively harms--the victims on whose behalf guilt is felt."" To help members of the British ruling class feel better about themselves, the whole of Britain had to be wrecked through mass migration and deliberately turning a blind eye to the evils done by non-white Britons. (The same logic explains the rampage of gender ideology, which has resulted in the lifelong sexual mutilation of gender-dysphoric British children.) As Morson explains in chilling detail, the utopians of the Russian Left, once they gained power in the 1917 revolution, sacrificed the lives of tens of millions of innocent people to pay homage to ideological principle. Yet as Dostoevsky--and only Dostoevsky, in Morson's judgment--saw, the seeds of the 20th century's mass murders were already in plain sight in the writings of the 19th century progressives. What Britain has lived through--and what many European countries are living through as well--is the cost of the utopian ideals of their liberal elites, of both the Left and the Right. After all, what was conservative German chancellor Angela Merkel's infamous 2015 declaration opening Europe's floodgates to migrants, "" Wir schaffen das!"" (""We can do it!""), if not a manifestation of liberal utopianism? Britain today has a feckless Labour government in part because the Conservatives in power, despite all their stated convictions, also lived by these hollow beliefs. The raped working-class girls of Britain are the price people pay for liberal ideology. Morson writes that the great Russian realists refuted progressive theories not by taking them on directly in their novels, but by showing what it means to live by them. Well, Britain now has its answer--and so does every European country cursed by migrant rapes and other crimes. The rape-gang scandal makes it abundantly clear that liberalism, as it has been practiced for decades in the West (as distinct, for example, from its Hungarian version), is the suicide note of a civilization. Both the UK and the European Union are rapidly approaching a decision point. A cataclysmic reckoning will be a horrible thing to live through. But the only thing worse is no cataclysmic reckoning at all, just resignedly going gently into history's long and barbarous night. We saw what happened to Russia when those in positions of leadership refused to take the warnings of its Dostoevskys seriously. The same is true of us, in our time. Indeed, it is happening right now. The West is burning, while the Starmers, the Scholzes, the Macrons, the Von Der Leyens, and even the Pope--all fiddle. On Mount Athos, a priest told me that the monks there are so removed from the world that they were late to learn about the existence of the Second World War. I'm not sure if that is true, but experiencing how cut off they are, deliberately, from the outside world, even in the Internet age, it is at least plausible. But the monks, in their medieval peninsular redoubt, have an excuse for not seeing what's happening in the world beyond their personal horizons. We do not.",The European Conservative,2025-01-09T10:41:32,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/what-russian-literature-tells-us-about-the-muslim-rape-gangs/
Guarantee of Unhappiness,"In the midst of the West's demographic crisis, the invisible hand of the crazy algorithm bombards impressionable young minds with the alleged 'benefits' of a life without children, an emotional digital tribute to Herod, exposing thousands of 'success stories' of boyfriends or married couples who claim to be immensely happy because, having no offspring, they can devote all their income to travel, shopping, going out with friends, renovating the house, and other inconsequential activities. And, above all, they can devote their free time to themselves, since they are liberated from the terrible burden (this is how they talk) of taking the child to extracurricular activities, medical check-ups, or attending the odious parents' meetings--the only aspect of their case, I must say, to which I am somewhat sympathetic. If TikTok were not a social control mechanism managed by the black soul of the Chinese Communist Party, we could still believe that the proliferation of DINK (double income, no kids) culture reflects an authentic social reality, that it has become an indisputable trend in an organic, non-astroturfed way, spurred by the number of adherents to that way of life who suddenly feel the need to share with other users the extent of their immense happiness without children. But then we would also have to believe that the disproportionate invasion of 'trans' promotional content on Instagram and TikTok is also a natural consequence of extrapolating what's on the streets to social networks. But never has media and entertainment been employed like this: they have always been used to shape society, to disfigure and change it, rather than to reflect it. Just think of the film industry, literature, television franchises, music. The quotas of 'diverse' characters in Disney's current output, for example, reflect nothing in our culture other than a deliberate policy of social transformation, as the company's own employees, immersed in their own particular 'go woke go broke' career, have acknowledged. Perhaps the most characteristic feature of 21st century man is his determination to fight against nature. Progressive activists pride themselves on breaking antiquated moral norms, but the truth is that they are only fighting against the natural order and their proper place in it. In both animals and humans, the sexual drive to come together and reproduce has as its main objective the maintenance of the species. If it were up to the DINKS, the human being would become extinct, as in that wonderful song by Siniestro Total: ""Smile when you go to fossilize / so they don't think later that you've had a bad time / Try to become extinct with class and dignity / Think of the Natural History Museum."" Of course, not everyone is born to be a father, but the renunciation of fatherhood is something exceptional, conjunctural, personal. There is usually a good reason behind it, or even an unavoidable circumstance that one has not even chosen, and in any case, it is no ground for pride, nor of course for shame. But the DINK cosmos does not bet on anything positive. There is no larger noble goal or pursuit. Hedonism may sometimes be fun, but it is not an end in life, unless you are committed to living a proudly sad and miserable one. Lacking a goal to pursue that they can boast about, DINKs focus their proselytizing on hatred of their parents' way of life. The effectiveness of their message, and the popularity of the phenomenon, is explained by the TikTok audience. Ultimately, the DINK message resonates perfectly with people who are not yet ready for parenthood. That call of nature does not usually appear at the age of 18, but a little later, which is when one begins to think for the first time that one could die any day and that, short of children, all one is going to take to the grave is an immense succession of empty hangovers. This is from the masculine point of view, From the feminine point of view, a certain longing for motherhood naturally arises from the woman's bundle of instincts. As such, when a man tries to run away unhealthily from fatherhood, it is women who are best placed to inject some common sense into proceedings. If all reproduction hinged upon the whims of men, perhaps we would have become extinct by the Stone Age. Be that as it may, fighting against nature is a lousy idea, not least because sooner or later nature will exact her revenge--and often in a quite painful way. If what they seek is happiness, they may not know it, but by prioritizing their selfishness over the most elementary needs of their nature, they stand to obtain nothing but a spectacular vital failure. A diagnosis of the immediate future: DINK, give yourself a few years, and you will find yourself contending with all you were not looking for--unhappiness, boredom, depression, and the feeling of having thrown your life overboard. And the worst thing: often, when you realize it, there will be no turning back. In truth, there is absolutely nothing on this earth comparable to parenthood. You don't know what it is until you live it. All opinions on the matter from non-parents lack no more credible basis than my own hunches as to how the clam feels when it bubbles amidst the rice and opens up. It's no secret. If you want to find someone unhappy, always look among those who boast of being very happy on social networks. Just as, if you want to find someone with relationship problems, always look among those who constantly boast of infinite love on social networks. It is not a discovery of the digital era either, but finds expression in the very old Spanish proverb: tell me what you boast about and I will tell you what you lack. The denizens of DINK culture count themselves happy for living in constant homage to their own selves. In doing so, they miss one of life's paradoxes: it is in selfishness that we are most solidly guaranteed unhappiness. What Christianity brought into the world is a way of salvation for the soul in eternity, but also a masterly formula for secular happiness: think a little more of others and a little less of yourself. One of the top DINK influencers, John Eringman, tells his millions of followers on TikTok: ""We are DINKS, we sleep a full 8 hours and sometimes more. We are DINKS, we eat desserts and snacks at restaurants. We are DINKS, we get to play with other kids. We are DINKS, we still do it 3 times a week."" Everything is wrong with his statement. First, parents also sleep a full eight hours and sometimes more. But most of all: what kind of happy life do you have if sleep is a goal? Sleep is a necessity, sometimes a pleasure, but never a goal. Normal people dream of having such enriched days that sleep comes to be seen at best, as a chore-like necessity. The whole thing about desserts and appetizers in restaurants has left me flabbergasted. What on earth does Mr. Eringman think parents are doing? Giving up dessert? Is he aware that most children could be moved to eat their own father alive in front of the entire restaurant if they are denied dessert? In the illusion of playing with other children, one discovers the crux of this farce: at the height of the selfishness and sleaze of this approach, Mr. Eringman uses the children who eventually fall near him to try to assuage his most basic emotional needs, just as others fill that need with a dog or a cat. However, we reach the pinnacle in his heroic confession that, thanks to not having children, he gets to go to bed with his girl three times a week. How do I explain it to you, Eringman? Where on earth do you think the children of couples who have decided to become parents come from? Do you think marriages reproduce by spores? And, by the way, not to take away your DINK Pride high: three times a week is not an enviable average.",The European Conservative,2024-12-21T16:13:37,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/guarantee-of-unhappiness/
When Is a Refugee Not a Refugee?,"President Trump's suggestion that the population of Gaza should leave while Gaza is turned into ""a middle eastern Riviera"" has provoked the predictable outcry from Palestinian advocates around the world of 'ethnic cleansing.' More interesting was the statement from the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, who said Gazans wanted to return to their homes in Gaza and rebuild ""because this is where they belong and they love to live there."" But hold on. According to the UN, nearly 80% of the population of Gaza are refugees. Now, I may have a wrong idea of what a refugee is, but I assume that it is somebody who, by definition, is not living in the place that they belong. Whereas somebody who is living in the place that they belong is not a refugee. So how is it that Gazans can be both refugees and not refugees? It is because, unlike any other displaced people in the world, the residents of Gaza inherit refugee status. There are hardly any people left alive from the original population displaced during the war with Israel in 1948, yet millions of Palestinian Arabs have, under a UN mandate, the right of return to places in Israel. To maintain that the population of Gaza, and the West Bank, and some in Jordan, are both refugees and not refugees at the same time can only prolong any settlement in the Middle East and bring endless strife. If it is the case that Gazans wish to stay ""where they belong"" then they will have to do something about Hamas, because nobody is going to invest in a place run by armed terrorists. Hamas responded to Trump by saying ""What is required is an end to the occupation and aggression against our people, not their expulsion from their land."" This is rich from Hamas, given that there was no Israeli occupation of any kind in Gaza between 2005 and 2023, despite Hamas and other Islamists regularly rocketing southern Israel. Had Hamas not invaded Israel on October 7th and murdered, raped, and kidnapped people, there would be no Israeli forces in Gaza now. Gaza has been largely destroyed and is not going to be rebuilt any time soon, while Hamas is holding sway. President Trump's musings on the future of Gaza after his meeting with President Netanyahu may or may not change the reality on the ground in the Middle East. There is a logic to his suggestion that Gazans go and live somewhere else while Gaza is rebuilt. But Trump sees Gaza, in the words of the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dennis Ross, ""as a real estate building problem. It's not a political problem."" Unfortunately, politics trumps logic and the problem that Gaza is being run by Hamas, and that Middle Eastern states are not keen on importing a jihadi-influenced population cannot be wished away.

"Myself, Me, and I: The Annoying Rise of Reflexive Pronouns","Something weird is afoot in our culture, and it's indicated by an increasingly bizarre deployment of reflexive pronouns. The first time I became aware of this phenomenon was just before a visit to a property in which my wife and I were interested as potential buyers. Beforehand, I received an email from the estate agent which began, ""I look forward to meeting yourself at the property at 11am, where myself will be waiting for your arrival."" Naturally, in anticipation of the house viewing, I tried to imagine what this spatio-temporal encounter of selves might look like. Since then, I have received numerous emails from people expressing hope that ""yourself has enjoyed a good Christmas,"" or that ""myself and my wife were sorry to miss you"" at such and such event, or ""ourselves will get to the event early."" As my readers know, I enjoy perusing fieldsports magazines, but the peculiar--though fast becoming conventional--use of reflexive pronouns is ruining them for me. Recently, one of my favourite mags had a guest editor whose opening piece read: ""I hope you enjoy the content that myself and the rest of the team have commissioned."" A nice sentiment, but I was already not enjoying it at the first page on account of the spazzy wordsmanship assaulting my leisure reading. As it happens, I can cope with the occasional grammatical dog's breakfast when it comes to pronouns. I, on occasion, have said things like, ""You shall meet my wife and I at the gallery,"" only immediately to realise that it's my wife and me who will be met at the gallery, simultaneously trusting that my converser either hadn't noted my syntactic blunder or is too polite to point it out. The horrendously expensive education which my parents purchased for me as a child was, it seems, insufficiently pricey to provide me with any lessons whatever in grammar. Hence, in adulthood, I've had to invent all sorts of 'rules' not to sound too stupid. For example, before talking, I often mentally remove the other person from the sentence: ""You shall meet I at the gallery."" Well, that doesn't sound right , I say to myself. So, I change the I to a me and then pop my wife back into the sentence. I've got pretty good at doing this quickly enough, and if it does take me a moment to spit the sentence out, hopefully others just assume I'm absorbed in profound thought. That's one way I just about manage not to sound like a moron. ... Or do I? For of course, if I'm speaking such proper English to someone who is accustomed to announcing that ""myself and my wife will be at the gallery,"" my converser may think I have no idea how to construct a sentence. So, you see, the collapse of English syntax isn't just making us all sound idiotic, it's causing those who know how to speak properly appear idiotic to those who don't. Indeed, this collapse is generating all sorts of uncomfortable social tensions, the rules for undoing which are known to no one. The widespread grammatical chaos I highlight partly came from an impolite habit of placing oneself first in the sentence. People started saying things like, ""Me and my wife will meet you at the gallery."" But if such a person were to apply my rule and remove his wife, he would have: ""Me will meet you at the gallery."" A sentence fit for a caveman, certainly, but not for a beneficiary of three millennia of civilisation. The prevailing, solipsistic prejudice of modernity is to see oneself as first in any event, and the rest of existence as orbiting oneself. As such, it is easy to see how 'me' in that sentence evolved into 'myself,' given that modernity has done a very comprehensive job of teaching us that it is my self that really matters. There may, of course, be a class dimension to this. In England especially, the unhappy disappearance of regional and class-based dialects and accents, in favour of a butchered 'received pronunciation,' followed the egalitarian mania of Prime Minister Tony Blair and his successors in both the Conservative and Labour parties. But throughout the West more recently, the decline of any expression of the regional, the particular, and the settled has coincided with the tech age and the fact that general communication has moved out of the concrete community and into the 'online community.' This transformation of human interaction has concurred with an unspoken insistence that working class people begin to despise their roots and pretend to be middle class, adopting all the same base, bourgeois mannerisms and social commitments. To use the distinction of David Goodhart, they must cease to be people of somewhere and be people of anywhere--for only then, can they become fully utilisable as interchangeable units of production and consumption. And that means leaving behind whatever ties them to a particular place and community, especially the way they express themselves. It is this process of deracination that may be the key to understanding the weird use of reflexive pronouns so prevalent today in English-speaking countries. For this now common use of reflexive pronouns betrays a greater comfort with selves than persons . Other people would rather meet my self than meet me. The notion of the 'person' implies embodied presence. When I speak of being ""personally present"" or being with you ""in person,"" I mean that I will be, concretely and actually, with you. For example, one might say, ""I'd prefer not to talk over the telephone, but meet with you in person."" I cannot be personally present to you over the telephone precisely because my disembodied voice is not me , but a re-created, technologically mediated emanation of me. As we are ever less personally present to one another, and instead interacting via technologically contrived mediators, we are becoming ever less comfortable with persons and we evermore prefer disembodied 'selves.' Hence, increasingly, people will be unready to meet me in person, and if they must, they shall insist that themselves are meeting myself, and will progressively speak in this mad way, as indeed they are. And it is mad. In the West today we are obsessed with pronouns precisely because we think that pronouns, disassociated from the body and its distinctiveness (like, for example, its sex) denote some interior being called the 'self' which, as it happens, I have never seen and about whose existence I'm agnostic. And modernity's superstitious belief in the 'self' is now fully reflected in our bastardised English, and as such it is seriously pissing me off. Descartes' mythos of the encaged self in the fleshly vehicle has turned into a working anthropology by means of technology and is intensifying due to the social pathologies that new technologies are fomenting. The rising idiom of the moronic, modern West is revealing this fact. It is distressing to me that the 'fool's pronoun'--as I think I'll start calling the syntactically skewed use of the reflexive pronoun--is even cropping up in fieldsports magazines, as embodied activities like fieldsports are among my prescriptions for healing the social disease of the 'self.' When I get an email saying, ""I hope you had a good Christmas"" or ""My wife and I were sorry to miss you,"" or indeed ""I thought to myself that it would be nice for us to meet up,"" it's an indication that my interlocutor knows the basic structure of the English language. But it also suggests that he still has a foot on the earth. That, I can assure you, inspires in me some confidence.",The European Conservative,2025-01-08T13:57:42,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/myself-me-and-i-the-annoying-rise-of-reflexive-pronouns/
American Oligarchy,"You will have heard by now that U.S. President Joe Biden has granted his son Hunter a ""full and unconditional pardon"" for any and all crimes he committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024. This must have come as a great relief to Hunter. The younger Biden has been accused of a laundry list of crimes involving firearms, illegal drugs, prostitution, sexual abuse, and political corruption. No doubt this will go down as the most famous presidential pardon in American history, surpassing even Gerald Ford's granting immunity to Richard Nixon in 1974. Ford acted out of a (perhaps misguided) sense of civic duty. He wished to give the American people closure over the Watergate scandal. Biden, on the other hand, is simply protecting his own. He's placing his family above the law. This isn't particularly novel, of course, nor even particularly interesting. Not a day goes by when a drunk-driving state senator doesn't ask a weary police officer, ""Do you know who I am?"" Very few people would have acted differently if placed in Biden's position, especially given his diminished mental capacity. What's startling--and disturbing--is how American liberals have responded. The denizens of r/politics, the 74th largest forum on Reddit, greeted the news with jubilation. ""Lmfao Joe really said 'I'm outta here I don't give a **** anymore,'"" the top comment reads. ""Pardon Hunter, Pardon other people. Go wild, old man,"" reads the second. And so on. Nor is it only the internet trolls. Patrick Healey, the deputy opinion editor for The New York Times , fell over himself trying to justify Hunter's pardoning. ""Hunter Biden didn't harm anyone,"" he argues (dubiously), ""and pardons go to people with connections all the time now."" Healey also engaged in a head-spinning bit of whataboutism: ""Trump has indicated he would pardon January 6 insurrectionists, whose actions I'd argue were more disreputable and dangerous to the Republic than what Hunter Biden did."" Reddit users also echoed the New York Times line. The third-highest comment on that post said this: ""MAGA about to scream 'Biden Crime Family!' as Trump the fugitive appoints two in-laws with criminal records, at least two sex offenders, and a Russian asset to his cabinet."" Granted, this is a small survey. But I think most any American would agree that it captures the mood of U.S. politics at this particular moment. Whenever our favorite politician is accused of breaking the law, we respond in two ways. First, we say that it serves the greater good. Secondly, the other side is just as bad. This is the way things work now. They go low, we go lower. It may seem like a relatively small matter, but if we're right--if this is, indeed, the standard to which Americans hold ourselves and our leaders--then we can safely say that the United States is not a functioning liberal democracy. To be clear, I am not claiming that the corruption itself is the proof. There's corruption in every form of government. The difference is that, in a liberal democracy, politicians hide their corruption. When they break the law, they do so in secret, because they are afraid of being caught and arrested or (at the very least!) voted out of office. Today, America's political leaders no longer operate according to the rule of law-- nor do Americans wish for them to . They do not hide their corruption-- nor do Americans wish for them to . Their ability to break the law with impunity is seen as a strength. So is their ability to punish their enemies by using the powers of their office to appoint ideologically sympathetic judges, bureaucrats, etc. Now's not the time to open the can of worms that is election-rigging. Let it suffice to say that both major parties are accused of electoral fraud by their opponents whenever they win a presidential election--and those accusations are almost always plausible. Republicans and Democrats are fairly open about their willingness to undermine the rule of law and the popular will in order to seize or maintain power. Once again, I'm not saying that gerrymandering, disinformation, or election-rigging are new phenomena. What I'm saying is that, in ages past, these things were done covertly. There was a sense that voters would react negatively to corruption. Not so today. In short, our system of government is quite similar to Ukraine's. We are ruled by warring tribes of oligarchs. These oligarchs embrace the ceremonies of democracy but disregard basic liberal and democratic principles. And we expect nothing less. In fact, statesmen who refuse to game the system are accused of being weak, naive, etc. Where do we go from here? Before we even attempt to answer that question, we should simply allow this reality to sink in. Again, the United States is no longer a functioning liberal democracy . We are an illiberal oligarchy. That's simply a fact. Any political analysis or platform which doesn't account for this fact is, on its face, worthless. Those who would prefer to restore our liberal democracy are faced with a near-impossible challenge. They must convince either the Republicans or the Democrats to start playing by the rules, to ""be the bigger men"" (or women). They must allow themselves to be martyred--politically, if not literally--for the rule of law and good manners. They must be willing to let go of power for the sake of the common good. What's more, they must convince us that, in doing so, the other party will not simply establish a permanent stranglehold on the state. This, too, is not a prescription; it's an observation. The American people are not wedded to the principles of liberalism or the democratic process--at least, not until they start losing. One final thought. Commenting on the Biden-pardon scandal, David French writes : When you talk to Trump voters, they'll often share the conviction that Trump isn't really all that different from other politicians. He's just more blunt and direct about his goals and objectives, while his opponents act the same way Trump acts, but they conceal their corruption in high-minded rhetoric. This pardon fits that narrative perfectly. David French is perhaps the most prominent 'Never-Trump' journalists. He rose to prominence as a columnist for National Review but now serves as a token conservative at The New York Times (maybe ""conservative"" should be in scare quotes). I find French's comments fascinating because, like every member of his class--that is, the political, economic, academic, cultural, and media elite--he begins with the assumption that the 'Trump narrative' is wrong. And whenever some evidence of gross, systemic legal and moral corruption bubbles to the surface, their response is always the same: 'It's unfortunate that this will feed into Trump's narrative.' They did it when Jeffrey Epstein's dirty laundry was hung up on the line. They did it when a newly-elected senator is tied to the world's largest producer of fentanyl. They did it when evidence emerged that the Biden administration was using the Ukrainian government to launder taxpayer money to BlackRock. The line is always the same: ""Worst of all, this is going to fuel those conspiracy-theory whackjobs!"" At what point, Mr. French, does evidence for the ""'rump narrative' become so overwhelming that it can no longer be denied? Let me say one last time that I'm not blaming Democrats and exonerating Republicans. It's true that Trump's GOP tends to be more honest about the nature of America's plutocracy. But let's not forget that, before Trump, a similar narrative was being pushed by Democrats like Bernie Sanders. If a conservative tells the truth, it's far-right propaganda. If a liberal tells the truth, it's far-left propaganda. This is the broken thinking we need to move beyond if we're ever going to have a constructive--or even vaguely realistic--conversation about how best to move forward as a country.

Not a Lego To Stand On,"The recent re-election of Donald Trump and the stateside war on DEI appear to have stiffened the spines of conservatives not just in America, but on this side of the pond too. Anyone vaguely engaged with social media will likely attest that the Overton window has shifted rightwards as conservatives are emboldened by this 'Trump effect'. Yet at the same time, we are constantly reminded how deeply woke ideology has infiltrated our major institutions. Just this week in Britain, the Science Museum --a place where, if anywhere, biological fact should count for something--has come under well-deserved fire from conservative publications. The museum's 'Seeing Things Queerly' self-guided tour made headlines last week with multiple media outlets revealing how it depicts LEGO (yes, the Danish-produced building blocks) as ""anti-LGBT."" The tour was first mentioned on the Museum's blog back in 2022, but was only picked up by an article in The Telegraph last week. It was organised by the Gender and Sexuality Network, charged with ""creating more visibility and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community in the Science Museum Group's museums and collection."" This is what the blog says about LEGO: Like other connectors and fasteners, Lego bricks are often described in a gendered way. The top of the brick with sticking out pins is male, the bottom of the brick with holes to receive the pins is female, and the process of the two sides being put together is called mating. This is an example of applying heteronormative language to topics unrelated to gender, sex and reproduction. It illustrates how heteronormativity (the idea that heterosexuality and the male/female gender binary are the norm and everything that falls outside is unusual) shapes the way we speak about science, technology, and the world in general. Where is the evidence that LEGO bricks are ""often described in a gendered way""? I have never once heard anyone--child or adult--refer to them as ""male"" and ""female,"" or the process of connecting them as ""mating."" How exactly would LEGO function without such connecting parts? In what sense can LEGO be classified as ""heteronormative"" when the pieces are identical? Surely, if anything, that makes LEGO gay-friendly since (like homosexuality) each individual possesses the same equipment? Furthermore, why would you feel the need to sexualise children's toys, unless you were trying to promote a certain form of sexuality to them? The more sinister side to the 'Seeing Things Queerly' tour is encapsulated in the claim that LEGO ""illustrates ... heteronormativity (the idea that heterosexuality and the male/female gender binary are the norm and everything that falls outside is unusual)."" This is not only profoundly anti-scientific, but outright mendacious. Gender binary is the norm, and everything that falls outside is by definition unusual. That 'normative' has culturally come to be considered a negative thing, even at an institution like the Science Museum, speaks volumes. Throughout the entirety of human history, it has not been necessary to ""normalise heterosexuality""; thankfully our ancestors had bigger things to worry about than confusing the contents of their pants. Even the word ' heterosexual' was not in common use until the 1960s, and we seemed to manage alright up to that point. The Science Museum does have form in this department. Just two years ago, it felt compelled to dismantle a 'trans-inclusive' display, after criticism that it was pushing propaganda rather than science. The 'Boy or Girl' gallery, featuring chest binders and a fake penis, was adorned with quotes such as ""'wrong body'"", and '""hero's journey,"" and suggested that gender was '""difficult to define."" As is customary, the museum has downplayed the importance of the tour--notably, only once objections were raised. LEGO meanwhile is yet to respond officially, but it seems safe to guess which side of the argument they will endorse. Back in 2021, the company pledged to eliminate 'gender bias' from its toys, stating ""We still experience age-old stereotypes that label activities as only being suitable for one specific gender."" In the same year, the brand launched the first rainbow-themed LGBTQ+ LEGO set , called 'Everyone is awesome.' Like the Science Museum, LEGO can preach all it wants, but the facts are unequivocal. Even according to the brand's own research , 90% of its $4 billion market is composed of boys; the reasons for which are blindingly obvious: men are interested in things, women are interested in people . The company would naturally like to get a few more girls on board, however, I can't help thinking 'LEGO Gender Dysphoria' sets might not be the way to go about it.",The European Conservative,2025-02-11T16:44:29,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/not-a-lego-to-stand-on/
A Spectre Is Haunting Germany,"Just weeks before Germany's general election, a spectre is haunting the country's political class --the spectre of Elon Musk. Amid the allegeded threat of foreign interference in the election, the hand-wringing over how to stop the troublesome billionaire boss of X/Twitter--who has publicly backed the far-right populist Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD)--has reached worrying heights. This was evident when Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner for digital affairs, peddled the idea that the elections might have to be annulled if Germans voted the wrong way. Breton was discussing the possibility of an election win for the AfD in an interview with French broadcaster BFMTV/RMC . Referring to Musk, he said: Let's keep calm and enforce our laws in Europe when they are at risk of being circumvented [...]. We did it in Romania, and we will obviously do it if necessary in Germany. He was, of course, alluding to the shocking annulment of Romania's presidential election in December after an outsider--a Putin-supporting anti-vaccine populist--had surprisingly won the first round. The EU elites tried to blame the result on foreign 'disinformation' spread via social media. No German politician has yet gone as far as Breton. But it would be a big mistake to dismiss the former EU bureaucrat's statement as a mere slip of the tongue-even if he has, in the meantime, retracted. (After Musk labelled him ""a tyrant of Europe "", Breton claimed that he had been misquoted, that it ""was another fake news"" or a translation mistake, tweeting: "" The EU has NO mechanism to nullify any election anywhere in the EU."") Yet other influential figures, such as Germany's president Frank Walter Steinmeier (SPD), have also issued similar warnings. When Steinmeier dissolved the Bundestag (German Parliament) in December, and announced snap elections, he said: ""Outside influence is a danger to democracy. Be it covert ... or open and blatant, as is currently being practised particularly intensively on Platform X."" Notably, to date, the president has not distanced himself from Breton's threat to erase the election results. There is no doubt that Musk has been meddlesome. He has also emboldened the AfD leadership. In late December, he wrote an opinion piece for Die Welt claiming that ""only the AfD could save Germany"" from decline. Following Steinmeier's warnings in December, he took to X, disparaging the president as an "" anti-democratic tyrant "". Then, on January 9th, Musk livestreamed approximately 70 minutes of conversation with Alice Weidel, the AfD's candidate for chancellor. During the talk, he reiterated his endorsement for her party. Though not everyone in the AfD was happy with Weidel's performance--she was long-winded, and often very crass--they naturally appreciated Musk's backing. At the AfD's party conference, held last weekend, Weidel's references to Musk received enthusiastic applause. However, attributing the AfD's success to Musk, rather than to the failures of Germany's established politicians, is blatant nonsense. The party's polling numbers have held steady at around 20% for weeks, and recent surveys indicate that Musk's interventions have had negligible impact, at best. This narrative reflects a persistent and problematic anti-populist assumption: that voters are passive objects, easily swayed by 'demagogues' rather than acting on their own political judgment. Back in January last year--long before Musk was getting up to mischief online--Frank Walter Steinmeier called for a large alliance against the AfD and said: ""We will not allow this country to be destroyed by extremist pied pipers ."" What he meant was that AfD supporters were following tricksters and shady characters, as the rats and the children of Hamelin followed the pied piper to their doom in the old German folktale. The insult to German voters in the analogy was obviously lost on the president. The establishment's fear of Musk is, in truth, its fear of the electorate. The threat to cancel the election was just one of many that have been made in recent days. Following Musk's conversation with Weidel, EU vice president Henna Virkkunen announced an investigation into whether the conversation violated the Digital Services Act. Germany's Bundestag has also launched an investigation into whether it was an illegal ""party donation."" The idea that the speech had given the party an illegal monetary advantage ("" geldwerter Vorteil "") has also been peddled by Robert Habeck , Germany's hapless economics minister and the Green Party's candidate for chancellor. If the allegation of a financial advantage is proven, ""this would have considerable consequences"" for the AfD, said Michael Brenner, a constitutional lawyer, adding that the party could face ""a very substantial sum"" in fines. Claiming that a single interview may have given the AfD an unfair advantage in the run-up to the federal elections is more than a little disingenuous. While mainstream parties like the SPD, CDU, and Greens regularly receive extensive media coverage through numerous interviews and talk shows , the AfD has frequently been excluded from such platforms. The systematic exclusion of Germany's second most popular party from media platforms isn't surprising. For years, the German media landscape has been dominated by a center-left worldview. This bias is reflected in the demographics of media professionals. A 2020 study of trainees at the public service broadcaster ARD showed an overwhelming preference for left-leaning parties: 57% supported the Greens, 23% the Left Party, and 12% the SPD. Another comprehensive study indicated that 41% of German journalists align themselves with Green politics. Notably, none of the journalists surveyed expressed political alignment with the AfD. Musk's crass intervention in the German election campaign is not without its problems. But as talk of nullifying the election and threats of heavy fines show, it is the authoritarian tendencies of the elite that are the bigger problem. Thierry Breton's threat must serve as a warning to every democrat who believes that people can make up their own minds about whom to support in an election.",The European Conservative,2025-01-16T13:01:58,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/a-spectre-is-haunting-germany/
Swiss Referendum on Eurovision Song Contest: Disunited by Music?,"The results from the most important world vote held this November are now finally in: on Sunday the 24th last month, 66.4% of citizens in the Swiss city of Basel voted in a referendum to support taxpayer money being used to stage the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 there. The primary concern of most of those 33.6% who voted against Eurovision in the ballot was that the whole thing was an egregious waste of public money: some $40m or so, which would have been blown on holding ancillary events to the main televised Song Contest, together with funding for transport and accommodation for certain favoured attendees. Yet another, arguably far more important, concern was on the minds of many other 'No' voters too, however--the idea that the Contest itself had become little more than a gigantic Gay Parade held in the literal name of Satan. It appears that Contest with the slogan ""United by Music"" may have hit a Swiss wall. Switzerland has a long tradition of holding referenda upon important social and political topics, in the name of what they term 'direct democracy,' just so long as an appropriate number of signatures can be gathered demanding one. Such votes often prove hard to predict in terms of their outcome--that's what happens when you let actual ordinary people, as opposed to a rarified semi-permanent political class, decide such things. The Eurovision referendum was instigated by a small Christian conservative party, the Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland (EDU), gathering the requisite number of names, much to the disgust of the similarly abbreviated EBU, the European Broadcasting Union, who manage and run the Contest itself. EBU promised EDU that the $40m cost would end up more than paying for itself, facilitating, as it would, ""a large number of international visitors coming to the city, spending generously while there."" They'd have to spend very generously indeed over the course of a mere long Eurovision weekend, to recoup Basel's taxpayers their $40m. But this was not the EDU's chief point of objection. In a series of interviews, senior figures from the EDU said that, whilst deploring the carelessly splashed cash, their main objections were much more fundamental(ist) in nature. Every year, Eurovision is held in the nation whose entrant won the tournament the previous year. Switzerland was host, therefore, on account of its successful 2024 entrant Nemo, an ostentatiously queer singer who has been acclaimed by activists as the first non-binary winner in Eurovision history--possibly because no such concept as 'non-binary' even existed until about five minutes ago. Contrary to Nemo's pious posturings, various transvestite-type beings had actually won in the past anyway, from Israel's Dana International in 1998 to Austrian bearded lady Conchita Wurst in 2014. However, as Eurosodom's queer provocations have to get worse and worse with each passing year in order to generate the necessary publicity-raising headlines amongst an increasingly rainbow-jaded public, following his own winning 2024 performance, Nemo had accepted a gift of headgear that resembled Christ's crown of thorns, thereby implying transgenderists were being ritually crucified by an oppressive heteronormative mainstream European society. As if to prove that such people really were incredibly oppressed, remember, the great European public had immediately prior to this point just voted for Nemo to win. Members of the Christian EDU would not have been amongst those hitting the phones to give Nemo douze points , however. Daniel Frischknecht, the EDU's leader, released an online video condemning Eurovision in terms I personally find highly accurate: ""It's not about the music any more, and hasn't been for decades. Instead it is more or less purely a political occasion. The contents of this occasion are [the promotion of] racism, antisemitism, satanism, blasphemy, destructive things like the third gender."" (The ""racism"" and ""antisemitism"" there referred to persistent intimidating public protests being held against Israeli entrants following the Hamas pogrom against Israel of October 7 2023.) In other words, Eurovision had been transformed from the late 1990s onwards from a mere harmless compendium of camp Europop from the likes of Abba, Sandie Shaw, and Bucks Fizz, into a kind of prototype for the ostentatiously queer and blasphemous opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics with its notorious trans-tastic blue-hued parody of the Last Supper. From popular singing contest, the whole thing had surgically transitioned into what one Swiss political activist called an ""embarrassing rainbow event"". Another EDU board member, Philippe Karoubi, told journalists Eurovision had now become ""a vector of ideological provocations, which are clearly contrary to Western Judeo-Christian values"". Politically speaking, it had degenerated into a far-left agitprop event, ""an international platform that has been completely instrumentalised to promote ideologies"" like gender-bending. Religiously speaking, some songs were outright satanic, ""blasphemous performances"" based upon ""the occult"", and were ""almost a public form of Black Mass."" This assessment may initially sound hyperbolic, extreme, or merely rhetorical in nature, but Karoubi's words were in fact a reference to Ireland's fairly high-ranking (it finished 10th of 37 entrants in the final results-table ) 2024 Eurovision entry, ' Doomsday Blue ', by the self-declared proponent of ""Ouija pop"" Bambie Thug . Like Switzerland's own Nemo, Bambie declares herself to be non-binary, performing part of her song semi-clad in transgender colours alongside a supporting coterie of freaks dressed as horned drag queen-like devils, evil anti-priests , and tattooed zombie-corpses. It was Bambie who had originally worn the crown of thorns that was later accepted by Nemo following his victory. Unlike Nemo aping Christ, Bambie preferred to ape the Antichrist, her highly pagan performance centring upon Doctor Faustus-style props like pentagrams, Wiccan icons, and so forth. As a self-professed ""queer witch"" whose whole song was about magically cursing an ex-lover, one might expect no less. According to the official Eurovision rulebook, no religious references are allowed in any eligible entries--unless the religions in question are inverted anti-Christian anti-religions like Satanism, Wicca, or Queerness, evidently. For Samuel Kullmann, the leader of the EDU's Eurovision referendum campaign, the fact that Bambie Thug's openly satanic performance was allowed, but the merest hint of any Christian references in a song would be instantly disbarred under Eurovision rules, spoke of ""an egregious double standard"". He did not necessarily expect to actually win the referendum itself, merely to use it as a handy, publicity-generating vehicle for drawing this double standard to wider public notice. As Kullmann explained, the vote was called mainly ""to bring an issue to political attention, to bring it onto the political agenda, even if maybe only a few people in parliament would approve it ... [By such means] you are able to launch a nationwide discussion on an issue that maybe was previously ignored by politics"" and professional, socially distant, politicians. In this sense, the referendum, although lost, may actually have been a partial success. Without it, the false pretence could easily have been maintained by liberal mainstream politicians and media that Eurovision's new overtly and aggressively pro-queer and anti-Christian DEI-type agenda, as expressed through the routines of Nemo and Bambie Thug, were utterly uncontroversial. As it is, thanks to the vote, we can see that around 33% of Basel residents, or one in three, actually seem to find the whole thing morally or religiously objectionable (or possibly just a complete waste of public money). This may be a minority, but it is nonetheless a very sizeable minority; national European governments often win power with only around 30 percent of the vote, as has just happened with the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. The automatically assumed ruling class notion of absolute 100% approval and hegemony for their own chosen subjective values is dispelled by such clearly split votes as an arrogant delusion of pure moral hubris. Perhaps disappointed and dissenting Swiss voters might have an alternative option open to them than tuning in to Eurovision 2025 when the infernal pop-contest comes around again next year, though--they could always turn on their televisions and watch Intervision 2025 instead. Intervision was the old Soviet Union's alternative to Eurovision, held from the late 1960s to the early 1980s in Eastern Bloc Czechoslovakia and Poland, but which the government of Vladimir Putin has recently promised to revive, with Moscow-friendly nations like Belarus, China, Cuba, and Kazakhstan likely to be in attendance. The move has mainly been made in order to make amends for Russia being summarily expelled from the normal Western Eurovision contest following the Kremlin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. However, wishing to disingenuously downplay this fact, Russian authorities have instead been painting their banishment as being very much their own decision to withdraw in the face of devilish Western perversions like the work of Bambie Thug and Nemo, decrying the ""decadent"" and ""degrading"" material routinely on display there. Of course, this may well all be merely self-evident crude political propaganda on Putin's behalf. But so, to be frank, is Queer Eurovision on behalf of gay-worshipping, conservatism-hating, anti-Christian Brussels. In any case, maybe the Russians have a point that Eurovision 2025 is likely to be in some sense demonic in its planned output. I observe that, in the past, Basel--also known as Basle--always used to be pronounced as 'Barz-il'. Today, we are now told it should really be spoken as 'Baal'. Putin's in-house propagandistic opponents of the Brussels Great Satan should take close note.",The European Conservative,2024-12-10T19:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/swiss-referendum-on-eurovision-song-contest-disunited-by-music/
The West’s Great Free Speech Divide,"A new bipolar order of speech is unfolding before our eyes. On one side, the United States is energetically recommitting to its free speech heritage. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, the UK and Europe are tightening the noose of censorship. This divergence is not just a policy debate--it is a fundamental split in the Western world, one that will determine whether future generations will live in freedom or under the shadow of state control. Case in point: on his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing government-led censorship. ""Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society,"" the order states, reaffirming America's constitutional commitment to free speech. The next day, the European Parliament doubled down on social media censorship, convening a meeting on enforcement of the Digital Services Act (DSA), a sweeping European Union law that polices online speech for ""disinformation"" and other ""harmful material"" with unfettered authority. This juxtaposition alone makes clear that, for speech, two irreconcilable visions are on a collision course. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez synthesized the EU's censorious approach at the recent World Economic Forum, stating that more social media regulation is needed for the sake of ""our social cohesion, our mental health, and our democracies."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took it even further : We have freedom of speech in Europe and Germany (...) but we don't accept it if it's supporting extreme-right positions. This is the European model--one where governments dictate acceptable speech and criminalize dissent. The cost of censorship in Europe and the UK is already devastating. British army veteran Adam Smith-Connor was criminally convicted for silently praying near an abortion facility--a thought crime made possible by ""buffer zone"" laws. In Germany, police recently raided the home of a pensioner for posting an ""offensive"" satire about government policies. Longstanding Finnish parliamentarian Paivi Rasanen is set to appear before the Supreme Court of her country for quoting the Bible on X, formerly Twitter. The frightening reality is that tomorrow this could be any one of us. It is impossible for the West to sustain a future where one part is censored and the other remains free. Nowhere is this more evident than in the digital space. Consider the case of Billboard Chris , a Canadian father known for his viral street advocacy against gender ideology. In March, with the support of ADF International and the Human Rights Law Alliance, he will stand trial in Australia--not for actions taken on Australian soil, but for posting content on Twitter/X. His supposed offence? Criticizing a radical WHO appointee in a 2024 post that was subsequently geo-blocked by Australia's ""E-Safety Commission"". The result of this bureaucratic body's overreach is that a Canadian citizen must travel to Australia to defend his right to speak freely on an American-owned social media platform. Billboard Chris' case underscores how censorship regimes are no longer confined by geography--authorities are extending their reach beyond their borders, creating a world where speech is increasingly regulated at a global scale. Emerging from the EU, the DSA and its web of regulations will undoubtedly have effects far beyond Europe. As social media platforms are forced to comply with EU rules or face massive penalties, they will increasingly apply these restrictions worldwide, setting a de facto global standard for speech regulation. This means that even those in free speech jurisdictions may find themselves silenced, as platforms opt for the lowest common denominator of compliance--rather than risk significant financial or legal repercussions. The effect of the American political free speech resurgence cannot be overstated. Famously, Mark Zuckerberg has been among the first to realign, expressing regret over past censorship on Facebook. As he admitted in a stunning reversal, the platform went ""too far,"" and now they ""want to fix that and return to that fundamental commitment to free expression"". The hope is that others read the writing on the wall and follow suit. We are living in an unprecedented era of tension within the West over this most fundamental human right. All who value freedom must recognize the stakes. And these stakes are most dire for the average person that just wants the freedom to peacefully express their views without fear of government punishment. The great free speech divide is upon us. We must side unequivocally with free speech now if we are to have any hope of closing the censorship chasm that has torn apart the West.",The European Conservative,2025-02-03T11:15:02,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-wests-great-free-speech-divide/
Why Do These Terrorists Target Our Children?,"In several unsettling attacks across Europe, lone assailants have singled out children in especially shocking acts of violence. Consider last week's knife assault in Bavaria or the horrifying mass stabbing in Southport for which the killer has just been sentenced. Each time, authorities rush to dismiss terrorism or cite ""psychological problems."" But far from having nothing to do with terrorism, these attacks suggest the emergence of a new kind of nihilistic terror, one which, although different from the ideological jihadism we might be used to, draws on a similar script. These killers express the hatred and contempt they have towards contemporary Western societies in acts of barbarism specifically targeted at children. Their choice of children is not incidental. It is hard not to situate these attacks within a broader pattern of terrorists focusing on children. The Manchester Arena bombing of 2017, where Islamist attackers targeted an Ariana Grande concert, killed 22 people, including ten under 20, with 79 children hospitalized. It fits a historical pattern, from the Beslan school massacre in Russian North Ossetia--where Chechen Islamists took hundreds of children hostage--to the October 2023 Hamas pogrom in Israel, where children were kidnapped and killed. However, the most recent wave of attacks in the West--carried out by lone individuals--does not neatly align with the highly organized, ideologically driven terrorism seen in Manchester or Beslan. Instead, we should understand the attacks as representing a new kind of nihilistic terror. Though scarce, the details of last week's attack in Germany are hard to grasp in any other fashion. On Wednesday 22 January, in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg, an Afghan asylum seeker began following a group of creche children who were out on a supervised nature hike. After a short while, he attacked the group with a knife. Police reported a number of injuries, and, most horrifyingly, the death of a 2-year-old boy and a man, apparently a bystander who intervened. As is now the norm, German authorities rushed to ""rule out terrorism with absolute certainty"" and insisted the individual had ""psychological problems."" Germany is in the grip of something of an epidemic of such incidents. In May, a policeman was killed by an Afghan man after intervening in a knife attack. In August, three people were killed by a Syrian man in Solingen, and in December, a Saudi Arabian national mowed down five people and injured over 200 in an attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg. But perhaps the most chilling parallel is the mass stabbing in Southport Britain, carried out late last year by Axel Rudakubana, a second-generation Rwandan immigrant who has just been sentenced to 52 years in prison. The three children he murdered were six, seven, and nine years old. A further nine young girls received hospital treatment, six of them critically. The barbarity of the attack--parents have asked not to share the details of the degree of mutilation--is almost beyond words. He specifically targeted children, attacking a group attending a Taylor Swift dance class. He told police, ""It's a good thing those children are dead. I'm so glad, I'm so happy."" Authorities in Britain also insisted the attack had nothing to do with terrorism, despite his possession of an Al-Qaeda training manual, the poison ricin, and a history of referrals to the UK's anti-extremism programme, Prevent. There have also been reports of his interest in ""white genocide"" and his cultivation of critical race theory-style grievances against British people. Likewise, in June 2023, a Syrian man with refugee status in Sweden attempted to massacre children in a park in Annecy, France. He stabbed four children, between 22 months and three years old. Police again claimed he had no terrorist intent. These are not straightforwardly jihadist attacks. But neither can they be dismissed as random acts of violence. We need a new frame of reference to understand them. A highly perceptive article by Chris Bayliss in The Critic offers a lens for these attacks. Bayliss argues that such perpetrators appear to be ""individuals who arrived or whose parents arrived ... largely for want of anywhere else in the world to be."" Their defining trait is total alienation from the societies in which they live: Rather than fanaticism or zealotry, our new generation of violent attackers seem to be displaying signs of nihilism. In fact, there is a genuine question as to the extent to which this kind of activity can even be described as 'terrorism' ... They are not driving cars into crowds of Christmas shoppers to unite the Ummah ... Rather, it is the ultimate expression of contempt and resentment for a society they do not understand, and feel no connection to. Bayliss might be too quick to question the language of terrorism. One reason not to is that our authorities seem determined to downplay these incidents as random acts or as social services failures. But the nihilism he identifies does help explain the fixation on children. Children represent a society's future, embodying its innocence and vitality. To alienated individuals consumed by contempt, children may be the most potent and shocking targets--a blow aimed precisely at what their host society values most. This repeated focus on events tied to young people--Ariana Grande concerts, Taylor Swift dance classes--suggests these are not random choices, but deeply resonant symbols. Could anything represent more precisely the so-called ""decadence"" of the West than dancing young girls? This is an isolated, resentful, and often entitled terrorism. Rudakubana seems to have been obsessed with the idea of ethnic cleansing, harbouring grievances about supposed ""racist"" treatment in Britain. The Annecy attacker was reportedly motivated by anger that his asylum application had been refused. Their terror ultimately grows out of hatred for a society they neither belong to nor understand. In that sense, their actions borrow from the ideological script of jihadism--a loathing of Western societies--even if they lack a coherent or explicitly Islamist political program. For these individuals, destroying children is a grotesque way to express their alienation, disdain, and disgust for the societies around them. The cultivation of a sense of terroristic grievance encourages them to lash out at the most defenceless but also the most outrageous targets they can find. They share the ideological terrorists' disdain for the West, if not their level of organization. We cannot seriously pretend there is no link. Instead, they play out in nihilistic fashion the script provided by radical Islamism. To address this growing wave of nihilistic terror, we must face the anti-Westernism cultivated by Islamists and their apologists. Securing society will demand more than the long-overdue tightening of borders; it will require a political reckoning with the hatred that fuels these attacks.",The European Conservative,2025-01-28T14:50:10,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/why-do-these-terrorists-target-our-children/
The NGO Pope Commits ‘Ecclesiastical Suicide’,"In 1571, Pope Pius V created the Holy League, organizing the Catholic states of Europe in a coalition to end Ottoman control of the Eastern Mediterranean, and to protect Europe from Islamic invasion. The naval Battle of Lepanto that year resulted in the near-total destruction of the Ottoman fleet by the Christian forces, and bought Europe time. The final assault of the Ottoman Empire on Europe would come just over a century later, at the gates of Vienna, where the Europeans defeated the Turks for all time. The point is this: the Catholic Church once had a pope who defended Western civilization. That was then. Now it has Pope Francis. Earlier this week, the pontiff released a public letter to the American bishops , instructing them to resist the Trump administration's attempts to deport illegal migrants and to regain control of America's borders. In this key passage, Francis writes: I have followed closely the major crisis that is taking place in the United States with the initiation of a program of mass deportations. The rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality. At the same time, one must recognize the right of a nation to defend itself and keep communities safe from those who have committed violent or serious crimes while in the country or prior to arrival. That said, the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness. Got that? Just because migrants broke the law to enter America does not mean that they are criminals. Who can fathom the subtlety of the Jesuit pope's mind? In the letter, Francis pays lip service to the Church's teaching that nations have rights to defend and protect themselves, but affirms his belief that nations must accept non-criminal migrants as an act of charity. Elsewhere in the epistle, Francis implicitly condemns Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic, for misunderstanding the Church's teaching on ordo amoris --the order of love. Vance, a convert who was catechized by two of the most intelligent Dominican priests in America (I introduced him personally to his first teacher), had defended the administration's tough migration policy by referring to St. Thomas Aquinas' teaching that the order of love requires us to love those closest to us first--not exclusively, but primarily, as God has given us the duty to care for them. It turns out that JD Vance really is more Catholic than the pope . The Catechism teaches that the moral duty towards foreign refugees must be balanced by duties to the common good of the people within one's own country. Yes, wealthy countries do have a moral responsibility to be generous in welcoming distressed foreigners, but they have the right to set limits on migration, and to refuse it when they judge that it harms the common good. The official Catholic teaching balances charity with common sense. JD Vance understands that; Pope Francis does not. The pope, in his teaching, has sanctified open borders--even, as in Europe, when those ungated frontiers allow the migration into the Christian lands of Europe of millions of Muslims who at minimum do not share the ancestral faith of Europeans, and no small number of whom are militantly hostile to it. If Francis had lived in the time of Pius V, Europe would be Islamic today. R.R. Reno, the Catholic editor of First Things , the leading U.S. Christian theological journal, wrote in response to the new Francis letter : The practical upshot of the Holy Father's letter is nothing other than the globalist, open borders position, glibly theologized. This, Francis implies, is the only position permitted for true Christians who honor Christ's universal love. Reno writes that in reading Pope Francis over the years, it seems that the pontiff is an ""accelerationist"" who believes the West--especially the United States--is so evil that only when it is destroyed can we live in a truly Christian society. He continues: This borderless fraternity is a true utopia, a world of no-place, a future universal society free from the grave evil of loyalty to one's country--Donald Trump's terrible crime against universal love. ""I don't envy America's bishops,"" writes Reno. ""It's a hard task to require the faithful to attend Mass so that they can be told that loving one's country and its citizens is a wicked sin. That's a recipe for ecclesiastical suicide."" Yes, and for civilizational suicide, as many Europeans today can attest. Major European cities are overrun by migrants, who are disproportionately guilty of murders, rapes, stealing, and other serious crimes. Some of them are Islamic radicals who engage in acts of terrorism against the peoples and countries who have taken them in. In 2016, two Islamic terrorists--one born in Algeria, the other the French-born son of migrants-- slaughtered an elderly French priest , Father Jacques Hamel, as he was celebrating Mass. On Monday in Paris, the trial of Brahim Aouissaoui for the murders of three Christians, and the attempted murder of six more, began. The accused is a Tunisian charged with invading a church in Nice in 2020, and carrying out savage knife attacks. Prosecutors say the young man, now 25, left Tunisia for France with terroristic intent. He had previously described France as ""a country of miscreants and dogs."" According to Pope Francis's thinking, though, to have deported this Tunisian before he cut Catholic throats would have been an impermissible assault on his dignity. Leaving aside terrorism and lesser (but still violent) crimes, mass migration has made daily life hard to endure for native-born Europeans. I asked a French woman living in Budapest why she chooses the Hungarian capital over her native Paris. She told me that it's because in Budapest, capital of a country that has strict migration laws, she can walk around without fear of harassment or assault. In her hometown, she was constantly threatened, sexually and otherwise, by migrants. She said even female Muslims in hijab routinely spat at her and made threats about how the French would soon learn their proper place. That doesn't happen in Budapest. You know where else it doesn't happen? In Vatican City, where Pope Francis lives in order and peace, safely behind high walls . He is like the scribes and Pharisees, the religious authorities condemned by Jesus (Matthew 23:1-4), who, in Our Lord's words, ""do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them."" The pope's indirect rebuke of Vance raises the question: how often did Francis call out the Catholic president Joe Biden for his open and extreme support of abortion and gender ideology, both of which have been condemned by Francis? Answer: none. For that matter, how often has Francis criticized China's Xi Jinping in this way for his government's grotesque persecution of Chinese Christians, as well as for the genocide of Uighur Muslims? Answer: none. To be sure, Francis rightly opposes China's persecution of Christians and Muslims. But it is only the Trump administration that receives this kind of personal rebuke from the pontiff--and that's for simply trying to regain control of its borders and enforce American law. And it is only the bishops of the United States who have been openly tasked by the Bishop of Rome with resisting their government, which is acting to serve the common good of the people who elected it. For politicians, supporting open borders covers a multitude of sins, at least in the eyes of Pope Francis. Last November, the pope paid a visit to Emma Bonino, a left-wing Italian politician who played a leading role in legalizing abortion in that country in the 1970s. Francis brought the ailing Bonino roses and chocolates, and, likely referring to her pro-migration work, called her an ""example of freedom and resistance."" What did R.R. Reno mean when he characterized Francis's call to the US bishops as ""ecclesiastical suicide""? That the Roman pontiff is turning American Catholics against their pope, and the bishops who follow his instructions. But then, by governing the Catholic Church as a sentimental, progressive humanitarian, as if the Church were nothing more than a left-wing NGO, Francis long ago lost moral authority among many Catholics. Who would ever have imagined that in order to defend what is left of their civilization, and the peace, good order, and integrity of their nations, faithful Catholics of the West would have to defy their pope? Somewhere, Pius V weeps.",The European Conservative,2025-02-12T17:08:38,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-ngo-pope-commits-ecclesiastical-suicide/
California’s Bonfire of Vanities,"It's fair to call the recent Los Angeles wildfires 'apocalyptic,' in the generally accepted use of the word: a total cataclysm. The immense destruction caused by the fires, whipped by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds, will likely make this the worst natural disaster in US history--and as of this writing, the fires still rage. But they have also been an apocalypse in the strict, etymological sense of the word: an unveiling of things hidden. The main thing uncovered by the harsh light of the flames is the utter bankruptcy of liberalism in power. It is impossible to say how things will turn politically for California after the fires have been doused and staggered Angelenos are left sifting through the ashes, but it is equally impossible to imagine that they will return to normal for one of the bluest states in America. On X, some diehard California leftists have taken to blaming Donald Trump for the disaster. This is risible. The Republican Party scarcely exists there, and hasn't for many years. At every political level, Democrats--and not just any Democrats, but among the most progressive in the nation --control the levers of power. Gov. Gavin Newsom is a Democrat. The state legislature is controlled by Democrats. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is not only a Democrat, but when she was younger, traveled to Castro's Cuba to donate labor in an ideological work program designed to show solidarity with the island's Communist dictatorship. Moreover, L.A. has long prided itself on being a showcase of liberalism, most especially in Hollywood, the world's dream factory, where liberal values take pride of place both on- and off-screen. Los Angeles has been inundated with illegal migrants from Latin America, of whom the city's leaders boast. Diversity is our strength, after all. California has always positioned itself to the rest of America, and indeed the world, as a sun-splashed paradise, a charmed land of leisure and enlightenment. The charming Oscar-winning 2016 film musical La La Land hymns this vision of California and its premier city. And now, it lies in ashes. There are lessons. Back in the day, when the Democrats were still a party that cared about the working class, its urban leaders knew how to govern. True, they had their faults, but government more or less worked. Then, after the 1960s, American liberals turned their enthusiasm away from improving the economic conditions of the masses, and instead focused on the boutique enthusiasms of the educated. Left-wing identity politics and its particular passions--the various iterations of multiculturalism and sexual revolution--moved to center stage. This has happened everywhere liberalism ruled, but perhaps nowhere has left-wing ideology triumphed as in California, a state whose great weather, abundant resources, and iconic status as the fullest expression of the American Dream shielded its people from the consequences of their political folly. When ideology meets reality, it's rarely a fair fight. Things have been declining in California for some time. High taxes and stifling regulations have driven many of the state's most productive people out. Mass migration, a sacred cow in California political culture, has driven up the cost of government and diminished the quality of life. The rise of political extremism within the state's education system has devastated public schooling and diminished its world-class public universities. In recent years, homelessness has overwhelmed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other municipalities. And the explosion of crime after the 2020 George Floyd killing, which suppressed policing and made racial minorities sacrosanct, has made California's cities increasingly unlivable. Video clips of looting and brazen shoplifting there have become staples of social media discourse. Crime has become so bad that Democratic voters even drove progressive district attorneys, whose campaigns were promoted by George Soros, out of office. And yet, somehow, California carried on. The national Democratic Party even nominated a California liberal, Kamala Harris, as its standard bearer in last fall's presidential election. The state's sitting governor, the handsome but oily Gavin Newsom, has been widely discussed as a leading candidate for president in 2028. It's all gone now. The California political class--again, all liberals to the marrow--stands utterly discredited by the L.A. catastrophe. It has been a bonfire of progressive vanities. Southern California wildfires are common in the region's dry climate. Clearing underbrush outside of fire season is standard practice to reduce the likelihood of wildfire, and to minimize their destructive capacity. We now know that leaders did not take adequate care of this simple, maintenance duty. Extensive state and national environmental regulations--California has the strictest such laws in the country--have made controlled burns of underbrush difficult to implement. The Santa Ynez reservoir, which normally holds 117 million gallons of water for the Pacific Palisades area--the one hardest hit by the wildfires-- sat drained and empty when the fire broke out. The state had emptied it near the start of fire season, said state officials, because of clean water regulations. Donald Trump alleged that the Newsom administration's determination to protect the smelt, an endangered small fish, prevented reservoir water from going to L.A., but that has been credibly disputed. Whatever the truth, Los Angeles fire hydrants ran dry in the clutch. Many homeowners whose houses have been reduced to smoking rubble have no insurance because state regulations forced insurance companies to abandon the market. Because the state would not allow them to raise rates commensurate to the risk of wildfires, insurers pulled out. Some progressive diehards are now howling about the wickedness of these companies, but common sense tells you that it makes no sense for insurers to plan to lose fortunes because of artificially controlled rates that compel them to deny real-world risk. Like most liberal governments, the City of Los Angeles placed a premium on social justice. Across America, firefighting is a profession that overwhelmingly attracts white males. This is considered to be a very bad thing--and if fire departments have to lower their standards to attract more women and minorities, well, they say, it's only fair. Thus, the Los Angeles Fire Department, led by a lesbian chief, made DEI and a DEI-related initiative two of its top three goals , more important than ""disaster recovery capabilities."" In a promotional video circulated before the fires, Kristine Larson, a black lesbian LA assistant fire chief taunted critics of diversity . Larson said that if someone questioned whether or not females had sufficient physical strength to do their jobs - like, carrying someone out of a burning building - she would respond by saying, ""He got himself in the wrong place if I have to carry him out of a fire."" Got that? A man who burns to death because the lady firefighter was not strong enough to lift him is at fault for his own demise. Social justice cannot fail; it can only be failed. A black lesbian L.A. firefighter blaming victims for their own suffering is the perfect icon of contemporary liberalism. Above all, what the L.A. apocalypse reveals is the staggering cost of trying to force reality into an ideological straitjacket. Liberalism did not cause the wildfires, but what California liberalism tells people of the state is that if they've lost their homes and all their worldly possessions to the fires, well then, they got themselves in the wrong place. When the smoke clears, this is a lesson that, no doubt, tens of thousands of middle-class Angelenos will take away from the conflagration. They will leave, relocating to states that have not been wrecked by progressive pieties and ideological illusions, and take their skills with them. California's reputation as a sunny oasis of liberalism and prosperity has gone up in smoke. The political careers of Gov. Newsom and Mayor Bass are over. Bass is especially disgraced. Not only did she cut $17.6 million from the fire department in this year's budget, but she was in Africa on a political junket when the fires broke out. Even famously liberal celebrities are turning on their leaders. Actress Sara Foster, a pro-LGBT feminist Democrat, blasted Newsom and Bass on X, tweeting : We pay the highest taxes in California. Our fire hydrants were empty. Our vegetation was overgrown, brush not cleared. Our reservoirs were emptied by our governor because tribal leaders wanted to save fish. Our fire department budget was cut by our mayor. But thank god drug addicts are getting their drug kits. RESIGN. Your far left policies have ruined our state. And also our party. It is a cultural truism that what happens in California rarely stays in California. The state has always been a global trendsetter. If anything good can emerge like a phoenix from the ashes of Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and other once-idyllic enclaves, it is the fierce hope that progressive ruling classes everywhere--even in Europe, where mass migration and economic decline are analogs to the L.A. fires--will have burned themselves out.",The European Conservative,2025-01-16T12:03:20,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/californias-bonfire-of-the-vanities/
How J.K. Rowling Defeated the Transgender Movement,"The past six months have been tough for the transgender movement; the past week has been terrible. President Donald Trump has signed a string of executive orders targeting gender ideology, affirming that the U.S. government recognizes only the male-female sex binary, protecting minors ""from chemical and surgical mutilation,"" and targeting LGBT indoctrination in schools. In Canada this week, two large-scale studies highlighted , once again, that evidence for the efficacy of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers is weak to the point of non-existence. This confirms the UK National Health Service's Cass Review, published last April , which condemned the use of transgender ""treatments"" in minors. A decade ago, the transgender movement was ascendant. Now, the pillars of their ideology are being broken across the West. The coalition of activists that has brought this about--from social conservatives to radical feminists, from Elon Musk to J.K. Rowling--is a truly strange one. There are many who deserve a portion of the credit for these victories, but perhaps no single figure has had the impact of J.K. Rowling, who on April 1st of last year, days before the Cass Review was published, single-handedly neutered Scotland's hate speech bill. The Scottish government's Hate Crime and Public Order Act 2021, designed to replace the previous common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel, had finally come into effect after years of ineffectual pushback. It prohibits the vague offence of ""stirring up hate"" against anyone based on a range of characteristics, including ""transgender identity."" The law was deliberately vague for maximum chilling effect, and trans activists triumphantly announced that ""misgendering"" and other public objections to their ideology were now illegal. Rowling took aim and fired. First, she posted a string of tweets sarcastically referring to various trans-identified male sexual predators as ""women."" She ended the thread by throwing down the gauntlet to the Scottish authorities: Only kidding. Obviously, the people mentioned in the above tweets aren't women at all, but men, every last one of them. In passing the Scottish Hate Crime Act, Scottish lawmakers seem to have placed higher value on the feelings of men performing their idea of femaleness, however misogynistically or opportunistically, than on the rights and freedoms of actual women and girls. The new legislation is wide open to abuse by activists who wish to silence those of us speaking out about the dangers of eliminating women's and girls' single-sex spaces, the nonsense made of crime data if violent and sexual assaults committed by men are recorded as female crimes, the grotesque unfairness of allowing males to compete in female sports, the injustice of women's jobs, honours and opportunities being taken by trans-identified men, and the reality and immutability of biological sex ... Freedom of speech and belief are at an end in Scotland if the accurate description of biological sex is deemed criminal. I'm currently out of the country, but if what I've written here qualifies as an offence under the terms of the new act, I look forward to being arrested when I return to the birthplace of the Scottish Enlightenment. If you agree with the views set out in this tweet, please retweet it. She ended with a challenge: #ArrestMe . It was retweeted over 35,000 times. The Scottish government folded. On April 2nd, the police affirmed that complaints had been filed against Rowling, but that her ""misgendering"" posts and other statements opposing transgender ideology were not illegal. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak publicly expressed his support for her stance. Rowling declared victory on X: ""I hope every woman in Scotland who wishes to speak up for the reality and importance of biological sex will be reassured by this announcement, and I trust that all women--irrespective of profile or financial means--will be treated equally under the law. If they go after any woman for simply calling a man a man, I'll repeat that woman's words and they can charge us both at once."" Rowling had become Public Enemy Number One for the transgender movement when, on December 19th, 2019, she came out publicly in defense of Maya Forstater , who had lost her job for social media posts identifying ""transgender women"" as men. The LGBT movement responded to Rowling's tweet with a two-pronged strategy: They accused her of endangering ""trans children,"" and the LGBT lobby group GLAAD menacingly offered to host a re-education meeting for her where she could do penance and correct her thinking. Rowling contemptuously declined the offer. The public cancellation campaign heated up. The LGBT movement threw everything at her. There was media condemnation; furious editorials; banishment from events associated with characters she had created. But Rowling, as it turned out, had done her research and was not interested in surrender. In fact, the trans jihad only made her angrier. She exposed their campaign of personal destruction on X , writing that women, including herself, face ""endless death and rape threats, threats of loss of livelihood,"" had their ""employers targeted,"" suffered ""physical harassment,"" and in one case a ""family address posted online with [a] picture of [a] bomb-making manual."" For LGBT activists, Rowling's public stance is more than opposition--it is betrayal. Rowling is a cultural elite and they expected her to be on their side. Harry Potter is the best-selling book series in history. It sold over 600 million copies, was translated into 84 languages, and was adapted into blockbuster Hollywood films. The franchise is a cultural phenomenon; there are theme parks, walking tours, and a staggering amount of merchandise. Until her fateful 2019 tweet, Rowling was considered impeccably progressive: she is pro-choice and supported redefining marriage , and she retroactively announced a Harry Potter character was gay. But when Rowling stepped off the rainbow reservation and the LGBT movement tried to cancel her, she turned out to be more powerful than they are. When all else failed, LGBT activists tried physical threats. Activists showed up at Rowling's home in Edinburgh and publicly posted her address online. She has received ""so many death threats I could paper the house with them,"" she wrote, has faced ""campaigns of intimidation,"" and noted that many ""families have been put into a state of fear and distress."" Her stance has revealed the true, ugly face of the transgender movement that so many of their less famous opponents have suffered for years. ""Perhaps...the best way to prove your movement isn't a threat to women, is to stop stalking, harassing and threatening us,"" Rowling wrote. They won't, of course. Rowling won't stop, either. On the five-year anniversary of her famous 2019 tweet, she stated that her only regret is not speaking out earlier. Many ""people around me, including some I love, were begging me not to speak,"" she wrote in the Times . But her silence caused her ""chronic pain,"" because ""I'd come to believe that the socio-political movement insisting 'trans women are women' was neither kind nor tolerant, but in fact profoundly misogynistic, regressive, dangerous in some of its objectives and nakedly authoritarian in its tactics"" and she believes that ""what is being done to troubled young people in the name of gender identity ideology is, indeed, a terrible medical scandal."" As to those who tell her almost daily on social media that she is destroying her ""legacy,"" Rowling's response is blunt. ""I do not walk around my house thinking about my legacy,"" she said. ""What a pompous way to live your life, walking around thinking, what will my legacy be? Whatever, I'll be dead. I care about now. I care about the living."" As the public consensus swings slowly but inexorably against transgender ideology, Rowling's new legacy is beginning to emerge. She is one of the only cultural elites who had the courage and foresight to oppose and expose a violent, totalitarian movement perpetrating the greatest medical scandal since eugenics. She leveraged her fame, her wealth, and her cultural power to amplify and support the beleaguered activists who had been battling the ascendant transgender movement for years. And against all odds, she is winning--and exposing the cowardice of her fellow elites and the viciousness of the transgender movement in the process.",The European Conservative,2025-01-30T17:51:13,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/how-j-k-rowling-defeated-the-transgender-movement/
The Gaza Hospital Blood Libel,"On Friday (27 December) and Saturday (28 December), the Israeli Defence Forces conducted a raid on the Kamal Adwan hospital in Gaza. The IDF said it was being used as a Hamas command and control centre. At the hospital they arrested no fewer than 240 terrorists, 15 of whom, they said, had participated in the October 7 massacre in Israel. Inside the hospital, they found weapons including grenades, guns, and military equipment. The IDF killed 19 terrorists there; 700 civilians were evacuated and none was killed. Some of the terror operatives, said the IDF, posed as medical staff and patients. Some tried to leave on stretchers and in ambulances; of a first group of 21 patients leaving the hospital, 13 turned out to be terrorist suspects. The IDF also said that before the raid, 350 patients as well as caregivers and medical personnel were evacuated to other hospitals. The Israelis delivered thousands of litres of fuel, food, and medical supplies for the essential functioning of the hospital. Once operations began 95 patients, caregivers, and medical personnel were evacuated to Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, to which the IDF delivered 5,000 litres of fuel, two generators and medical equipment. Additionally, hundreds of civilians were able to move away from the area for their own safety via defined evacuation routes. In video footage taken by Hamas itself and released by the IDF , Hamas operatives were filmed planting explosives about 45 metres away from the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, to where patients from Kamal Adwan were moved. Using a hospital for military purposes is a war crime. It turns such a hospital from a protected space into a legitimate military target under international law. In Britain and America, however, the media did not report the hijack of Kamal Adwan hospital as a war crime. There was no outcry over the gross abuse of medical facilities that had turned a place of healing into an active war front and put patients at risk. Instead, media outlets faithfully parroted Hamas propaganda and accused Israel of burning the hospital down. NBC News headlined the story: Israel burns northern Gaza's last functioning hospital; patients and staff removed. AP wrote: Middle East latest: Israeli soldiers burn a hospital in Gaza. Newsweek wrote: North Gaza Hospital Burns After Israel Removes Patients, Staff: Officials. The Guardian headlined its live blog: Officials claim Israeli military ""burning"" Kamal Adwan hospital after forced evacuation of patients. Also parroting Hamas was its ideological soul-mate, the World Health Organisation, which tweeted on X: Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid. The IDF replied that the fire accusation was a heinous lie. It tweeted: Today, the IDF started a counter-terrorism precise operation in the area of Kamal Adwan hospital. While IDF troops were not in the hospital, a small fire broke out in an empty building inside the hospital that is under control. After preliminary examination, no connection was found between IDF activity to the fire. Meanwhile, headlines are exclaiming ""IDF troops burned the hospital"". Running with unsubstantiated reports on the cause of this fire shows nothing but questionable journalistic integrity. No major mainstream media outlet reported this IDF statement. Instead, a hue and cry has been building over the arrest of the hospital's director, Dr. Hussam abu Safiya, on suspicion of being a Hamas terrorist. Abu Safiya has been near-universally presented as a saintly doctor trying vainly to protect his patients against Israeli aggression. Earlier this month, the New York Times published an affecting account of his cry for help as the last doctor in the hospital. However, it would appear that abu Safiya is perhaps less saintly than the New York Times would have us believe. On October 9 2023, two days after the Hamas pogrom, abu Safiya reportedly described it on his personal social media account as an act of God. Photographs have shown him meeting top Hamas officials. He has also posted this : O Allah, protect our people in the West Bank in general and in Jenin in particular, and protect the beloved people of Palestine and al Aqsa Mosque from the oppression and aggression of the Jews. and this : O Allah, we place You before them, and we seek refuge in You from their evil. O Allah, turn their plots against them and make their destruction in their schemes. O Allah, protect the Jenin refugee camp from the plots of the criminals. One might think that such a man would obviously have questions to answer if 240 of his staff, including doctors and other health workers, were discovered to be terrorists. Instead, the media did what they invariably do--imply that the IDF can't be believed while they report Hamas claims without question. Except, of course, where Hamas actually tell the truth. Which the media don't report at all. One year ago, the former director of the Kamal Adwan hospital, Ahmad Kahlot, who had been a senior member of Hamas since 2010, revealed in a Shin Bet interrogation that his hospital had been turned into a military facility under Hamas's control and that at one point it had even housed a kidnapped Israeli soldier. Times of Israel reported in December 2023: In footage published on Tuesday by the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces, hospital director Ahmed Kahlot could be seen telling an Israeli interrogator that Hamas had offices inside the hospital and used it as a base for operational activity. According to Kahlot, who said he has been a lieutenant colonel in Hamas since 2010, some 16 members of the hospital's staff -- including doctors, nurses and paramedics -- were Hamas operatives serving in the al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the terror organisation. He added that several members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's Al-Quds Brigades were also employed in the hospital. During this interrogation, Kahlot described how Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, including hiding its operatives, carrying out military activity, moving around Hamas members. He told his interrogators : They hide in hospitals because for them a hospital is a safe place. They won't be targeted when they are inside a hospital. I know 16 employees in the hospital -- doctor, nurse, paramedic, or clerks... who also have different positions in al-Qassam. There are offices where the Hamas leader and two of the senior officials were. There's a place where the soldier was in (the kidnapped soldier). There's a place for the interrogators, internal security, and special security. All of them have private telephone lines inside the hospital. They [Hamas] have a private ambulance, even it colour and the way it's painted are different, and it doesn't have a licence plate. They used it to transport the soldier [kidnapped] and transport bodies... It didn't assist us with transporting the injured. I begged [him] to take someone to the Indonesian Hospital, take to Shifa [hospital], but he would refused. His mission is more important. The leaders of Hamas are cowards. They left us in the field while they hide in secret places... They have destroyed us. A few days ago, the Palestinian Authority, no less, stated that Hamas turns hospitals into military interrogation facilities. Palestinian Media Watch has reported that the PA posted up a summons issued by Hamas instructing a Gazan to report to Nasser Hospital to be interrogated there by Hamas's military intelligence. The post was made by the former official spokesman of the PA Security Forces, Adnan al Damiri. Moreover, al Damiri criticised Hamas for continuing to use hospitals for ""summonses, interrogations, and extortions"". You might think that the WHO would be extremely concerned to hear of this gross abuse of medical facilities and the commission of such war crimes against patients and doctors. But on this, the WHO is silent. Instead its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X : Hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds and the health system is under severe threat . Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is out of service following the raid, forced patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director. His whereabouts are unknown. We call for his immediate release. Now look at this post on X by Eitan Fishberger, which he says provides a translation of the first two paragraphs of an article on the Palestinian Donia al Watan news site that acknowledges abu Safiya's rank in Hamas: The Directorate of Military Medical Services organised a series of scientific lectures on Wednesday morning for paediatricians from hospitals and paediatric departments in Adwan Complex, the Algerian Hospital, and paediatric departments affiliated with the Ministry of Health. The lectures were held in the conference hall within the Adwan Complex in North Gaza Governorate. The opening was attended by the Director General of Medical Services, Brigadier General Saeed Al-Saudi; the Director of the Adwan Complex, Colonel Ahmad Al-Kahlout; the Director of the Paediatric Hospital at the Adwan Complex, Colonel Hossam Abu Safia; and approximately 60 doctors working in paediatric departments in hospitals affiliated with the Medical Services and the Ministry of Health across the Gaza Strip. The text explicitly uses terms that imply a military context: The phrase ""Directorate of Military Medical Services"" is translated from ""mdyry@ lkhdmt lTby@ l`skry@"". The word ""`skry@"" explicitly denotes a military affiliation. The rank ""Brigadier General"" is referred to in Arabic as ""l`myd s`yd ls`wdy"", where ""`myd"" is equivalent to Brigadier General in military terminology. The rank ""Colonel"" appears in ""l`qyd 'Hmd lkHlwt"" and ""l`qyd Hsm 'bw Sfy@"", where ""`qyd"" directly translates to Colonel. The text is framed within a military structure, as evidenced by the use of these designations. Even if some of these details aren't correct, Hamas has itself acknowledged that Gaza's hospitals are used for military purposes and that the Kamal Adwan hospital is a Hamas terrorist hub. These are war crimes; yet on all this, the media and the WHO are silent. Instead, they accuse Israel of burning a hospital and targeting the sick. That's a blood libel. Where are the decent western leaders to call out this evil? This article was published on the author's Substack on December 31, 2024.

Expanding Our Reach,"As we went to press with the Winter 2024 print issue of The European Conservative , we kept hearing our conservative friends in the U.S. proclaim jubilantly: ""We're so back!"" The election of Donald Trump has given the American Right a solid mandate. But it's not just Americans who are pushing back against corrupt bureaucrats and 'woke' nonsense, or speaking up for traditional values and fighting on behalf of Western civilization. Here across the Atlantic, the European Right is also in the ascendant. In Austria, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, to name but a few, there have been many encouraging, positive developments. And with Javier Milei in South America, we cannot ignore that we are on the verge of an historic moment--and now face the possibility of forming a truly international alliance of nationalist-populists. However, neither the American Right nor the European Right are monolithic. There are a variety of (sometimes conflicting) platforms and positions--and we think these are all worth considering with seriousness and care. This gets to the very heart of our mission: exploring the various conservative traditions in Europe and around the world. In fact, at The European Conservative , we have always sought to provide coverage of the wide ranging intellectual and political developments on the Right--even those considered 'controversial.' As we near the end of this year, we reflect on the past three successful years of this kind of work. And as we prepare to start 2025, we are well positioned to expand this project by focusing on our various products--namely print and online--and creating specialized divisions for each. Thus, from the beginning of January 2025, a new online division at the europeanconservative.com website will sharpen its focus on current affairs and news, along with commentary and analysis. The print division, on the other hand, will continue to produce The European Conservative --the lush, full-color quarterly magazine that so many admire. Both divisions will be inspired by the civilizational values that we think undergird all forms of conservatism. As part of this, The European Conservative print quarterly will continue looking at some of the important themes that are emerging on the Right--and explore how they fit within various philosophical and intellectual conservative traditions. The perennial questions that guide these efforts remain the same: What is conservatism? Is there a 'new Right?' Is revolutionary or reactionary conservatism the way forward? Is there a sort of neo-fusionism emerging? Are there principles to which all on the Right can agree? And if Trump can MAGA, can Europe MEGA? And as we consider these questions, we will continue to build on our reputation as ""Europe's leading conservative English-language quarterly of philosophy, politics, art, and contemporary affairs."" Another aim at the print magazine is to provide content targeted at readers who find themselves politically homeless--that is, 'refugees' from the center or the Left--and who feel they have been abandoned by the increasingly radical agenda of left-wing and mainstream parties. The Left is no longer the home of the 'working man,' for whom today's progressive elites have nothing but disdain. It thus cannot be a surprise that right-wing parties everywhere have been attracting voters from across the ideological spectrum. If you are one of these disenchanted voters-- or perhaps just a new reader of our print quarterly--we welcome you. It is a place for the exploration of books, ideas, and positions; for serious engagement with new political theories; and for reflection on the future of our Judeo-Christian heritage. And The European Conservative quarterly magazine will continue to offer cutting-edge writing from across the dissident and 'disruptive' Right. We hasten to remind readers that we also firmly believe in civilized discussions and vigorous debate as sound paths to understanding. As we have so often stated, ""we publish ... a range of viewpoints on the Right, broadly conceived, including but not limited to: agrarians, anti-statists, classical liberals, decentralists, integralists, monarchists, nationalists, populists, radical localists, sovereigntists, and defenders of the Judeo-Christian and Western tradition."" But we are not beholden to any of them. In everything we plan to do in 2025, we will remain committed to providing content that reminds us of beauty, elevates the mind and soul, and points our eyes toward Heaven. Who knows ... in the process, we might even be able to save the West. Join us. This editorial has been adapted from the Winter 2024 issue of the quarterly print magazine, now available here .",The European Conservative,2024-12-23T08:00:52,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/expanding-our-reach/
We Are Conservatives,"We are conservatives and we value goodness, truth, and beauty. That is, we like St. John Paul II, Thomas Aquinas, and Ivanka Trump. We also like beer, but I don't want to detract from the solemnity of this moment. We are conservatives and we do not believe in the natural goodness of human beings--perhaps because we know that we are imperfect, perhaps because we have looked evil in the face more than once, and perhaps because we knew that, one day, Pedro Sanchez would be president of the Socialist International. We are conservatives and we believe that the government is often the problem, not the solution. We are conservatives and we believe that any climate solution that ruins family economies is immoral and should be opposed. Most of us think that climate change is a ploy by the Left to impose a totalitarian system, and that human activity is, to sum up, irrelevant to the temperature--especially if only the West acts, while the truly polluting countries take advantage of our green epiphany. We are conservatives and we respect our ancestors, we are proud of the successes and mistakes of our history, and we embrace the Constitution because we know that it guarantees the rule of law so that we may live in peace and freedom. We are conservatives and we do not idolise what some call 'progress.' We like prosperity better. We are conservatives and we like freedom, individual property, and life. We like life so much that we defend it from its beginning to its end, and we oppose outright the murder of babies and the elderly, as well as the disgusting industry that makes money from their blood. We are the conservatives and the word 'taxation' gives us hives. We are conservatives and we care about language. We abhor the attacks that the Left promotes against our languages, whether in the form of unhinged pronouns, or in the form of euphemisms to mould minds through language. We are the conservatives and our mission is to preserve tradition and cultural baggage. We reject any attempt by the Left to cancel works, books, films, or historical figures. We will raise every statue they tear down. We will reprint every book they burn. We are the conservatives and our girls are prettier. Just look at the young people who show up at right-wing rallies. We are conservatives and we think that communism is a crime and that socialism is theft. We are conservatives and we believe in national sovereignty and international cooperation. We oppose globalism that seeks to leave local decisions in foreign hands--especially if those hands are those of George Soros and Bill Gates, who have hooks rather than hands. We are the conservatives and we do not sit down and negotiate with terrorists. We are the conservatives and, by and large, we believe in the transcendence of human life, we believe that there is something beyond it, and we believe that God cares about the destinies of our nation. We are the conservatives and we can discuss among ourselves without purging each other like the communists do. We can discuss everything in freedom, because we are looking for the best political solution, even though we know that the best political solution does not exist. We are the conservatives and we are so 'crazy' that we believe that the human species is divided only into two sexes: male and female. We are the conservatives and we are in a great moment. We have the best solutions for the worst problems. And, as the rock star Javier Milei says, we are better.",The European Conservative,2024-12-12T16:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/we-are-conservatives/
"Without Europeans, Europe Has No Future","The global population crisis--that is, the sharply declining birth rate, which has hit nearly every country on earth, absent (for now) those in sub-Saharan Africa--is perhaps the greatest threat facing civilization. But it's the one few people want to talk about. Well, that's not quite true. In Europe, where birth rates have been below replacement levels for many years, political leaders have no choice but to talk about it. The problem is that most of them only want to say, and hear, one thing: that mass migration from more fertile countries is the only possible solution. In January, when the European Commission presented its 'Demography Toolbox,' conservative European parliamentarians criticized it for prioritizing migration over other potential solutions to the crisis. Left-wing MEPs predictably denounced them as racist, hateful, and xenophobic--still confident, one assumes, that they can make unpleasant truths magically disappear with progressive buzzwords. But can anyone plausibly deny that mass migration is tearing Europe apart? Oh, it certainly is denied--not only by establishment leaders, but by the millions of voters who still support them, out of terror of voting for the so-called 'far right.' The right-wing AfD was held off in Germany's recent election, despite it doubling its numbers, but no serious person expects the centrist establishment coalition that will now govern Germany to solve its grave crises. The same is true across Europe, but it won't be true for much longer. In an unsparing analysis of the death of the old order, liberal Northern Irish commenter Gerry Lynch poleaxed the Left for its smug unwillingness to accept that real-world conditions had changed radically, such that its old certainties no longer held. Lynch writes, ""Paradigms depend on faith; loss of faith kills them."" His point is that the managerial-liberal paradigm that has framed and guided politics in the United States and Europe since the end of World War II is dead. Europeans have idealized their model of transnational governance, with its welfare-statism, its hardline secularity, its cultural liberalism, its hostility to national sovereignty, its sentimental humanism, and its openness to mass migration. Europeans have been living in a dream world, underwritten in part by the willingness of America to pay for its defense. The mounting cost of living inherent in this paradigm has been denied for many years by European leaders and those who vote for them. On the migration issue, as in America, politicians have consistently acted against the wishes of their publics, but they mostly haven't had to pay a price for it. Those days are coming to an end, and the regime change--the paradigm shift--in America will accelerate the collapse of what you might call the Brussels Utopia. It must be said, though, that this is not only a problem with the Eurocratic ruling class. Europe really does depend on cheap migrant labor. France's economic minister recently claimed on national television that France needs more migrants . The massive cultural cost of this structural economic policy is paid by ordinary Europeans who are dealing with skyrocketing violent crime, including terror murders by Islamists. And it will be paid by future generations of Europeans, who will inherit nations perhaps irreversibly changed--de-Europeanized--by the presence of these migrants and their children. All honest Europeans know this. And they hate it. Everybody else either lives in denial, or, like the far-left French politician Jean-Luc Melenchon, cheer for the Great Replacement as a good thing (""We are destined to be a Creole nation, and so much the better""). And yet, the stark reality remains: without Europeans, Europe has no future. If mass migration is an unacceptable solution, then the only thing for Europeans to do is to have more children. There is no third choice. Enter Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, who has just announced a radical new pro-natal policy: a lifelong exemption from income tax for women who have two or more children. The pro-family Fidesz government has long been at the forefront of using tax policy to stimulate childbearing. Now the Orban government is making a huge leap in its pro-natalist policy, despite considerable cost in public spending. Orban's ambitious priorities are correct: there can be no European future without Europeans, and European governments must make incentivizing births a top priority. Unfortunately, results have been decidedly mixed, as pro-natalist demographer Lyman Stone explained in 2022. ""Hungary's policies thus far point to a grim reality: Policy changes, even dramatic ones, are simply not enough to create the world that many conservatives want,"" he wrote. That's because the main reason mothers aren't having children isn't financial. Nicholas Eberstadt, one of America's leading demographers, points out that depopulation is happening in both rich countries and poor ones. What is happening, said Eberstadt, is a global cultural revolution in family formation. When women perceive that they don't have to have large families, they typically choose not to. He wrote: People the world over are now aware of the possibility of very different ways of life from the ones that confined their parents. Certainly, religious belief--which generally encourages marriage and celebrates child rearing--seems to be on the wane in many regions where birthrates are crashing. Conversely, people increasingly prize autonomy, self-actualization, and convenience. And children, for their many joys, are quintessentially inconvenient. As every parent knows, raising children requires sacrifices that aren't simply material. Creating a family requires surrendering autonomy to an enormous degree. In 1999, when my then-wife and I were preparing to welcome our first child, my sister, who already had two little ones, told me, ""You are both going to lose the freedom you have enjoyed. There's no getting around that, and I think you know that. But what you don't know is how much joy you are going to have as parents. That's something you can't know until you do it."" She was right. We had two more children, only stopping because of medical issues. Raising children was the most difficult thing we had ever done, but also the most rewarding. My sister was right, though, to say the blessings that come from the sacrifice of one's autonomy and convenience are very hard to communicate to the childless. My kids' mother and father came to understand that our ""self-actualization"" was primarily in being parents. Yet we were probably the last generation in America raised with the idea that marriage and children were a primary good--that is, something one simply did as part of the good life. It mattered, too, that we are Christians and consider childbearing, with its sacrifices, to be a divine calling. Today, American culture, like European culture and most other global cultures, considers family formation as a relative good. That is, kids are fine, but only if they can be made to fit into an overall picture of a good life--one that does not make marrying and begetting the next generation the telos of life, but rather subordinates it to the ultimate goal of achieving personal fulfillment and ""well-being."" In this way, Hungarian society is no different from others. A Catholic friend in Budapest--a mother of three, in her thirties--once lamented that her generation of Hungarians want nothing more than for their country to be a Magyar version of Sweden. She meant that for all the overt conservatism in Hungary, deep down, younger Hungarians share the pan-European aspiration for a life of secularism, consumerism, and comfort. They are not, in her view, motivated by higher ideals that call them out of their individual selves. This is not just a Hungarian problem, but a European one, an American one, and indeed a global one. This is a hard but necessary lesson to learn. I am fond of quoting a Viktor Orban speech from years past about the limits of politics. Politicians, he explained, can provide the material basis for cultural change and renewal, but they cannot force it to happen. That can only be done when other institutions--families, churches, schools, civic organizations, artists, and the like--take advantage of the space created by politics to do what only they can do. The greatest challenge facing Europe is reversing its catastrophic demographic decline without surrendering to civilization-destroying mass migration. In this crisis, politics are necessary, but not sufficient. Orban is far, far ahead of most European politicians in grasping the severity of the crisis and its long-term consequences and putting every available resource of his government toward addressing it in a way that guarantees the survival of Hungary as Hungarian, and Europe as European. But, as I think even he would admit, unless Orban can find pro-natalist partners outside of politics to lead a cultural revolution, all his extraordinary efforts will be in vain. No political leader can force unwilling people to have babies and welcome them into functional families. A culture that has come to believe that individual happiness is its highest goal is a culture that is on its way to barrenness and extinction. Think about it: the reason any of us are here today is because our ancestors, in a time of far greater material poverty and often instability, believed that family formation was worth it. They chose life, despite it all. Yet here we are, the richest and safest generations that ever lived, and what do we do? We choose a very comfortable death. This is a paradox that cannot be resolved by politics.",The European Conservative,2025-02-25T19:45:46,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/dreher/without-europeans-europe-has-no-future/
Is Europe Sleepwalking Into Irrelevance?,"The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant , one of the country's leading publications, devoted its front page story on Saturday, November 9th to claiming in large print--and framed by an even larger menacing photo of Donald Trump--that ""This is the New World Order: It will be Lonely for European Democracies"". The piece went on to state that Trump's election is a boon for autocrats worldwide, whilst pointing out that the president-elect is apparently aiming for ""a weak and divided Europe."" This is quite a mouthful of far-reaching claims for a major newspaper that pretends to offer objective journalism. In fact, since November 5th, thanks to the dignified statesmanship of President Joe Biden after his party resoundingly lost the democratic and peaceful election, we have witnessed a return to the important American tradition--ignored by Trump in November 2020--for the president-elect to be invited by the outgoing president for a chat in the Oval Office. A tradition that publicly gets the orderly and democratic transfer of power into motion. Whether autocrats the world over are going to be happy about the Trump election remains to be seen: Iran in any case is nervous enough to find it necessary to be backchanneling olive branches to the incoming team in Washington. The claim that the new president is hoping for a weak and divided Europe lacks evidence and illustrates something much more important that many seem to forget: Europe itself, not the United States, is responsible for being united and strong. De Volkskrant is a telling product of how Europe is sleepwalking into further decline by its established media and political leaders being completely out of touch with what has been so visibly brewing amongst large parts of Western populations on both sides of the Atlantic. They are also failing to rightly interpret and respond to the epochal changes that have been taking place on the world stage already long before this US election cycle. Trump entering the White House is only supercharging this change, where the new 'leader of the free world' and his team will be acting under the motto ""escalate to de-escalate"" and causing plenty of disruption inside and outside of the United States. Hundreds of executive orders have already been written and will be signed the moment the new president returns to the Oval Office after his inauguration on January 20th, 2025. This time Trump seems to be well-prepared and focussed on rapidly executing a comprehensive plan. How quickly things are changing since November 5th can be witnessed all around. For example, we suddenly find the German Chancellor speaking at length to the Russian president for the first time in two years, followed by an obvious debriefing of Trump by Scholz, whilst President Zelensky of Ukraine, although protesting the Berlin-Moscow call, feels the need to subsequently officially announce a desired end to the war in 2025 ""by diplomatic means."" Not long ago this would have been unimaginable, even forbidden, talk in European capitals, especially in Brussels. Europe's failure to be ready for another Trump presidency is to a large extent caused by a moralising and therefore blinding ideological stance of most of its media and political leaders toward anyone, including very large parts of their own electorates, who does not adhere to the political orthodoxy of the day. Many refuse to entertain the idea that they might have gotten it wrong on important issues and that the insights, opinions and concerns of those outside of their own bubble are deserving of attention, respect and dialogue. We do this at our own peril, considering the dangerously weak state in which Europe finds itself today, in a critically restless global conflagration where not only economic turmoil but also the sliding into a full-scale Third World War are real risks. The opinion of us Europeans, moreover, on what has just transpired electorally in the United States, is wholly irrelevant, as President Macron of France rightly pointed out in a speech he gave at a recent meeting of political leaders in Budapest. Neither the current nor the future U.S. administration is going to spend much time fretting about what any major European newspaper or political leader thinks about the election of Donald Trump and his cabinet appointments, however controversial some may be. Europe and its leaders, on the other hand, will have to prioritize with great urgency efforts to get their own house in order and, as a matter of absolute priority, to build a constructive working relationship with the new leadership team that is taking shape in Washington. This is, of course, only if Europe does not want to continue its ongoing economic, military and political decline in the face of the now rapidly intensifying geo-political realignment. This is a realignment unseen since the end of the Cold War. The United States under a second Trump administration will not hesitate to do whatever it deems necessary to retain its position as the world's sole remaining superpower, whilst China, aided by a group of mostly rogue states, will do everything in its power to challenge Washington and weaken and divide the Western alliance, especially Europe. Without a clear common strategy to be implemented as soon as possible, the EU risks getting stuck in the middle--used as a playground whenever convenient for either or both competing sides--because it has failed to get its act together in time on three major fronts: energy independence, economic resilience, and military strength. EU soft power is no longer a leading factor in the current situation. If Europe wants to have a peaceful and prosperous future, it will need to live up to its enormous potential and untapped power by overcoming the manifold self-imposed (ideological) obstacles. These include, amongst others, the energy, economic and military sectors, whilst building a robust communication with the new American administration. If Europe treads wisely and discards its tendency to claim the moral high ground while getting distracted by false priorities demanded by loud ideologues, there is a real chance that at least the EU, if not the whole of the European continent, may even benefit from the new wind that will be blowing out of Washington. Also under Trump, America will continue to regard Europe as important enough that it is willing to cooperate and find mutually beneficial solutions, provided the Europeans are willing to step up to take full responsibility whilst ending their lethargy. Despite enough economic enticements and sweetened deals providing easy money, nobody with a grip on the raw facts and in positions of responsibility can seriously believe that Communist and authoritarian China with its fundamentally different culture and lack of freedom can or will be the reliable political and economic partner that the EU needs for a stable future--especially in terms of its energy supplies, economic prospects and military sovereignty. Hence, despite the U.S.'s manifold problems and deficiencies of its own, its continuing partnership is the only real option for a Europe that loves its freedom and democracy. The sick man of Europe, Germany, once its undisputed economic engine, is a perfect example of ideologically inspired self-destruction by means of cutting off the free flow of energy that is simply a necessity to retain an industry-based economy. First, it was the permanent rejection of nuclear energy, then the economically unsustainable rapid 'green energy transition' ('Energiewende') pushed to the extreme by the now defunct traffic light coalition (that curiously collapsed the day after the U.S. elections), followed by the Ukraine war and the closure of the Nord Stream pipeline. Germany, against better judgment dependent for far too long on Russian gas, was not able to quickly enough tap into alternative energy resources to protect the industrial base of its economy against the fallout. The recent downturn of Volkswagen, unheard of in its highly successful history, is a perfect illustration of the short-sightedness of Europe's intertwined energy and climate policies. As a result, Germany, and thus the EU, are in for major trouble. In the meantime, according to The Economist , the United States has since 2019 grown into becoming the world's largest producer of crude oil and natural gas - whilst parallel large-scale creation of 'green' energy production is ongoing - and thus has also achieved its strategically vital national energy independence, especially important in the current volatile geopolitical climate with the Middle East in flames and the African continent witnessing ever more destabilising wars and conflicts in various major countries such as Sudan, Congo, Kenya and Nigeria. Most of Europe, meanwhile, having had to wean itself from dependence on Russian gas, is now fully dependent on especially the United States (50% of the EU's LNG), but also undemocratic countries such as Qatar and Algeria to meet its energy needs. On 16 November, Austria, one of the remaining European Gazprom customers, felt how dependency on Russian gas continues to be a risk: its deliveries were suddenly cut off. Unless Europe rapidly further develops its own green and fossil energy sources that are also economically sustainable (!), which is unlikely to happen anytime soon, it will very much need the United States and its expensive energy deliveries for the foreseeable future. Thus, good relations are key, and one wonders why droves of EU and member state delegations are not already showing up in Washington and Mar-a-Lago to meet with the Trump transition team for ongoing energy supply negotiations. Due to many interplaying factors, including overregulation, high payroll taxes and a lack of innovation, Europe is falling far behind the United States in economic terms where the U.S. is the EU's largest trading partner responsible for 16% of all EU exports. According to The Economist 's October 14th, 2024 edition , ""America has outperformed its peers among the mature economies. In 1990 America accounted for about two-fifths of the overall GDP of the G7 group of advanced countries; today it is up to about half ... On a per-person basis, American economic output is now about 40% higher than in Western Europe and Canada."" And: ""America's real growth has been 10%, three times the average for the rest of the G7 countries."" The United States is still the world's biggest economy by far, with China only making 65% of the U.S.'s GDP, where this was still 75% in 2021. Productivity in America substantially outpaces that of other countries and regions, including Europe: economic output generated by an average American worker is $171.000, - compared to $120.000, - in Europe. The U.S. has seen a 70% increase in labour productivity since 1990, whereas the Europeans have lagged with 29%. America is also by far the largest spender on R&D, with around 3.5% of GDP. These are hefty figures and should give Europeans pause for modesty and swift action. The combination of the new Trump administration considering 10-20% universal import tariffs also on European goods and the resulting looming trade wars, as well as the increasing tensions between the U.S. and China surely affecting Europe, will likely lead to the EU and European nations having to choose soon on whose side they stand. Building a good working relationship with the new U.S. administration should therefore be a priority, starting with negotiating an EU exemption on import tariffs. Three recent developments should have every European political leader lay awake at night: North Korean troops that are now fighting on the side of Russia on European soil, the Ukrainian president and his military openly discussing the possibility to start producing nuclear weapons to defend itself, and aides to President-Elect Trump presenting a possible peace plan (from which the transition team later distanced itself) to end the Russia-Ukraine war that would freeze the conflict and require European troops to man a demilitarized buffer zone in Eastern Ukraine, with the Americans already clearly indicating that they will not be fielding troops themselves for such a mission, other than for training purposes. Whether or not this plan has any chance of success is beside the point: with this message today's America has just informed Europe that without massive increases in its military capabilities and willingness to engage and share the burden with the Americans (the NATO 2% defence spending norm is about to go up to 2,5 or 3%), Washington will not be ready to do more than it already does on the continent defending it against Russia. Instead of the immediate moral indignation that usually follows such statements from Trump or his aides, European leaders would do good to consider how they can take substantially more responsibility and pride in defending their own countries, cultures and peoples. In the meantime, to prove this point, despite the truly heroic effort of the Ukrainian army ever since the Russian invasion, Ukraine is now increasingly losing momentum and territory . The EU, initially strong and united in its military support of Ukraine, has always lacked a comprehensive and long-term political and military strategy to deal with Russia's aggression, whilst for the United States, despite its continued large-scale delivery of weapons to the country, Ukraine's full territorial integrity has never seemed to be a real priority (the US also did not intervene when the Crimea was taken over by Russia's ""green men"" in 2014). Under the new U.S. president this will possibly be even less so, as for example the BBC recently reported. Furthermore, Western governments are not going to send troops into Ukraine. An opponent the size of Russia that is willing to accept any number of casualties amongst its own soldiers whilst fighting a war of attrition without end and in constant violation of the Geneva convention is almost impossible to defeat through conventional warfare. The perspective for Europe, therefore, is bleak. Although this still seems to be a tabu in Brussels, the much-proclaimed mantra that the EU will stand by Ukraine until Russia is defeated now sounds hollow and even reckless. There is no actionable plan, neither seems there to have ever been one. Ukrainians are paying the price whilst the rest of Europe looks on. The belated drive by most European governments to strengthen their armed forces in the face of the Russian aggression and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has been too little too late to enable Europe in the foreseeable future to defend itself without robust American help. Even if an end to the Ukraine war could be achieved, nobody should have the illusion that Putin will be done with his military pursuits and hybrid warfare. History is littered with examples of dictators of his calibre that will never stop in their lifetimes, not even with a peace deal in place. Just think of the Munich conference of 1938. Furthermore, the current larger geopolitical reality puts Europe in a very weak spot: should for example China decide to invade Taiwan, the U.S. would have to engage substantial military resources in Asia, even more so when Pyongyang uses the situation to cause conflict or war on the Korean peninsula. This could then mean that U.S. troop presence in Europe would likely be negatively affected, leaving Europe to have to fend even more for itself. The perspectives for military escalation in the Middle East are no better. The Germans, as Europe's leading nation, have been specifically sloppy in keeping their military in order, whilst the Polish, knowing the harsh historical reality of invading armies coming from East and West, have been consistently investing in their defence capabilities for at least the past decade. Poland is thus showing the rest of Europe what is possible with the right priorities and political will. As a result, Poland now seems to be the preferred military partner of the United States in Europe, with amongst others recently a NATO missile defence base opened in Poland. Also here, European nations and the EU better work hard for good relations and cooperation with the new US administration, if they do not want to be a passive bystander when the political and military fate of Europe is being decided. Not only mainstream media such as De Volkskrant , but even more so Europe's government leaders, regardless of their political affiliation, need to realize that they are geopolitically in for a wild ride now that Donald Trump has once more been elected president of the United States with also majorities in both houses of Congress. All indicators are that he will be true to his word and that he will take swift action - mostly through executive orders - on the issues that concern a majority of American voters, whether Europe and its leaders like this or not. Domestically, Trump will not only tackle illegal immigration in unorthodox ways, in economic policy terms import tariffs and trade wars can be expected and the geopolitical realignment that has already started much longer ago with the rise of China, is now being fast-tracked with very serious consequences for Europe in terms of energy, economy and military realities. The time is far overdue to act. European leaders would be well-advised to get their own house in order instead of lecturing Americans on what is democracy and the rule of law. Rather, the EU and European nations should be rapidly getting on good terms with the new leadership in the White House and on Capitol Hill to still be able to influence the outcome of what will surely be the greatest geopolitical contest and upheaval of our time, resulting in a new world order. This new world order may or may not include Europe as a major player, depending on its willingness to once again take full responsibility for its own fate.

Does the West Need a Palestinian State?,"The governments of Ireland, Spain, and Norway want to recognize a non-existent Palestinian state, just as other, predominantly Muslim states have done since the United Nations elevated the status of the Palestinians to that of a quasi-state in 1988. But this status does not actually make the territory a state. Point three of the Montevideo Convention, one of the relevant lists of criteria for statehood under international law, emphasizes, ""The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states."" In other respects, too, the Palestinians do not fulfill the criteria for statehood. The population of the Palestinian territories consists of very different, mutually disunited Arab tribes, clans, and immigrant groups that emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. They settled in and around the nascent Jewish state when proximity to the Jewish enterprises became lucrative. For decades, efforts have been made to declare this heterogeneous population a kind of nation, with a common culture, history, and goals, united by the narrative of the so-called Nakba, said to designate their expulsion and persecution by Israel. The decisive factor, however, is that the majority of these people do not want a Palestinian state. If they really wanted it, they could have founded it long ago, given the worldwide support and Israel's willingness to compromise. Or they could have at least laid the foundations for such statehood: the economy, the structures, and the everyday institutions of coexistence on which statehood is based. None of this has happened. The Israeli occupation of the territories is to blame, claim the worldwide supporters of this fantasy state. But Palestinians have lived in Gaza since 2005, more than 18 years, without any Israeli troops or settlers, and yet they made no efforts to establish a state or to prepare for it. The reasons why the Palestinians do not want their own state are as heterogeneous as they are themselves. This state was conceived along the lines of UN Resolution 181 (II) in 1947. It was to exist alongside a Jewish state ""in peace and security"" and--in another, mostly forgotten paragraph--must allow a Jewish minority to live ""in security"" on its territory, a precaution taken by the UN to protect the Jewish settlers in Arab-dominated territories like the Gaza Strip (abandoned by Israelis in 2005) and Judea and Samaria (usually now called the West Bank). Jewish presence in the territories of the envisaged Arab state is by no means contrary to international law, as claimed in the European media and by European politicians, especially of the Left. On the contrary, the presence of Jews is required by international law, as ""close Jewish settlement"" in the entire British Mandate territory of Palestine was the actual purpose of the Mandate--granted in 1922 by the League of Nations and confirmed in 1947 by the UN Founding Assembly as applicable international law. The coexistence with a Jewish state demanded by the UN is one of the reasons why religious-fundamentalist Palestinians do not want their own state according to the UN model: they would then have to make do with a part of the territory that, in their view, belongs to them 'from the river to the sea.' According to Islamic law, once conquered, Muslim land, including the entire territory of the Ottoman Empire, is forever Muslim; thus the state of Israel (or any other non-Muslim state) cannot be other than illegal in their eyes. In 1947, when the idea of an Arab state in a peaceful neighborhood with Israel--a state recognised according to Western criteria--was included in UN Resolution 181, there was not yet a worldwide movement of Islamic fundamentalism. In the meantime, the character of the Islamic group of states has changed dramatically: encouraged by the weakness of the West, and having grown in terms of people and countries, many of these are increasingly militant, irreconcilable, and ready for war. Many Palestinians reject a Palestinian state for another reason: because it would be corrupt and inefficient. They would prefer to live as full citizens in the state of Israel, upon whose solvency, humanity, and rule of law they could depend. There are no guarantees of inner security in the corrupt crony networks of President Mahmoud Abbas or any similar puppet. The Palestinian Authority led by Abbas--intended to create the necessary conditions for statehood according to the Western model, in preparation for the establishment of a state--by no means fulfills the condition of a state authority or state power, as required by the ""three-element doctrine."" This is the doctrine, according to the German legal scholar Georg Jellinek who devised it, upon which Western state law is based: clear state territory, clearly defined state people, and a state authority in possession of a monopoly on the use of force. After a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West bank, the Palestinian Authority would certainly collapse. It would suffer the same fate as has been previously seen in Gaza: it would be overthrown and eliminated by a fundamentalist movement like Hamas. In 2006, during the last parliamentary elections in the Palestinian territories to date, Hamas won the most votes. As a result, it took over Gaza, whence the Israeli army withdrew in 2005. Hamas then consolidated their hold on power in a bloody civil war and cruelly liquidated all the PLO officials they could. In the West Bank, only the presence of Israeli troops has secured the power of the corrupt Palestinian Authority, which is hated by the population and which, according to estimates by its opponents, wastes and embezzles 70-80% of Western aid money. Under such circumstances, a Palestinian State is difficult to imagine, unless the West would like to see either another Hamas state (and the wars emanating from it) or Israeli troops and settlers remaining to protect the alleged state authority. Moreover, the other criteria of statehood according to Western standards are also not fulfilled by the Palestinians. There is neither agreement on the borders of the state territory nor the minimum internal solidarity required for a people to cohere together as citizens of the same state. The only cohesion between these groups and clans is a shared hatred of the West and a common intention to extract as many billions in aid money from the despised and frightened Western states as possible. The Arab religious fighters and terrorists of all stripes immigrating to these states provide the violence needed to create the necessary level of fear that will persuade governments and the electorate to continue financing the corrupt business. On all issues beyond this, the positions of the Arab groups, the so-called Palestinian people, diverge to the point of incompatibility. A state under the presence of Israeli troops or other foreign forces of order would not be tolerated by radical Palestinians. Nor would they demilitarize and disarm their militias. If this should be a condition of their statehood, they would do everything imaginable (smuggling, secret weapons production, etc.) to achieve the actual purpose of a state as they see it, which is jihad--as we have seen in Gaza. That is why they emphasize their independence, as Hamas did in its laudatory statement on the recognition of the non-existent state by the governments of Ireland, Norway, and Spain. Behind the appealing word 'independence' lies, above all, the right to arm oneself. A demilitarized Palestinian state, as demanded by the West, makes no sense according to devout, Quran-abiding Muslims. This is because jihad--struggle, including armed struggle--is both the real fulfillment of a man's life (as the 1988 Covenant of Hamas declares) and the real purpose of an Islamic state. In his book Crowds and Power , Elias Canetti unapologetically called Islam a ""religion of war."" In Islam, the state is conceived as a fighting institution, not as a protective, distributive, and charitable organization, as in the Western conception. As proof, consider the use of Western aid money. The aid is not, as Western politicians hope and claim to their tax-paying voters, used to benefit the needy or for meaningful projects to build state infrastructure, but primarily to maintain reactionary tribalist structures, secretly procure weapons, and finance terror. The idea of being able to establish a demilitarized Palestinian state reveals the deep, hopeless misunderstanding between the Western and Islamic sphere when it comes to the establishment of a Palestinian state. In any case, there is no mention of independence when it comes to the billions in Western aid payments on whose continued inflow this state would naturally depend. First of all, if such a state were founded, the Palestinians would lose their refugee status, on which their current billions in aid payments (primarily from the largely corrupt UNRWA and the European Union) are based. Aid would then likely be declared differently and come from other sources (e.g., from Iran, supported by the billions currently flowing from China for Iranian crude oil). Various powers could have an interest in exerting influence on the strategically important territory of the Palestinians. Even then, their state would remain a so-called 'failing state,' characterized by internal conflicts and armed actions against its neighbors. Where state structures do not function, there are lawless areas for criminal gangs and terrorist networks. The question is why European governments insist on creating another state of this kind. In this case, it would most likely be a terrorist state similar to the Hamas regime in Gaza, which not only keeps its own population in poverty and ignorance and invests international aid money in rocket building and global terrorist activities, but also seeks to trigger a new regional war at some point. Does the West really need such a state?",The European Conservative,2024-12-10T17:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/does-the-west-need-a-palestinian-state/
Jimmy Carter is Dead at 100,"""The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude."" These were the gracious words posted by the once and future U.S. President Donald J. Trump to his Truth Social platform upon learning of the death on December 29 of his long-ago Democratic predecessor Jimmy Carter, who held office from 1977 to 1981. Carter had entered hospice care in February 2023 and celebrated his 100th birthday on October 1, expressing his wish to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Carter was the longest-lived American president to date and died just as Joe Biden, the oldest U.S. president ever to hold office, prepares to leave the White House to make way for Trump, who in November became the oldest man ever elected to presidential office. Carter, who consistently violated the custom that past presidents do not criticize their successors, is on record calling Trump a ""liar"" and predicting that a second Trump term would be ""a disaster."" Trump's social media statement decidedly took the high road, with the incoming president adding in a later post that Carter was ""a truly good man."" In the past, Trump had given the late former president backhanded compliments, calling him ""brilliant"" in comparison to Biden, a longtime Carter ally and the first Democratic senator to endorse him for the presidency. It has been confirmed that the flags at Trump's January 20 inauguration will fly at half-staff to conform with the normal thirty-day period of official mourning that follows the death of an American president. Presumably, Trump will appear at Carter's funeral. Formalities notwithstanding, mainstream U.S. media is already seizing on Carter's life and post-presidential legend to score direct and oblique political points at Trump's expense, a successful messaging campaign as some American conservatives sit back and politely offer good wishes and selective praise. The truth, of course, is that Carter was one of the worst presidents in American history, featuring close to the bottom even in ranking surveys by overwhelmingly leftist academics and media personalities. When he left office in 1981, inflation stood at 12.5%. His four-year mandate witnessed an energy crisis that created painful gas shortages, a national affordability crisis that began the current 'hollowing out' of the middle class, severe compromises in America's strategic position around the world, global advances by Soviet-aligned communist regimes, a dramatic increase in the bureaucratic apparatus and burdensome expense of the U.S. federal government, and a hostage crisis in Iran, where 52 diplomats were held for 444 days while the administration floundered and a rescue mission Carter authorized ingloriously failed. In the 1980 presidential election, the American people denied him a second term in a landslide rebuke, with Republican Ronald Reagan prevailing by nearly 10% in the popular vote and winning 46 of the fifty U.S. states. Carter left office with one of the lowest approval ratings of any president. In 1984, Reagan defeated Carter's vice president, Walter Mondale, in an even greater rout. The only path for Carter's party to return to executive office was to shed his legacy in favor of almost radical commitment to centrism, defined by Bill Clinton's recasting as a ""New Democrat."" It may be unfair to judge a centenarian by the events of just 4% of his life. But neither life nor politics is fair. Nor was the torment of the embassy hostages, the mass suffering of the developing world populations subjected to communism during his weak presidency, or the immiseration of tens of millions of Americans in his terrible economy. The best Carter's defenders can say for him is that he was an ""honorable"" man, or, as Biden said the day after he died, a man defined by ""decency, decency, decency."" Conceit allowed Carter not merely to mask the failures of his presidency in the decades that remained to him, but also to define himself as a model politician and model citizen. This should not take away from an earnest appreciation of his humanitarian achievements in the realm of public health or quality-of-life work, where he used his clout to accomplish great things and in 2002 won the Nobel Peace Prize. No amount of gloss, however, can disguise the fundamental truth: Jimmy Carter failed in virtually everything he set out to do as the leader of the free world. Jimmy Carter left his country poorer and weaker than it had been at any time in its modern history. He diminished its power and prestige. He spoke openly of a ""crisis of the American spirit"" whose symptoms, he said on national television ""are all around us."" In the name of misguided globalist projects, he held back America and its people, even chiding them that they expected too much peace and prosperity in a world that he seemed to believe should no longer accommodate their excellence and exceptionalism. In foreign policy, he gave away the Panama Canal, a military and commercial asset of epochal proportions, in exchange for nothing and in the naive name of good will. He officially recognized communist China, setting its heinous regime's rise to a superpower status that will likely rival America's in the current century. His approach to the Middle East made a limited peace between Israel and Egypt, but foregrounded the Palestinian cause to the extent that further peace deals came haltingly, with no further progress until 1994 and then 2020. His renewal of detente with the Soviet Union ceded strategic weapons superiority and favorable trade deals to Moscow in exchange for proffered geopolitical restraint that never came. And in the most glaring catastrophe, he sold out the Shah of Iran in favor of ""democracy,"" only to watch that democracy be subverted by radical Islamists who hated the United States, plunged Iran into decades of theocratic darkness, and took the U.S. embassy staff hostage while Carter had no solution to offer. He may have made up for that sorry moment in decades of service, but it will burn brightly as the defining one of his life.",The European Conservative,2024-12-31T05:33:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/jimmy-carter-is-dead-at-100/
A Defense of the Small Christmas Ritual,"It is difficult to trust someone who despises Christmas. Beyond the central point, the fact of the birth of God, everything at this time of the year is covered with a divine grace that makes wonders happen through the smallest traditions. Whoever is not capable of preserving the tiny Christmas traditions that our elders once bequeathed to us, will never be able to take up the defense of any greater cause. Dusting off the boxes of the nativity scene. Turning on the tree lights. Making glitter stars with the children. Writing letters to the Three Wise Men. Stacking the guests' coats on Christmas Eve. Ironing the red tablecloth for another year. Saying a family prayer. Handing out tambourines to the kids. Inventing makeshift side tables so that everyone can be seated. Arriving on time for Midnight Mass. Cutting up the nougat and placing it gracefully on the trays. Listening to Grandpa's stories that we already know by heart. Hugging without haste. Smiling without fear. Meeting again with the hearts of those who are always close to us. Detecting the aroma of Christmas food from the landing. Sitting in the dark to watch What A Wonderful Life . Toasting with friends just before dinner. Taking a very long nap. Counting grapes several times. Lifting a baby over your head as King Gaspar's carriage passes by. Going over the lottery numbers. Making a list of resolutions for the New Year. Carefully kissing the foot of the Baby Jesus. Singing Christmas carols with the family. Snacking at the orejones fountain in the early morning. Getting dressed up and wearing a new scarf. Waking up with confetti in your pajamas. Putting up Christmas cards in the living room. Calling distant family right after the grapes. Petitioning the good Lord for a miracle. Getting excited about yesterday's family photos. Laughing at the messages that arrive at dinnertime. We shall not understand Christmas unless we defend, as we would a homeland, every little ritual of our Christmas days. They might seem like minor details, family things, small traditions or routines--some more reasonable than others, some more important than others. In these days when ritual is scorned, it is more necessary than ever to safeguard everything that was once established by custom in our home, everything that identifies and strengthens the peculiarity of each family, everything that gives us a sense of belonging: parents, children, siblings, friends, neighbors, home, our street, our bars, our way of cooking, our particular way of singing Christmas carols, and our sources of snacks. ""Rites are symbolic actions,"" writes the South Korean philosopher Byung-Chul Han in The Disappearance of Rituals , ""they transmit and represent those values and orders that hold a community together. They generate a community without communication, whereas what prevails today is communication without community."" Each small Christmas ritual is an emotional conquest for the elders, a bulwark of family stability, and a life lesson for the youngest, who tomorrow will carry on their backs the responsibility of making their own posterity see that the smallest ritual is of incalculable value. ""Being a form of recognition,"" adds Han, ""to perceive the symbolic is to perceive the everlasting. In this way the world is freed from contingency and given permanence. The world suffers today from a chronic shortage of the symbolic."" Everything today is threatened by the uniform anarchy of postmodernity. ""When respect for tradition perishes,"" as Gomez Davila warned us, ""society, in its incessant eagerness to renew itself, frantically consumes itself."" So there is nothing to give in to, except for those moments when life places us before the obligation to institutionalize what will also be ours from now on: the new home, the children, becoming grandparents, staying alone this Christmas, or making hand in hand with the grandchildren our first Bethlehem, molding each figure, bespattering the children's aprons with clay. ""Our hearts grow tender with childhood memories and the love of relatives,"" wrote Laura Ingalls, ""and we are better throughout the year because, in spirit, we become children again at Christmas."" So, never stop sending the letter to the Three Kings. Never give up on the little Bethlehem, even if only you and the Christ Child are going to see it. Don't let January 6th dawn without a surprise package. Don't forget to sing the Adeste fideles on Christmas Eve. Don't forget to wish Merry Christmas to the neighbor who never says hello. Don't forget to take something to the parish for the poor. Don't even think of taking your Christmas cynicism for a walk in front of a child's shining eyes. Do not despise as pagan those who believe in the magic of Christmas. Perhaps God will magically knock on their door tonight. Niall Gooch has written on more than one occasion about the excesses of Christmas performances and the emergence of traditions far removed from the biblical account. He believes that they form something like ""the residual memory of faith,"" even in the most de-Christianized societies, and ""that is better than nothing; and it is a useful foundation on which to build."" As Gooch concludes, ""the world is full of meaning. Symbols, metaphors and allusions add to the richness of faith. Poems, songs and plays engage people in faith with all their imagination, with all their heart and soul, if you will, as well as their mind. Not everyone can be a theologian. Everyone can get into a great story."" Christian customs coexist with others that emanate from them, from the festive and family atmosphere of these last days of the year. Rather than detracting from the meaning of Christmas, they enrich it. So don't stop laughing along to the seasonal television humor. Don't conclude the year without listening to old vinyl records on New Year's Eve. Don't go to bed early on Christmas Eve. Don't stop telling the stories of those who are no longer around the table, even if sometimes it seems that no one wants to hear them. Don't forget the postcards, the lottery, or the bottles of wine you used to send on these dates. Don't let frivolity prevent you from being a child every Christmas. Remember that every little family Christmas ritual is one more way to adore the Child God. And, in short, never forget the words of that frightened and repentant Scrooge: ""I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year round.""",The European Conservative,2024-12-24T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/a-defense-of-the-small-christmas-ritual/
“Only Two Sexes”: Will Europe’s Populists Follow Trump—and Biology?,"Courage is contagious. So, it turns out, is sanity. President Donald Trump's executive order affirming the male-female sex binary is already having an international impact. Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, in response to journalist questions about the statement, cautiously affirmed that he, too, only ""knows of two genders."" On January 24, Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) concurred in stronger language, posting on X : Trump is right, there are only two genders: male and female. Let's bring common sense back to our society. No more woke madness or indoctrination. No more nonsense. Wilders' populist PVV, which won a quarter of the seats in the Dutch House of Representatives in 2023, plays an outsize role in Dutch politics. Wilders himself proved too controversial to cobble together enough support from coalition partners to become prime minister (a position now held by independent Dick Schoof), but his party is the largest in the House, and his victory-- referred to by the Associated Press as ""one of the biggest political upsets in Dutch politics since World War II""--gives Wilders significant influence. Wilders' opposition to gender ideology is representative of populists across the West. He supports the sexual revolution and abortion, but the transgender movement has become a microcosm of the insanity and totalitarian instincts of the woke progressive project. Wilders, an atheist, does not oppose the cultural revolution that transformed the West after World War II but believes that it has now gone too far. Dutch Christians see Wilders as a conditional ally rather than an ideological fellow traveler. Throughout his career, Wilders has portrayed himself as a defender of liberal Dutch values--including feminism and gay rights--against the encroaching forces of mass Muslim immigration. His public statements include occasional references to ""the Christian character of the nation,"" but these are a rhetorical weapon rather than affection for the Dutch Calvinist heritage. Like other clever populist politicians, Wilders is willing to honor Christianity insofar as it helps him create a coalition opposed to mass migration from non-Christian countries. As the transgender movement's extremism became increasingly clear, their agenda proved a bridge too far for many defenders of the post-war liberal consensus. In 2022, Wilders' PVV voted against the Transgender Act, which sought to allow trans-identifying people, including those under the age of 16, to easily change their gender on official documents, citing female safety in sex-segregated spaces--but hedged their bets slightly by calling it "" symboolpolitiek "" (symbolic politics) that wouldn't genuinely help trans-identifying people. In 2024, a majority of MPs voted to ""shelve"" the law entirely as too controversial. Several other parties voted with the PVV, and the Telegraph noted that recent polling data ""revealed hardening attitudes towards transgender people in the Netherlands, which has traditionally been among the most liberal countries on trans rights."" A national survey indicated only a quarter of Dutch people agreed with the statement: ""People should be able to change [sex on] their passport from the age of 16 without a statement from an expert."" The politicians clearly noticed. ""We are absolutely not against changing sex,"" stated Nicolien van Vroonhoven, the NSC MP who put the motion forward. ""But it should not be too easy either. There are real risks to women's safety. In England, for example, men are suddenly given access to women's prisons, and that is not something we should want."" The transgender movement was once seen as the natural successor to the gay rights movement, and the T tacked onto the LGB. Most progressive politicians still believe this--or at least, claim to. Others are not so sure, especially as the last half-decade has given us a good look at what the transgender agenda looks like in practice. Wilders has been willing to condemn the ""madness"" of gender ideology, and during the 2022 debate, he asked incredulously: ""What is it? Tomorrow you're a camel? The day after that, a dromedary?"" But again, he hedged: ""If people are transsexual, they get all the respect from the PVV. We have no problem with that."" In short, Wilders' position appeared to be something approximating support for the foundational premise of gender ideology--that men can become women, and vice versa--but not ""self-identification"" and an ever-multiplying panoply of genders. The brilliance of the Trump Administration's executive order on gender, however, is that it thoroughly and painstakingly rejects gender ideology in its entirety . I don't know if Wilders read it before he posted his support, but if so, his statement may indicate the realization that many are coming to: You cannot accept the premises of gender ideology while opposing the inevitable consequences of its social implementation. If ""transgender are women,"" they should be granted access to women's facilities. If they are not women, then they should not. There is no centrist position on gender ideology. It is true, or it is false. Premises are policy. The clarity of the American position creates the space for other leaders to reject gender ideology in its entirety. Donald Trump's executive orders make it clear that his administration recognizes the impossibility of a ""centrist"" approach to the transgender agenda. The now-famous question ""What is a woman?"", so indicative of the insanity of the past decade, has social implications from top to bottom. Europe's populists have sensed that the transgender agenda represents, in the minds of many, the overreach of the progressive project. But they cannot merely oppose bits and pieces of it; they must reject the entire agenda or ultimately fail to fight the madness. It appears that Geert Wilders understands this. His statement is certainly unequivocal enough. Populists and conservatives everywhere should follow suit.",The European Conservative,2025-02-05T14:06:14,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/only-two-sexes-will-europes-populists-follow-trump-and-biology/
Toutes pour une: Using Tax Money To Turn a Beloved Classic Into a Woke Flop,"Progressive culture is woefully lacking in imagination. When it comes to making people dream and telling stories, nothing beats recycling the great classics. This is the spirit in which Toutes pour une (All for one, in the feminine), a remake of Alexandre Dumas' masterpiece The Three Musketeers , was shot. Dumas may recently have been transformed into a precursor of wokeism , but he remains a little too patriarchal: his works contain men, far too many men. The original story has, therefore, been extensively remodelled by screenwriter Houda Benyamina. The heroine is no longer d'Artagnan, but Sara, a young girl who is shocked to discover that the three musketeers charged with looking after the Queen of France are in fact... women. From then on, she dreams of fighting alongside them. Their destiny? ""To transform in order to be free, to transform in order to be oneself."" What a programme: it almost looks like a Planned Parenthood poster advocating gender transition. The three musketeers have not only given up testosterone for oestrogen--they've also been great-replaced. They are no longer the dark Athos, a nobleman from Bearn; Aramis, elegant Chevalier d'Herblay; or the truculent Porthos inspired by the Protestant lord Isaac de Portau, but three shrews of unlikely origins. What are a wild Moroccan (Oulaya Amamra), a daughter of Algerians (Sabrina Ouazani), and a pudgy Congolese immigrant doing in the France of the good King Louis XIII? Concerns about consistency are clearly not stifling the director, who is herself of Moroccan origin (and sister of Oulaya Amamra: at least she didn't have much trouble getting one of them on board!) In today's France, where culture is almost exclusively in the hands of the progressive Left, such a film project could only be brought to fruition with a great deal of public funding. Toutes pour une received, the Destination Cine X account explains , EUR2.6 million from France TV, EUR850,000 from the Centre National de la Cinematographie, EUR550,000 from the Ile-de-France, Occitanie, and Provence regions, and EUR500,000 from European funds via Eurimages, for a total budget of EUR10 million. In her press kit, the director acknowledges that she is being militant . On the Left, since Jdanov, the Soviet Union's 'propagandist-in-chief,' cultural activism has been seen as a high-value achievement. ""Through an adventure film, I wanted to question gender identity. Maybe that's what it means to be relevant to our time,"" she explains, with (a very relative) audacity. Let's be straightforward to avoid any accusations of intellectual dishonesty: We haven't seen the film, and we have no desire to see it. What's available about it on the web is more than enough to give you an idea. It's ugly and vulgar. The plot is shaky and furiously lacking in imagination, and the direction is vague and imprecise. In short, this film is what we in French call un navet (a turnip). The film, which aims to honour female heroines, doesn't escape the main scam of self-righteous feminism: asking women to ape the worst traits of men, i.e., obscenity, fat laughs, jokes below the belt, and sexual obsession. Apparently, that's what being a man is all about. Audiences were clear in their response: during its theatrical release week, the film achieved a record low attendance. With just 1271 admissions for 564 screenings, the film maintained a very respectable average of 2 spectators per screening. This is good news: common sense has not totally deserted Dumas' country. And, as journalist Berengere Viennot wittily points out on X, the statistics are distorted by the presence in the cinema of journalists paid to inflict this burden on themselves, and who made the effort to attend simply because they had no other choice. Je suis au cinema pour voir une daube (on m'oblige, c'est le dur lot de la journalere). Je suis toute seule. A votre avis c'est quel film? pic.twitter.com/1582qL9H7H How can we fail to compare this pitiful spectacle with the dazzling success a few months ago of the flamboyant Count of Monte Cristo , brought to the screen by Matthieu Delaporte and Alexandre de La Patelliere, which sold over 9 million tickets and went on to conquer international audiences, becoming the most-watched French film in the world in 2024? The brilliantly classic, yet skilfully updated direction took just the right amount of liberties with the original work to give it the spirit it needed to bring a sprawling plot within the confines of a big-screen film. But the scandal of Toutes pour une , financed by French taxpayers who didn't ask for it and don't want it, doesn't stop there. The Allocine platform, which gathers reviews from cinema-goers and the press for each new cinema release, was alarmed by the desperately low score achieved by Toutes pour une the week it arrived in cinemas and cried scandal. A score of 5% from satisfied viewers could not be honest. To dismiss such a masterpiece with such contempt could only be the result of a concerted effort by Elon Musk's henchmen, directed from the underbelly of X. Allocine has therefore simply decided, exceptionally, to remove the spectators' rating from the film's online entry . There's something Soviet about this reaction--as if it were neither possible nor morally acceptable for this film to be considered genuinely bad . Let's rejoice: society tiring of the over-saturation of wokeism is not a phenomenon confined to Trump's America. An irresistible opposing wave is rising just about everywhere. Our hope is that it will sweep away all the mediocre dross in its path, and that artists will finally choose to celebrate the beautiful, the good, and the true.",The European Conservative,2025-01-28T12:05:05,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/toutes-pour-une-using-tax-money-to-turn-a-beloved-classic-into-a-woke-flop/
"Poland’s EU Presidency: A Showcase for Brussels, Not Warsaw","The rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, while not granting significant power, offers a valuable opportunity to showcase one's country. EU member states are eager to use this opportunity. But not Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who has decided that his country's presidency will be centred in Brussels. Poland as such is to be invisible. No wonder. If the EU heads of state had taken an interest in the situation over the Vistula, they might have started asking uncomfortable questions about democracy and the rule of law. ""Europe, you are lucky that at this very difficult moment in our history it is Poland that will be carrying out the mission of the presidency, because we in Poland know very well that we need to find in ourselves both strength, hope and faith in our own strength - and we need to rediscover the sense of freedom, the sense of everything that Europe is,"" Donald Tusk declared during the inauguration of the presidency on 3rd January in Warsaw. Such a declaration sounds like a bitter irony, given that a few days earlier the same politician had declared that he would block the reimbursement of expenses incurred for the 2023 parliamentary election campaign of the largest opposition party Law and Justice (PiS)--a move that hardly aligns with European democratic traditions. Tusk's words also came several days after one of the deputy ministers of the previous conservative PiS government, Marcin Romanowski, was forced to seek political asylum in Hungary out of fear for his safety. Using dubious corruption allegations as a pretext, the Tusk government unleashed the full force of the state prosecution and secret service apparatus against him. These incidents symbolise the profound erosion of the rule of law and the principles of democracy that Donald Tusk's left-liberal government has brought about within 13 months of taking power. Within a year of his government taking power, Poland has witnessed an unprecedented attack on the rule of law--both in terms of scale and brutality. The new government only respects court rulings that align with its political agenda. It has forcibly taken control of the general prosecutor's office and the public media. It has bypassed constitutional legislative processes and ruled by means of parliamentary resolutions that have no legal force. These actions are motivated by a desire for revenge against political rivals and to weaken them in such a way that Poland becomes a de facto one-party state. While Poland under the Law and Justice (PiS) government faced harsh criticism and sanctions from the European Commission for alleged violations of the rule of law, Donald Tusk's government is receiving praise despite openly breaking the same rules. The Commission lifted proceedings against Poland under Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which allows for the possibility of suspending a state's membership. Brussels even unblocked previously frozen EU funds without the new administration making any significant legislative changes to address the alleged problems. Instead, Donald Tusk can be sure of the discreet or, if need be, open support of the Brussels elite. In December 2023, Tusk's government, with the help of private security companies and the police, forcibly took over the public media. The events in Warsaw attracted the attention of the foreign press who began to raise the alarm about the methods used by the new government. It was precisely then that the infamous Commissioner for the Rule of Law, Viera Jourova, appeared in Warsaw. She ignored questions about the public media, and her mere presence at such a time was an obvious signal to Tusk that he had a free hand in capturing the state. Nevertheless, the spiral of lawlessness that Tusk has set in motion in Poland has reached such a scale that the decision to make the presidency 'Brussels-based' and low profile is perfectly logical. Donald Tusk wants to avoid some unforeseen situations, such as meetings between Polish opposition politicians and EU leaders, and any uncomfortable questions. That is why the highlight of each presidency--the informal leaders' summit--will take place not in Warsaw, but in Belgium. In addition, information obtained by europeanconservative.com shows that a relatively large number of people have been delegated from the EC and other institutions to work on the Polish Presidency. And although this is not an unusual practice, it says a lot about Donald Tusk's motivation. ""Instead of actually leading the work of the Council of the European Union, Donald Tusk's government has decided to have the work led de facto by the European institutions, which are permanently based in Brussels,"" said Pawel Jablonski, Law and Justice MP and former Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the wPolityce.pl news portal. ""The Polish Presidency thus has a purely ceremonial character. We're giving up the opportunity to influence the EU agenda in a moment that is extremely important from the point of view of security,"" he added. Critics emphasise that Poland is a testing ground where Brussels' left-liberal elites are formulating strategies to combat the growing popularity of right-wing ideas and groups. According to Jerzy Kwasniewski, president of the Warsaw-based Ordo Iuris think-tank, the methods currently used in Poland--judicial purges, media control, the politicisation of the judiciary, and the instrumental use of state services to target political opponents--could easily be exported elsewhere in the West. Now, during its presidency, Poland is also becoming a testing ground in another sphere: we are witnessing the transfer of competencies in the management of the presidency to the level of EU institutions. Donald Tusk is quite consciously giving up the powers that Poland is entitled to under the treaties. In doing so, he is giving the Eurocrats pushing for EU federalisation an argument vis-a-vis other states. If we take this into account, European Council head Antonio Costa's words at the inauguration of the rotating six-month presidency in Warsaw sound unfortunately ironic: ""Poland is a source of resilience and strength at a time when authoritarianism and populism pose an increasing threat to our values. Polish women and men are inspiring a stand against these phenomena at a time when foreign influences threaten the integrity of our democracy.""",The European Conservative,2025-01-08T11:30:16,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/polands-eu-presidency-a-showcase-for-brussels-not-warsaw/
Make Europe Great Again? What Trump 2.0 Can Do for Europe,"What will it mean for Europe when the new Trump regime takes power next week in Washington? The question brings to mind something that happened to me recently on Mount Athos, the isolated Orthodox monastic republic in Greece. The driver of our van stopped to pick up an elderly Russian hermit walking along the dirt path. When the hermit learned that several of us were American, he said, in thickly accented English, ""Trump is hope!"" Traveling on the continent since the November U.S. election, I have met ordinary Europeans who all say, in one way or another, that the Trump victory gives them hope, at last, for real change in Europe. Whatever happens in America eventually comes to Europe. Even in Budapest, a staunch holdout against globalist liberalism, in 2021, the left-wing mayor of one district erected a temporary statue of the criminal George Floyd. When asked by journalists what the purpose is, given that Hungary has almost no black people, she replied, as only a Western leftist can, that we all must be united against racism. The late Czech novelist Milan Kundera, in his great novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being , said that what makes a leftist a leftist is the ability to corral anything into the narrative of the Grand March--a parade through history towards ultimate liberation from oppression. This is the messianism of the Marxists, of course, but it is also a utopian creed believed by Western liberals, both of the Left and the Right. After all, what drove George W. Bush's insane crusade against Iraq was, in large part, a sincere belief that liberal democracy is the final destination of all humankind. The same utopianism has long guided the ruling classes on both sides of the Atlantic. Look at what the Davos elect--and more broadly, the utopian liberalism that is the spirit of the World Economic Forum--have done to us. Los Angeles is burning to the ground because they thought left-wing ideals could replace practical governance. The Los Angeles Fire Department is led by a lesbian chief, who bragged about making diversity a top priority. Before the fire, another lesbian leader in the department boasted on social media about diversity in the department. She said that to a woman who would complain that female firefighters aren't strong enough to carry her sick husband out of the flames, she (the lesbian firefighter) would respond, ""He got himself in the wrong place if I have to carry him out of a fire."" Think about that: in order to sustain progressive idealism, we have to blame victims for their own suffering. The same mentality is now exposed in Britain, where the ruling class for years blamed working-class white girls for their own rape and exploitation at the hands of Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs. They had to, in order to sustain the illusion that mass migration is good and that Diversity Is Our StrengthTM. Now everyone can see what an evil fraud that was. We can only hope that similar lustration happens on the European continent, as the media and establishment politicians lose their iron grip on controlling the narrative. This is what Trump's return to the White House could mean for Europe. In the U.S., the ruling class tried everything to destroy Trump's candidacy--and failed. To the media and the establishment, to vote for Trump is to be a racist, a bigot, and probably a fascist. Most Americans ceased to be intimidated by the insults. Trump even gained a big share of the vote from ethnic minorities who were sick and tired of exhausted liberalism. Europe, alas, has turned itself into an appendage of the American Empire. This is an appalling tragedy, but one that might turn out well for European national conservatives when the EU bureaucracy can no longer count on unquestioned support from Washington. Look for leaders like Viktor Orban and Giorgia Meloni to rise in influence in Europe, precisely because they have the trust of Donald Trump. Unlike 2017, when he first entered the White House, Trump returns to power facing an enfeebled and discredited liberal order, both in North America and in Europe. Now once-powerful European bureaucrats like former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton have been reduced to howling in interviews that the EU crushed the recent democratic election in Romania, and it will do so again if voters choose against Brussels' interests. In order to save democracy, they have to destroy it: this is not the stance of a confident ruling-class mandarin. Consider what's happening in Germany. The German ruling class has made every effort to demonize the Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) party as neo-Nazi rabble. And yet, as the failures of that class cascade, destroying the German economy and wrecking German society with mass migration, the AfD gains support. German media, goose-stepping faithfully in the Grand March, blockade the AfD's spokesmen--but thanks to Elon Musk, information finds its way to freedom. Last week, Musk held an open conversation on X with AfD leader Alice Weidel. If the only thing you know about AfD comes through the establishment media, you would have expected her to be Eva Braun in a pantsuit. In fact, Weidel came across as ... normal. She was funny, she was curious, and she was full of common sense. Weidel's interview gave lie to the hysterical claim by the ruling classes in Germany and elsewhere that the AfD is a fascist threat to German democracy. For the past three years, I have been trying to tell my fellow Americans that the Viktor Orban they know from the media, and the actually existing Viktor Orban are very, very different. In 2021, the powerful media renegade Tucker Carlson broke the U.S. media embargo on Orban. Now, Musk's passion for free speech and basic political sanity threatens to do that for many politicians of the nationalist European Right. No wonder the EU bureaucrats want to ban him, and the X platform. They will not succeed. Musk has the most powerful man in the world--the incoming U.S. president--on his side. If Brussels tries to silence Musk, there will be consequences. True, there will be serious policy consequences for Europe, both economic and military, from the new Trump government. But it will have the biggest effect, I think, on Europe's political culture. Europeans will be able to see not only the true measure of their governing class's failures, but also that a real alternative is possible. Trump has learned from the way the Washington swamp blocked his initiatives in his first term, and will not make those mistakes again. Plus, the American people's loss of confidence in their leaders and institutions gives Trump 2.0 a clear path for change. It's a small thing, but it says a lot: Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has turned on the Democratic establishment, which exhorted control on Facebook to maintain the official COVID narrative. Recently, Zuckerberg ordered tampon machines to be taken out of men's bathrooms in all of Meta's offices. Commenter Richard Hanania said, This is like pulling down the statue of Saddam. Now you know wokeness is dead. This sea change may take some time to come to Europe, but come, it will. The Grand Marchers of Brussels and other European capitals will not be stopped in their tracks soon. But now, at last, there is real hope that they will be stopped. This might be the last chance Europe has to save itself from the ruin its post-1960s leaders have brought. Nobody could have imagined that a vulgar, orange billionaire from New York and an anti-woke South African immigrant in Silicon Valley might be the champions Europe needs to find its own courage and Make Europe Great Again. But then again, despite the false faith of the left-wing ideologues and their bureaucracies, the march of history follows no predictable path.",The European Conservative,2025-01-14T11:27:49,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/make-europe-great-again-what-trump-2-0-can-do-for-europe/
Silenced German Right-Wing Voices Set to Speak Freely in the Voting Booths,"Germany's increasingly restrictive free speech legislation has come under international scrutiny, highlighted by a recent CBS television network expose titled 'Posting hateful speech online could lead to police raiding your home in this European country.' The programme, which featured interviews with German prosecutors, a Green Party politician, and the head of a government-backed anti-hate speech NGO, revealed a striking indifference toward freedom of expression. Germany stands out among European countries in its extensive framework of laws and institutions restricting free speech and its top-down attempts to control public debate. While some of these measures date back to the post-war period, many have emerged more recently with the rise of populism. Laws restricting free speech have either been introduced or amended under the guise of combating extremism, particularly the far right. The German doctrine of ""defensive democracy""--a principle that argues that democratic threats must be eliminated at their earliest stages--has been used to legitimise these initiatives. Two laws have become particularly notorious: Section 188 of the Penal Code, which criminalises ""insults"" to politicians, and Section 130, which prohibits the ""incitement of masses."" These laws have led to hundreds of prosecutions and convictions in the past months, particularly as the government has come under pressure over criticism of its migration and COVID-19 policies. The severity of these measures can be illustrated by these examples: In the spring of 2024, police conducted a pre-dawn raid on a Bavarian pensioner's home for sharing a social media post that showed Economics Minister Robert Habeck's photo with the caption ""Schwachkopf PROFESSIONAL,"" which roughly translates as ""professional moron,"" --a play on the 'Schwarzkopf Professional' shampoo brand name. In December 2024, authorities fined a pensioner EUR800 for criticising Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on the Foreign Ministry's contact page. The citizen's comment referenced the minister's past as a trampolinist and her stance on transgender legislation, stating: ""Almost the entire nation is feverishly asking the question: when will Baerbock overcome his or her puberty, when will Baerbock finally grow up? Some evil tongues think never, because she has banged her head on the ceiling too often while trampolining."" In January 2025 a 74-year-old woman received a EUR7,950 fine under Section 130 for criticising migration policy writing: ""Blah, blah, blah. We need skilled workers, not asylum seekers who just want to make a nice life here without respecting our values and culture. Send those who are here to work. We don't need idlers and scroungers, and we certainly don't need knife artists and rapists."" The comment was posted on Facebook in response to a statement by Robert Habeck about Germany's need for migration. Despite these concerning developments, established political parties have largely ignored free speech issues in their election campaigns. Even the opposition CDU's election programme endorses defensive democracy, with only a small group of party dissidents challenging Section 188. These critics have initiated a petition which argues that unlike politicians, trained in careful rhetoric, citizens express themselves more directly, especially during times of social stress--and should be able to do so without fear of prosecution. Beyond legislative restrictions, state institutions have also increasingly attempted to shape public discourse. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) exemplifies this trend, using its authority to monitor citizens' speech and label certain political movements as ""extremist and unconstitutional."" Its designation of the right-populist AfD as in parts ""extremist and unconstitutional"" has helped to stigmatise the party and its supporters. Thomas Haldenwang , the former BfV head, alongside Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, declared: ""We must not only focus on violent right-wing extremism, but also on shifting verbal and mental boundaries."" This climate of restriction has measurable effects. An Allensbach Institute survey from 2024 reveals that most Germans now feel unable to express their opinions freely. The survey revealed a stark divide: 78% of Green Party and 61% of Social Democrat voters perceive no speech restrictions. In contrast, 88% of AfD supporters feel heavily censored--a demographic the government has deliberately marginalised. The government's approach is clearly designed to further alienate voters and cement divisions. Interior Minister Faeser's warning that ""Anyone who mocks the state will have to deal with a strong state"" exemplifies this. Constitutional law professor Rupert Scholz characterised this approach as a ""massive intimidation campaign"" against government critics. This stifling climate has also extended into Germany's media landscape and affected reporting about issues such as Germany's failed energy policy, international populist movements, COVID-19, climate change, migration or Islamism. Germany's public broadcasters--ARD, ZDF, and Deutschlandfunk--deserve particular scrutiny. These networks command an enormous EUR9 billion annual budget through mandatory license fees, yet face growing public scepticism. Despite ARD's self-proclaimed status as the ""epitome of credibility and expertise,"" a 2023 INSA survey revealed that less than half of Germans trust the network. Among young adults aged 18-29, trust plummets to just one-third. Alexander Teske, a former ARD planning editor, provides troubling insights in his recent book. He describes how reporters routinely filter stories through ideological lenses, particularly in coverage of demonstrations and anti-government protests in former East Germany. Instead of balanced reporting, journalists often cherry-pick the most inflammatory statements. Fear of missteps has led many newsrooms to simply echo each other's coverage rather than conduct independent journalism. In response to these constraints, alternative media platforms have emerged and gained popularity despite facing pressure through advertising boycotts and legal threats--reflecting a growing public demand for more open debate Whether a new government abolishes Germany's repressive anti-free speech laws, and resists the temptation to attempt to stigmatise critics, will serve as a touchstone of its genuine commitment to democracy in Germany.",The European Conservative,2025-02-23T13:13:41,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/germany-silencing-dissent-right-wing-voices-democracy-elections/
We Stand with JD Vance Versus Europe’s ‘Enemy Within’,"Even before I had heard JD Vance's speech, I knew it must be something special simply from the horrified reactions of the EU elites and their media allies. We publish the US Vice President's speech to the Munich security conference in full on europeanconservative.com , because we recognise that it marks a dividing line in Western politics. And because we agree with pretty much every word of it. Since the moment he stopped speaking on Friday, Vance has been loudly accused of ""attacking Europe"". No, he didn't. He gave a devastating critique of the EU and UK leaders who have themselves betrayed the foundations of European democracy and Western civilisation. They are the ones who are attacking what Europe should stand for. As he said, the most worrying threat to Europe now ""is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America."" Vance's extraordinary speech was aimed against Europe's 'enemy within'-- the ruling elites who do not believe in their own nations, peoples or history. Far from being ""anti-European"", he came down on the side of the millions of people across Europe who are revolting against the bankrupt old political establishment. Vance outlined a hit list of the key issues on which Europe's leaders are betraying Europeans--much the same issues you will find at the top of our agenda. He slammed official Europe for retreating on free speech and imposing censorship by branding dissident views as ""so-called misinformation"". He attacked the EU and European governments for an open borders policy which has exposed their people to the sort of terrorist attack that struck Munich last week. ""No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the flood gates to millions of unvetted immigrants"". But, he observed to the delight of this veteran Brexiteer, ""In England, they voted for Brexit. ... And more and more, all over Europe, they're voting for political leaders who promise to put an end to out-of-control migration."" He expressed near-disbelief at the attacks on democracy which mean EU officials can boast of cancelling an election result in Romania, while German politicians demand a ban on the second-most popular party before their general election. As Vance summed all of this up: Now, to many of us on the other side of the Atlantic, it looks more and more like old, entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don't like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion, or, God forbid, vote a different way, or, even worse, win an election. Mr Vice President, it looks a lot like that to many of us on this side of the Atlantic, too! What brings these issues together is the EU elites' fundamental fear and loathing of the demos--the people. As Vance said, ""what no democracy, American, German or European, will survive, is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered. ... To believe in democracy is to understand that each of our citizens has wisdom and has a voice"". Five hundred years after Niccolo Machiavelli wrote that ""The multitude is wiser and more constant than a prince,"" it somehow sounds revolutionary once more to hear a Western leader praise the wisdom of the masses. And how startling to hear that in Europe, at a time when the anti-democratic EU elites prefer to put their faith, not in princes, but in equally unelected judges, commissioners and experts. Since Munich was a security conference, Vance brought the issue back to the question of defence. ""But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me--and certainly I think to many of the citizens of Europe--is what exactly it is that you're defending yourselves for."" In other words--what is it that Europe's leaders want to fight for? The answer to that question could decide the future of NATO and much more. ""Europe faces many challenges, but the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis I believe we all face together, is one of our own making,"" said Vance. ""If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you, nor, for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the American people who elected me and elected President Trump. You need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value. "" Vice President Vance has gone back to face the ""many challenges"" his own country faces, of course, But in hurling those political grenades at the crumbling walls of fortress Europe, he exploded some history-defining questions that we cannot allow to be swept back under the plush carpets of Brussels. At the time of the European elections last year, I wrote a Democracy Watch Column entitled (with reference to U.S. author John Dos Passos), ""All Right, We Are Two Europes"". It highlighted the divide between official Europe, where the elites were clinging to power, and the real Europe where millions of ordinary are in revolt against their policies and rule. All right, now, maybe even more: we are two Wests. The divide is not America versus Europe, nor just Vance versus Von der Leyen. It is the people versus the elites, the oligarchs versus the demos, the cancel culture warriors versus those who believe free speech is the lifeblood of our civilisation. We know where we stand. Whose side are you on?",The European Conservative,2025-02-17T09:31:09,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/we-stand-with-jd-vance-versus-europes-enemy-within/
Erasmus: How Brussels ‘Deconstructs’ European Values,"Erasmus+ is one of the most emblematic programmes of the European Union. Conceived to help European students from various countries engage with each other and strengthen academic cooperation. It was supposed to be a creator of unity and a means to transmit the fundamental values of our civilisation. But the current management of the programme has betrayed its principles. With unjustified political sanctions and dubious financing, the European Commission has sacrificed Erasmus on the altar of its ideological preferences. In September 2023, the Commission made the controversial decision of suspending Hungary's participation in two leading programmes: Erasmus and Horizon Europe. Officially, this measure was presented as taken in response to the reform of higher education initiated by Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Inspired by the American model, the reform aims to modernise Hungarian universities by instituting, via private foundations, Boards of Trustees in charge of strategic, financial and academic decision-making. The objective of the move is dual: on the one hand, it aims to improve the international standing of Hungarian higher educational institutions, and on the other, attract private funding. By integrating representatives of the private sector into the management of universities, the reform simultaneously simplified university governance, and catalyses investments into the higher education sector. In addition, the adoption of this reform was never compulsory: it was supported and freely chosen by the majority of Hungarian universities, and a minority could in turn preserve the old structure. Similar university management models exist in other European countries, too, for example in Germany. But whether one is in favour of such a model or not, it is up to the Hungarians to decide about it, and certainly not Brussels bureaucrats. By suspending Hungarian universities from participation in the Erasmus and Horizon programmes, the Commission made a decision that is equally unacceptable and profoundly unjust. The sanction, which affects practically the entire Hungarian higher education sector and close to 180,000 students, pretends to be targeting the Orban government's education reforms. The Hungarian government has attempted to resolve the situation by proposing the passing of a new law, but the Commission has kept demanding ever newer amendments to it. As a result, the funding remains frozen to this day for the majority of Hungarian universities. The European Commission in reality is weaponising the concept of the rule of law to weaken a leader who defies it, sacrificing in the process Hungarian university students and exacerbating the divisions within the European Union. This politicisation of educational programmes and research betrays their original purpose. While Hungary remains excluded, universities with proven links to Islamism continue to receive Erasmus funding. The example of Gaziantep University in Turkey is telling: its rector has publicly hailed Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, an organisation classified as a terrorist group by the European Union. Despite this, the university is still part of the Erasmus+ programme. And this is not an isolated case. In 2021, it was revealed that the Islamic University of Gaza, nicknamed ""the Hamas campus"", had received EUR1.8 million in European funds via Erasmus. Jean-Paul Garraud, head of the National Rally delegation in the European Parliament, and myself have tabled an amendment asking for an explanation and demanding an audit of the funding. But the Commission, true to its laxism, remains deaf to our calls. How can we justify the fact that institutions linked to Islamist movements continue to receive European subsidies, even though Hungary, a member of the Union, is ostracized? This double standard is an insult to the citizens who finance these programmes. It is only because our delegation spoke out against these scandals that Macronist MEPs finally woke up and followed suit, demanding accountability from the Commission. Faced with these abuses, it is urgent to remember the primary mission of Erasmus. Inspired by the humanism of Erasmus of Rotterdam, this programme aimed to transmit the great values of European civilisation: academic excellence, intellectual freedom and commitment to the humanities. It was not simply a question of facilitating student mobility, but of offering them an education rooted in our common heritage. However, instead of promoting the humanities and the classics, Erasmus is today being diverted to finance institutions that are moving away from the very essence of our civilisation. Rather than strengthening European unity, it is being used to promote projects that are contrary to our traditions and fundamental principles. While the Commission funds institutions close to Islamism through Erasmus, it also seems indifferent to universities that promote wokeness and tolerate the excesses of the radical Left. To restore the credibility and integrity of the programme, we demand: Erasmus is too valuable a programme to be left in the hands of Brussels ideologies. We at the National Rally will continue to fight so that it once again becomes a genuine tool for academic excellence and the transmission of European values.",The European Conservative,2025-02-20T17:41:36,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/erasmus-how-brussels-deconstructs-european-values/
The Only Certainty Is that Nothing Is Certain Anymore,"The world is living through times of extraordinary transformation. Whatever one might think of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, his New Year message about 'changes unseen in a century accelerating across the world' seems purely descriptive. In many ways, the post-Cold War world we were accustomed to is already solidly in the past. Liberal ideological hegemony--defined by ever more absolute forms of atomisation and extreme individualism, the primacy of globalist institutions over those of the national states, the superseding of nation and civilisation as self-sufficient, relevant cultural systems, as well as the world-wide imposition of privatisation, denationalisation, free trade, and free market economics--is shattered. Wokery is losing ground. Both the rapid disappearance of the old international order and the acceleration of political transformation in the West--personified by Trumpism in America and the rise of the Right in Europe--make plain that, in the years ahead, there's little that can be taken for certain. It is not that the West has entered a post-Liberal--or, even less, an illiberal--era yet; but liberalism is no longer taken for granted. And it can no longer take us for granted. The future of the West is being decided in America. Trumpism in its original, 2016 form was almost entirely about what it was not: it was adamant in its rejection of the 'liberal consensus' that had put an end to its age of 'hyper-power' by destroying America's industrial muscle and social fabric--yet it lacked a clear counter-programme. It sensed, correctly, that liberalism is not democracy; that America's formal, constitutional institutions of governance had been emptied of real power by an alliance between progressive big capital and the bureaucracy; and that, whatever its name--be it Yarvin's 'the Cathedral', 'the regime', or the 'deep state'--practical control over the country no longer belonged to 'we the people' but to a shady, decidedly not well-intentioned 'they'. Yet, this incipient revolt still lacked the intellectual and human resources to fight effectively. In his solitude, Trump made the mistake of trying to placate his enemies by offering them a seat at the table of his administration. Instead of thanking him for his magnanimity, these apparatchiki--Bolton, Haley, Pompeo, and countless lesser-known officials--devoted all their energy to the enactment of a counter-revolution, striving to protect the threatened oligarchy from the Jacquerie outside. They saw themselves as a Maquis against the people, sabotaging the public's demands--that is, Trump's popularly-elected platform--at every turn. Their sabotage seemed entirely successful after Trump lost the 2020 election. Indeed, it would have ended in complete triumph had it not been for Biden's superlatively inept performance as commander-in-chief--and Kamala Harris' dismal attempt to succeed him. Trumpism 2.0. is a wholly different machine. It learned from its tribulations. It recruited men of ability. It gained maturity and ideological consistency. In 2016, Trumpism was anti -liberal; now, it is increasingly becoming illiberal . Not because it is anti-democratic, as liberalism is today; but because it is genuinely, deeply, properly democratic. Trumpism 2.0. goes beyond the boisterous critique of the deep state. It now wishes to understand, fight, and replace it. Trumpism 2.0. no longer merely intends to enjoy the nominal dignity of command; it wishes to govern . And, to do so, it must do away with the current anti-popular, globalist bureaucracy--and rebuild it with men who truly intend to implement the political priorities of the electorate, as decided democratically. No one should underestimate the vigour with which the 'deep state' will try to resist this. As JD Vance--clearly Trump's ideal champion for the mission at hand--tries to reclaim control over the apparatus of state, its current owners will fight with all their might. Their efforts during Trump's first term will pale in comparison to what is to come--as the Trumpian threat is now much greater, mature, and effective, so will their determination to conserve the almost limitless power they have long enjoyed. America's coming years will be bitter and unstable, dominated by intrigue and relentless power struggles. Conservatives must be ready for what is to come. Trump's victory in November was a crushing blow to the ruling liberal-globalist clique. But just as they will not give up their long-held power over the United States easily, so will 'the Cathedral' fight to conserve its remaining fortress: Europe. This will not be an easy task: as the undisputed cultural leader of the West, the rightward shift of the United States now acts as a powerful magnet for a continent that was already in open insurrection against its political establishment. Still, the Eurocrats have not yet run out of options. In Poland, the globalist-reactionary government of Donald Tusk has been hard at work: Brussels is using the country as a political laboratory in its quest to develop an effective--and easily exportable--algorithm of counter-revolution. Since Tusk's return to power, in late 2023, his regime has enforced the fiercest, most overtly authoritarian program yet developed by the beleaguered globalists. In the name of liberty and pluralism, the Prime Minister had TV stations invaded by police and taken off the air ; he has refused to pay the main opposition party the electoral subvention to which it is entitled by law ; he has even used the powers of the State to force opposition leaders into exile for the first time since the fall of Polish communism, in 1989. He even took over the General Prosecutor's Office in open defiance of the law and had the police, under his command, invade the palace of the President --the sole remaining check on his power. Should the vaccine pass its Polish test, it will no doubt be administered to other patients throughout the Union. Or so Brussels wishes. The liberal repressions were clearly engineered under the presumption that Kamala Harris would win the US Presidency. Had this happened, the Eurocrats would have not only had the medication, but the prescription to use it. The attempts to jail Italy's Matteo Salvini--the first step towards an anti-Meloni coup--and to bar France's Marine Le Pen from running in the 2027 Presidential elections were obviously launched with that expectation. It will now be harder for the Brussels bureaucracy--although not impossible. Indeed, they now have nothing to lose. Shocked by the recent victory of nationalist candidate Georgescu in Romania, the European Union simply had the whole election canceled. Not only did former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton admit responsibility , he threatened Germany . Outrageous? Indeed. When a dog is cornered, however... Those on the dissident Right have long hoped that something--or someone--might come to rescue the world from the gloomy boredom of liberal hegemony. We needed a surprise that would restart the engine of History. If there was to be more to the future than Woke techno-totalitarianism and the nightmares it would entail, it could only be with an icebreaker: an unexpected turn of events that shattered the present order of things and allowed for an alternative timeline to emerge. This has now occurred; the water has been stirred. The world of tomorrow is again a tabula rasa . It might be a good place--if we make it so. But lest we ignore the scope, size, and fear in the mighty transformations ahead. Liberalism has not been defeated; the Right is not victorious. The future of Western civilization is anything but assured. International law is dead--so is democratic convention. Politically and geopolitically, inside and outside the West, the only certainty now is that nothing is certain anymore.",The European Conservative,2025-02-24T20:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-only-certainty-is-that-nothing-is-certain-anymore/
Ceasefire Is No Victory for the Israelis—Or for Us,"As Western leaders celebrate the prospect of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, we should listen instead to the response of Adam Ma'anit, cousin of Israeli hostage Tsachi Idan. Tsachi's 18-year-old daughter Maayan was murdered by Hamas terrorists in front of him on October 7th. The world community, the international community has allowed Hamas to play a game where they have a lot of the cards and we are forced into a discussion of a deal where they can exact concessions from us in order to secure the release of the hostages. The entire world has failed us. If the world stood steadfast on October 7, October 8 against Hamas, demanding their full surrender, exerting every kind of pressure possible on states like Iran and Qatar and Egypt who have any kind of leverage over Hamas, insisting on the unconditional release of hostages rather than pursuing a so-called deal, we might have had them released a lot sooner--and the devastation that has been wrought on Gaza as a result of the Hamas atrocities may have been averted as well. In my travels across Israel last year, from Sderot on the border with Gaza, in the army camp at Reim, in Jerusalem, in Tel Aviv, and on the border with Lebanon in the north, I met and talked to many Israelis about their views on the war. They divided into two camps. There were those who wished Hamas to be destroyed so that the hostages could be freed, and there were those who wanted the hostages freed and then Hamas to be destroyed. This was a tactical difference only. Neither camp can be satisfied with a prospective deal that leaves Hamas to fulfil its pledge to repeat the October 7th pogrom ""again and again."" So, what are Western politicians celebrating? Before the ink is dry on a ceasefire agreement, Western leaders have announced victory. Not victory against the terrorists of Hamas, dedicated as they are to the destruction of Israel, but victory for their own attitudes towards the war. Most leaders would not go along with the rhetoric of their NATO ally, the Turkish President Recep Erdogan, who said ""We respectfully salute the heroic people and brave sons of Gaza who courageously defended their land and freedom against Israel's unlawful and inhumane attack"". But the main thrust of Western leaders' statements was that, while welcoming the potential release of hostages, the important thing was that the ceasefire would stop Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza, launched after October 7th. French President Macron referred to the end of ""the unjustifiable suffering"" of Gazans, and opened the door to a two-state solution, thus effectively rewarding Hamas for its murderous attacks on Israel and failing to recognise that it is Hamas that has brought suffering to the people of Gaza. In America, an unseemly argument has already broken out between supporters of departing President Biden and incoming President Trump about who can claim credit for the ceasefire. For many, perhaps most, Western leaders, Israel's war against the death cult of Hamas has been an inconvenience at best and a threat at worst. For countries with large Muslim populations, such as France and the UK, and for those with large youthful contingents and leftists who have more sympathy with Hamas than with Israel, the war has caused internal conflicts and loss of political support. Western leaders' domestic politics has taken precedence over their rhetorical support for the struggle against Islamist terrorism, helping to undermine Israel's fight for survival. While the release of hostages is to be welcomed, the only real victory represented in this ceasefire is for those who have tried to hold Israel back from defeating Hamas. For many commentators outside Israel, the ceasefire is an opportunity to once again condemn Israel for having fought back against the murder, rape, and kidnapping of it its people on October 7th, 2023. Over the past 15 months, Western Commentators have repeatedly claimed that Israel could not defeat Hamas ""because you cannot defeat an idea,"" and that Israel should not go into Lebanon to deal with Hezbollah who were firing rockets into Israel because they would get ""bogged down"" and ultimately fail. Western governments have told Israel to hold off from fully attacking the Islamists because of civilian casualties. Israel has been faced with arms boycotts, prosecuted for genocide at the International Court of Justice, and its democratically elected prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has even been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court. Its alleged Western allies have forced Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, to fight the war against genocidal Islamists with one hand tied behind its back. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have gone to extraordinary lengths to limit civilian casualties in Gaza. Yet, the West has condemned Israel for the suffering of Palestinian civilians whom Hamas uses as human shields, and whose deaths Hamas has openly celebrated as martyrs. All this from Western politicians who claim to support Israel's right to exist and to defend itself. One has to ask, with friends like these, who needs enemies? The Israeli government is now being berated for not having negotiated a ceasefire earlier, because the Biden plan has been on the table since last spring. Netanyahu is presented as a ruthless and selfish leader, bent on staying in power at the expense of the Gazans and the Israeli soldiers and civilians who have lost their lives. Alternately, he is presented as the puppet of the 'far right' ministers in his coalition. Critics of the Israeli government conveniently forget how much it has achieved since the ceasefire deal was first tabled last year. The IDF has had remarkable success over the past six months in punishing the Hamas killers, neutralizing Hezbollah, helping to destabilise the Assad regime in Syria, and pushing the tyrannical Islamist regime in Iran onto the defensive. These advances, and the threats from Donald Trump to ""unleash hell,"" have pushed Hamas onto the defensive and forced them to the negotiating table. Israel has shown that you may not be able to defeat an idea, but you can degrade and defeat an army and rout your enemies through the skill and bravery of your own army and the support of your people. The hostage crisis is a symptom of the problems that Israel faces, not the cause. The continued existence and operation of Hamas poses an ongoing existential threat to Israel, something which I found Israelis understand full well. The young people who were murdered, raped, and kidnapped at the Nova festival on October 7th are part of a generation in Israel which had hoped for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This hope was largely extinguished by the butchery carried out by Hamas terrorists on that day. The latest opinion polls show that three-quarters of Israelis think that Hamas has no future role to play in Gaza. It is against this background we should understand the ceasefire. It will be met with qualified support by most Israelis because hostages must be freed. Most do not believe there can be a peaceful future while Hamas still runs Gaza. And how could there be when Hamas is committed to the destruction of Israel and the driving of all Jews from the lands between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, the entirety of Israel? It is completely understandable why the families of the remaining hostages should welcome the prospect of their release, however distant and uncertain that might remain under the drawn-out process proposed. An initial halt to fighting will also be a relief, if perhaps temporary, for the citizens of Gaza. But the ceasefire provides no answer to the question of Hamas, which cannot be allowed to survive and prosper. How the Israelis conduct their war is their business. They are the people who are under threat from neighbours on all sides who wish to see them destroyed. We on the outside must do all we can to persuade our governments to support Israel's fight. Between the democratic state of Israel and the Islamists of Hamas, there is no equivalence. Hamas is part of an Islamist movement which bombs and murders citizens of Europe, America, and beyond. The Israelis are fighting for their lives to defend their democracy. As it was on October 7th, so is it now. Israel's is a war in defence of Western civilization against those who wish to destroy it, both in Israel and beyond. It is their fight, and it is our fight.",The European Conservative,2025-01-16T15:43:28,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/ceasefire-is-no-victory-for-the-israelis-or-for-us/
The Hungarian Way: Supporting Families to Boost Birth Rates,"No, Europe's most serious problem is not climate change, nor its public debt, nor even its geopolitical irrelevance--it is its demographic suicide, its programmed disappearance amid general indifference. Europe is dying. What countless wars and plagues have failed to achieve is now being accomplished by an unprecedented mix of self-hatred, materialism, spiritual emptiness, fashionable Malthusianism, and rampant individualism. Postmodern society has managed to anesthetize the reproductive instinct that has driven humanity for millennia, and no one seems to care--least of all its elites--on an aging continent that has never lived up to its name more fittingly. Even worse, Europe has chosen to outsource its own survival, preferring to import millions of immigrants to secure its short-term future--fully aware that, in doing so, it is paving the way for its own disappearance. The numbers speak for themselves: according to Eurostat, the birth rate in the EU has been declining since 2008, no EU country meets the replacement threshold, and the continent's median age continues to rise. In 2023, Europe's median age reached 44.7 years. For decades, more Europeans have died than have been born, while millions of migrants continue to arrive. Europe is so consumed by ideology that it no longer dares to acknowledge the most obvious diagnosis or draw the necessary conclusions: first, Europeans are no longer having children, and this constitutes an existential threat; second, the utmost priority of any leader should be to encourage birth rates and place the traditional family at the heart of the equation, as the cornerstone of society. This stands as a direct challenge to the prevailing ideological orthodoxy in Europe, which promotes precisely the opposite. Nevertheless, in this sea of fatalism, some countries refuse to fade away and dare to assert their existence. Hungary, for instance, has spent the past decade implementing ambitious and innovative family policies, investing 5% of its GDP to reverse the demographic suicide that once loomed over it. The approach is clear: ensuring that starting a family is not a disadvantage, placing mothers at the center of the equation, and rewarding marital stability. Since 2010, the government has introduced a comprehensive set of generous and strategic measures that have turned around what once seemed like an irreversible demographic decline. After years of freefall--from 2.25 children per woman in 1980 to a record low of 1.2 in 2010--the birth rate climbed to 1.6 in 2020 and now stands at 1.55. At the same time, divorce and abortion rates have significantly declined over the same period. Hopeful? Yes. Sufficient? No. That is why the Hungarian government has just doubled down on its commitment to boosting birth rates with a series of new measures, the most notable of which is a groundbreaking tax exemption: mothers with two or more children will be exempt from paying income tax for life. This benefit previously applied only to mothers of four children, but it is now being dramatically expanded to provide a decisive boost to birth rates. In the coming months, Hungary will effectively become a tax haven for families--especially for mothers. A revolutionary measure that will likely mark a turning point. Some remain skeptical, pointing out that after ten years, Hungary has yet to reach the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. This is true, but it has nonetheless averted an irreversible demographic collapse and fundamentally reversed the trend. Since 1980, Hungary's birth rate had been in steep decline, dropping from 2.2 children per woman in 1978 to just 1.25 in 2010. By 2020, however, it had climbed to a notable 1.6. Without determined policy intervention, what would the birth rate be today? It is estimated that these pro-family measures have contributed to the birth of 250,000 babies over the past fifteen years. With the large-scale expansion of the tax exemption for mothers of two or more children, it is more than plausible that this trend will solidify in the years to come. It is true that the battle for higher birth rates cannot be won through economic incentives alone. Europe urgently needs a cultural shock to counteract decades of individualist propaganda and legislation that have undermined and devalued the family. With the continent teetering on the edge of demographic collapse, the frivolity and ideological rigidity of political and cultural elites regarding family--and motherhood in particular--are unforgivable. Take Spain, for instance: despite having the second-lowest birth rate in the EU, its government does nothing to promote higher birth rates while simultaneously facilitating abortion for minors and passing an animal welfare law that fines pet owners for leaving their dogs outside supermarkets while shopping. Meanwhile, in Hungary, government policies are reinforced by civil society initiatives and a broader narrative that promotes the family, recognizing it for what it truly is--the cornerstone of society and a source of happiness and stability. This holistic approach has led to a simultaneous decline in divorce and abortion rates alongside rising birth rates. That is why Hungary remains the only country that proudly declares itself ""family-friendly."" As the 16th-century French statesman Jean Bodin once said, ""There is no wealth but men."" In Hungary, there is no need for a reminder.",The European Conservative,2025-03-01T15:55:46,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/hungary-family-policy-families-birth-rates-demography-survival/
Is Brussels Attempting to Export the ‘Polish Model’ to Hungary? ,"A salient example of the autocratic aspirations of the globalist elite is Brussels' compulsion to decide who and how should lead a sovereign member state. Manfred Weber , president of the European People's Party, declared: ""As Tusk managed to defeat Kaczynsi, so will Peter Magyar defeat Viktor Orban; Peter Magyar is the future."" Weber has every right to be upset about and criticize the EU policy of any member state, but he certainly has no authority to try and designate the prime minister of a country by interfering in its internal affairs. And yet, he is obviously keen on employing the formula that has worked so well in Poland: enabling the demonization of the conservative government, supporting the opposition, and disregarding the unlawful machinations of the latter. After the 2023 change of government Donald Tusk admitted to wanting to cement the constitutional order with unconstitutional tools. He stated, ""If we want to restore the constitutional order... we will probably make mistakes or commit actions that, according to some legal authorities, will be inconsistent or not fully compliant with the provisions of the law."" Well, Peter Magyar went one step further by giving an exact number of those they are planning to start criminal procedures against once in power. Tusk pledged allegiance to Brussels, the American Democrats and globalist big caps when during his parliamentary hearing, saying he denounces governments that are ""working to weaken the [Western] alliance""; that he will be a loyal ally of the United States; and that Poland's task is ""to loudly and firmly demand the full determination from the entire Western community to help Ukraine in this war."" We see the exact same thing with Magyar's Tisza Party (EPP). The Peter Magyar bunch keep voting in favour and support everything the Brussels elite expects, starting with the re-election of Ursula von der Leyen. As Tisza MEP Zoltan Tarr put it, ""in many ways we indeed endorse the positions of the European People's Party, which is a sort of obligation as well. During the vote on the EU budget Magyar and his fellow party members supported allocating 25 million Euros more on implementing the migration pact, which would make the redistribution of migrants compulsory, with a fine of 20,000 Euros per migrant to be imposed on those who fail to comply. Lakos opines that Hungary should pay the absurdly high penalty adjudicated by the Court of the European Union (200 million Euros plus one million Euros per day in case of non-compliance). The Tisza Party does not only keenly kowtow to Brussels, but has also voiced its support for loyal cooperation with the United States, expressing its agreement with the previous administration on unconditional support for Ukraine. Wearing T-shirts with the Ukrainian flag, the Tisza MEPs also joined in the standing ovation following Zelensky's remarks on the 100th day of the outbreak of the war. The Tusk government began the ""restoring of the rule of law"" with political cleansing, forcibly occupying the public media and appointing its new leaders with total disregard for the laws in force. The minister for culture and heritage protection simply relieved of their duties the chief executives of Polish public media, on the basis of a parliamentary resolution, and created new supervisory boards, thus bypassing a normative act that is at the top of the legal hierarchy with the stroke of a pen. Peter Magyar has also declared war on all media outlets and journalists who used negative adjectives in relation to him or reported on any of his (numerous) scandals. He has labelled several outlets as propaganda media, calling for the boycott of the ""propaganda products"" of the Hungarian public media and has also demanded the dismissal of the CEO and other executives of the National Media and Information Authority. By repeatedly dismissing Hungarian public media as a broadcaster ""Gobbelsian propaganda,"" he is clearly attempting to build up legitimacy that would justify the copying of the Polish model. While Magyar's wishful thinking and Tusk's actions in terms of the treatment of the media are far from being democratic, Brussels has made it clear that if there was a change of government in Hungary (spearheaded by Tisza), it would release all funding previously withheld on the grounds of rule of law concerns, and has indeed disbursed all the funds due to Poland as soon as Tusk entered office. In January 2024, former Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski and his deputy were arrested in a case in which the President had already pardoned them. In a state governed by the rule of law, pardoned perpetrators cannot be prosecuted again for the same crime. However, in Poland, the law has been subordinated to political opportunism and Tusk-style class struggle: since the change of government, the new Minister of Justice has dismissed numerous court leaders for their--presumed--political views, has challenged more than a hundred judicial appointments for political reasons, and has also illegally, without the President's approval, sought to remove the incumbent prosecutor general. In the summer of 2024, opposition MP Marcin Romanowski was illegally arrested as a suspect in a criminal case in which he had already been acquitted in a binding verdict. Father Michal Olszewski, who was arrested for political reasons, was held in handcuffs for hours, denied food and was not allowed to consult with his lawyer. The latter case raises the possibility of a violation of the UN Convention against Torture, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Polish Constitution. The Polish prosecutor's office has initiated ECJ proceedings against Poland for serious violations of the rule of law, but their motion was not addressed in substance. This double standard in Brussels may encourage Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar to promise measures reminiscent of the Polish ones, such as the dismissal of the President of the State Audit Office, members of the Constitutional Court, the Prosecutor General and the President of the Republic. A new head of state replaced illegitimately would be exactly what the Hungarian Left has accused presidents nominated by Fidesz of being: a puppet of the government. Just as was the case with Poland, we can expect that all Brussels concerns regarding the rule of law in Hungary would magically evaporate should Magyar gain power. In exchange for giving up our sovereignty, Brussels would ""generously"" offer Hungary the resources that it is entitled to anyway. But in 2026, it will be Hungarian voters and not Brussels bureaucrats who go to the polls and decide whether to follow the Polish path or keep Hungary a sovereign, Hungarian country.",The European Conservative,2025-02-25T14:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/is-brussels-attempting-to-export-the-polish-model-to-hungary/
Valencia Is Not Forgotten,"The Spanish government wants to impose the narrative that the state has everything under control and that life has returned to normal in Valencia, but what those affected are telling us completely shatters this narrative. On October 29th, 2024, Valencia suffered one of the greatest disasters in its history. The gota fria --the cold snap--caused torrential rains and the overflowing of rivers and ravines, leaving more than 200 dead along with incalculable material damage. The response of the authorities, both at the regional and state level, was utterly ineffective , and tens of thousands of people found themselves abandoned by the state that was supposed to protect them. But, in the midst of the chaos, the tragedy brought out the best in many Spaniards, as thousands of volunteers threw themselves into the mud to help their compatriots. Without them, this tragedy would have had far more serious consequences. Today, the state is present and several thousand military personnel are working to build bridges, fix roads, and clean garages, but the destruction is so great that they are not enough. In addition, the tragedy has shown a surprising lack of means--from machinery to fuel--of a military that tries to make up for these deficiencies with effort and will. It is worth remembering that our soldiers are in one of the lowest-paid professions and that the condition of many of our weapons systems is lamentable. The defense policy of our various governments has left us at the mercy of others. Unfortunately, when an event ceases to be news, it seems as if it no longer exists, and that is what has happened with the tragedy in Valencia. The media spotlight has moved on and many have the impression that everything is back to normal. We wish it were so, but the reality in which many Valencians live is far from normal. More than two months after the ' gota fria ' episode, Paiporta still smells of mud. The town became famous for the events five days after the floods, when the king and queen of Spain and the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, arrived in the town surrounded by a legion of attendants and policemen. The king and queen held their ground and listened to the outrage of the locals; Sanchez, on the other hand, fled with his tail between his legs, blaming the ""far right"" for what had happened. ""It is another lie, those who insulted Sanchez were neighbors from the town. What did they expect? They left us stranded for days,"" says Yolanda, a nurse who lives in the town with her family, showing us the destroyed ground floors--in Paiporta alone, there are 2,520 ground floors of destroyed houses--and garages still flooded with mud, posing a health risk to those who live on them. The lies told by politicians and the media about what happened in the first days of the tragedy have left their mark on many residents of the affected villages, and graffiti against Sanchez adorns the walls of destroyed houses. Many no longer believe anything the government says, much less the official number of dead and missing. ""The deaths caused by the flood are presented as traffic accidents or other causes,"" says Yolanda, recounting the case of a neighbor who died from being hit by an object swept away by the water. Other people tell us the same thing, that authorities want to reduce the real number of victims in order to minimize the scope of the disaster or with a view to future compensation. Many are still in shock and have not fully come to terms with what has happened, and the most vulnerable, the elderly and children, are the ones who suffer the most from the psychological effects of the flood. One volunteer told us about a couple whose two children refuse to go out into the street unless they are wearing arm floats. With the arrival of Christmas, great efforts have been made to restore the joy of this season, and Paiporta is decorated with Christmas stars made by local children--a stark contrast to the surrounding destruction more typical of a war zone. Gas supplies are inadequate and much infrastructure is still in shambles and months away from being restored. For example, it is estimated that work to restore the Paiporta metro will not be completed until the summer. Combined with the loss of more than 120,000 vehicles, this has left many unable to commute to work or school. There is also a serious security problem. Many businesses have been boarded up out of fear of looting and squatting. Jesus, a local policeman, tells us that as the water levels began to drop, looting of businesses began and they even tried to steal machinery and water pumps to empty the garages. What surprised me and all the people in these villages is that no one came here in the first few days. If we have to wait for a politician to give the order to respond to a tragedy like this, we are a failed state. Many have thought the same thing, and Jesus has met police officers from other provinces who went to Valencia on their own to help. Here, again, the problem was the incompetence of the state, which sent the message that volunteers were no longer needed. In Chiva, the town where the flooding began, we spoke with Nieves, Elisabeth, and Elvira--three volunteers who bring appliances, clothes, and food to the victims. This afternoon, they are bringing heaters to two families and have not stopped helping since the first day. ""There is still a lot to be done,"" they assure us, ""because the aid is not reaching most of the victims."" They introduce us to Juan, a 74-year-old farmer who saw his century-old house flooded in a few minutes (the water reached a height of 2.37 meters) and who lost everything. Juan has not received any help, except from volunteers, because of bureaucratic obstacles: ""They ask me for the deeds of the house and I don't have them because the water took them away,"" says Juan, speaking from a room destroyed by the flood. Bureaucracy, both institutional and from private insurers, is a real nightmare for people like Juan, who also receives help from the volunteers in this regard. Within this volunteer work, we must highlight the role of young people. In Paiporta, we met Asier, a 19-year-old young man who has spent the last two months removing mud. ""It's the right thing to do,"" he says, and his case is an example of young people who are stepping up to the plate and surprising many with their commitment. Also noteworthy are the efforts of volunteers who come to Valencia from other provinces to bring all kinds of help. ""When I went to the affected areas for the first time, my heart sank. That's why I can't stop coming here,"" said Nacho, a security guard from Toledo who uses his days off to bring all kinds of aid. While we were in Chiva, we got in touch with Pablo from Revuelta, who was in Paiporta. He had left Madrid early in the morning with other colleagues to install a stove in the home of an old woman, to bring hot water to the home of a Colombian family with a newborn baby, and to help two other families. We did not see each other because after the four visits, they returned to Madrid. To Pedro Sanchez, this is a hate campaign of the ""extreme right"". There is no better example of the difference between reality and official spin. The truth is that Valencia needs all our help and volunteers are still needed. It is evident that authorities want to impose the narrative that the state has everything under control and that life has returned to normal, but the accounts of those affected shatter this narrative entirely. That is why it is so important to keep talking about what is really happening. Valencia will not be forgotten.",The European Conservative,2025-01-17T12:58:51,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/valencia-is-not-forgotten/
Bonhoeffer’s Legacy,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer is, deservedly, one of the most well-known resistance figures of the Second World War. One of the few Germans to speak out against Hitler and the Nazis at the height of their power, he preached against the persecution of the Jews and condemned the Nazi euthanasia program. He became one of the founders of the Confessing Church, a faction of German Protestants committed to resisting Hitler's takeover and the consolidation of the German Evangelical Church that emerged in the 1930s. Bonhoeffer was arrested in April 1943 and, after being incarcerated at Tegel Prison for over a year, he was sent to Flossenburg concentration camp. Although the historical record is inconclusive about his involvement, Bonhoeffer was accused of being part of the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler. He was hanged on 9 April 1945, as the Third Reich collapsed. Both his imprisonment and execution are portrayed in the final scenes of Bonhoeffer , the new biopic by Angel Studios. Predictably, Bonhoeffer's portrayal in the film has triggered a vigorous historical debate. The docudrama is compelling, although extensive creative liberties were taken with regard to his involvement in the July 20 plot (the subtitle refers to him incorrectly as an ""assassin""), and the nuances of Bonhoeffer's theological views--and the tensions between his pacifism and his resistance activities--are left entirely unexplored. Some reviews, such as Joel Looper's in First Things , have been scorching, and fair enough: the ""based on a true story"" disclaimer was definitely warranted. The film has given Bonhoeffer scholars cause once again to accuse conservatives of 'hijacking' Bonhoeffer; many insist that, in his bestselling biography, Eric Metaxas portrayed Bonhoeffer as an American evangelical rather than the complex German theologian that he was. And indeed, Bonhoeffer's theological views were, in many instances, far from orthodox . But it must be pointed out that it isn't just conservatives who wish to claim Bonhoeffer. I suspect Bonhoeffer would be appalled to see how progressives are using his name, as well. Take Angela Denker's review for Slate.com, titled "" I'm Pretty Sure Dietrich Bonhoeffer Would Have Hated Bonhoeffer ."" Denker bemoans the pain of watching ""the right slowly claim one of your lifelong heroes"" while vigorously straw-manning American evangelicals. Denker--a female pastor--claims that a Bonhoeffer relative told her that the famous pastor would be ""turning in his grave"" to see his words being used to, for example, oppose ""women's reproductive rights."" But Bonhoeffer rather unambiguously referred to abortion as ""murder"": Destruction of the embryo in the mother's womb is a violation of the right to live which God has bestowed upon this nascent life. To raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue. The simple fact is that God certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life. And this is nothing but murder. A great many different motives may lead to an action of this kind; indeed in cases where it is an act of despair, performed in circumstances of extreme human or economic destitution and misery, the guilt may often lie rather with the community than with the individual. Precisely in this connection money may conceal many a wanton deed, while the poor man's more reluctant lapse may far more easily be disclosed. All these considerations must no doubt have a quite decisive influence on our personal and pastoral attitude towards the person concerned, but they cannot in any way alter the fact of murder. Who, exactly, is recruiting who? Pro-lifers do not need to 'recruit' Bonhoeffer--he identified abortion as murder before we were born and was also a rigorous opponent of all forms of euthanasia. Bonhoeffer's views certainly defy the simplistic political categorizations to which we are accustomed, but it is absolutely fair to point out that he would be ""turning in his grave"" to see his name used to defend a procedure he referred to as ""murder,"" considering that he was willing to risk death and face execution in opposition to a regime built on murder. Several reviewers have accused Angel Studios of producing some sort of MAGA nationalist Bonhoeffer, but this seems to be projection. Many, including Denker, condemn Christians who oppose LGBT ideology (which the film doesn't mention), with the strong implication that Bonhoeffer, if alive today, would be heavily into all that. None seem to see the irony in asserting that Bonhoeffer would be a backer of the sexual revolution and the new state ideology. It is the rainbow flag that many churches hoist now, and even President-Elect Trump obediently hosted a victory party to celebrate the LGBT movement's accomplishments at Mar-A-Lago. It is true that some conservatives would like to baptize Bonhoeffer as one of them; it is also true that progressives, who are fond of comparing their ideological opponents to Nazis, would like to portray Bonhoeffer as a trans-identifying Episcopalian bishop who smuggles abortion pills into red states. Indeed, just as the Scholl siblings of the White Rose resistance are consistently portrayed as defenders of 'democracy' and 'liberalism' rather than the devout Christian dissidents they actually were, Bonhoeffer has been recast as the sort of hero whom progressives can get behind. But it is the fierce faith of these resistance figures that should compel us and challenge us. Twenty-one-year-old Sophie Scholl uttered her parting words as she crossed the prison courtyard to the guillotine on February 22, 1943: ""Such a fine, sunny day, and I have to go. But how many must die on the battlefields, how many promising young men ... What does my death matter, if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?"" And then, just before the blade fell: ""God, you are my refuge into eternity."" Dietrich Bonhoeffer's last words as he faced the noose at the age of 39 were: ""This is the end--for me, the beginning of life.""",The European Conservative,2024-12-11T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/bonhoeffers-legacy/
Atheists Against Transgenderism: a Menshevik Revolution?,"Last month, three of the world's most prominent atheists abruptly resigned their honorary board positions with the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), an American non-profit organization founded in 1978 to advocate for atheists and agnostics and champion ""the separation of church and state."" Evolutionary biologists Jerry Coyne and Richard Dawkins and cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker all cited the ideological capture of the organization by the transgender movement. Jerry Coyne, a professor emeritus with the University of Chicago, was first. On December 26th, Coyne responded to a column by Kat Grant titled "" What is a Woman ?"" from November 7th, in which Grant concluded, with signature circularity: ""A woman is whoever she says she is."" In a response titled ""Biology is not bigotry"" on FRF's Freethought Now! blog, Coyne asserted that contrary to Kat's claims, ""the biological definition of 'woman' [is] based on gamete type."" Trans activists came for FFRF with a vengeance, and Coyne's column was pulled the following day, accompanied by a long, groveling apology titled "" Freedom From Religion Foundation supports LGBTQIA-plus rights ."" Co-presidents Dan Barker and Annie Gaylor painstakingly detailed the LGBT activism of their organization; condemned the enemies of the trans movement, both foreign and domestic, and concluded their struggle session by repudiating Coyne's views: Despite our best efforts to champion reason and equality, we recognize mistakes can happen, and this incident is a reminder of the importance of constant reflection and growth. Publishing this post was an error of judgment, and we have decided to remove it as it does not reflect our values or principles. We regret any distress caused by this post and are committed to ensuring it doesn't happen again...We stand firmly with the LGBTQIA-plus community and their allies in advocating for equality, dignity and the freedom to live without fear of religiously motivated discrimination. In response, Coyne published an open letter to his blog on December 29, resigning and accusing FRFF of ""censorious"" behaviour when he was ""simply promoting a biological rather than a psychological definition of sex, and I do not understand why you would consider that 'distressing' and also an attempt to hurt LGBTQIA+ people, which I would never do."" He noted that when he had emailed Annie Gaylor about his article being disappeared, he did not even receive the courtesy of a response. (Atheist Lawrence Krauss has republished the piece on his Substack.) Furthermore, Coyne added, the ""gender ideology which caused you to take down my article is itself quasi-religious, having many aspects of religions and cults, including dogma, blasphemy, belief in what is palpably untrue ('a woman is whoever she says she is'), apostasy, and a tendency to ignore science when it contradicts a preferred ideology."" Steven Pinker concurred, submitting his own resignation letter almost simultaneously , citing ""your decision, announced yesterday, to censor an article by fellow Board member Jerry Coyne, and to slander him as an opponent of LGBTQIA+ rights."" FRFF, Pinker stated, has become ""the imposer of a new religion, complete with dogma, blasphemy, and heretics."" Pinker added that the foundation ""has turned its back on reason"" and that Freethought Now! has become a ""sad joke."" Richard Dawkins resigned on December 29. ""Publishing the silly and unscientific 'What is a Woman' article by Kat Grant was a minor error of judgement, redeemed by the decision to publish a rebuttal by a distinguished scientist from the relevant field, namely Biology, Jerry Coyne,"" he wrote . ""But alas, the sequel was an act of unseemly panic when you caved in to hysterical squeals from predictable quarters and retrospectively censored that excellent rebuttal."" He added that to do so without even informing Coyne was ""an act of lamentable discourtesy."" It has been fascinating to watch the culture wars come to the atheist community. Dawkins has been tangling with trans activists for several years; in January 2024, he vehemently responded to an article defending gender ideology, stating: ""This ridiculous article (shame on the once-great Scientific American) ignorantly misunderstands the nature of the sex binary. ... Sex is not defined by chromosomes, nor by anatomy, nor by psychology or sociology, nor by personal inclination, nor by 'assignment at birth', but by gamete size."" He added archly: ""You may argue about 'gender' if you wish (biologists have better things to do) but sex is a true binary, one of rather few in biology."" In 2021, the American Humanist Association withdrew its ""humanist of the year award,"" which it had bestowed on Dawkins back in 1996, due to his ""history of making statements that use the guise of scientific discourse to demean marginalised groups, an approach antithetical to humanist values."" Pinker has similarly run afoul of transgender activist groups, who have carefully detailed his sins in online lists . While there is certainly schadenfreude in watching the sneering anti-theists discover that the New Atheist Apocalypse is just as dogmatic as the religions they despise, it must be noted that the very concept of ""humanist values"" has always been up for grabs. Science seeks to demonstrate what is; the idea of godless ethics is an entirely different question, and Dawkins, Coyne, and Pinker have been at the forefront of championing truly repulsive applications of practical atheism. In 2014, Dawkins responded to a woman asking about a prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis by telling her to : ""Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice."" He defended his advice by claiming it was ""very civilised"" and that ""I do not for one moment apologise for approaching moral philosophic questions in a logical way. There's a place for emotion & this isn't it."" In Dawkins' atheist ethics, it turns out, using abortion to eugenically destroy people with Down syndrome is both ""civilised"" and ""logical."" He did not explain why, especially considering the fact that a staggering 99% of people with Down syndrome report being ""happy with their lives."" There is no ""mercy"" in this killing--just an atheist's analysis of what their lives are worth. Stephen Pinker has gone further, writing in the New York Times that laws against infanticide are difficult to defend (one is tempted to add: at least, for atheists). According to Pinker, unborn children don't possess any more morally significant traits ""than mice do."" Jerry Coyne, for his part, has actually bemoaned that residual Christianity has prevented the legalization of ""the euthanasia of newborns, who have no ability or faculties to decide whether to end their lives,"" and stated that although ""the topic seems verboten now, I believe some day the practice will be widespread, and it will be for the better."" If we euthanize cats and dogs, he added, why not babies? Coyne, Pinker, and Dawkins are correct in their defence of the biological barricades against the transgender revolutionaries, but they have long championed the post-Christian society that made the transgender revolution possible, if not inevitable.Before social conservatives view these men as co-belligerents in defence of civilization, we should recognize that this atheist set might not be Bolsheviks, but they are Mensheviks--and their ""ethics"" are every bit as ugly as those they now oppose.",The European Conservative,2025-01-15T17:16:44,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/atheists-against-transgenderism-the-menshevik-revolution/
Europe Is on the Wrong Side of History,"Middle East, China, Russia, South America, Europe: The Trump earthquake has been felt in parliaments across the world. Every signature he scribbles on a piece of paper triggers a new tremor. Trump has the upper hand with some of them, as is the case with the European Union, whose official defiant stance towards the new president's policies is reckless, if not ridiculous. In October 2021, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and Joe Biden staged a transatlantic reunion after strained relations with Trump. ""The United States and the EU are entering a new era of transatlantic cooperation,"" the then-president said. The two announced an agreement on steel and aluminum import tariffs as ""a major step forward in bilateral relations"" and in the ""fight against climate change."" Since then, the United States and the EU have been moving in the same direction: total fidelity to the Sustainable Development Goals, decarbonization and environmentalism, globalism, and the implementation of woke policies. So it came as no surprise that, three years after that agreement, Joe Biden quietly endorsed von der Leyen's candidacy for re-election as head of the European Commission. The arrival of Trump has put the brakes on this heartwarming friendship. The majority groups in the European Parliament, both the social democrats and the center-right, have made no secret of their sympathies towards the Democrats and their fear that the Republican would return to the White House. They have been preparing for that eventuality for months, intent on softening the blows and seeking out ways of agreement. Now that the moment has arrived and we have heard the positions of both sides, one thing is clear: they have not prepared well. A few weeks ago in Paris, German Chancellor Scholz and French President Macron called for European unity in the face of Trump. Macron called for a ""united, strong and sovereign Europe,"" ""which also knows how to assert its own interests and defend them with its values and with European instruments."" But 'their' Europe no longer exists. They speak as if Europe were an exception in the right-wing current that has swept first Argentina, and then the United States. Moreover, none of the European leaders defending this stance is particularly popular at the moment. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni's right wing is shining and nobody remembers the Left; in France, Marine Le Pen's party won the last elections and only a last-minute alliance of progressives and centrists prevented the National Assembly from falling into her hands; in Germany, in AfD won regional elections, becoming the first right-wing party to do so since the Second World War; in Austria, the same thing happened--a historic right-wing triumph--and similar news came from Hungary and Belgium. What do these heterogeneous right-wing parties have in common? The same thing they have in common with Trump: emphasis on national sovereignty, war on wokeism, curbing immigration, ending globalism, and shutting down climate policies. Perhaps that is why Scholz', Macron's, and von der Leyen's vain stance is so grotesque, trying to keep afloat a woke edifice that very few dare to defend in public. Instead of hedging their bets, they boast a united Europe that no longer exists. The fragmentation in the European Parliament is greater than ever, and Javier Milei's speech denouncing European leaders for having sold the sovereignty of their peoples for well-dressed but essentially socialist and anti-freedom ideas still rings in the ears of very influential EU bodies such as the World Economic Forum WEF. The paragon of the disconnection of European leaders from reality can be found in the President of Spain, the socialist Pedro Sanchez. Cornered by corruption, and with his international prestige at rock bottom, Sanchez took advantage of his speech at the WEF to criticize ""the techno-billionaires who want to do away with democracy"", alluding to Elon Musk and the other tech gurus who attended Trump's inauguration, pointing to them as part of a supposed ""ultra-right-wing international"" that dominates social networks. To cap it all, he offered to lead the European resistance to the advancing 'far right' in the U.S. How could a lame duck from a disgraced European nation stand up to a Trump who is stronger than ever? With a heavy dose of irony, when a Spanish journalist asked Trump about Spain's relations with the new administration, the president asked, ""Are you a BRICS nation? Is Spain a BRICS?"" alluding to the alternative to the G7 founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Trump then threatened BRICS with a 100% tariff. In Europe, media headlines suggested Trump had mistaken Spain for one of the BRICS nations, but it is more likely that he was consciously threatening the Spanish social-communist government, forcing it to decide whether it wants to be friends with the likes of Maduro or Lula da Silva, or with Western democracies. In fact, he then went on to remind that Spain's defense spending is insufficient, showing that he knew exactly what he was talking about, even if that was all he had in mind about Spain. The WEF is demonstrating that the free world is in full transformation, with two opposing poles: those who bet on cooperation while maintaining sovereignty, Western values, and freedom, and those who blindly follow the entelechy of woke globalism, the virus of cancellation, multiculturalism without law, or climate demands that are bankrupting European farmers with extreme regulations and then importing cheaper products from Africa or India without any environmental control. Maybe someone should tell Macron, Scholz, von der Leyen, and of course Sanchez that they will disappear before Trump does and that their policies are not going to outlive them. Trump already knows this and is waiting for them to figure it out before he sits down to talk.",The European Conservative,2025-02-20T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/europe-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history/
10 Years After the Terror Attacks Denmark Still Needs a Harsh Reality-Check ,"In a few weeks, it will be 10 years since the terrorist attacks on the Krudttonden Cultural Center and the Krystalgade Synagogue in the Danish royal capital. The attacks followed a month after the terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo editorial office in Paris. While the anniversary of the latter received appropriate international headlines, the Danish event deserves its own observance. On February 14th and 15th, 2015, two unarmed Danish citizens were killed when Copenhagen was hit by two consecutive terrorist attacks perpetrated by the same person--a 22-year-old man of Palestinian descent, born in Denmark. First, the Lars Vilks Society's panel discussion ""Art, blasphemy, and freedom of expression,"" held at Copenhagen's Krudttonden Cultural Center and cafe, was interrupted by gunfire from the terrorist's semi-automatic weapon. Lars Vilks , a Swedish cartoonist who since 2007 had faced numerous death threats for caricaturing the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was one of the speakers. While Vilks was whisked away by security, film director Finn Norgaard--a member of the liberal Social Democrats, who actively contributed to suppressing freedom of expression in the cultural sector--shot dead and three police officers were injured. Some nine hours later, the terrorist proceeded to a synagogue in Krystalgade in central Copenhagen, where a bat mitzvah was underway, attended by numerous children. During this attack, a volunteer synagogue guard was killed and two police officers injured. The reaction from the official authorities in Denmark in the wake of the attack can be summarized as follows: The unthinkable has happened. A peaceful little country, a model democracy, has been hit by terror. Two innocent civilians are dead. One for freedom of speech, the other for defending his community. They are heroes. The police and intelligence services have done their work selflessly and admirably. We are determined to stand up for our values. We insist on protecting our freedom. We stand shoulder to shoulder. Muslims, Jews, Christians (in that order). We stand together as Danes. It is important to emphasize that posterity's memory of the terrorist attack relies on weightless, shallow statements like the ones above rather than on facts. Because tidy falsehoods pose a bigger obstacle to facing the truth than outright repression, we ought to revisit the events of February 14-15, 2015, and expose how their memory has been distorted for political ends. First of all--Denmark was not hit by terror out of the blue. In 1985, two firebombs exploded in Copenhagen, at the American Airlines office and a synagogue. One person was killed and 27 others injured in the attack carried out by a Palestinian terror cell based in Sweden. In 2005, Jyllands-Posten 's publication of the Muhammad cartoons had shaken Denmark and the world, an unprecedented event that drove another nail in the coffin of freedom of expression in the West. Ironically, the cartoons were all about freedom of expression, criticism of Islam, and self-censorship. The publication of the 12 caricatures of Muhammad was followed by protests, diplomatic demands from Muslim countries, death threats to the cartoonists, and violent riots around the world. Then, a decade of threats and thwarted attacks and assassination plots by Islamists followed, primarily aimed at cartoonist Kurt Westergaard and Jyllands-Posten . In January 2015, Islamists murdered 13 people in the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. Yet, a month later, when the Copenhagen terrorist struck, Danish police and intelligence services appeared unprepared. At the time of the incidents, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was Minister of Justice and bore the political responsibility for the police's decision to remove the armed guard from the Krudttonden at the Lars Vilks event. When one of the wounded intelligence agents was asked about the reason for removing the armed guard, he said if they hadn't, ""we would just have just lost a few colleagues"". After the shooting at Krudttonden, the Jewish Community contacted the intelligence services for help. It took about three hours before the police sent two officers to the synagogue--officers who had not had any firearms training for over a year and a half. The killing of the guard at the synagogue could have been avoided if the terrorist had been stopped immediately. Justice Minister Mette Frederiksen and Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt in the wake of the attack both said that they had sent reinforcements to the synagogue right after the first shooting--a brazen lie on live television. An apology from the highest political levels would be a step in the right direction toward healing the wounds. The role and responsibility of Danish police have never been investigated but rely solely on their own account of events. The terrorist, who before the attack was serving a prison sentence, was known by the Prison and Probation Service to have been radicalized during his prison term. After his release, he obtained the semi-automatic weapon used in the attacks 14 days later. What about the bereaved families? How does the Danish State support the victims' relatives? Danish law is very reluctant to compensate victims of terrorism. This led to the 2015 creation of the Finn Noregaard Association (in memory of the victim of the Krudttonden terror attack), which fights for other relevant cases too. This includes compensation for journalist Daniel Ryge, who in 2013-14 was held hostage for 13 months in Syria and whose family had to raise the DKK 10 million ransom, and the family of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, who was beheaded by Islamists in Morocco in 2018. The association's second purpose, as stated in its statutes, is ""in Finn's spirit to promote human understanding and dialogue among disadvantaged children and youth."" This is a euphemistic way of saying that the Association is working on a voluntary basis to prevent Muslim youth from Islamist radicalization by offering multicultural programs, seminars, and so on. The association also awards prizes and grants to volunteers with successful initiatives. Ironically, in 2024, the Finn Norgaard Award was given to volunteers at the controversial Kaershovedgard deportation centre. The centre houses rejected asylum seekers who have been convicted of a serious crime or are considered a danger to Denmark's security. In July 2024, eight people convicted of terrorism were living at Kaershovedgard. What is the justification for doing humanitarian work with terrorists waiting to be deported from Denmark? Why spend resources on criminals who reject everything the West offers them--except free welfare? And what sort of useful message could such a naive humanism send to a Danish society that has been led to embrace unreciprocated altruism towards the ""New Danes"" and the image of multicultural society for decades? The upcoming 10th anniversary of the double terrorist attack in Copenhagen in February 2025 may offer insights intothese questions, at least in terms of rhetoric. Will collective memory once again be dulled by sentimental phrases about ""love triumphing over hatred"" and ""solidarity overcoming division""? If so, it will perfectly reflect the post-traumatic syndrome of Western societies, which lulls vigilance into narcissistic complacency and cowardly self-abandonment. Only time will tell.",The European Conservative,2025-01-27T11:34:47,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/10-years-after-the-terror-attacks-denmark-still-needs-a-harsh-reality-check/
French Prime Minister François Bayrou: Portrait of an Eternal Centrist,"After a series of false alarms and final adjustments, the appointment of Francois Bayrou as prime minister and head of the French government to replace Michel Barnier was confirmed by the Elysee on Friday, December 13th, shortly after noon. The president has chosen someone who is very well known to the French--an old hand in politics and one of his long-standing supporters. The Left has called for immediate censure, while the RN is reserving its judgment. The prime minister's announcement was due to be made on the evening of Thursday, December 12th, when Emmanuel Macron returned from his trip to Poland, but the head of state preferred to take his time. Only the names of putative candidates who had turned down the post, such as former defence and foreign affairs minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who considered himself too old for the job, were leaked to the press. Bayrou was received by Macron at 8:30 a.m. on Friday for a very long meeting, which some sources say was stormy and tense. The president is said to have offered him the job of number two in the government, with a left-leaning former Macron minister, Roland Lescure, as number one. Bayrou refused, prompting an initially reluctant Macron to finally entrust him with the reins of power. A whim? Perhaps. This is the final grand-guignolesque episode in this haphazard race for prime minister organised by a haggard and bewildered France. Once again, the influence of the Rassemblement National may have weighed in the balance. Lescure is known to be violently hostile to the RN, and Marine Le Pen's party had unofficially let it be known that he would be censured if chosen. Bayrou has been a fixture in French politics for decades--so those expecting a 'surprise' from Macron will be in for a surprise. He has served many times as a minister and has stood several times in the presidential election at the head of a centrist formation, the UDF, which has since become the MoDem ( Mouvement Democrate ). In 2007, he even emerged as the 'third man,' with more than 18% of the vote in the first round. At legislative elections, the very modest electoral weight of his party has never prevented him from being present on numerous occasions in majorities--mainly on the Right--by virtue of that well-known French 'centrist privilege' whereby groups with a minority of votes have a political role that is out of all proportion to their real importance. Bayrou can in many ways be considered a pure product of the dominant system, and it is not for nothing that he has been a near-constant supporter of Macron since the latter came to power. He is a convinced Europeanist, federalist version. Academician Maurice Druon, one of the most brilliant writers of his time, said of him in 2004: Mr. Francois Bayrou, a secondary character and destined to remain so, is remarkable only for his perseverance in harming France's highest interests. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bayrou spoke out in favour of compulsory vaccination, which earned him a certain amount of animosity from the French, who were reluctant to have health policies they had not chosen imposed on them. His centrist concern to be above partisan quarrels is reminiscent of the ' en meme temps' (at the same time) of the president who now calls on him. His stints in government have not left lasting memories: a lot of talk, little action. But he has, on a number of occasions, played an original role in the little theatre of French political life. This is primarily due to his origin and temperament. He comes from the southwest of France, was for many years mayor of the town of Pau in the Pyrenees, and takes a certain pride in his local roots, even though he doesn't have an accent. Bayrou is a fervent and regular visitor to the shrine at Lourdes. He claims to be a practising Catholic. An anecdote about him is circulating in the press rooms: the Blessed Virgin would once have told him personally that he would end up in the Elysee Palace. Not everyone can say that! While waiting for the Elysee, here he is at Matignon. As a Catholic, he is opposed to the latest legislative developments aimed at introducing euthanasia in France. ""Let's not create a public service to give death,"" he declared in the spring of 2023 in the columns of Le Figaro . Now that he is in charge, will he stick to this line, or will he give in to win the good graces of the Left? A year earlier, he had also expressed scepticism about the inclusion of the right to abortion in the constitution, deeming it ""pointless"" and a low priority. This ' vieille France ' side--it would be an exaggeration to go so far as to describe him as 'conservative'--came to the fore with vigour during the 2002 presidential election campaign. Visiting a market in Strasbourg, he slapped a boy who was picking his pocket in front of the cameras. He did this without the slightest hesitation, expressing the belief that France lacked authority at all levels. This anecdotal and ephemeral episode earned him a temporary surge in popularity. The final point to his credit is his constant concern for the debt which, for a very long time, he was one of the few French politicians to systematically highlight in his political analyses. This is probably one of the reasons why Emmanuel Macron chose him--more than the slap or the Holy Virgin, of course. Today, the task ahead of him is more than arduous. Resignation, without enthusiasm, greeted his appointment. His 'ability to adapt' is praised, a disguised way of saying that he has no ideas to displease anyone. He is seen as ' the man for the job ', but for how long? The left-wing coalition has already announced that it will not wait and will trigger a motion of censure against him. But without the support of the RN, this motion has no chance of passing. And the RN is reserving judgement--for the time being. There is no ""Pavlovian reflex"" of censure in the RN, said MP Sebastien Chenu, scoffing at the hysteria of the La France Insoumise party in the process. Le Pen's party is waiting to judge Francois Bayrou's programme on the key issues of the budget, of course, but also immigration and public safety, which have never been his strong points. Le Pen's welcome to the announcement of his appointment was couched in the form of a warning: ""We are asking him to do what his predecessor was unwilling to do: listen to and hear the opposition in order to construct a reasonable and considered budget. Any other policy that would simply be an extension of Macronism, twice rejected at the ballot box, could only lead to deadlock and failure."" Apres de longues tergiversations, le president de la Republique a decide de nommer Francois Bayrou a Matignon. Soucieux de l'imperieuse necessite de proteger les Francais, nous lui demandons d'entreprendre ce que son predecesseur n'a pas voulu faire : entendre et ecouter les... In passing, it should be noted that Francois Bayrou and his party were the subject of legal proceedings very similar to those currently being brought against the RN in the European parliamentary assistants affair. Bayrou was eventually acquitted --a reason for the RN to remain cautious and watchful.",The European Conservative,2024-12-13T14:33:09,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/french-prime-minister-francois-bayrou-portrait-of-an-eternal-centrist/
Curing Trans Delusion: “Gynecologists Are Trained To Treat WOMEN’s Genitals”,"A French gynecologist has been suspended from practicing medicine for one month and penalized with an additional five months of probation by the French Medical Council for declining to treat a 26-year-old man who identifies as a woman. In August 2023, a trans-identifying man and his partner showed up at Dr. Victor Acharian's office in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques in the Pau region of southwestern France. Acharian, naturally, treats only women, and after several moments, his secretary told the man that Acharian wouldn't see him. ""I told her that I'm not competent, but I can guide you,"" Acharian explained . ""I can refer you to services that can take better care of you. But after I said that, things went south."" The prospective patient began to insult the staff, yelling ""You're transphobic!"" at Acharian, and stormed out with his partner, who left a Google review stating: ""It was my trans partner's first appointment. He refused to see her, his secretary threw us out coldly. I advise against [visiting]. Never again."" Acharian responded in an attempt to defend himself: SIR, I am a gynecologist, and I take care of real women. I have no skills to take care of MEN, even if they have shaved their beards and come to tell my secretary that they [have] become women. My GYNECOLOGICAL examination table is not suitable for examining men. You have specialized and very competent services to take care of men like you. Thank you for informing TRANS people to never come for consultation with me. The trans-identifying man promptly sent a complaint to Conseil National de l'Ordre des Medecins (CNOM)--the regulatory body that oversees the medical profession in France--and the LGBT activist organization SOS Homophobie released a statement, tagging the French Minister of Equality between Women and Men and the Fight against Discrimination Berangere Couillard: ""We denounce the transphobic and discriminatory remarks of gynaecologist Victor Acharian in Pau. Transphobia is a reality with serious consequences, particularly in access to health. It affects the entire territory."" The tactic worked. Acharian was summoned to appear before the disciplinary board of the French Medical Council on December 16th, 2024, where he was suspended from practice for the month of March, with an additional five-month probation. He was warned that if he ""engaged in transphobia"" or similarly denied treatment to a trans-identifying male during that period, he would be further disciplined. Acharian's insistence that he lacked the expertise to treat such patients was ignored. Acharian noted that he'd never had a ""transgender"" patient before and pointed out, with a hint of plaintive defiance, that: ""Just because it's a cavity doesn't mean it's a classic vagina."" Reduxx noted that Acharian had previously responded similarly to a one-star review with the statement: ""Dear Sir. I do not know you. You cannot know me, since I am a gynecologist, and I only treat women. As for your political militancy, that does not concern me."" Acharian, like so many other ordinary citizens targeted by the transgender movement's attempts to conform society to their ideology and force collective compliance, found out the hard way that trans militancy very much does concern him. Edouard Martial, the lawyer for the spurned trans-identifying man gloated about his suspension: ""We are pleased to have confirmation that what happened that day was totally abnormal."" The suspension and probation weren't enough for SOS Homophobie, which suggested that his actions were ""also punishable by criminal sanctions."" As Reduxx reported, trans activists have frequently been willing to work outside the law to accomplish their ends, as well. Feminist activist Marguerite Stern came to Acharian's defence, writing on X: ""Gynecologists are trained to treat WOMEN's genitals. Not inverted penises or cavities created using pieces of colon or peritoneum. We live in a world of lunatics."" She has experienced the wrath of the transgender movement first-hand. Stern is the co-author, along with journalist Dora Motout, of Transmania: Investigation into the Abuses of Transgender Ideology , published last year. In an interview with europeanconservative.com , Motout told me that it has become dangerous to oppose transgender ideology in France. ""We gave a conference at Assas University in Paris [in June 2024], and we had 15 police buses to protect us,"" she told me. ""Hundreds of people were chanting 'A TERF, a bullet, social justice!' in front of us. It was impossible to enter the university. The police had to help us find another entrance. I also had to move out of my home because I received death threats."" While some European countries are quietly dropping plans to implement the transgender agenda--both the UK and the Netherlands recently scrapped ""self-identification"" policies--France is thus far defying the trend. Since 2017, trans-identifying people can change their legal gender without any surgical or medical intervention (although they must still undergo a court process). So-called ""conversion therapy,"" which could include counselling to assist gender dysphoric individuals to become comfortable in their own bodies, was banned in 2022. Discrimination based on ""gender identity"" has been illegal since 2012, with ""transphobia"" being recognized as an ""aggravating circumstance"" in crimes in 2017, and further training for law enforcement to combat ""discrimination"" against LGBT people in 2023. There have been a few glimmers of sanity on the horizon. In 2021, an open letter condemning ""sex reassignment"" for children was signed by more than 50 medical professionals and prominent academics, including doctors, legal experts, educational experts, philosophers, sociologists, psychiatrists, judges, and psychoanalysts, and published on the L'Express website. In 2022 the National Academy of Medicine highlighted the potential health risks of sex change ""treatments"" for minors, and advised both extreme caution and thorough psychological support before such treatments commence. Dr. Victor Acharian has the right to appeal his suspension but has not yet decided if he will do so.",The European Conservative,2025-02-18T20:33:46,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/curing-trans-delusion-gynecologists-are-trained-to-treat-womens-genitals/
The Revenge of the Mediocre,"We should not underestimate how mortified Keir Starmer and his team of cosmopolitan trendies feel to be governing a country like Britain. Born in 1962, Starmer belongs to a tradition of left-wing politics infused with the adolescent spirit of that decade. The activism is less about public-spirited concern for the working man than a matter of viewing the past, in all its givenness, as a prison to which progressive politics is the escape key. For such people, leadership of Britain generates a special kind of embarrassment, owing to the fact that throughout our history we have managed to pull off being free and humane without ever falling seriously for the cult of progress. We are talking, after all, about an hereditary kingdom with an established church, an imperial state crown, and a healthy suspicion of codified constitutions. Despite Tony Blair's deliberate vandalism, much of this remains and much of the rest can be restored. As of yet, we have suffered no wholesale break with our past. I suspect that Starmer, if he had the interior life required to entertain such fantasies, would much prefer to be French or American. Such juvenile politics can motivate all sorts of day-to-day decisions, from gift-wrapping the Chagos Islands for a CCP ally to removing portraits of grey-whiskered statesmen from government offices to make way for the likes of Ellen Wilkinson, a founding member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. ""Change""--the glib reason given for Rachel Reeves's move to swap a Nigel Lawson photograph for one of this socialist boss girl--becomes its own justification. Indeed, upon becoming the first female chancellor of the exchequer, Reeves vowed to replace all the wall-art in the No. 11 Downing Street state room with paintings either ""of a woman or by a woman."" Rather than revering the office they have joined, it is typical of such activists to spite the heritage of the institutions from which they feel history has hitherto excluded them. I struggle to shake the suspicion that they would not be so petulant unless they feared deep down that such exclusion, at least in their own cases, may have been warranted. Margaret Thatcher had enough self-belief to avoid any urge to pretend that Pitt the Younger and William Gladstone were not great men. It is in the light of Reeves's callow, small-minded bitterness that the Labour government's reported desire to ship the Elgin Marbles back to Greece should be understood. According to Craig Simpson, Arts Editor at The Telegraph , the government is actively looking for loopholes opened up by the 2022 Charities Act that may enable them to return the artefacts--a move otherwise forbidden by laws stemming from the British Museum Act of 1963. We might have assumed that such technicalities would be thanked as a saving grace: any government that is unable or unwilling to make a moral case for keeping the marbles in Britain can at least see off the Greek demand for repatriation by taking refuge in legal arcana. This was the successful, if somewhat unheroic, strategy pursued by the Tories while in office. The extraordinary thing about Starmer's approach is that, without any fresh pressure whatsoever, he is going out of his way to raid our national museum of the jewel in its world-beating collection. The modern state of Greece has no meaningful diplomatic weight to throw around. The British government's hand has not been forced. It is a blatant case of petty vandalism, motivated by the same cringing, half-educated embarrassment at our past that prompted the feeble Chagos agreement and Reeves's decorative crusade against the glares of her more accomplished predecessors. None of this is to scoff at the desire of Greeks or anyone else to see the sculptures reunited with the Acropolis of which they were once a part. Though I do not accept it, there is an aesthetic case for restitution. What is especially revealing about Labour's search for a legislative loophole is that it would permit museums to dispose of artefacts in their care if the trustees feel they have a ""moral obligation"" to do so. In other words, the government views the case for returning the marbles to Athens as ethical, not aesthetic. This lends a quality of self-abasement to what could otherwise be an interesting debate about cultural treasures and their curation. After all, what form can this ""moral obligation"" take if not an apologetic acknowledgement that the British Museum has been hoarding stolen goods for two centuries and will continue to be a beneficiary of unconscionable theft until the marbles are returned to their rightful owner? The historical record does not support this account of how the marbles came to reside in Britain. Between 1801 and 1812, Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin and for a brief time Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, devoted much effort to removing many of the sculptures around the Parthenon--then, like the rest of Greece, under Turkish control--and shipping them to England. Far from donning a balaclava and snatching them in the dead of night, Elgin acquired multiple forms of legal title from the governing Turks at a time when the local Greek population, for whatever reason, had been content to watch the gems clustered around the Acropolis fall into disrepair. Elgin was of the view that, rather than wasting away, the sculptures would be better off adorning a private museum that he was in the process of putting together. After a series of financial headaches, Elgin instead sold the marbles to the British Museum, where they have remained for over two centuries--longer than the modern Greek state, arising in 1828, has existed. And even then, it was not until 1983 that the government of Greece put in a formal demand to have the artefacts returned. The aesthetic case, hinging on the value of artistic unity, suffers more through practicalities than a failure of principle. It would do the sculptures lasting damage to be released into the open Mediterranean air. If returned, they would therefore not be reattached to the Parthenon but displayed in the neighbouring Acropolis Museum. It follows that we are dealing not with a case for restorative unity so much as geographical proximity, which seems pointless. Nevertheless, to make a reparative rather than an aesthetic pitch for returning the marbles to Athens necessarily casts aspersions on Elgin and the wholly legitimate manner in which he acquired and transferred them. By extension, arguments with this moralising zeal also serve to condemn Britain herself as a longstanding enabler and beneficiary of cultural theft. Since none of this is accurate, it is often remarked by the opponents of restitution that caving to Greek demands would mean surrendering our role as a custodian of world-historical cultures to a petty form of nationalism that is both possessive and light on detail. While this is true, we risk doing the case too much credit by viewing it only from the Greek perspective. The real marvel is that so many in our own ruling class, from George Osborne to Keir Starmer, are committed to applauding in Greeks the very sentiments they attack in us, when we dare to express them, as small-minded, reactionary, atavistic. They are driven by a calculation that if they cannot be as great as our historic rulers they can at least be more morally preening. They are less embarrassed about inheriting the British Museum than they are troubled by the knowledge they could never have built it. Most of all, they find little comfort in the suggestion that their forebears may pride themselves on no more than a self-serving monument to the accomplishments of other civilisations. This is because they are well aware that, by creating such museums and achieving much else besides in the days when Britain bestrode the world, our ancestors secured for themselves a solid place alongside the most trailblazing heroes of classical antiquity. As this government racks up more and more blunders, they will only be further tempted to revenge themselves upon our past, so intimidating are its glories.",The European Conservative,2024-12-12T07:00:00,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/the-revenge-of-the-mediocre/
New French Sex Ed Plan Opens Gate to Gender Ideology,"The arrival of the Bayrou government in office coincided with the accelerated implementation of a new, openly militant sex education programme in French schools, completely excluding parents from the process. Despite the mobilisation of parents' associations, there is no indication that the Ministry of Education intends to back down. All the indicators are red ; the skill level of young French children is plummeting year after year; the basics--reading, writing, arithmetic--are not mastered by the time they start secondary school; but the stated priority of the Ministry of Education is ""relational, sexual and emotional"" education. The new sex education curriculum has been in the works for almost two years. The project was created on the initiative of former Education Minister Pap Ndiaye, known for his militant progressivism, who made it one of his priorities. An initial version , made public in December 2024 by the previous government, raised concerns among parents and family associations. Even the then-minister for school success, Alexandre Portier, expressed his reservations at the time--before being pilloried by the press and teachers' unions for being too conservative . In the meantime, the government fell apart. Portier was not reappointed to his post, and a new minister of education arrived in the person of Elisabeth Borne, former prime minister. The learning framework has been reworked--and the changes made do nothing to correct the flaws already observed in the previous version. 35,000 people had signed a petition calling for a revision of the text. They were not heard, and the Higher Council for Education ( Conseil superieur de l'education ) has just definitively validated an extremely worrying curriculum, which is to be applied in all French schools from the next school year--whether they are state schools or private ones under contract with the state. A symbolic and particularly revealing element sets the tone for the spirit in which the course of study was conceived. Parents were supposed to be informed in advance of the ""education in emotional, relational and sexual life"" ( Education a la vie affective, relationnelle et sexuelle , or EVARS) sessions, but this clause has been removed. The refusal to inform parents about what their children will be told shows that the forces behind the development of this programme know full well that it is a militant tool that does not respect the basic principles of healthy pedagogical neutrality on highly sensitive subjects. The stated objectives were to strengthen equality between men and women, to combat violence, and to raise awareness of harassment from an early age. But the means used are clearly inappropriate, even counterproductive. The Syndicat de la famille (Family Union), an offshoot of the La Manif Pour Tous movement formed at the time of the adoption of same-sex marriage, has carried out an in-depth analysis of the course outline . The fight against gender inequality is transformed, from nursery school onwards, into a systematic deconstruction of images of the feminine and masculine in young children: ""on the obviously laudable grounds of equality, the fight against gender stereotypes is omnipresent from nursery school onwards, in the form of a systematic challenge to all the mental representations that children may have of the feminine and masculine,"" the Family Union's report laments. Despite the protests of the curriculum's editors--for whom ""gender theory does not exist""--pride of place is given to an ideology which deliberately disconnects sex and gender, to make students think that gender (i.e., the social and cultural expression of sexual identity) is totally independent of sex (biological). Beyond its practical recommendations, the teaching plan claims to fight against extremely serious problems currently blighting childhood and the adult world--sexual violence, harassment--but is unable to produce an alternative positive discourse that allows young people in the process of developing their personality to envision positive and inspiring values. Nothing on the couple, nothing on motherhood, nothing on fatherhood. The programme prides itself on considering relationships not only in sexual terms but also in 'relational and emotional' terms but is reluctant to connect love and sexuality--a necessarily retrograde vision in the eyes of its writers--not to mention the connection between love, sexuality, and family. The document reveals the total and systematic evacuation of any form of morality. Thus, the notion of consent, so beloved of the progressive Left and brought to the fore by the ""#me too"" movement, is reduced to a banal dichotomy: I want to / I don't want to--without any reflection on the merits of the act, for oneself, for the other, or on the harmony to be sought between the body and the heart. This sketches a sad and dreary landscape where depression and suicide attempts among young people can boom . If no one speaks to them seriously and no one cares about offering them an inspiring ideal and a real prospect of fulfilment, how can we be surprised? The scourge of pornography , which does so much damage to teenagers and children alike--and at an increasingly early age--is totally underestimated, because here again, a firm condemnation of its ravages implies the integration of a moral reflection. We now know full well that children as young as primary school age are already being exposed to pornography, but the curriculum does not address this until the 4th year (13-year-olds), with a guilty shyness. Let us be logical: moral safeguards cannot be put in place when those behind the instructional content claim to be 'taboo-free' and advocate unbridled sexual liberation--which gives rise to the very ills they claim to be fighting. Finally, we note the predictable but oh-so-dangerous complacency towards transgenderism and gender transition among young people: nothing on the dangers of puberty blockers, nothing on the risks of hormone intake and gender reassignment surgery. If gender has nothing to do with biology, then anything goes, and information on these subjects will, unsurprisingly, be left in the hands of duly blessed militant associations and authorized and recommended by the Ministry of National Education. A curriculum of similar substance has already been implemented in French-speaking Belgium. Four administrative appeals for the annulment of the educational plan are pending before the Belgian constitutional court. In France, teachers' unions are crying out against the "" fundamentalist offensive "" protesting the new plan. In terms of fundamentalism, it is simply a matter of recalling Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.""",The European Conservative,2025-02-19T10:36:46,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/new-french-sex-ed-plan-opens-gate-to-gender-ideology/
From ‘Right To Die’ to ‘Duty To Die?’,"Few recent pieces of British legislation have proved as controversial as the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. Despite assisted suicide being decisively rejected by parliament multiple times in past years (including by 330-118 votes in 2015), Leadbeater has pushed on with her bill in the face of mounting opposition. The bill was published only days before its second reading and one of its supposedly ""robust"" safeguards was a requirement for sign-off from a High Court judge for each individual case. For many MPs, who were denied the chance to take more time over this life-and-death issue, this so-called 'safeguard' was central to its appeal, and they saw judicial oversight as a vital check. Now, in a remarkable turn of events, Ms. Leadbeater has proposed removing this requirement--one she once considered a unique protection. Instead, a three-member panel, chaired by a senior lawyer or retired judge and including a social worker and a psychiatrist, would approve each case. The broader concerns with the bill are well known: the impossibility of accurately detecting coercion, the disproportionate impact on the vulnerable, the problems with predicting life expectancy, the one-sided approach to hearing real concerns from parliamentarians during the committee stage, and the dramatic escalation of assisted deaths we have seen in other countries with similar regimes. Its critics, including cabinet ministers, a former Chief Coroner, a former President of the Family Division of the High Court, palliative care professionals, and disability rights groups all spoke out. The new approach signals the bill's 'direction of travel.' Even Leadbeater seems to tacitly admit this in the rhetorical flourish of calling this new model 'Judge Plus.' With this amendment, there would be no requirement for a judge to play any role. Just a few months ago, the necessity of a High Court judge's involvement was touted as the key factor that differentiated this bill from other assisted dying frameworks. Those promoting it on television and in Parliament assured the public that this safeguard was critical for protecting the vulnerable. Now, that very safeguard is being scrapped. If the supposed ""most robust"" protection can be thrown out so easily, what will be next to go? Indeed, this continual expansion of the criteria and relaxation of the rules is exactly what the bill's opponents have warned of.To those of us who have spent time looking at similar laws overseas, this isn't surprising. It's the direction of travel of every single jurisdiction that has legalized the intentional ending of life. And the laws in those countries now look strikingly similar to the British bill. This is not my first interaction with a death approval panel. I represented Tom Mortier at the European Court of Human Rights after his physically healthy 64-year-old mother was euthanized in Belgium for what doctors deemed ""incurable depression."" In that case, the Court ruled that Belgium had violated her right to life, specifically because of concerns about the panel and process through which her euthanasia was deemed lawful. The court cited a lack of robust accountability and conflicts of interest. The committee set up to vet euthanasia requests, composed almost entirely of pro-euthanasia figures, functioned more like a rubber stamp than a meaningful safeguard. This should not be surprising. In Belgium--as in the UK--only those inclined to support assisted suicide are likely to volunteer or be appointed, leading to a small echo chamber. Moreover, the opportunity for a small panel, sitting alone in a room, with a stack of paperwork to understand someone's motivations, the assumptions of their treating doctor, and the coercion they may be experiencing is--at best--very limited. Or take it from those who have served on these panels. Professor Theo Boer sat on a Dutch euthanasia review panel, reviewing 4,000 cases. In his 2023 evidence to Parliament, he concluded: Like those currently arguing for a change in the law in Great Britain, I once believed it was possible to regulate and restrict killing to terminally ill mentally competent adults with less than six months [to live]. ... Moreover, by taking this bold step I believed we could regulate suicide and death in this way that would curtail those all too familiar cases where someone ends their own life. I was wrong. Meanwhile, in Belgium, Dr Ludo Vanopdenbosch, a neurologist who was a member of the euthanasia commission for several years, resigned with a scathing letter. He highlighted a case in which he considered other members not 'stretching' the law but 'breaking' it before charging the rest of the panel to secrecy. He ultimately concluded that the panel was ""neither independent nor objective."" How many more examples do we need before concluding these are not isolated cases but inherent to this approach? The real task of these panels is not in comprehensively reviewing requests and safeguarding the vulnerable, but giving an air of legitimacy to the kind of paper review a former senior High Court judge has already told us is essentially impossible. The bill basically now looks like every other euthanasia bill around the world. Leadbeater was quick to try and differentiate her bill because of the stories coming out of places like Canada - where a 27-year-old with Autism and ADHD was approved for 'MAID', and Belgium where the youngest person to be euthanized was just 9 years old , and Oregon where more than 43% of people seeking lethal drugs expressed the concern that they were ""a burden on family, friends/caregivers."" At a societal level, the 'right to die' quickly becomes a 'duty to die'. And countless people are left in its wake. Apart from the immediate victims, including the elderly and the vulnerable, there are family members and friends left behind; medical professionals required to play some role; and now social workers, too, are being implicated. To the extent this bill occupied any high ground, it has ceded it. It now joins the ranks of other bills that have delivered the outcomes from which Leadbeater was so keen to put some distance. Her amendment indicates that the bill is floundering. Itl is not as thought-through as Dignity in Dying's marketing push would have us believe. If something so central to the bill's promise of ""robust checks"" can be dropped at this stage, it underscores just how fragile the entire framework really is. And that should give those concerned about protecting the vulnerable hope. This bill can and should be stopped. Rather than forcing this defective bill through, Parliament must recognize the legitimate concerns, lament the defective process through which its proponents are rushing to try to address them, and reject the text. The warning signs could not be clearer. And the stakes could not be higher.",The European Conservative,2025-02-17T19:22:33,COMMENTARY,Commentary,https://europeanconservative.com/articles/commentary/end-of-life-bill-uk-euthanasia-europe-canada-no-safeguards/
