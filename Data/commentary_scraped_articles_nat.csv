Who is legally responsible for climate harms? The worldâ€™s top court will now decide,"It bears repeating over and over: the science is not in question. High concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are warming the planet. International law is also clear: under the legally binding Paris climate agreement, nations pledged to keep average temperatures within 1.5 degC of pre-industrial levels. And yet, as emissions continue to increase, global temperature rises will almost certainly exceed this limit . The research community is frustrated that its warnings are not being heeded. What is the point of a legally binding agreement if countries can effectively ignore it? Some scientists are arguing that climate researchers need to become climate activists, too 1 , 2 . But others, and more than a few governments, are not giving up on the legal route. Because the Paris agreement lacks an enforcement mechanism, they want courts to ensure that all those with climate responsibility -- nationally and internationally -- can be held to their promises. And they have been busy going to court. By the end of last year, 2,666 climate-litigation cases had been filed worldwide, according to a report 3 by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, published in June (see 'Climate in court'). Most claimants are individuals , young and old, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). All are looking to hold governments and companies accountable for their climate pledges. In 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4 acknowledged that , if successful, climate litigation ""can lead to an increase in a country's overall ambition to tackle climate change"". Note the phrase, ""if successful"". There have been a handful of landmark judgments. For example, in May, courts in Germany and the United Kingdom separately found that their government's policies would fail to meet emissions-reduction targets that are set out in law. But most claimants struggle to get a positive result, as Joana Setzer and Catherine Higham, researchers at the Grantham Institute in London, show in their report 3 . Much climate litigation is mired in a maze of process and procedure. In some instances, respondents -- mostly corporations -- are embarking on counter-litigation, essentially challenging climate laws that they do not like. This is where the entry of the world's highest court could be a game changer. In the next few months, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations' principal judicial organ in The Hague, the Netherlands, will begin hearing evidence on two broad questions: first, what are countries' obligations in international law to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, and second, what should the legal consequences be for states when their actions -- or failure to act -- cause harm? The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature The time to act is now: the world's highest court must weigh in strongly on climate and nature This could be one of the most consequential developments in climate policy since the Paris agreement itself. Adil Najam, president of the global conservation NGO WWF, writes in a World View that the ICJ's opinion ""will amplify the voices of millions of scientists and citizens who are demanding strong ambition and action on climate and nature protection"". These voices include people arguing against greenwashing, or for the protection from climate change as a human right , as well as public authorities seeking compensation from corporations for climate-related harms, under the 'polluter pays' principle. Last September, California launched legal action against five of the world's largest oil companies -- BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon and Shell -- and their subsidiaries, demanding that they pay ""for the costs of their impacts to the environment, human health and Californians' livelihoods, and to help protect the state against the harms that climate change will cause in years to come"". Brazil's public prosecutor's office and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources are seeking compensation for harms specifically from greenhouse-gas emissions caused by illegal deforestation 5 . The ICJ's opinion, although non-binding, will be especially important for low- and middle-income countries, which have comparatively less access to expertise in climate science, policy and law than do high-income countries. One criticism of climate litigation states that courts should not be getting involved in what are essentially political processes. The argument is that, if climate laws lack an enforcement mechanism, then governments need to legislate for one. According to this idea, it shouldn't be up to the courts to do something that is the job of governments; that would be judicial overreach. Courts are well aware of these concerns, and the ICJ will be, too. Legal redress is but one tool in a larger toolbox of actions. Ultimately, climate action at scale and pace will happen only when the international community is persuaded that humanity has no alternative but to decarbonize in a just way; not because of the threat of prosecutions, but because our collective survival depends on it. But the law has a key role. And the ICJ's opinion, backed by the highest standards of evidence, will be necessary in clarifying states' responsibility for climate harms and their obligation to protect the environment from emissions.",nature,2024-08-13T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02600-5
"To boost science, the growing BRICS group must embrace inclusion and transparency","When economics researcher Jim O'Neill coined the acronym BRIC in 2001, it was to highlight the potential of four up-and-coming world economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China. O'Neill, who had authored a 16-page research paper for the investment bank Goldman Sachs, couldn't have imagined that these countries would decide they had so much in common that they would form their own intergovernmental organization. The first formal summit of the BRIC network was held in 2009. The following year, the group became BRICS when South Africa joined. At this year's annual meeting, held last month in Kazan, Russia, the group expanded once more, formally admitting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. 'BRICS' nations are collaborating on science but need a bigger global platform 'BRICS' nations are collaborating on science but need a bigger global platform The latest BRICS expansion comes at a point at which the network can take stock, review its processes and see how it can fully embrace its collaborative potential. In particular, it should be embracing transparency and inclusion in all it does, not least in science. Talk to policy researchers and policymakers in high-income countries about BRICS and you will hear decidedly mixed views. Some see it as an 'anti-Western' alliance, whereas others dismiss it as a mere talkfest. Whether justified or not, such criticisms miss a bigger point. BRICS represents a long-held ambition for what is also called south-south cooperation: the idea that nations at similar stages of economic development want to meet and learn from each other. Since its foundation, BRICS has blossomed as one forum for such cooperation . When it comes to scientific collaboration, the BRICS group has taken an approach almost opposite to that of networks such as the larger G20 (to which all five pre-2024 BRICS members also belong). Formal research collaboration involving G20 nations as a single unit is minimal. However, there are BRICS networks for astronomers, environmental scientists, geographers, life scientists and statisticians, among other fields. This year, new groupings have been announced for researchers in humanities and social sciences, in public health and in nuclear medicine. There's already a BRICS network of policy-research think tanks, and a grouping of BRICS universities. There is also a network for young scientists (under 40 years old), which will be meeting later this month. The countries maintaining research ties with Russia despite Ukraine The countries maintaining research ties with Russia despite Ukraine That makes for a lot of meeting and talking. Each year, a different BRICS member takes the chair and organizes events, and that's a good thing. India set up more than 100 events in 2022; according to South Africa's BRICS events calendar, the tally increased to 200 last year under the country's leadership. But BRICS countries could be doing a lot better in documenting these activities. Some of the biggest beneficiaries could be their researchers, those with expertise who might wish to contribute, but who might not be part of official BRICS networks. Although the country that holds the chair each year produces a website advertising events and publishes short press releases, with some exceptions these say relatively little about the breadth and depth of activity taking place, including any publications that might emerge. All BRICS chairs should be publishing agendas, aims, objectives and reports from meetings. They should also publish reviews of ideas and proposals being presented. Just this year, for example, the BRICS countries agreed to develop their own indicators for research evaluation and performance, or scientometrics. That is not a small undertaking. There is likely to be a proposal written by a team of researchers, presented in advance to country representatives for their review and comments; there would be a rough timetable for implementation, and names of people to contact. This needs to be publicly available. COP26 didn't solve everything -- but researchers must stay engaged COP26 didn't solve everything -- but researchers must stay engaged The United Nations, including its Sustainable Development Goals, which the BRICS members are committed to, provides one model for how to do things. UN agencies publish detailed documentation before, during and after meetings. Equally importantly, observers (researchers, representatives of non-governmental organizations, businesses and the media) are invited to witness and report on events. Implementation is often a challenge, as Nature has reported ( Nature 599 , 347; 2021 ), but the principle is not in doubt. The expanded BRICS gives low- and-middle-income countries a platform to share experiences. And the group is expected to become even bigger. Saudi Arabia could be the next to join, with at least another 13 countries understood to be candidates. But this expansion must be accompanied by both inclusion and accessibility of information, at a minimum. Transparency is a non-negotiable principle in science. As the BRICS group expands, boosting its research collaboration, now is the time to become both more transparent and more inclusive in all of its processes.",nature,2024-11-12T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03673-y
A thaw in scientific relations could help clear the air in India and Pakistan,"A toxic haze has descended over a land area shared by some 500 million people in the northern parts of India and Pakistan. Its sources include the industrial emissions, domestic fires and diesel and petrol exhausts that form the largest components of air pollution in many parts of the world. But during winter in South Asia, crop residue burning is estimated to be the biggest source. It is an annual event that massively worsens the region's atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter -- that measuring 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter. These concentrations already exceed the safe limit advised by the World Health Organization. Air pollution is a leading cause of child death and is devastating for the communities that have to endure it. It also contains climate-altering compounds. Read the paper: Bureaucrat incentives reduce crop burning and child mortality in South Asia Read the paper: Bureaucrat incentives reduce crop burning and child mortality in South Asia In Nature this week, researchers show how the field of computational social science, along with publicly available data, could help authorities in India and Pakistan begin to address a problem that affects both nations ( G. Dipoppa & S. Gulzar Nature 634 , 1125-1131; 2024 ). The work also highlights what could be achieved if scientific links between the two countries were not frozen as a result of worsening relations between their governments. An overdue thaw could save lives and improve health in both nations. The annual winter burning of crop waste in South Asia has its roots in earlier science. High-yielding crop varieties born of 1960s-era green-revolution technologies, combined with mechanization, have enabled farmers in the nations' agricultural heartlands to grow wheat and rice on the same fields in the same year. Once a rice crop has been harvested, farmers burn millions of tonnes of leftover materials, clearing the land for the wheat-planting season. The resulting haze cuts visibility to a few metres, shuts schools, impedes road transport and causes flights to be cancelled. Researchers are actively studying both the extent of the pollution and prevention strategies. Gemma Dipoppa at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Saad Gulzar at Princeton University in New Jersey have examined the authorities' responses to the fires in India and Pakistan over a ten-year period, from 2012 to 2022. The authors compared fire, air pollution and wind-speed data with police and court records of action taken against farmers. They also studied the effects of the pollution on health. Burning crop waste is against the law in both countries and violations can lead to farmers being fined or even imprisoned. But many are willing to take that risk. And the sheer number of farmers lighting fires at the same time makes it unfeasible for the authorities to deal with them all. Local government actions can curb air pollution in India and Pakistan Local government actions can curb air pollution in India and Pakistan The authors found that officials in both countries are more likely to take action against farmers if winds are blowing pollution across home turf, and that crop residue burning decreases as a result. They also found that this effect is larger in areas close to the border between the two countries -- in other words, farmers in both nations are more likely to be penalized for crop residue burning if the wind is blowing towards their own side. This raises questions that would benefit from further enquiry. For example, to what extent might India's and Pakistan's authorities be cancelling out each other's pollution-control efforts close to the border? And on days when one country is putting resources into dealing with high levels of pollution within its own borders, is it also receiving more pollution from its neighbour? Further research -- both analyses of remote data and field-based studies -- will help researchers to understand the perspectives of farmers and the factors underlying the actions of government officials. Efforts to answer these and other questions would benefit from greater collaboration. However, at present, there are minimal links between researchers in India and Pakistan. Non-governmental links (sometimes called track-two diplomacy), including scientific connections, are the weakest they have been in around a decade. Scientists used to be able to meet through the eight-country South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), based in Kathmandu, but SAARC has not been functioning, mainly because of the continuing tensions between India and Pakistan. The agricultural scientists' committee has not met in five years. There's a strong case for such links to be revived. So much could be gained if researchers in the two nations could communicate better, work together and study each other's situation. Dipoppa and Gulzar's work illustrates what can be achieved with open data, and why science should not be done solely within national borders. When it comes to addressing problems with a regional or global dimension -- and when people's lives and health are at stake -- policymakers must prioritize collaboration.",nature,2024-10-30T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03485-0
Quantum technologies need big investments to deliver on their big promises,"In fields such as computing, information security and precise measurement, quantum systems promise to outperform classical ones . And there's been much progress over the century since the formulation of quantum mechanics. Quantum computers have reached the 'quantum advantage' milestone: they are able to solve problems that classical supercomputers cannot. And one method of secure communication, quantum cryptography, uses keys that are known only to the parties involved -- a form of unconditional security, which means the protection cannot be broken even with unlimited computer power. How to introduce quantum computers without slowing economic growth How to introduce quantum computers without slowing economic growth Quantum sensors are measuring both time and gravity with unprecedented precision . For instance, gravimeters for detecting earthquakes and for navigation are already commercially available. However, other than these encryption devices and quantum sensors, few quantum technologies have practical applications. In the next few years, quantum simulations will probably advance fields such as quantum chemistry and high-temperature superconductivity. The community is making progress, but the development of noise-resilient quantum computers that can be used for a wide range of problems will take another 10-15 years. Current challenges include protecting the fragile states of quantum bits (qubits) from errors and unwanted interference from the environment. Three steps would help to spur the field. First, calm down the quantum-computing hype. As a quantum physicist with more than 30 years of experience, I've seen how oversold promises have attracted a lot of capital and attention but can lead to unrealistic expectations. Some companies suggest that they can provide quantum-computing services, for example, when they have merely demonstrated small-scale quantum algorithms. Why even physicists still don't understand quantum theory 100 years on Why even physicists still don't understand quantum theory 100 years on Exaggerated claims can mislead the public and investors and undermine societal confidence in quantum information technology. For example, January saw a collective plunge in quantum-computing stocks , triggering concerns that this technology bubble has now burst. To prevent such stock-market jitters, academic and industrial research communities, as well as the media, must accurately communicate the state of quantum technology to the public, to foster realistic expectations. Second, stable and long-term government investment is essential for the continued advancement of quantum information technology. Unlike mature technologies, such as the Internet or mobile phones, quantum information research cannot yet rely fully on market-driven financing. Governments in the United States, Europe and China have increased their investments in quantum information research and development over the past few years. For example, the US National Quantum Initiative invested US$3.75 billion in 2023 -- nearly triple its five-year budget of $1.3 billion (see go.nature.com/3cw6qtr ). The next budget is in the process of being reauthorized, with a plan to allocate $2.7 billion over five years. But the eventual investment might be higher. or",nature,2025-02-26T00:00:00Z,WORLD VIEW,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00564-8
Progress on nuclear clocks shows the benefits of escaping from scientific silos,"What do you get when you put a nuclear physicist, an optical physicist and a crystal-growing maestro together in a laboratory? This is not the beginning of a bad joke, but the starting point for making what could become the world's most accurate timepiece. The level of boundary-crossing innovation required to make a nuclear clock 1 serves as an example of how cooperation can exist alongside competition in science. Atomic clocks currently hold the world record for most accurate timekeeping. They tick out time through the frequency of light emitted and absorbed by electrons jumping between atomic energy levels. Lasers that are locked to a clock's frequency provide the read-out. Countdown to a nuclear clock Countdown to a nuclear clock Nuclear clocks, by contrast, tap into the energy shifts of protons and neutrons inside an atom's nucleus. These energy transitions occur at a higher frequency than do those of electrons, making for a faster tick that could someday slice time more finely than atomic clocks can. And nuclear clocks come with other benefits. They are inherently more robust than atomic ones, because the nucleus and its energy transitions are more impervious to external perturbations than orbiting atomic electrons are. The transitions are also more heavily influenced by constants of nature, such as the strength of the strong nuclear force. This makes nuclear clocks highly sensitive instruments for testing fundamental physics. But nuclear clocks are also difficult to make, which is why it has taken almost 50 years to get close to a working model. For most atoms, a huge amount of energy is needed to lift the nucleus away from its lowest energy state, well beyond what can be achieved using precise, stable probing lasers. In 1976, patterns in the radioactive decay of the isotope thorium-229 suggested that the energy gap between the nucleus's ground state and its first excited state is much smaller than for other atomic nuclei 2 . Further calculations indicated that the window of energy in which the transition occurs might be accessible to lasers, leading physicists in 2003 to propose a thorium-based clock 3 . Best ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise 'nuclear' timekeepers Best ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise 'nuclear' timekeepers But theoretical models of the nucleus cannot predict the energy of such transitions with the necessary accuracy, so finding this one meant searching an enormous range of possible values. Moreover, thorium-229 decays slowly from its first energy state. So, with a half-life of around 30 minutes, the chance of observing the decay from second to second is low. This wearisome work has received a new impetus in the past few years -- thanks in no small part to input from scientists in fields beyond atomic and nuclear physics, as Adriana Palffy and Jose Crespo Lopez-Urrutia write in a News and Views article . Last year, rare-isotope specialists at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, observed the low-energy transition for the first time by making thorium-229 using an innovative method 4 , 5 . At the same time, solid-state physicists at the Technical University of Vienna grew crystals embedded with so many thorium-229 atoms that the decay became visible amid other nuclear processes 4 . Researchers realized that the experimental problems were too diverse for any one group to solve alone, says Ekkehard Peik, a physicist at the PTB, Germany's national metrology institute in Braunschweig. Peik's team 6 was one of two 6 , 7 to stimulate the energy transition earlier this year . ""The community -- different groups -- had to solve the different problems, one by one,"" he says. The international Thorium Nuclear Clock project, which is funded by the European Research Council, was explicitly designed to bring together the necessary expertise. Read the paper: Frequency ratio of the 229mTh nuclear isomeric transition and the 87Sr atomic clock Read the paper: Frequency ratio of the 229mTh nuclear isomeric transition and the 87Sr atomic clock Now, optical physicist Jun Ye at JILA, a research institute in Boulder, Colorado, and his colleagues have built on these advances 1 . They not only succeed in stimulating the transition in thorium-229 with exquisite precision, but also hook the thorium up to another timekeeper using a type of laser known as a frequency comb. This device, which creates a spectrum of equally spaced frequency lines at higher energies than ever before, has been used for measurements since 2012 8 . Ye and his co-authors saw its potential for driving a nuclear clock but were able to do so only when other groups had found ways to boost the thorium-229 signal in crystals and shown where in the spectrum to look. As such, this nuclear clock is a great example of the merits of reaching beyond silos. But, like many areas of science, the field of precision clocks thrives on competition as well as cooperation. There are many other avenues to explore, such as whether studying a small number of thorium-229 ions in a trap will provide a more stable environment in which to observe the transition than the crystal does. Laser physicists, too, might scramble to find other ways to improve the high-frequency devices needed for this extreme transition. Despite all this, a practical working nuclear clock has yet to be made. But that will now be only a matter of time.",nature,2024-09-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02829-0
How the World Health Organization can thrive without the United States,"The executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO) is meeting this week, just days after US President Donald Trump made the decision to withdraw the United States from the WHO. This loss of a founding member is, without doubt, a heavy blow; in 2022-23, the United States contributed around one-sixth of the agency's overall income. In his keynote speech to the board , WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for ""constructive dialogue to preserve and strengthen the historic relationship between WHO and the USA"". Even if Trump should change his mind, his move to withdraw the United States must still act as a wake-up call for the WHO's remaining 193 member countries to step up. The organization cannot allow itself to become so reliant on a single donor again. Vaccines save lives: how can uptake be increased? Vaccines save lives: how can uptake be increased? Part of the difficulty the WHO faces is that it is not easy to succinctly articulate what the agency does. It is the world's only global authority for coordinating international public-health work. For low-income countries, the WHO provides a lifeline to affordable drugs and vaccines, access to quality standards and help to increase health-care capacity. All countries benefit when the WHO's actions limit the spread of infectious diseases. The agency's signature achievement is the eradication of smallpox in 1980. Since then, governments worldwide have given the WHO responsibility for surveillance and control of infectious-disease outbreaks. It works with national health systems to promote good health and to set standards for vaccines and therapeutics. Increasingly, the agency is harnessing science and evidence in its decision-making, through a (still relatively new) office of the chief scientist. Work that the US contribution, which in 2022-23 came to some US$1.3 billion, has helped to fund includes efforts to contain infectious-disease outbreaks such as mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, and Marburg virus disease in Rwanda. The United States has been instrumental in the fight against Ebola virus, as well as in providing humanitarian and emergency-health assistance in areas affected by conflict. The US contribution has been considerable. But the funding gap left by its exit could be filled by the WHO's remaining members -- particularly the high-income and upper-middle-income nations -- and philanthropic foundations. Possibly anticipating a US exit, last November the WHO leadership secured $3.8 billion in extra donor pledges, which will go some way towards the additional $7.1 billion needed to cover the organization until 2028. These pledges must be converted into money in the bank without delay. In the past, some donors have suggested structural reforms of the WHO's governance. It is arguable whether, at this time of crisis, such reform should be the number-one priority. Mpox: apply COVID lessons to control outbreak in Africa Mpox: apply COVID lessons to control outbreak in Africa The WHO, like most large multilateral agencies, is complex. It is both an expert-led standard-setting body and an organization involved in alleviating suffering on the ground. Yet, at the same time, it is political: the head of the WHO is elected by the world's governments through a vote at the World Health Assembly, a kind of parliament of health ministers. This means that candidates campaign for the post, as do the six elected directors of the WHO's regional offices. Every WHO director-general, from the first, Brock Chisholm, to the incumbent, Tedros, has had to work within such a political framework. There is an argument for separating the agency's political and technical functions. However, unless WHO member states all agree -- which is unlikely in the current geopolitical climate -- the current architecture will not change. That said, the world is very different today compared with 1948, when the WHO was founded. Established regional public-health bodies such as the Pan American Health Organization have been joined by newer ones, notably the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, in setting health-care standards and overseeing their delivery. Philanthropic organizations also offer a source of funding. These beneficial developments are helping to share the load previously carried mainly by national governments and the WHO. Diseases, especially infectious diseases, do not respect borders. That is one of the reasons why the WHO was established as a global body, and it should have meant global responsibility for its funding. As the world's largest economy, it is understandable that the United States became the WHO's largest donor, and we hope it will soon rejoin the agency. But if countries genuinely want and value an organization that champions health for all, they must all step up to pay for it.",nature,2025-02-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00283-0
"In the big data era, prioritize statistical significance in study design","'Experimental design': these words signal a section of a research paper that many readers might be inclined to scan fleetingly, before moving on to the actual findings. But a study in Nature this week should make all researchers -- both readers and writers of papers -- consider dwelling a little more on the methods part of the scientific process. Read the paper: Study design features increase replicability in brain-wide association studies Read the paper: Study design features increase replicability in brain-wide association studies The study, led by Simon Vandekar, a biostatistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, is on how to make brain-wide association studies (BWAS) more robust ( K. Kang et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08260-9; 2024 ). The core idea of BWAS is to study collections of brain images using statistical tools and machine-learning algorithms. This is to predict what specific brain features or patterns of activity are associated with traits or behaviours, for example an ability to reason abstractly or a tendency to experience particular negative emotions. But BWAS have a perennial, and well-known, problem of low replicability: two studies on the same topic can come to different conclusions. Much of the problem is that some BWAS studies need huge sample numbers to reflect effects accurately. Small sample sizes can exaggerate the relationship of a certain brain feature to a behaviour or trait. In the similar field of genome-wide association studies -- which seek to relate differences in DNA with traits in health or disease -- the problem of unreliability is being overcome by gathering data sets with tens of thousands of samples from participants. However, in the case of the brain, this is much more difficult, especially for researchers outside Europe and the United States. One hour of scanning in a molecular resonance imaging (MRI) machine costs about US$1,000. The US National Institutes of Health distributes around $2 billion for neuroimaging research each year, but few other countries have this level of resource. Vandekar and his colleagues suggest that concentrating on quality, rather than quantity, could be one answer. They analysed more than 100,000 MRI scans from healthy adults and healthy children, as well as scans from children with mental-health conditions. Design tips for reproducible studies linking the brain to behaviour Design tips for reproducible studies linking the brain to behaviour Their aim was to explore how factors such as age, sex, cognitive function and mental health are associated with brain structure and function across diverse study designs. For example, one study explored how brain volume changes with age. Vandekar and his co-authors found that, compared with one-off scans of multiple people -- cross-sectional studies -- repeated MRI scans of the same people over time yielded more-robust results (see R. J. Chauvin and N. U. F. Dosenbach Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03650-5; 2024 ). Such longitudinal studies have long proved their worth in areas of science such as identifying biomarkers for chronic or degenerative diseases ( Y. Guo et al. Nature Aging 4 , 247-260; 2024 ). Although they don't work for some types of question for which cross-sectional studies are needed, longitudinal studies are good at ruling out irrelevant factors that looked as if they might be implicated during small cross-sectional studies. There are caveats, however: researchers conducting longitudinal studies must, for instance, take care to leave long enough gaps between measurements in any one individual if they are to capture meaningful and statistically significant differences over time. Vandekar and his colleagues also emphasize that researchers must account both for changes that happen in individuals over time and for differences between individuals. All research needs to be planned. For BWAS, selecting participants in such a way as to achieve robust results and using the right statistical models can improve the trustworthiness of findings without an automatic need for massive sample sizes. The benefits of statistical rigour, in turn, highlight the need for more collaboration between statisticians and neuroscientists, as they use more-sophisticated data-handling methods in their research. These findings will be valuable to the neuroscience community, and deserve wider attention. Many fields of science are plunging into data-driven discovery, increasingly assisted by the pattern-seeking abilities of artificial-intelligence algorithms. As they do so, questions of correlation and causation, and of ensuring that findings are statistically significant and reproducible, are becoming ever more pertinent. That means researchers must not skate over experimental design, whether they are reading a paper or writing one. Greater attention to research methods, and to how a study obtains the signal of its effect, is the way to make sure that results stand the test of time.",nature,2024-11-27T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03843-y
Humanity needs to diversify its lithium sources,"Nations are moving away from energy supplied mainly by fossil fuels to using renewable sources, but this transition relies on devices that we all take for granted: batteries. Humanity needs more of them and quickly, especially for electric vehicles, which use up most available battery power. In 2016, the global inbuilt battery capacity in all electric vehicles was around 50 gigawatt hours. By 2023, that figure had surged to almost 800 gigawatt hours . And, by 2035, according to one scenario considered by the International Energy Agency, it could be at least ten times that in 2023 -- assuming that countries meet their fossil-fuel reduction pledges (see go.nature.com/4avqdax ). The rechargeable battery is not as new as many might surmise; it is, in fact, more than 150 years old. The first such device was a lead-acid battery, invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plante. The technology was used to power the first electric cars that were developed at the turn of the twentieth century. The battery's descendants are still providing electrical charge to petrol and diesel engines. Today, lithium is the element of choice in the weighty boxes that power electric vehicles. The lithium-ion rechargeable battery isn't a spring chicken either: materials scientists John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino developed the device in the 1970s and 1980s (although they had to wait until 2019 to receive a Nobel prize for the breakthrough). Lithium is the smallest metallic atom in the periodic table under ambient conditions, and the lightest of the alkali metals. This means that it can carry a lot of electric charge for its size, and that the element can be found in lots of places, from mineral deposits to salty water. Ten years left to redesign lithium-ion batteries Ten years left to redesign lithium-ion batteries The United States Geological Survey estimates that the known sources of lithium globally comprise around 105 million tonnes, of which 28 million tonnes can be extracted economically with current technologies (see go.nature.com/4hshays ). That could be around a century's worth of battery supplies. The global annual demand for lithium is around 200,000 tonnes today, although it is projected to increase sevenfold by 2040, the International Energy Agency says (see go.nature.com/4jabduz ). Having an ample supply is good news. But the bad news is that most of the known accessible lithium deposits are found in just a few countries. Although Australia is currently the world's largest producer of lithium, about half of the world's known reserves are contained in salt flats in the 'lithium triangle' on the borders of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. China also has considerable reserves. Extracting lithium from these sources is an energy-intensive process . Large amounts are needed to pump water from its source into huge ponds, where the water evaporates, leaving behind salts. These salts are further processed and separated to obtain lithium-rich minerals. All stages of the process use considerable quantities of fresh water, often in arid locations, where this resource is scarce. Up to two million litres of water are needed to extract a tonne of lithium, according to some estimates. An obvious alternative is to obtain lithium from brines, such as seawater; the element is abundant in the world's oceans. But at 0.1-0.2 parts per million, extracting the metal from these sources is challenging technically and, as is the case for lithium mining, it also has a considerable environmental footprint. Lithium extraction from low quality brines Lithium extraction from low quality brines For these reasons, brines are not considered a dependable source. But, as materials scientists Ping He, Haosheng Zhou and their colleagues at Nanjing University in China explain in a Review article in Nature , there are ways to improve existing methods of separating lithium from lower-quality sources, such as developing chemicals that grab lithium more effectively or using special filters and electricity that can separate it out ( S. Yang et al . Nature 636 , 309-321; 2024 ). The good news is that several techniques, from improved filters to better precipitation methods, are being developed to do just that. However, to fully exploit lower-quality lithium sources, the authors say, research needs to go back to the basics of understanding how low concentrations of tiny ions can be separated, and then build back up to improve on the technologies currently being developed. Researchers are also examining alternatives to lithium, including sodium . The element sits directly below lithium in the periodic table, has similar chemical properties and is easier to source, but its atoms are heavier. Extraction is only one part of the story. When it comes to the full process of producing lithium batteries, only one country has worked out what to do at scale: China's government and companies have invested heavily in all stages of electric-vehicle development, including batteries. This is partly to satisfy domestic demand: more than half of new vehicles are electric. Although the nation is responsible for mining around 20% of the world's lithium, it refines almost 60%. When it comes to making lithium-ion battery components, China is responsible for making more than 80% of each battery part used globally. Other countries need to work out how they too can access this crucial energy source. The final part of the picture is to improve the batteries themselves. Battery performance must be enhanced; they need to last longer and be fully or mostly recyclable. In all respects, lithium is the key.",nature,2025-01-28T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00213-0
AI watermarking must be watertight to be effective,"Seldom has a tool or technology erupted so suddenly from the research world and into the public consciousness -- and widespread use -- as generative artificial intelligence (AI). The ability of large language models (LLMs) to create text and images almost indistinguishable from those created by humans is disrupting, if not revolutionizing, countless fields of human activity. Yet the potential for misuse is already manifest, from academic plagiarism to the mass generation of misinformation. The fear is that AI is developing so rapidly that, without guard rails, it could soon be too late to ensure accuracy and reduce harm 1 . This week, Sumanth Dathathri at DeepMind, Google's AI research lab in London, and his colleagues report their test of a new approach to 'watermarking' AI-generated text by embedding a 'statistical signature', a form of digital identifier, that can be used to certify the text's origin 2 . The word watermark comes from the era of paper and print, and describes a variation in paper thickness, not usually immediately obvious to the naked eye, that does not change the printed text. A watermark in digitally generated text or images should be similarly invisible to the user -- but immediately evident to specialized software. Read the paper: Scalable watermarking for identifying large language model outputs Read the paper: Scalable watermarking for identifying large language model outputs Dathathri and his colleagues' work represents an important milestone for digital-text watermarking. But there is still some way to go before companies and regulators will be able to confidently state whether a piece of text is the product of a human or a machine. Given the imperatives to reduce harm from AI, more researchers need to step up to ensure that watermarking technology fulfils its promise. The authors' approach to watermarking LLM outputs is not new. A version of it is also being tested by OpenAI, the company in San Francisco, California, behind ChatGPT. But there is limited literature on how the technology works and its strengths and limitations. One of the most important contributions came in 2022, when Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, described, in a much-discussed talk , how watermarking can be achieved. Others have also made valuable contributions -- among them John Kirchenbauer and his colleagues at the University of Maryland in College Park, who published a watermark-detection algorithm last year 3 . The DeepMind team has gone further, demonstrating that watermarking can be achieved on a large scale. The researchers incorporated a technology that they call SynthID-Text into Google's AI-powered chatbot, Gemini. In a live experiment involving nearly 20 million Gemini users who put queries to the chatbot, people didn't notice a diminution in quality in watermarked responses compared with non-watermarked responses. This is important, because users are unlikely to accept watermarked content if they see it as inferior to non-watermarked text. AI models fed AI-generated data quickly spew nonsense AI models fed AI-generated data quickly spew nonsense However, it is still comparatively easy for a determined individual to remove a watermark and make AI-generated text look as if it was written by a person. This is because the watermarking process used in DeepMind's experiment works by subtly altering the way in which an LLM statistically selects its 'tokens' -- how, in the face of a given user prompt, it draws from its huge training set of billions of words from articles, books and other sources to string together a plausible-sounding response. This alteration can be spotted by an analysing algorithm. But there are ways in which the signal can be removed -- by paraphrasing or translating the LLM's output, for example, or asking another LLM to rewrite it. And a watermark once removed is not really a watermark. Getting watermarking right matters because authorities are limbering up to regulate AI in a way that limits the harm it could cause. Watermarking is seen as a linchpin technology. Last October, US President Joe Biden instructed the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to set rigorous safety-testing standards for AI systems before they are released for public use. NIST is seeking public comments on its plans to reduce the risks of harm from AI, including the use of watermarking, which it says will need to be robust. There is no firm date yet on when plans will be finalized. How does ChatGPT 'think'? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models How does ChatGPT 'think'? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models In contrast to the United States, the European Union has adopted a legislative approach, with the passage in March of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, and the establishment of an AI Office to enforce it. China's government has already introduced mandatory watermarking, and the state of California is looking to do the same. However, even if the technical hurdles can be overcome, watermarking will only be truly useful if it is acceptable to companies and users. Although regulation is likely, to some extent, to force companies to take action in the next few years, whether users will trust watermarking and similar technologies is another matter. There is an urgent need for improved technological capabilities to combat the misuse of generative AI, and a need to understand the way people interact with these tools -- how malicious actors use AI, whether users trust watermarking and what a trustworthy information environment looks like in the realm of generative AI. These are all questions that researchers need to study. In a welcome move, DeepMind has made the model and underlying code for SynthID-Text free for anyone to use. The work is an important step forwards, but the technique itself is in its infancy. We need it to grow up fast.",nature,2024-10-23T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03418-x
"Universities are not just businesses, but an investment in future generations","There are two stages to going bankrupt, according to a character in the 1926 Ernest Hemingway novel The Sun Also Rises : first gradual, and then sudden. Many UK universities are approaching step two, as Nature reports in a Careers feature . High inflation and frozen student fees have created a perfect financial storm. To add to that, in January, the UK government banned most international students from bringing their dependants into the country. This is further fuelling existing perceptions that the nation is becoming less welcoming, resulting in a marked fall in the students who contribute to balancing the books. All of this helps to explain why there is a crisis: the state does not directly pay universities in England, Northern Ireland and Wales to teach students, as happens elsewhere. Instead, universities rely heavily on tuition fees for income, with students essentially their paying customers, as if universities were for-profit businesses. Any government typically would let businesses fail if they don't make a profit. The 11-week-old Labour government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer doesn't seem inclined to see universities differently to businesses. It should. UK university departments on the brink as higher-education funding crisis deepens UK university departments on the brink as higher-education funding crisis deepens To be clear, not all UK universities are suffering equally. Older, world-renowned ones, such as the 24 members of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, are comparatively less at risk, because they have enough longevity and reputation to both secure credit and attract students from abroad, who pay higher fees than home students. A 'squeezed middle' of newer institutions are less fortunate. They are more reliant on home students, whose tuition fees are currently capped at PS9,250 (US$12,300) a year in England and Wales and PS4,750 in Northern Ireland (Scottish students do not pay to attend universities in Scotland). Many of these institutions have also borrowed heavily to fund buildings to make them more attractive to students and to keep up with their more famous competitors ( A. R. Bell et al. Int. Rev. Econ. Finance 82 , 771-783; 2022 ). Some 108 degree-awarding institutions in England are expected to be in deficit by the end of this year, according to the Office for Students , the English universities regulator. Many of those working in higher education say that soon -- very soon -- one of these universities will become insolvent. In many cases, the cost of educating a UK undergraduate student is more than the amount the student pays the university. A bankruptcy would be a disaster. The universities most at risk are among the largest employers in their towns and cities, and more likely to educate students who will be the first in their families to receive higher education, compared with Russell Group universities. UK's new science minister on budget battles, Brexit and AI leadership UK's new science minister on budget battles, Brexit and AI leadership So far, the government's message seems to be that universities are on their own. Higher-education leaders must behave like business owners -- and face the consequences of the market if they fail. Labour's thinking fails an important test. Universities organize much of the nation's research, which is subject to different financial arrangements from teaching. In 2021, UK taxpayers contributed PS12.8 billion (US$17 billion) in funding to researchers, mostly at universities . That subsidy comes partly on the understanding that innovation and technologies emanating from universities push society forward and boost economic growth. A report commissioned by Universities UK, the London-based umbrella body for UK universities, found that every PS1 of public investment generates PS14 of economic benefit (see go.nature.com/3xztcrf ). It makes little sense to treat academic research as a public investment, but higher education as a private-sector industry. If universities can't educate those who will be the scientists of the future, their research output is going to be severely diminished. Other countries show that it doesn't have to be this way (see 'A league of its own'). Many European governments pump billions into higher-education funding as well as research. Students pay a small charge, or a heavily subsidized tuition fee, to cover the costs of a degree. Government scholarships are also available in many countries. China, which has the world's largest higher-education sector, with more than half of its secondary-school graduates enrolling in tertiary education, operates on a similar model. Even in the United States, public universities receive some direct funding from their state governments as well as charging tuition fees. The UK government faces a mountain of problems: prisons are overflowing, the National Health Service is in serious trouble and the economy is barely growing. Some say that UK citizens don't expect public money to be used to save a struggling supermarket or clothing label, so why should a government bail out a struggling university? One alternative being discussed is to allow universities to increase student fees , in exchange for them agreeing to limit international students. That could be the worst of all worlds: it would confirm that the United Kingdom is less welcoming to people from other countries, and subsequent generations of home students would be punished with ever-increasing fees. Universities are important places for investing in young people; they are a space, often far away from home, where for a few years, the next generation learns independence and agency. Universities -- through research, innovation and their role as employers -- are also necessary for economic growth, which Labour has committed to boosting. But market success cannot be the only measure if the United Kingdom is to achieve its growth ambitions. The future has to include long-term, stable public investment in universities, too.",nature,2024-09-25T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03109-7
A shout-out for AI studies that donâ€™t make the headlines,"It is not even past January, and 2025 is already proving to be a defining year for artificial intelligence (AI). On 21 January, just one day into his presidency, US President Donald Trump announced the Stargate Project, a joint venture between leading technology companies and financiers in the United States, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. They pledged a staggering US$500 billion to developing AI infrastructure in the United States. Yet only the next day, DeepSeek, an AI-research company based in Hangzhou, China, showed that such vast sums might not be needed. It released DeepSeek-R1, a large language model (LLM) capable of step-by-step tasks analogous to human reasoning -- reportedly at a fraction of the cost and computing power of existing LLMs. In early tests, its performance on tasks in chemistry and mathematics matched that of the o1 LLM released last September by OpenAI, a firm based in San Francisco, California. The news of a cheap yet advanced AI has sent the price of some technology stocks into a tailspin. The AI tool that can interpret any spreadsheet instantly The AI tool that can interpret any spreadsheet instantly Amid the various visions for AI that are likely to define the coming years, important studies will continue to be published, but not all will make headlines. They, too, need to be heard about, discussed and debated. One such work was published in Nature earlier this month. It is called 'Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model' ( N. Hollman et al. Nature 637 , 319-326; 2025 ), and it could be revolutionary for the field of data science, according to one of its reviewers, Duncan McElfresh, a data engineer at Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto, California, writing in an accompanying News and Views article ( D. C. McElfresh Nature 637 , 274-275; 2025 ). The best-known LLMs are pre-trained on hundreds of billions of examples of actual data, such as text and images. This enables them to answer user queries with a degree of reliability. But what if relevant real-world data do not exist in the required quantities? Can AI still provide reliable answers when trained on fewer data sets? This is a key question for researchers who use AI to make predictions from tabulated data sets, of which there is nowhere near the required quantity for training AI models. The Nature study suggests that reliable results could be achieved if AI models are trained on 'synthetic data' -- randomly generated data that mimic the statistical properties of real-world data. This advance is the work of computer scientists Noah Hollman, Samuel Muller and Frank Hutter at the University of Freiburg, Germany, and their colleagues. Their model is called TabPFN and is designed to analyse tabulated data, such as those found in spreadsheets. Typically, a user creates a spreadsheet by populating rows and columns with data, and uses mathematical models to make inferences or projections from those data. TabPFN can make predictions on any small data set, ranging from those used in accounting and finance to those from genomics and neuroscience. Moreover, the model predictions are accurate even though it is trained entirely without real-world data, but instead on 100 million randomly generated data sets. AI firms must play fair when they use academic data in training AI firms must play fair when they use academic data in training Synthetic data do not come free of risks, such as the danger of producing inaccurate results, or hallucinations. This is partly why it is important that such studies are replicated. Replication, a cornerstone of science, also reassures users that they can trust the results of their queries. Enhancing trust in AI, along with minimizing harms, must remain a global priority, even though it seems to have been downgraded by Trump. The president has rescinded an executive order by his predecessor, which called on the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and AI companies to collaborate to improve both trust in and the safety of AI , including for the use of synthetic data. Trump's new executive order, which is called 'Removing barriers to US leadership in artificial intelligence', neglects to use the word 'safety'. Last November, NIST published a report on methods for authenticating AI content and tracking its provenance (see go.nature.com/42c21tn ). Researchers should build on these efforts and not let them go to waste. Hollman and colleagues' work is an example of necessity spurring innovation: the researchers realized that there were not enough accessible real-world data sets to train their model, and so they found an alternative approach. It remains the case that all AI models, whether trained on synthetic or real-world data, are still black boxes: users and regulators do not know how a result is reached. So, as 2025 brings more exciting developments, let's not forget the studies that attempt to understand the 'how and why' of AI, and the methods papers, too. They are as important as the publications that announce the breakthroughs.",nature,2025-01-29T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00214-z
Support the Pact for the Future,"Last week's United Nations General Assembly debate saw a lot of anger. Some was directed at the UN, some at powerful nations, for their seeming inability or unwillingness to do more to tackle the world's crises. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres did not mince his words in his criticism of world leaders. ""Conflicts are raging and multiplying, from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan, with no end in sight. The climate crisis is destroying lives, devastating communities and ravaging economies. New technologies, including artificial intelligence, are being developed in a moral and legal vacuum, without governance or guardrails,"" he said. The world is in what social scientist Pedro Conceicao, the editor-in-chief of the UN's annual Human Development Report, describes as a ""new uncertainty complex"" of inequality, planetary pressures and polarization . In 2019, the Human Development Index, a composite measure of well-being, dropped for the first time in its more than three-decade history, although it is now recovering. It is also extremely unlikely that any of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be achieved by the UN's self-declared 2030 deadline. Yet, amid the anger and frustration, a different meeting, the UN Summit of the Future, brought a sliver of hope that a better future is possible: one in which science and cooperation are front and centre. Through a document called the Pact for the Future , Guterres says that he wants to ""turbocharge"" climate action and efforts to meet the SDGs. The 61-page text was signed off by world leaders on 22 September. It might be one of the few remaining opportunities that the world has to correct course. Unearthing 'hidden' science would help tackle the world's biggest problems Unearthing 'hidden' science would help tackle the world's biggest problems The pact is a list of 56 pledges across 5 themes, in which world leaders promise, among other things, to provide more finance for low-income countries; work harder towards peace and security; mobilize science; and listen more to young people. The document also advocates reform of the UN's top level of governance, as well as changes to global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These organizations have not changed much since the end of the Second World War, when they were established in part to support countries devastated by the conflict. The document already has its critics. Some are disappointed that there is no mechanism for monitoring whether the pledges are kept. Others see it as another example of governments getting unnecessarily involved in peoples' lives. Some of these points are valid, although there are a number of concrete mechanisms for following up on the pledges, including ones on improving Internet governance while protecting its autonomy, and improving the world's financial architecture. These are also reasons why it would be wrong to dismiss the pact. The benefits of such documents are as much about the process of writing them as they are their actual content, and need to be judged by what has changed from what came before. Several things are worthy of note. First is the fact that there is a whole section of the report devoted to science. This is not always the case with system-wide reports from the UN's highest office. For example, advancing science is not one of the SDGs. Some argue that it doesn't need to be, because science implicitly underpins the process of achieving all 17 goals. This is true, but science's invisibility at the highest level also means that it risks getting ignored. Guterres recognizes this. He has re-established a board of science advisers reporting to his office, which was originally established by his predecessor Ban Ki-moon, but wasn't continued in Guterres's first term . Also, as Nature reported last week, researchers, including those working at the UN, are pushing national governments to establish a much greater role for evidence in policymaking (see Nature 633 , 493; 2024 ). How to stop a looming 'splinternet' How to stop a looming 'splinternet' Second, the pact was produced through a radical process -- for governments at least -- that needs to be studied for its replication potential. Starting with its founding charter in 1945, the UN has grown to oversee hundreds of treaties and conventions, which set the rules for everything from managing road traffic to conserving endangered species. These agreements often have their own legally binding text, governing structure and complicated schedule of conferences. The existence of so many individual agreements makes it challenging to tackle cross-cutting issues. Most countries have no formal mechanism for different government departments to work together to achieve the SDGs. What was novel about the creation of the Pact for the Future is that representatives from different countries and across individual SDGs had to cooperate to produce it. SDGs, such as zero poverty or education for all, need to be achieved individually, but they also intersect -- reducing poverty has an effect on education, and improving education boosts poverty reduction. In creating the pact, Guterres's team broke through these silos, something that researchers have long been advocating and that is in fact the 17th goal: working in partnership. Researchers should help UN member states to learn from this process. Third, and appropriate for the document's name, the pact is a call for nations to invest more in their young people and involve them in decisions now. It is the coming generations that will ""live with the consequences of our actions and inaction"", as the document says. Ultimately, the pact will live or die on the actions of its signatory countries. If they choose to collaborate, they can achieve goals much quicker. If they build walls between them, there is a limit to what can be achieved. Guterres and his team have shown what can be achieved by prioritizing evidence and using a partnership approach. It is now up to all of us who care about sustainability, peace and security to run with the baton that has been passed to us.",nature,2024-10-01T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03183-x
Quantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution,"It is rare for a scientific idea or theory to fundamentally change our perspective on reality. One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology . This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics. The word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy -- in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant , which is derived from a Latin term meaning 'how much'. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics -- the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects. How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago As science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift fur Physik a paper whose title translates as 'On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships' ( W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33 , 879-893; 1925 ). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schrodinger. The revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas -- for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing . Others will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don't fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die. Commemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers' collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century -- and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come. This billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed? This billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed? In May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil. This meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom -- particularly women -- have not been recognized in the history of the field. These ""hidden figures"" include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics . For all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics -- such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter -- from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s. 'A truly remarkable breakthrough': Google's new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone 'A truly remarkable breakthrough': Google's new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone The standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does -- and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the 'dark matter' that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized. Other conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments 'collapse' the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the -- still remorselessly classical -- macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies. The resulting applications in computing, ultra-secure communications and innovative scientific instruments are still in their nascent stages. Quantum theory keeps on giving. This year is an opportunity to celebrate and to make the broader public aware of the role that quantum physics has in their lives -- and to inspire future generations, whoever they are and wherever they are in the world, to contribute to another quantum century.",nature,2025-01-08T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00014-5
The world needs a US president who respects evidence,"Next week, US voters will go to the polls to elect a new president, along with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This election will take place at a time of extreme uncertainty, both for the United States and for the world. The two candidates, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, represent vastly different views of the challenges and opportunities that the country faces, and the role of the United States on the international stage. The US is the world's science superpower -- but for how long? The US is the world's science superpower -- but for how long? Like all elections, the 5 November vote is about much more than science. However, the fate of scientific research, evidence-based lawmaking and the government's receptiveness to independent science-policy advice will be key determinants of the country's future course and long-term well-being. And, as we reported in a News Feature on 23 October ( Nature 634 , 770-774; 2024 ), US science could be at an inflection point: the election and a range of domestic and global forces could challenge the primacy that the country has held since the Second World War. A priority for both the winning presidential candidate and the new members of Congress must be ensuring that US science continues to thrive. This is essential if the world is to solve shared challenges , such as the climate crisis, inequality and societal divisions -- and that means retaining the openness and collaborative spirit that have characterized US science for much of the past 75 years. US scientists work with peers around the world, which has helped to position the country at the centre of fundamental, applied and translational research, while creating bonds of friendship and collegiality between US researchers and their international collaborators. These bonds are needed now more than ever. The United States needs leaders who fully understand the responsibilities that come with power and, moreover, are wholeheartedly committed to respecting facts or the consensus of evidence while governing. Harris, the vice-president under President Joe Biden, is a former US senator; before that, she was a public prosecutor and attorney general in California. In her previous and current roles, she has broadly sought to advance policies that are in line with the scientific consensus and with the objective of keeping people safe and protecting public health and the environment. What Kamala Harris's historic bid for the US presidency means for science What Kamala Harris's historic bid for the US presidency means for science The Biden-Harris administration's signature achievement is the plan to invest more than US$1 trillion in climate and clean-energy technologies over a decade -- albeit while overseeing record levels of production of oil and natural gas in the short term. A landmark piece of legislation passed by Congress in 2022, called The Inflation Reduction Act, is a historic investment that seeks to modernize US manufacturing and create jobs in the clean-technology industry. At the same time, the administration has sought to craft and implement plans to insulate regulatory agencies , such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from political interference. Harris said on 22 October that her administration will not be a continuation of the Biden presidency. She has said she wants to build an ""opportunity economy"". Precisely what that means is yet to be defined -- a science- and evidence-based approach needs to be at its core. That record is in stark contrast to what happened during Trump's presidency, from 2017 to 2021. As president, Trump not only repeatedly ignored research-informed knowledge, but also undermined national and global science and public-health agencies . He has denied climate science, lied about the federal government's response to hurricane forecasts and asked scientists to investigate whether disinfectants could be used to treat people with COVID-19. He pulled the United States out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. He withdrew the country from both the Paris climate agreement and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also called the Iran nuclear deal) -- both of which the United States had helped to craft. He instilled fear at the EPA, including by rolling back climate policies and making it harder for its research workforce to be able to function independently of politicians, as many EPA scientists told Nature at the time . If anything, Trump's speech has coarsened. In the past few weeks alone, he has falsely claimed that millions of migrants are ""pouring into our country from prisons, jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums"" and eating people's pets, and that members of the Democratic Party support the execution of babies after birth. Effort to 'Trump-proof' US science grows, but will it succeed? Effort to 'Trump-proof' US science grows, but will it succeed? The risks of a second Trump presidency continue to mount. It wouldn't be easy for a new administration to reverse the investments pledged by the Inflation Reduction Act, but Trump has promised to try. He has said he will ramp up fossil-fuel production and promised to reclassify the positions of tens of thousands of federal employees, including scientists and senior officials in the executive branch of government. That is an alarming development that would require reversing the rule that the Biden administration has crafted to prevent such action. It would undermine a basic premise of modern governance the world over: that scientific and technical specialists working in government are recruited for their expertise, not on the basis of their loyalty to the president or a political party, which is what Trump wants to do. Political leaders, irrespective of party membership or ideology, generally agree on the need for a society that creates jobs, promotes better health and advances science. But solutions for the world's mounting problems can come only from a shared, accurate understanding of reality. A lack of regard for the law and evidence fosters mistrust of scientists and institutions of state. That, in turn, weakens the foundations of democracy, both in the United States and around the world. A second Trump presidency would have an even more destabilizing effect globally, giving the green light to yet more leaders like him.",nature,2024-10-28T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03417-y
Give â€˜science for peaceâ€™ a chance,"The fall of the regime of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, which brought widespread joy and optimism , was a rare and welcome development in what has mostly been another devastating year of violence and conflict around the world. Wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan have made the past year one of the deadliest in recent times, according to the latest Armed Conflict Survey (see go.nature.com/3z565x ), produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), based in London. Worldwide, nearly 200,000 people were killed between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, a 37% rise from the previous 12-month period. Mark Rutte, the former Netherlands prime minister, now head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), said last week that NATO must prepare for a ""wartime mindset"", and urged member states to allocate more money to military budgets. In 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, world military spending had risen to an all-time high of nearly US$2.5 trillion, the ninth consecutive annual increase (see go.nature.com/4gggmuf ). In Africa, military spending was one-fifth higher than it was in 2022. But are more wars inevitable? Why can't peace be more of a priority? These questions need to be asked, and they make a new initiative called Science 4 Peace Africa all the more timely. What's next for Syria's science: a view from Nature 's reporter who was a refugee What's next for Syria's science: a view from Nature 's reporter who was a refugee At last week's African Academy of Sciences (AAS) general assembly in Abuja, Nigeria, Lise Korsten, president of the AAS, which is headquartered in Nairobi, and Sara Clarke-Habibi, a peace-building specialist at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) in Geneva, Switzerland, outlined a way for the African scientific community to work with stakeholders in the pursuit of peace and in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Korsten and Clarke-Habibi have set themselves a monumental task, and they are asking the right questions. Perhaps most importantly, their plan does not assume that wars are inevitable. Africa's leaders and their international partners need to sit up and listen to what they are proposing. Science 4 Peace Africa aims to establish the main drivers of conflict in the continent and see how science cooperation can address them. The approach has two aspects: first, specialists across disciplines and sectors, including research, policy and humanitarian relief, will map existing peace-building initiatives that involve the scientific community and highlight future opportunities. This will then feed into more-detailed consultations for each region. The second aspect is capacity-building: the initiative will train students and researchers in using peace-building tools in education and scholarship. ""Research, innovation and teaching can actually reinforce conflict drivers when not developed in a conflict-sensitive way,"" Clarke-Habibi and Korsten write in the project's concept note . A fresh start for the African Academy of Sciences A fresh start for the African Academy of Sciences This is important work not just for the knowledge and skills it will generate, but also because it will give scientists visibility in fields in which they can lack influence. Science is often not well represented in diplomacy or peace-building, a point also made in a Communications Engineering comment article published last month ( M. M. Lopez et al. Commun. Eng. 3 , 159; 2024 ). The authors of the article say that peace-building efforts are led by people with backgrounds in social and political sciences, law, diplomacy and humanitarian relief. Those with backgrounds in science, engineering and technology need to be among those doing strategic planning. Peace itself is foundational to the SDGs, not least SDG 16: peace, justice and strong institutions. ""When regions are destabilized, research is often interrupted, resources diverted, partnerships falter and knowledge exchange and innovation uptake come to a halt,"" say Clarke-Habibi and Korsten. Peace-building organizations such as the Pugwash Conferences on Science in World Affairs were established by scientists in the wake of previous global conflicts. But, they are finding it tough to be heard amid the constant and rising drumbeat of war. The AAS and UNITAR have an innovative plan. It has seed funding from South Africa's government, and now needs support from other funders and policymakers. There is no law of nature that says that there must be more conflicts and that more people must lose their lives.",nature,2024-12-18T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04114-6
Unearthing â€˜hiddenâ€™ science would help to tackle the worldâ€™s biggest problems,"On 22 and 23 September, world leaders will meet in New York City at an unusual Summit of the Future. Devised by United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres, the meeting aims to bolster global efforts to build a better world. Guterres is visibly frustrated by the glacial progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- the bold commitments made in 2015 to tackle inequality, poverty, climate change and more by 2030. It is now clear that most of the goals will be missed. The world's goals to save humanity are hugely ambitious -- but they are still the best option The world's goals to save humanity are hugely ambitious -- but they are still the best option A question on the minds of many delegates, including scientists, will be how the world can do better. One answer is to turn to research -- and some of what is needed already exists but lies neglected. As things stand, governments and institutions have tens of thousands of 'evaluation studies' that were commissioned to assess whether a policy or programme was completed, whether it worked, how much it cost and what barriers got in the way. Few of the commitments that will emerge from next week's summit will be more useful than an undertaking by all parties to open their vaults and help researchers to synthesize the best of the available evidence. Governments spend trillions on public services each year. Rigorous, independent evaluations offer a robust way for scientists, policymakers and citizens to learn which policies are worth continuing, which should be modified or expanded and which shelved. Evaluations come in many flavours. Some are impact evaluations, such as randomized controlled trials conducted to measure the success of a programme as it is rolled out -- as was the case for an initiative to see whether booster classes improve learning in refugee camps. Others evaluate processes or programmes by reviewing documents, data and interviews once a project is completed. Some are published in academic journals. Many are not. The most comprehensive database of development impact evaluations, held by the non-profit International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie), contains some 17,000 of these studies. Most have been published in the past 15 years, reflecting the growing pressure on governments and international funders to show that their money is being spent well and making a difference. What's the best way to tackle climate change? An 'evidence bank' could help scientists find answers What's the best way to tackle climate change? An 'evidence bank' could help scientists find answers Yet transparency is not the norm. Many evaluations remain buried in institutional vaults, inaccessible or unknown to many. Often, the reports are read by just a handful of people before being filed away. The UN is helping to change this. The Global SDG Synthesis Coalition, formed in 2022, is a group of some 40 UN organizations that want to make better use of the mountain of studies in their filing cabinets. The UN Development Program (UNDP) alone has upwards of 6,600, and there are tens of thousands more across other UN and national agencies, says Isabelle Mercier, who leads the UNDP's independent evaluation office. The aim of this coalition is to synthesize UN evaluations and other research to extract lessons on five themes in relation to the SDGs: partnership, people, planet, prosperity and peace. The first synthesis report, on partnership, was published in September 2023 (see go.nature.com/3xr5srk ). It drew on several hundred studies to examine prospects for the SDG 17 -- how factors such as trade, technology and cooperation could accelerate all of the targets. One of its findings is that collaborations between low- or middle-income countries are often more fruitful than those between high- and low-income nations. For instance, after Brazil moved from a paper-based to an electronic census in 2010, officials shared their experience and technology on data collection with countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. National governments are also paying more attention to evaluations. In 2021, the UK government launched an Evaluation Task Force to ensure that more spending decisions are based on evidence as to what works. In April, it launched a registry to improve civil servants' access to hundreds of evaluation reports, and mandated that government departments register studies there. In the United States, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, which became law in 2019, requires federal agencies to have a designated evaluation officer and associated plans. In 2023, the Australian government set up the Australian Centre for Evaluation (ACE) to inject research into policy. What scientists need to do to accelerate progress on the SDGs What scientists need to do to accelerate progress on the SDGs In the same year, the Inter-American Development Bank and several other major funders signed a Global Evidence Commitment, developed by 3ie, pledging to use and produce more research on which policies work. This momentum is encouraging, but more is needed. At present, countries and institutions tend to conduct and use their own evaluations and evidence syntheses, leading to duplication. Some of those studies lack rigour or fail to capture the lived experience of those affected by policies. A Global Evidence Report commissioned by the UK Economic and Social Research Council, the country's main social-sciences research funder, and published on 9 September (see go.nature.com/3twyhsi ), called for shared investment into research evidence by the international community. It recommends, for instance, establishing a fund to evaluate programmes and synthesize evidence on pressing topics, such as how to tackle climate change and support ageing populations. These are good ideas. Nations at next week's summit should back them and, in so doing, help to reinvigorate global efforts to solve the world's biggest problems. Better evidence can light the way to a brighter future, faster.",nature,2024-09-17T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02991-5
Live music is a major carbon sinner â€” but it could be a catalyst for change,"On 25 August, the band Massive Attack performed to around 34,000 fans as part of an all-day live music festival in Bristol, UK. Nothing unusual in that -- in many parts of the world, summer calendars are packed with such events. But this festival, Act 1.5, aspired to be something different. Billed as a ""climate action accelerator"", it was the culmination of a five-year collaboration between Massive Attack and scientists at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, UK, to decarbonize the live music industry. Such efforts are much needed. Live performances are an increasingly important source of revenue for artists, and audiences love them, too: the multinational company Live Nation Entertainment reports that more than 145 million fans attended its over 50,000 events worldwide in 2023, a record. For every one, temporary sets must be constructed, venues supplied with energy, and performers, equipment and audiences transported, often over large distances. Massive Attack's science-led drive to lower music's carbon footprint Massive Attack's science-led drive to lower music's carbon footprint US singer Taylor Swift's ongoing Eras Tour alone consists of 152 shows across 5 continents in 21 months. In 2010, researchers used figures from 2007 to estimate that the UK music industry produced some 540,000 tonnes of greenhouse-gas emissions annually, around 0.1% of the country's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Live music accounted for 74% of that ( C. Bottrill et al. Environ. Res. Lett. 5 , 014019; 2010 ). Those figures are likely to have risen. Many in the music industry are riffing ever more loudly on sustainability -- in no small measure because of pressure from their fan bases. Kpop4planet, a campaign group run by fans of South Korean K-pop music, successfully petitioned the South Korean car maker Hyundai -- for which the members of the K-pop supergroup BTS act as brand ambassadors -- to scrap a coal-plant-powered supply deal in Indonesia. Radiohead, Coldplay, Billie Eilish and The 1975 are just some of the high-profile Western stars who have declared initiatives to make live events more sustainable. These initiatives have not always met with the approval of climate campaigners. When Coldplay was criticized for a biofuel partnership with a Finnish oil company in 2022, for example, the band described its efforts on sustainability as a ""work in progress"". One common criticism, says Kyle Devine at the University of Oslo, who researches the environmental impact of the music industry, is that bands' messaging often focuses on the actions of individual fans -- for example, encouraging audience members to travel more sustainably, reduce their plastic use by carrying refillable bottles, or eat more plant-based food. When it comes to high-energy aspects of touring, such as stage power requirements and artists' travel, the preferred solution is often offsetting, rather than reducing, emissions. Sounds of science: how music at work can fine-tune your research Sounds of science: how music at work can fine-tune your research Massive Attack's collaboration with Carly McLachlan and her colleagues at the Tyndall Centre started from the premise that low-carbon practices should be the backing track to all aspects of staging live music. The resulting roadmap, published in 2021 (see go.nature.com/3xdyq5j ), set out emissions-reduction targets for the UK live music industry in line with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Its recommendations focus on curbing emissions in energy use, audience and artists' travel, and sundry areas such as food and drink supply -- all principles applied to the Act 1.5 festival, as a Careers Feature in Nature details . At the end of this year, the researchers will report on how sustainable and replicable such events are in practice for both organizers and attendees. Other initiatives also signal a shift in how the industry thinks about sustainability, says Devine. This year, the organizers of 36 arts festivals from across 8 Caribbean and Latin American countries joined together through the Cultura Circular Programme to discuss reducing the events' environmental impact. The Climate Machine research group, part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Environmental Solutions Initiative, has undertaken a project co-funded by the Warner Music Group, Live Nation and Coldplay to analyse the carbon footprint of the live music industry, initially in the United Kingdom and United States, and suggest practical mitigating measures. That should be published in an academic report later this year, with a public report following in 2025, says the group's co-leader Norhan Bayomi, an environmental scientist and DJ. The neuroscientist formerly known as Prince's audio engineer The neuroscientist formerly known as Prince's audio engineer Some real change has already been achieved. In 2023, for the first time, the long-running Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom was powered solely by fossil-fuel-free energy, using a combination of renewable electricity, solar photovoltaic and battery hybrid systems, as well as generators powered by fuel derived from waste vegetable oil. In June 2024, Coldplay announced that direct emissions from its current world tour were almost 60% lower than those of its 2016-17 stadium tour, with 18 shows powered entirely by portable battery systems and 72% of all waste diverted from landfill. Historically, music has played a key part in social movements. The industry now has the chance to be a role model for real change -- and audiences are receptive. In a survey of 350,000 live music fans across the United States, 72% said climate change is an important issue and 70% did not oppose artists speaking out about it (see go.nature.com/474sh69 ). And a 2022 report by researchers at the University of Glasgow, UK, found that music fans are more likely to care about climate change than are non-music fans (see go.nature.com/3x9drao ). Some might say that live music is, by its nature, unsustainable, and that the best solution would be for performers to stop touring altogether. But that is a joyless answer -- and there is an alternative. Richard Betts, a meteorologist and climate scientist at the University of Exeter, UK, thinks that change will come only when it is driven by those highest up in the music industry and backed by good science. Now is the time to be vocal.",nature,2024-09-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02828-1
â€˜Foreverâ€™ chemicals can be destroyed with clever chemistry â€” now test these techniques outside the lab,"A simple chemical bond between carbon and fluorine atoms changed the world -- for the better, and then for the worse. Such bonds lie at the heart of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of compounds, numbering in the millions, that are remarkably water-, heat- and greaseproof. Discovered in the 1930s with the advent of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, branded as Teflon), these chemicals make pans non-stick and keep the rain off our jackets. Varieties of cosmetics, fire-retardant foam, kitchen utensils, metal coatings, packaging, textiles and more all contain them. But they have become known as 'forever chemicals' because they are difficult to break down, persisting in the environment for perhaps 1,000 years or more. They are also 'everywhere' chemicals, in that they can be found in rivers and on the tops of mountains. This would not be such a problem, except that the chemicals are highly toxic, having been linked to developmental problems and conditions ranging from cancer to immune-system suppression. The world is belatedly starting to act, both to stop forever chemicals entering the environment and to clean up those already there. But more action is needed -- and faster. Catalysts degrade forever chemicals with visible light Catalysts degrade forever chemicals with visible light The carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond is one of the strongest in organic chemistry, requiring huge amounts of energy to break down, at huge expense. But now two papers in Nature 1 , 2 describe two low-energy ways to overcome the C-F bond. Both methods combine a catalyst with some relatively simple chemistry driven by the energy of visible light. In each case, the catalyst absorbs light that then triggers a reaction. Chemist Garret Miyake at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and his colleagues use this absorbed energy to reduce the C-F bond to carbon-hydrogen -- albeit not in Teflon 1 . Yan-Biao Kang, a chemist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, and his colleagues uses this energy to break the bond and the overall molecule down to smaller constituent parts 2 , in temperatures as low as 40 degC. Both papers, without doubt, mark a major step forward. Important next steps include using these ideas in real-world settings, for example to develop catalysts that work in waste water or that can be used to clean up PFAS in contaminated soils. If a method can be adapted so that it is powered by sunlight, that would be of huge benefit. Any solutions that emerge from such developments will address only part of the problem. There's an urgent need both for updated regulation of chemicals, and for more research into safer alternatives to PFAS that do the same things without harming human health and the environment. On the regulatory front, scientists advising the European Chemicals Agency are considering a proposal from countries including Germany and the Netherlands to ban 10,000 PFAS substances currently in everyday use. At the global level, the Stockholm Convention, an international agreement that bans persistent organic pollutants, is revisiting its latest list which classifies only three types of PFAS as banned substances. Could the world go PFAS-free? Proposal to ban 'forever chemicals' fuels debate Could the world go PFAS-free? Proposal to ban 'forever chemicals' fuels debate It is equally important to stop PFAS entering the water supply. In 2021, the European Environment Agency (working under the European Union's Drinking Water Directive) for the first time set upper limits on PFAS levels in water. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has gone further . In April, it set safe limits for drinking water, under which there will be 'close to zero' levels of certain PFAS. The European proposal doesn't yet extend to banning PFAS in applications such as medicine or transport, for the simple reason that these chemicals are still too useful and adequate alternatives are yet to be found. C-F bonds in pharmaceuticals allow molecules to remain stable, which is necessary for products' shelf life. Medicinal chemists are trying to make drug molecules that contain C-F bonds but can biodegrade safely once they leave the body. In some circumstances, PFAS have replaced other harmful chemicals -- for example, outdated, ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants. Non-fluorinated refrigerants are also available, including ammonia and carbon dioxide, but large-scale roll out will need regulatory input. A lot of clever chemistry, together with updated regulation, will be needed to ensure that forever chemicals finally become never chemicals.",nature,2024-11-20T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03753-z
"A plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time","More than two years ago, Nature urged the international community to put science front and centre as nations embarked on talks to agree a treaty to end plastics pollution. Such an agreement is needed urgently. Around 400 million tonnes of plastics are produced each year, and this figure is expected to double by 2040. Of all the plastics that have ever been produced, only about 9% have been recycled. If left unchecked, and if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degC above pre-industrial temperatures, plastics production and disposal are projected to be responsible for 15% of permitted carbon emissions by 2050. But the effort to curb plastics pollution is, at best, a work in progress. The latest round of talks in Busan, South Korea, broke up on 1 December without a treaty being formally agreed. Campaign groups and representatives of many countries -- especially island states, which see the effects of plastics pollution every day, as plastics wash up on their coastlines -- were visibly angry and frustrated. How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work The meeting's outcome was not a surprise. International agreements can take years to finalize. This is particularly true of complex accords that involve the regulation of individual chemicals and chemical products. Talks on the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention took more than a decade, from start to finish, before the agreement opened for signatures in 1993. The makings of a text for a plastics treaty are now in place and negotiators will reconvene within a year to continue talks. Although delegates' frustrations are justified, the commitment to continuing the discussions and the ambition of most participating countries to secure a strong agreement are positive, says Samuel Winton, a researcher at the Global Plastics Policy Centre at the University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the negotiations as they unfold . There have been five rounds of negotiations since talks on an agreement got the green light at the UN Environment Assembly in March 2022. The proposed agreement will cover polymers and microplastics -- particles less than five millimetres long -- and products that contain them. UN plastics treaty: don't let lobbyists drown out researchers UN plastics treaty: don't let lobbyists drown out researchers It will include a list of named products to be regulated. There will also be provision for chemicals and products to be exempt from the treaty, but the criteria for these are yet to be defined. The treaty will have a ""financial mechanism"" -- that is, some form of funding attached. Who will contribute, what the fund should total and what it is intended to be used for all remain to be agreed. Some of these questions might end up being parked until after the treaty text has been finalized and the first conference of the parties (or COP meeting) is held. We know from COP meetings on other topics that it is extremely difficult for participants to reach an agreement when there are too many issues in contention. One area on which the latest meeting reached, at best, a fragile consensus was the part of the text that says that any eventual agreement must cover the ""full life cycle"" of plastics. This was in no small part because what is meant by full life cycle still needs to be defined. Most countries interpret it as including both the production and disposal of plastics. However, some 30 countries that extract and sell fossil fuels -- including Kuwait, Russia and Saudi Arabia -- oppose the idea of setting limits on plastics production and would prefer the treaty to concentrate on regulating waste flows. This is an area in which a role for scientists will be key, both to help define terms according to a consensus of the evidence and to undertake research to bridge any knowledge gaps. Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre That said, scientists have found it hard to get access to talks on the treaty. This is partly down to logistics -- there are around 2,000 accredited observers allowed to attend the talks, out of a total of 3,300 participants, and meeting rooms cannot accommodate these numbers. Another reason, according to researchers at the Centre for Science and Environment, a think tank in New Delhi, is that some decisions were made in closed groups of countries that did not permit observers to attend. This is not a positive development, because it risks undermining trust in what should be a transparent process. Observers represent industry, non-governmental groups and academic research. So far, each negotiating session has seen more representatives from the fossil-fuel industry than the last, according to the Center for International Environmental Law, a non-governmental organization in Washington DC (see go.nature.com/3zgjzba ). These voices cannot be allowed to dominate. The UN Environment Programme, based in Nairobi, is the overall host for the talks, and has still not announced how it will formally incorporate independent scientific advice. It should delay no further in addressing this: a formal role for scientists is essential. Both the treaty's text, including its definitions, and the post-treaty implementation plans must be based on an accepted consensus of the research evidence. It is clear that the majority of countries do not want a weak treaty and are not going to compromise just to get a text over the line. And although all nations are looking to protect their own interests, no country doubts the need for an agreement to end plastics pollution. The status quo cannot continue -- and scientists must guide the way, both during the negotiations and to ensure that the treaty, once finalized, is observed.",nature,2024-12-03T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03932-y
South Korea can overcome its researcher shortage â€” but it must embrace all talents,"South Korea is the envy of the world, by some measures. Its spending on research and development (R&D) is among the highest of all nations at almost 5% of gross domestic product, according to 2021 data. The automotive and technology giants Hyundai, Kia, LG and Samsung are household names. Science is a popular career choice -- in 2021, South Korea had more researchers per million people than any other nation. And the country is home to at least one global cultural movement, K-pop. Nature Index 2024 South Korea Nature Index 2024 South Korea When it comes to research, however, it also has its share of problems, like any other nation. Gender disparity is a serious concern, says Jung-Hye Roe, a biologist at Seoul National University. In spite of policy initiatives aimed at correcting the imbalance, only around 18% of principal investigators on government-funded research projects are women. The average government grant won by a woman is worth just 41% of the average grant won by a man. That's hurting the country, Roe writes this week in a South Korea-themed issue of Nature Index . Another problem is that South Korea's birth rate has been declining for decades and is now the world's lowest, with 0.72 births per woman in 2023. As a result, prospective student numbers are projected to decline. In 2040, an estimated 280,000 young people in the country will be eligible to enter university -- a 39% drop from 460,000 in 2020. According to an analysis of higher education data by the Jongro Academy, a network of private tutoring colleges based in Seoul, 51 out of 195 universities have failed to meet enrolment targets this year. These have been dubbed 'zombie universities' by the national media for their low student numbers. If under-enrolment were to continue, it would represent a severe hit to both industry and academia. Last week, a committee of advisers convened by the administration of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol proposed a raft of ways to make research careers more attractive. Its report recommends providing more funding to cover the living expenses of science and engineering graduate students participating in government-funded R&D projects; giving early-career researchers more autonomy by allowing postdoctoral researchers and non-tenured faculty members to lead projects; and giving postdocs better employment protection in law. This last recommendation is significant, and must result in university postdocs being given the kind of career stability enjoyed by people in other professions. South Korean scientists' outcry over planned R&D budget cuts South Korean scientists' outcry over planned R&D budget cuts Last August, the government announced plans to further boost researcher numbers by offering science postgraduate students and PhD holders from abroad a fast track to permanent residency and citizenship. And, as part of the same initiative, South Korea wants to attract more international students by 2027, bringing the country's total to 300,000. This compares with 205,167 as of March 2023. The government is also redirecting more of its R&D funding to international collaborations. For this year, its annual budget for such projects has tripled to 1.8 trillion won (US$1.3 billion). In March, the country sealed associate membership of the European Union's Horizon Europe funding scheme, the world's largest research programme. But this focus has come at the expense of funding for the kind of fundamental science that often attracts early-career researchers. One surprising finding discussed in the Nature Index is that South Korea is not in the top tier of places where researchers easily switch between academia and industry. Researchers in Italy and the United States have more cross-sector mobility, for example. This wasn't always the case in South Korea, however, and the COVID-19 pandemic might have played a part in weakening links between universities and industry. Gender equality: the route to a better world Gender equality: the route to a better world Policymakers are mindful of this and are looking at ways to boost cross-sector mobility and collaboration. The report of the government's advisory committee, for example, proposed formally linking researchers and start-up companies, so they can solve technical challenges together. Part of the problem is that industry-based researchers are used to projects with long lead times, so might not want to move to academia, in which the typical length of a grant is one to three years. And because academic roles are difficult to get, university-based researchers could be reluctant to risk moving to corporate jobs. The advisory committee has recommended that the government support industry-focused master's programmes, which would run R&D projects tailored to industry needs, to train a new generation of graduates for the sector. However, more work needs to be done to ensure that gender inequality remains at the forefront of discussions. Policymakers and their advisers must study other countries' efforts to understand the extent of and reasons for gender gaps and discrimination, and to test solutions, such as the Athena Swan charter, an international scheme in which institutional funding has been linked to gender-equality objectives. What works in one country will not necessarily work in another, but solutions would make a material difference to researcher numbers, especially in senior leadership. South Korea has transitioned from low-income to high-income country in a single lifetime by nurturing a highly skilled workforce. But the nation must encourage and incentivize all of its talents. Only by doing so will it continue to occupy the technological high ground.",nature,2024-08-21T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02673-2
Out of Africa: celebrating 100 years of human-origins research,"On 7 February 1925, Nature published an article about a curious fossil unearthed in South Africa 1 . ' Australopithecus africanus : The Man-Ape of South Africa' had been sent in by Australian palaeoanthropologist Raymond Dart, who was then at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. In his memoirs, Adventures with the Missing Link (1959), Dart notes that he was dressing for a wedding when he was distracted by the delivery of two large boxes of rocks, containing the face of Australopithecus and the braincast (known as an endocast) -- an internal cast of the braincase formed from sediment -- that fitted into the skull, like a ball in a baseball pitcher's mitt. The specimens' site of origin -- a lime-works and adjacent farmland in Taung, South Africa -- was already known as a source of monkey fossils. A humanlike skull 2 had also been found in 1921 at a mine near Broken Hill in what is now Kabwe, Zambia. In The Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin had predicted that the roots of the human lineage lay in Africa. Although Australopithecus had its antecedents, Dart's discovery was the start of a century-long journey of discovery that has confirmed Darwin's prediction. 100 years of Australopithecus 100 years of Australopithecus Nature , together with Nature Africa , Nature Communications and Nature Ecology and Evolution , is publishing two collections to commemorate this anniversary. The first includes 100 papers that charted this journey and reveal the part that this journal has played in documenting it. The second delves into the field of palaeoanthropology from the perspective of African scientists today . The skull that commanded Dart's attention was intermediate in form to those found before. Although that of a non-human ape, the skull clearly had humanlike characteristics, too, as anthropologist Dean Falk at Florida State University in Tallahassee describes in an Essay in this issue . The foramen magnum -- the hole through which the spinal cord enters the skull -- was underneath, rather than towards the back of, the skull, indicating that its owner had walked upright. The shape of the face and endocast was much more humanlike than apelike. The jaw, too, looked more human than did that of Eoanthropus dawsoni , or Piltdown Man, a supposed 'missing link' between humans and other apes from Piltdown village, UK, described in 1912. Dart surmised that Australopithecus adults would have had a brain capacity similar to that of a gorilla. However, the skull was clearly that of a small child. Dart concluded that the fossil vindicated Darwin's prediction of an African human origin . 'Taung Child' fossil offers clues about the evolution of childhood 'Taung Child' fossil offers clues about the evolution of childhood Trenchant criticism came thick and fast. The London-based grandees of anthropology noted that the juveniles of humans and other apes looked similar, so Australopithecus could just as easily have been a non-human ape. They might also have been irked by Dart's comments about the humanlike jaw of Australopithecus . In those days, it was thought that the large brain of humans evolved before the humanlike jaw and the rest of the skeleton. An upright ape with a small brain and humanlike jaw, therefore, went against the grain. It would be decades before Piltdown Man was exposed as a hoax, a mash-up of a modern human skull and an orang-utan jaw, and Australopithecus was finally accepted as being closer to humans than to other apes. Meanwhile, physician-palaeontologist Robert Broom had started unearthing further Australopithecus fossils, showing that Dart's specimen was not a fluke . And so, the course was set. Eventually the focus of human-origins research moved from southern to East Africa and the name of Louis Leakey began to appear in the scientific record, although in those days of less-thorough sub-editing, he is listed in his first Nature paper 'Stone Age Man in Kenya Colony' as 'Leaky' 3 . The Taung child: Celebrating 100 years The Taung child: Celebrating 100 years Leakey, the son of a missionary who had come to Kenya to preach to the Kikuyu communities, established a fossil-hunting dynasty, although it was his second wife, Mary (nee Nicol), who discovered their breakthrough fossil 4 , then named Zinjanthropus boisei (Nutcracker Man), in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in 1959. Nature became Leakey's field diary. In the early 1990s, John Maddox, the journal's then editor-in-chief, explained (in the presence of this editorial's writer) to Leakey's son Richard -- another distinguished palaeontologist -- that all papers in Nature were refereed except, historically, ""those from [astronomer] Fred Hoyle and your dad"". Richard was visiting the journal's London offices and commented on a Nature paper describing a remarkable fossil from Ethiopia, of a species then called Australopithecus ramidus 5 . He said that his wife, palaeoanthropologist Meave Leakey (nee Epps), had equally exciting finds to report. Nature subsequently published her paper, too, on a four-million-year-old hominin species from Kenya 6 . Ethiopia was by then on the palaeoanthropological map. Other countries in Africa would soon join it, with key fossils found in Chad 7 , Malawi 8 and Morocco 9 . And Nature was there to document every new bone and tooth. Nowadays, West Africa is in the frame for new and exciting discoveries. The past, as they say, is a different country, and so it was for 1925. Nature back then makes for often grim reading -- paternalistic, male-dominated, imperialist, colonialist and, at times, nakedly racist. Had Dart's paper been submitted today, it would at the very least have included the names of several others, notably, Josephine Salmons, a student demonstrator of anatomy at the same university as Dart, who brought the fossil to his attention. Although things have changed, the field of palaeoanthropology 10 has been slow to recognize the contributions of the many women , including Salmons, and African scholars who made key discoveries. One such researcher was Kamoya Kimeu , one of the greatest observers of human origins, who died in 2022. His successors are, increasingly, leading research today. The collections aim to celebrate all those who contributed to humanity's evolving understanding of this part of the human story. The people might have changed, but Africa remains the heart of human origins.",nature,2025-02-05T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00282-1
UK election: three research priorities for the next government,"""Shock delay to net-zero pledges turns UK from climate leader to laggard."" This unflattering headline from a 2023 Nature editorial gives a flavour of the disconnect between the UK government and scientific community since the country's last general election in December 2019. ""Equality and diversity efforts do not 'burden' research -- no matter what the UK government says"", from 2020, offers another snapshot. The next election will take place on 4 July. The two main contenders for prime minister are incumbent Rishi Sunak of the Conservative Party and opposition leader Keir Starmer of the Labour Party. Opinion polls predict a clear majority for Labour. Universities and science matter in this election, as Nature 's news team reports . A survey commissioned by the non-profit organization Campaign for Science and Engineering in London found that investments in health-care and environmental research are clear priorities for the public. But to achieve these and other goals, the incoming government needs to get a grip on at least three urgent priorities. Researchers were hit hard by the United Kingdom's formal exit from the European Union on 31 January 2020, following a referendum in 2016. It came as a huge relief when, last year, the government negotiated an agreement that allowed UK researchers to rejoin the EU's Horizon Europe funding scheme. But, in other respects, the country has grown more isolated. UK general election: five reasons it matters for science UK general election: five reasons it matters for science Many topics, including climate change and the regulation of artificial intelligence , are ripe for closer international collaboration. The government's decision to delay the implementation of climate targets was rightly criticized. So was the closure of popular funding schemes that encouraged research partnerships between scientists in the United Kingdom and counterparts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The UK authorities also make it hard for researchers from many LMICs to get visas to work, study and even attend conferences in the country, compared with researchers from high-income nations, according to London's Royal Society . The number of applications to UK universities by international students (who are mostly at the master's and PhD stages) is falling, in part because such students are no longer allowed to bring dependants. The incoming government must understand that such policies damage both research and international links. There's a paradox at the heart of UK research. Although research funding has been increasing and now stands at nearly 3% of gross domestic product, 40% of universities in England are forecast to be in deficit by the end of this year , according to the Office for Students, the universities regulator, and there are fears a few could go bust. A key reason is that student fees, introduced in 1998 under a Labour government, have become the largest source of income for public universities. These have not increased since 2017, meaning that university income has not kept up with expenses. This situation is untenable and needs fixing. We can make the UK a science superpower -- with a radical political manifesto We can make the UK a science superpower -- with a radical political manifesto Big research-intensive universities are at lower risk, partly because they have comparatively large numbers of international students, most of whom pay higher fees, and also because their members receive the lion's share of research funding. By contrast, many smaller universities are cutting courses and laying off staff. Such universities tend to cater for a higher proportion of students from low-income families. A solution must be found to distribute funding more equitably and avoid a situation in which research and teaching become more concentrated in fewer institutions. The past five years have seen members of the government openly interfering in the workings of research and higher education. Examples include official government websites discouraging students from enrolling on what they call ""rip-off"" or ""Mickey Mouse"" degrees, which are widely understood to include many in media and journalism. The British Academy, the national academy for the humanities and social sciences, has pointed out the value of these degrees to the nation's PS108-billion (US$137 billion) creative economy. UK research assessment is being reformed -- but the changes miss the mark UK research assessment is being reformed -- but the changes miss the mark Ministers have also sought to influence decisions made by the national funding agency, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), and told universities that there is no need for them to comply with equality initiatives such as the Athena SWAN charter, an internationally recognized scheme for gender equality, devised in the United Kingdom. Such interference should not come as a surprise -- warnings were sounded in 2017, following the passage of a law in which ministers gave themselves more power to interfere in this way. All political parties need to understand that 'arms length' expert bodies should be operationally autonomous. No credible government would interfere in the running of the Office for Budget Responsibility or the Office for National Statistics. UKRI needs to be treated in the same way. The past five years have been particularly unpredictable for researchers in the United Kingdom, which has had four prime ministers in that time. Higher education and research need conditions of greater stability to thrive. They also need appropriate and stable funding, consistent dialogue between ministers and the research community, and a respect for the autonomy of educational and research institutions. This is not too much to ask.",nature,2024-07-02T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02169-z
Is scienceâ€™s dominant funding model broken?,"It's a well-trodden path for most people who aspire to a career in academic research: you first earn a PhD, then take a succession of fixed-term contract jobs. For a small minority, this eventually leads to the coveted role of principal investigator (PI) and the chance to set up your own research group. Many of the postdoctoral researchers you hire will harbour the same ambition. An increasing supply of talent chasing a relatively static number of permanent positions inevitably results in a tortuous route to professional status. The process of becoming a PI is stressful and precarious, and, in many ways, not reflective of the increasingly collaborative nature of science today. Nor is it healthy for the long-term interests of the research enterprise, which, according to some scientists, is struggling to produce disruptive discoveries and innovations 1 . What's the state of hiring researchers in science? Share your insights with Nature What's the state of hiring researchers in science? Share your insights with Nature These observations are hardly new. Researchers at all career stages have described them in Nature 's pages. This week, our careers team has launched its first global survey of hiring managers and research leaders , hoping to capture their experiences of the recruitment process. Research leaders have previously proposed solutions (see, for example, ref. 2), but these have had little success. Could at least part of the answer lie outside academia? In January, a team of researchers at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI), a London-based think tank established by the former UK prime minister, came up with a proposal that some academics might call radical. The team delved into the structure and outputs of academic research. To their horror, the researchers uncovered a system that, in their words, ""ends up rewarding administrators and empire-builders, not creative scientists actively engaged in research and mentoring"". They have much more to say in their report, A New National Purpose: Leading the Biotech Revolution (see go.nature.com/3vvnpy5 ), but this quote demonstrates their shock over how academia is structured and how it operates. 'Disruptive' science has declined -- and no one knows why 'Disruptive' science has declined -- and no one knows why The structure of academia is also attracting attention from high-level policymakers because science is increasingly seen as a way to boost economic growth. Growth is barely above 1% in many countries that are home to some of the world's leading universities and science-based industries, such as aerospace and pharmaceuticals. Political leaders want to know how better partnerships between academia and industry, coupled with the potential of artificial intelligence, can accelerate growth. To reliably answer their questions, advisers need an understanding of how universities work and what the impediments to improvement might be. One of the suggestions in the TBI report is to organize research and development (R&D) in some parts of academia similarly to how it is structured in some R&D-intensive corporations. Instead of distributing funding through a single PI, money and decision-making would be shared between senior leaders. According to this vision, pay and conditions would be better than in the current model, and there might also be more permanent roles available. A similar approach, called the Focused Research Organization, was described earlier this year in a commentary in Cell by Samuel Rodriques, a researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London 3 . Such models are not exclusive to corporations; they also exist in some government-funded national laboratories. These are devoted mainly to applied research, and their scientists' employment status is similar to that of civil-service workers. However, this makes external collaboration harder. A DARPA-like agency could boost EU innovation -- but cannot come at the expense of existing schemes A DARPA-like agency could boost EU innovation -- but cannot come at the expense of existing schemes Another model is seen in the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its increasing number of counterparts around the world . In this system, grant managers -- picked from a pool of some of the most successful PIs -- wield considerable power and influence. It could, therefore, be argued that this offers no real improvement over the PI model. There are other models, too, and many associated issues to unpick. The current system, in which funders award large grants to one individual, who then employs 5, 10, 20 or more people, all with the ambition of becoming a PI, has served academia well, but will inevitably lead to an oversupply of researchers. Some might say that creating more highly qualified people is a good thing, regardless of whether they choose research careers, because their knowledge and skills will benefit them regardless of their occupation. Others might disagree, arguing that research should be subject to the kinds of recruitment limitations that exist in professions such as medicine. Another argument is that society would be better off taking resources that are going into research training and investing them in programmes, such as apprenticeships, that help people to develop more targeted skills. We would like to hear your thoughts. Take part in our survey of hiring managers (see go.nature.com/3zq1x2z ) or participate in our poll (see go.nature.com/linkedin ). Do you agree that the PI model is broken? If so, what would you change and why? If you disagree, or can see downsides to the alternatives, what are you reservations? Your thoughts will inform our future coverage of this issue.",nature,2024-06-26T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02080-7
Predatory conferences are on the rise. Here are five ways to tackle them,"Imagine being a medical researcher invited to present at an eye-health conference in London. You arrive to find that the other delegates are specialists in entirely separate disciplines, such as dentistry, pharmacology and midwifery. Your fellow attendees, who have travelled from around the world, are all expecting to attend conferences in their specific fields. But it's not clear which conference is being held, why some sessions have been cancelled and why no conference organizers are present. An awareness slowly dawns: everyone has been duped. This is not a hypothetical scenario. As Nature 's Careers team reports in a two-part investigation , researchers are paying commercial conference providers the equivalent of hundreds, even thousands, of US dollars to attend such 'predatory conferences'. Institutions and funders don't seem to be aware of the scale of these operations. They need to become so, and quickly. What is it like to attend a predatory conference? What is it like to attend a predatory conference? Academic conferences are one of the main routes for career development in research. The best events have carefully curated content that has been peer-reviewed by programme committees. Talks and panels are professionally chaired, and include enough time for discussion. There's plenty of opportunity for all-important networking, and the quality of food is not an afterthought. Predatory conferences, by contrast, exist to extract money from researchers, with little or nothing in the way of academic return. Often, they come about because there are insufficient spaces for presenters at well-established conferences, and because predatory conferences exploit the need for early-career researchers to attend international conferences. Unscrupulous companies are stepping into this gap. Our reporter attended several such conferences in London between March and July. In some cases, both the academic content and the level of organization failed to meet the standards that paying delegates would expect. In other cases, conferences were better organized, but still featured presentations for which there had been little or no peer review. Often, those who are duped by such events are early-career researchers whose first language is not English. How to spot a predatory conference, and what science needs to do about them: a guide How to spot a predatory conference, and what science needs to do about them: a guide What then, can be done? Here are five potential interventions. First is to heighten awareness among researchers, institutions and funding agencies. The InterAcademy Partnership, a global network of scientific academies based in Trieste, Italy, and Washington DC, is one of the few organizations attempting to track and combat predatory conferences. However, the full extent of the problem, and the level of financial losses incurred by attendees, is broadly unknown. Second, supervisors and established researchers must advise their early-career colleagues about which conferences are genuinely useful. Predatory-event organizers target established researchers, too, as well as journal editors, with flattering offers to give keynote speeches, partly to entice early-career researchers to come. Those who receive speaking invitations need to be extra vigilant over predatory proposals. Senior researchers should flag suspicious conference invitations to junior group members and encourage them to ask about invitations they receive. Third, research communities should more regularly publicize information on good conference practices, such as the necessity of thorough peer review, and provide links to trusted organizations. Fourth, consumer-protection authorities need to become more aware of predatory conferences. Many countries have laws that protect consumer rights and have established public bodies to which people can report concerns if a physical good or a service they have been sold is not what it claims to be. Clearly, academic conferences are being sold misleadingly. And yet, according to Nature 's reporting, there is low awareness of predatory conferences among consumer-protection authorities. That needs to change, and it will need research leaders to do so. Finally, the research community as a whole needs to come together and diminish the incentives for predatory conferences to exist in the first place. That means doing a better job of meeting the scholarly and networking requirements of early-career researchers so they don't feel the need to attend any available conference. Predatory conferences are not only unethical and a waste of time and money, but also risk public trust in research if they are allowed to proliferate. International cooperation and creative solutions are needed to put a stop to this dangerous development.",nature,2024-07-30T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02445-y
We need to talk about human genome editing,"Scientists know about tens of thousands of DNA variants that are associated with human diseases. On their own, the vast majority of these variants have small effects. But taken together, the result can be substantial. The effects of modifying multiple variants at once, known as polygenic genome editing, is the subject of an analysis published this week in Nature ( P. M. Visscher et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08300-4; 2025 ). Read the paper: Heritable polygenic editing as a potential frontier in genomic medicine Read the paper: Heritable polygenic editing as a potential frontier in genomic medicine The study reveals that polygenic genome editing in human embryos could substantially reduce the likelihood of certain diseases occurring, but it raises concerns, not least the renewed threat of eugenics. There are other caveats too, the researchers report. Nature is publishing this work because it is important to start a conversation about what could happen if more-sophisticated gene-editing technologies become available, which could be the case within 30 years, the authors say. Societies need to consider relevant benefits and risks before that day comes. Peter Visscher, a statistician and geneticist at the University of Queensland, Australia, and his colleagues modelled the consequences of simultaneously editing specific variants linked to a number of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and major depressive disorder (MDD). Gene-editing tools currently in development, called multiplex technologies, are projected in the coming decades to enable rapid precision DNA editing at tens, or even hundreds, of locations. The researchers found that, in some cases, editing a single variant associated with a polygenic disease can have strong effects, and, with the exception of MDD, editing up to ten genes associated with a disease can reduce its lifetime prevalence by an order of magnitude. Human embryo editing against disease is unsafe and unproven -- despite rosy predictions Human embryo editing against disease is unsafe and unproven -- despite rosy predictions This would be a huge achievement. However, the authors also include an extensive discussion of the study's limitations and challenges. The fear that polygenic gene editing could be used for eugenics looms large among them, and is, in part, why no country currently allows genome editing in a human embryo, even for single variants. There are also significant technical caveats. The authors say that polygenic editing is unlikely to benefit the wider population in any realistic timeframe, because the technology is available only through in vitro fertilization. There are also not yet enough known causal variants for common diseases. Other limitations to the findings include the fact that many diseases are also caused by non-genetic factors, which are harder to model. Furthermore, a successful new treatment for one of the diseases is likely to reduce the need for human genome editing. There are also pleiotropic effects to consider: a gene variant that is a risk factor for one disease could offer protection against another. And then there's the risk that these technologies will widen inequality and social divisions, because the costs will probably be substantial. These issues need society-wide discussion. The past few decades have shown that new technologies are being developed ahead of conversations on their ethics or social and environmental impacts. From the atomic bomb to artificial intelligence, discussions of risks, benefits, safety, regulation and transparency have had to play catch-up. As recently as 2018, biophysicist He Jiankui shocked the world by announcing that he'd created genetically edited babies. The mistake should not be repeated. Although it will be some decades before human-gene-editing science and technologies can be applied with precision and at scale, they are on their way; this is not a hypothetical issue. The intervening time should be used wisely. Societies need to be ready, understand the upsides and the dangers, and know what to do when that time comes.",nature,2025-01-08T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00015-4
"Donâ€™t overshoot: why carbon dioxide removal will achieve too little, too late","That photograph: the one taken in Paris in December 2015, showing beaming world leaders with linked hands held overhead, celebrating their agreement to work together to stop anthropogenic climate change. It marked a turning point in international climate policy. After more than two decades of disagreements, the world had finally united, both in recognizing the threat of global warming and in pledging to take action. But what action means in practical terms has always been unclear. At the time, researchers shared with Nature their doubts about the feasibility of achieving the goal to keep the rise in global temperatures ""well below 2 degC"", while ""pursuing efforts"" to limit it to 1.5 degC. Scientists had good reason to be sceptical. Under most plausible scenarios, average temperatures will overshoot the 1.5 degC target -- a fact that was confirmed in a 2018 special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . The report suggests that, to extract enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to bring the temperature rise below the limit, methods to remove carbon from the atmosphere -- yet to be tested at scale -- will be needed. Scientists had other unanswered questions, too: what will happen while temperatures are above the threshold? How hard will it be to reverse the rising mercury in our thermometers? Overshooting global-warming limits is a risky idea Overshooting global-warming limits is a risky idea Answers are now emerging, and some of them should make us all pay attention and ask again whether people and planetary health can withstand the effects of temperature overshoots. This week in Nature , a team led by Carl-Friedrich Schleussner at Climate Analytics, a non-profit research institute in Berlin, reports that even a temporary overshoot will allow climate impacts to accumulate over the next several decades ( C. F. Schleussner et al . Nature 634 , 366-373; 2024 ). These impacts would include more severe storms, heatwaves and the destruction of ecosystems, and it won't be easy to extract enough CO 2 from the atmosphere to reverse course. Research is showing that the space for viable alternatives is limited. As world leaders and climate diplomats meet at next month's United Nations COP29 meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan, they need to take note: the wisest solution to tackle ballooning emissions is to cut, cut, cut. It's not that carbon-removal methods don't work. Some do. The simplest is, of course, planting trees. More-complex measures include extracting carbon directly from the atmosphere. But as Schleussner and his colleagues estimate, up to 400 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere by 2100 to limit warming to 1.5 degC under a higher-than-expected response of the climate system to rising carbon emissions. In emissions terms, that is equivalent to running the US energy industry in reverse for around 80 years. Even assuming that removing that amount of carbon is feasible, some Earth systems will probably not be restored to their previous equilibrium. Some changes, such as rising oceans, shifting ecosystems and regional climate change, are likely to endure, and will have lasting impacts on agriculture, and other industries. There is ""no expectation of immediate reversibility after overshoot"", the authors argue. For many people, the climate that they will experience after overshoot will not be what they had experienced before it -- even if global mean surface temperatures return to levels before the overshoot. Top climate scientists are sceptical that nations will rein in global warming Top climate scientists are sceptical that nations will rein in global warming Moreover, higher temperatures, even for a brief period, increase the risk of hitting tipping points that could kick the Earth system, or parts of it, into a completely new state, a conclusion underscored in an August study in Nature Communications by Annika Hogner at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and Tessa Moller at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria ( T. Moller et al. Nature Commun. 15 , 6192; 2024 ) and their colleagues. The authors also find that the risk of crossing climate tipping points increases as successive increments above 1.5 degC are reached. The higher the overshoot, the greater the risk of irreversible events --- such as total collapse of the Greenland ice sheet or dieback of the Amazon rainforest -- even if carbon-removal technologies successfully bring the warming back to within 1.5 degC. Nearly a decade on from the Paris agreement, the world is already on the brink of the 1.5 degC threshold and people and ecosystems in low-income countries will bear the brunt of the impacts, even though they are the least responsible. ""Overshoot entails deeply ethical questions of how much additional climate-related loss and damage people, especially those in low-income countries, would need to endure,"" Schleussner and his colleagues write. The increasing likelihood of an overshoot requires research and development of carbon-removal technologies, but first the world needs to stop pumping carbon into the atmosphere. On 30 September, the United Kingdom set an example by shutting down its last coal-fired power plant and announced investments of nearly PS22 billion (US$29 billion) over the next 25 years in carbon capture and storage technologies. The projects will be situated in two of the country's poorest coastal regions, bringing much-needed skilled jobs, training and research to areas that have been hit hard by deindustrialization. These efforts are a start. Governments and industry must have a laser-like focus on the risks ahead and how to mitigate them. This means nothing less than aggressively cutting emissions and helping communities to become resilient to the impending shocks. To wait and scrub the atmosphere later is to court disaster -- for people and the planet.",nature,2024-10-09T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03266-9
Advising governments about science is essential but difficult. So train people to do it,"Earlier this year, Nature asked science-policy specialists which country is particularly good at ensuring science is factored into government decisions. The question mystified many respondents. ""Not aware of any,"" wrote one. ""None have enviable systems,"" wrote another. ""Very hard to say,"" said a third. Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it? Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it? That sums up the poor opinion that many have of science advice to governments. Nature 's survey was sent to several thousand people worldwide, most of whom are affiliated to the International Network of Government Science Advice (INGSA), a global association of researchers and policymakers, based in Auckland, New Zealand. Some 80% of the nearly 400 respondents rated their country's science-advice system as being patchy, poor or very poor. Blame lay on both sides: 77% said that policymakers and politicians ignore and undervalue science advice, and 73% said that researchers fail to understand policy. That dismal verdict is worrying. It has been nearly five years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many scientists had difficulty giving governments advice and politicians struggled to implement it . And yet, it seems that only a few countries have stopped to make repairs. Governments today are wrestling with climate change, infectious diseases, artificial intelligence and wars. To address these issues effectively, they need knowledge from research. More than 70% of survey respondents said that misinformation and disinformation obscure science advice. Having political leaders who are receptive to science is one essential ingredient for effective science advice. Another is having people who can deliver it well. It is a misconception to think that someone successful in research will also succeed in politics and policymaking, in which events move faster than in academia and the style of delivery is as important as what is said. Improving global science advice -- and therefore improving the world -- needs people with better training and skills for the job. Why we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments Why we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments That brilliant scientists often prove ineffectual in government has been clear since at least the mid-1960s, when the first cross-government chief scientific adviser was appointed in the United Kingdom. ""Having gained access to the corridors of power, scientists could not find their way to the men's room,"" wrote science journalist Peter Ritchie Calder, in his 1975 memoir Scientists in the British Government . Politicians weren't much better, he added: they were ""deferential, even gullible, but, by and large, they did not know the right questions to ask"". A lot has changed in the intervening years. Today, many countries have well-established formal systems in which governments call on chief science advisers, national academies and committees of scientists to inform policy with evidence from research. Beyond this, research shapes policy in a spectrum of ways, from think-tank reports to scientist-politician meet-and-greets. Aside from an understanding of science, a core attribute for science advisers is a good grasp of: how governments and their departments work; the goals and deadlines of policymakers; and how evidence can be appropriately added to the mix. That experience can be gained, for example, through fellowships or internships in government agencies. In the United States, the American Association for the Advancement of Science runs one well-known fellowship in Washington DC. There are many more. Another requirement is a repertoire of people skills: the ability to communicate complex ideas in succinct, everyday language; the capacity to build trusting relationships, so that politicians have faith in the information they receive and that their confidences will not be breached; being able to respectfully understand others' views and priorities, however different. ""Only in this way can you hope to convey the evidence to them in a way that helps them understand and appreciate it,"" says Mark Ferguson, who was Ireland's chief science adviser between 2012 and 2022. Training scientists in policy is one approach. Also important is to nurture an emerging group known as knowledge brokers -- people specialized in incorporating research evidence into the machinery of government. AI tools as science policy advisers? The potential and the pitfalls AI tools as science policy advisers? The potential and the pitfalls A growing number of institutions worldwide offer training to both scientists and knowledge brokers. One is the International Institute for Science Diplomacy and Sustainability in Kuala Lumpur, which was founded last year by Zakri Abdul Hamid, a former science adviser to Malaysia's prime minister. The institute trains people to bridge science and international diplomacy, preparing them for United Nations climate meetings, for instance. INGSA offers training too, but wants to do more, says Remi Quirion, chief scientist of Quebec, Canada, and INGSA's president. Research funders and employers need to incentivize researchers to do science-advice training and work. Some 60% of survey respondents said that funders' failure to do so was an impediment to science advice. These efforts need to be informed by evidence. A study in 2022 identified more than 1,900 initiatives worldwide aimed at promoting greater engagement between policymakers and researchers, from the collaborative production of policy briefs to networking events ( K. Oliver et al . Evid. Policy 18 , 691--713; 2022 ). Only 6% had been evaluated to assess how well they worked. Today's challenges are galvanizing interest in science policy among young people who see it as a more direct way to have an impact than pure research. That's good news. It is easy for researchers to gripe that politicians don't understand science. A better response is to learn about politics and policy, and to get involved.",nature,2024-12-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03910-4
How science recruiters and job applicants can get on the same page,"Every year, tens of thousands of people around the world apply for research jobs armed with postgraduate qualifications and specialized knowledge, only for their carefully crafted applications to seemingly vanish into a digital void. At the same time, recruiters report that they are unable to find appropriate candidates for open positions. Last year, 46% of around 1,000 respondents to a survey of research hiring managers from academia and industry told Nature 's Careers team that a lack of what they regard as 'high-calibre' candidates is their topmost concern (see go.nature.com/3drcqnz ). Killer questions at science job interviews and how to ace them Killer questions at science job interviews and how to ace them One key cause of this mismatch is the perception that someone with science qualifications is fully qualified for research work. The reality is that, often, a PhD or a first postdoctoral post is the equivalent of an entry-level qualification, with the holder needing further advice, guidance, mentoring and experience before they can work independently. Shifting generational priorities also play a part. For example, most current early-career scientists are millennials, born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s. They are often digitally savvy and bring with them strong collaborative instincts and a desire to see their work have societal impact. They also tend to value work-life balance and career flexibility, which might not always square with the priorities of the scientists interviewing them for jobs. Meanwhile, employers responding to Nature 's survey report that candidates often lack creative thinking, problem-solving and communication skills and qualities such as persistence, passion and tenacity. However, there's little by way of structured training for jobseekers on how they can learn or show evidence for these characteristics . Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach. But three interventions could make a difference. As Nature has argued before , universities and other research-training institutions can do more to expand the focus of PhD training beyond the academic track. This means providing advice and guidance about what career paths and job opportunities might be available for researchers in companies, the public sector and non-governmental organizations. This could come, for example, through talks from alumni or former university-based staff who have transitioned to other sectors. For those looking to build their careers at universities, institutions could learn from other public- or private-sector employers by implementing job-shadowing schemes, for example, in which undergraduate students follow postdocs for a week. Want a new job in science? Six charts to help you land it Want a new job in science? Six charts to help you land it The large online platforms that connect researchers to potential employers need to become less robotic. Often, candidates will submit a job application in response to an advertisement and hear nothing back beyond an automated acknowledgement. Many recruiters state that they will not provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants. That is understandable for positions that might receive a large number of applicants. But it is also demoralizing for jobseekers, and gives the impression of an uncaring employer -- not somewhere where the most talented people would want to go and work. Some recruiters told Nature that they prefer to hire through their professional networks, rather than rely on the big online platforms. This is partly to weed out cut-and-paste applications, or those that seem to have been generated using artificial-intelligence tools. This shows the continued importance of networks for career development, and means that those entering the job market should receive training in how to build networks. Employers need to consider the benefits of structured training for early-career researchers, as a way to boost critical thinking and analytical skills. This could be done by reproducing the training schemes commonly used by large pharmaceutical, technology, consulting, finance and legal firms. They often include rotations so that new hires can experience working in different departments for short periods. Such schemes do not need to cost the Earth -- a legitimate concern for small- and medium-sized companies. There are other models, too, such as short-term internships. How job-seeking scientists should walk the line between high-calibre and humble How job-seeking scientists should walk the line between high-calibre and humble Overall, universities and other training bodies must accept that they need to work harder to understand the challenges that science jobseekers face and make it their mission to provide students and trainees with the skills to succeed in the current job market. The stakes here aren't just about individual careers. Failing to properly prepare researchers for professional success wastes not only researchers' potential but also society's investment in scientific training. The path forward requires jobseekers and recruiters to understand each other better. Candidates would benefit from learning why recruiters are dissatisfied with the calibre of applicants. Institutions, for their part, must see themselves as architects of scientific careers. This means acknowledging that professional preparation isn't a distraction from research excellence -- it is an essential component of it.",nature,2025-01-14T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00049-8
Act now to stop millions of research papers from disappearing,"Millions of research articles are absent from major digital archives. This worrying finding, which Nature reported on earlier this year , was laid bare in a study by Martin Eve, who studies technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London. Eve sampled more than seven million articles with unique digital object identifiers (DOIs), a string of characters used to identify and link to specific publications, such as scholarly articles and official reports. Of these, he found that more than two million were 'missing' from archives -- that is, they were not preserved in major archives that ensure literature can be found in the future ( M. P. Eve J. Libr. Sch. Commun. 12 , eP16288; 2024 ). Eve, who is also a research developer at Crossref, an organization that registers DOIs, carried out the study in an effort to better understand a problem librarians and archivists already knew about -- that although researchers are generating knowledge at an unprecedented rate, it is not necessarily being stored safely for the future. One contributing factor is that not all journals or scholarly societies survive in perpetuity. For example, a 2021 study found that a lack of comprehensive and open archiving meant that 174 open-access journals, covering all major research topics and geographical regions, vanished from the web in the first two decades of this millennium ( M. Laakso et al. J. Assoc. Inf. Sci. Technol. 72 , 1099-1112; 2021 ). Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet A lack of long-term archiving particularly affects institutions in low- and middle-income countries, less-affluent institutions in rich countries and smaller, under-resourced journals worldwide. Yet it's not clear whether researchers, institutions and governments have fully taken the problem on board. ""Preservation is an issue and it's an issue that everyone flags, but it's not an easy issue to solve,"" says Iryna Kuchma, the open-access programme manager at Electronic Information for Libraries, a non-profit organization in Vilnius that aims to improve people's access to digital information. ""More and more journals are being established with less and less checks and balances,"" says Ginny Hendricks, chief programme officer at Crossref, who is based in London. ""You've got the big publishers, who are doing a decent job, but then there's half the journals in the world that are run on a shoestring, and it costs them money to have some kind of service from preservation networks, if they even know about them."" For this Editorial, Nature asked librarians, archivists, scholars and international organizations for suggestions on how to improve the situation. Researchers, institutions and funders should take note of what they can do to help. At the heart of the problem is a lack of money, infrastructure and expertise to archive digital resources. ""Digital preservation is expensive and also quite difficult,"" says Kathleen Shearer, who is based in Montreal, Canada, and is the executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories, a global network of scholarly archives. ""It is not just about creating backup copies of things. It is about the active management of content over time in a rapidly evolving technological environment."" For institutions that can afford it, one solution is to pay a preservation archive to safeguard content. Examples include Portico, based in New York City, and CLOCKSS, based in Stanford, California, both of which count a raft of publishers and libraries as customers. But archiving is often not prioritized when money is tight, as it generally is for publishers in low-resource settings. ""That is more of a challenge because a lot of these journals are small and they're more at risk because they don't have their own robust infrastructures for platforms and preservation services themselves,"" says Kate Wittenberg, Portico's managing director. Another option could be for institutions and funding bodies to include text and data archiving as a requirement in research projects, along with publishing papers. At a minimum, this would mean depositing work in institutional repositories, in cases in which such facilities exist. When they don't, making archiving mandatory would compel researchers and their funding bodies to think hard and find solutions to meet an archiving requirement. Making archiving obligatory would also encourage universities that don't yet operate their own repositories to work towards instituting them. ""Universities are one of the most enduring elements of our society,"" says Hussein Suleman, a digital libraries scholar at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. ""If we adopted this widely, this would be a safeguarding mechanism for the knowledge of our current generation so the future generations can access it."" A further option is for more countries to implement 'legal deposit libraries' -- keystone libraries into which authors or publishers are obliged to deposit new work. The concept was originally devised so that at least one institution always had a publicly available copy of every published book, but in some countries it has since been expanded to include research works. Further expanding it would not offer a complete solution, because material archived in legal deposit is not easy to find -- but it could be done as an absolute minimum to ensure that copies of scholarship continue to exist if their originators are no longer able to support archiving. More or better coordination ""between the big players globally"" is also needed, says Hendricks. And global should not only mean Western, she adds. Increasing people's access to knowledge and increasing the visibility of new research is rightly a focus for global research-publishing policy. Archiving is core to this -- and core to scholarship itself. As Eve told Nature in March: ""Our entire epistemology of science and research relies on the chain of footnotes."" If access to this knowledge becomes more restricted, the research that survives will be dominated by institutions, such as those in Europe and the United States, that have the funds to safeguard their research in archives. Action must be taken now to ensure that records of the scholarship undertaken by everyone, everywhere, can exist in perpetuity.",nature,2024-11-26T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03842-z
Why is mathematics education failing some of the worldâ€™s most talented children?,"Growing up in India, economist Abhijit Banerjee was always intrigued by the impressive mental arithmetic skills of young people working in the stalls at the local fruit and vegetable markets. ""I used to tag along with my grandfather"" to these markets and ""I could see kids ... who could do the mathematics involved"", he told the Nature podcast . ""You could buy five things and then give them some money and they would give you the correct change back, you know, quite complicated calculations."" Through his work in India, Banerjee, who is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, revealed that these same young people are doing poorly in tests of mathematical proficiency similar to those that determine their success at school and beyond. The results indicate that maths education must broaden its scope and approaches to serve all -- especially the talented and hard-working children from lower-income families. The question is: how? School smart or street smart? Maths skills of children in India tested School smart or street smart? Maths skills of children in India tested Maths education is becoming ever more important worldwide. Written assessments are set to become more complex as countries adapt their schools' curricula to meet the needs of our increasingly data-rich world, incorporating data and computational literacy along with conventional textbook maths. Proficiency in the kind of maths assessed in written exams is key to careers in computing, engineering, mathematics and science. A sound grasp of principles of mathematical reasoning is also necessary for other professions and for many life skills. In practice, a student leaving school today would ideally need to know, perhaps using basic algebra and statistics knowledge, how to interpret the infographics that fill their social-media feeds. They should have some understanding of coding principles, even if they haven't written code themselves. And they need to be familiar with, if not be proficient in using, spreadsheets and other programs. Innovative approaches are needed to ensure that children benefit from such education. In a study published last week, Banerjee, economist Esther Duflo at MIT, psychologist Elizabeth Spelke at Harvard University in Cambridge and their colleagues compared the maths proficiency of two groups of young people under the age of 18 years in India ( A. V. Banerjee et al . Nature https://doi.org/n5xz; 2025 ). Both groups attended school, but one group also worked in markets. The researchers found that the working group was more proficient in mental arithmetic than the other one . Yet, those who worked performed poorly in standard written tests of arithmetic problems, such as doing long division. Read the paper: Children's arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics Read the paper: Children's arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics The results reveal both the power of learning-by-doing and its pitfalls. This method doesn't automatically lead to success in existing written tests. To do better, these children need help with mathematical reasoning, to complement their rapid mental addition and subtraction skills. Moreover, if a student is already struggling with written assessments in long division and algebra, telling them that they need to learn how to do statistics and use coding programs, such as Python, will not yield the desired outcomes. Better teaching is crucial, but worldwide, there's a shortage of trained maths teachers. Changing that and improving how mathematics is taught should be a top priority for education systems, says mathematician and educator Marcus du Sautoy at the University of Oxford, UK. There are, however, several obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this, as studies, including those by science-education researcher Jonathan Osborne at Stanford University in California, have shown ( C. D. Wilson et al. J. Res. Sci. Teach. 61 , 38-69; 2024 ). The first is that many if not most standard assessment systems globally do not reward an understanding of reasoning -- that is, how a particular result was arrived at (the stories behind the maths and science). They reward a mastery of the method and an ability to get the right answer. Second, relatively few teachers are skilled at teaching reasoning and describing maths through storytelling, and of those, even fewer teach students from low-income families. These obstacles and others must be overcome. It will require big-picture thinking, assessment of the latest research and action from all those involved in maths-education policy. Banerjee and his colleagues have shone a much-needed light on a reservoir of underappreciated talent. With the right guidance, these children could one day be working in research laboratories, establishing start-up companies -- and becoming the maths teachers that their countries so desperately need, not least to help future generations to achieve their full potential.",nature,2025-02-12T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00402-x
Nobel prizes are globally unrepresentative â€” the nomination process must be opened up,"It's Nobel Prize week, and history indicates that the scientists in with the best chance of winning are men from Europe or North America. If you were born anywhere else in the world, your best chance of getting an invitation to Stockholm is to find a research job in a North American or European country and relocate. Thus concludes a Nature Feature published last week called ' How to win a Nobel prize '. The analysis also notes that prizewinning science is often performed by teams that share 'family' links with previous winners ( R. S. J. Tol Scientometrics 129 , 1329-1346; 2024 ). How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals? How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals? Representatives of the organizations that select the Nobel prizewinners have told Nature that they are continuously working to better recognize diversity in science. And there has been noticeable movement. In the entirety of the twentieth century, only 11 Nobel prizes in chemistry, physics, or physiology or medicine were awarded to women. Between 2000 and 2023, 15 women received awards (not all of this year's prizes had been announced by the time Nature went to press). Throughout Nobel history, only ten prizewinners have been born in countries currently classified by the World Bank as low- or lower-middle-income countries, and most had moved to North America or Europe by the time they received the award. Some might view that as simply reflecting the continuing reality of where the balance of power -- and funding -- lies in science. But the starkness of the numbers raises the question of how the Nobel prizes -- and, by extension, other high-profile international prizes -- can capture the depth and diversity of world science as it is today. China is a case in point. Today, the country hosts seven of the world's top ten institutions as ranked by their contributions to natural- and health-sciences journals tracked by the Nature Index database . So far, only ten Chinese-born or Chinese-heritage scientists have won a science Nobel prize. One continuing barrier is the invitation-only nominations process. According to the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, individuals from named categories can nominate recipients without needing permission to do so . These include: previous winners, professors at universities in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway, members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and members of the relevant Nobel awarding committees. Most others need an official letter inviting them to nominate. Medicine Nobel awarded for gene-regulating 'microRNAs' Medicine Nobel awarded for gene-regulating 'microRNAs' Thomas Perlmann, a molecular biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and secretary of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature : ""We are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan. Moreover, we're actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators."" The nominations process has two stages: university professors, deans and senior leaders are sent letters asking for the names of scientists who could be eligible to nominate potential prizewinners; selected scientists are then asked for their nominations. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm selects the Nobel laureates in chemistry and physics, and the physiology or medicine prize is awarded by the Karolinska Institute. Peter Brzezinski, a biochemist at Stockholm University and secretary of the chemistry committee, says that the academy has identified around 1,250 universities to write to. Because of a lack of capacity, each will receive, on average, an invitation only every five years. If the Nobel organizations are to write to larger numbers of people, they will need to increase their capacity for the task -- or accept offers of assistance from elsewhere. Over the years, international scientific networks that have access to a large and diverse pool of names of potential nominators have told Nature that they would be willing to help. These include the African Academy of Sciences, based in Nairobi; the InterAcademy Partnership, a network of the world's science academies; the International Science Council, which represents more than 250 scientific unions, associations and other bodies; and the World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). TWAS is a fellowship network for leading scientists that was established in 1983 by a group of researchers led by the late Pakistani physicist and Nobel laureate Abdus Salam. The current TWAS president, Quarraisha Abdool Karim, says that the organization's 1,400 fellows, most of whom are based at universities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are well placed to suggest people to nominate. They only need to be asked. Physics Nobel scooped by machine-learning pioneers Physics Nobel scooped by machine-learning pioneers As Daniel Schaffer wrote in his book TWAS at 20 (2005), there were two options for many researchers from LMICs when the academy was founded four decades ago: ""Focus on your career and turn your back on your home; or stay home and sacrifice your career."" Today, as Abdool Karim says, excellence is everywhere as science continues to grow and flourish beyond its previous centres of power. There is no doubt that the Nobel-awarding organizations are aware of what needs to be done and the scale of the task involved in continuing to broaden the pool of prize nominees. Change will take time. Many laureates have waited decades for their work to be recognized, although a long time lag is not a given; some have been rewarded within a few years of their prizewinning discoveries. The organizations that award the Nobels should accept the offers of help to identify people eligible to nominate. It is one thing to have a prize that is not a reflection of the world; quite another for it not to reflect the world of science.",nature,2024-10-08T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03267-8
Animal research is not always king: researchers should explore the alternatives,"It's been more than a year since US President Joe Biden signed a law allowing researchers to test drug candidates on human tissue or computer models before moving to trials in people. This challenged a regulatory dogma, accepted since the 1930s, that vaccines and drugs need to be tested on one rodent species and one non-rodent, such as a primate. Researchers such as Ofer Levy, a vaccinologist at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts, rejoiced. Levy has long advocated that studies in human tissue can, in some cases, be more informative than those done on animals. But the number of researchers who don't know about the law, which was signed in December 2022, stuns him: ""I mention it, and they look at me like I fell from the sky,"" he says. Animal studies are still important and often necessary, especially in the latter stages of vaccine and drug development. Moreover, researchers and funders need to be cautious and establish a way to carefully validate disease models based on human tissue. The changed mandate for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a reminder for researchers to reduce their reliance on animals, particularly in early-stage research. Global data on animals in research are incomplete, but there are signs that the number of scientific procedures performed on live animals is falling in some countries. According to UK government data for example, 2.76 million such procedures were performed in the country in 2022. This is the lowest number since 2002, and markedly lower than the 4.14-million peak in 2015 . Octopuses used in research could receive same protections as monkeys Octopuses used in research could receive same protections as monkeys What, then, are the alternatives? Induced pluripotent stem cells -- which have been 'reprogrammed' so that they can turn into any cell type -- offer a way to generate human cells from skin or blood samples. Organoids, 3D cultures that can comprise multiple cell types, take such Petri-dish systems to the next level. They allow researchers to evaluate the interplay between cell types and the importance of their spatial organization on drug responses. Researchers are innovating in other ways, too. Small tissue samples can yield a wealth of data, which means human biopsies taken using very fine needles, which minimize the risk of harm, can be used for such studies. Such approaches will never completely replace animal research. An organoid is not a full substitute for a mouse when evaluating, for example, how an experimental drug is absorbed and metabolized throughout the body. But these techniques allow for more initial hypotheses to be based on human-tissue responses to the environment or a disease, rather than beginning with observations of the animal model and looking for parallels in humans. An important application has been in immunology. Although much has been learnt about the human immune system by studying mice, there are key differences between biological processes in the two species 1 , so a particular mouse immune response might not be replicated in a human. For example, differences in how mice respond to infection have generally made them poor models of sepsis, a life-threatening condition in which the body's reaction to infection can damage organs. As a result, treatments for sepsis developed in rodents have translated poorly to humans 2 . Can lab-grown brains become conscious? Can lab-grown brains become conscious? Even among humans, responses to vaccines can vary by age, sex and geographical region in ways that are often difficult to model using animals 3 . And it is difficult to discover the molecular basis of longevity in a human centenarian while rifling through the genome of a rodent that reaches old age within two years. Around 90% of therapies tested in early-stage clinical trials fail to make it to market -- a failure rate thought to result partially from a heavy reliance on animal models in preclinical research. Cancer cures in mice rarely translate to approved drugs in humans. And then there are animal-rights concerns. Researchers must have a strong justification for using animals in their studies, and even then, there are rules limiting their use. For example, according to NIH guidance, it is inhumane to keep a mouse alive in a lab after some of the painful and debilitating consequences of ageing begin to take hold. Experiments involving animals can also t ake an emotional toll on the researchers who carry out the work . And studies on captive primates raise extra ethical concerns , particularly when the work is outsourced to countries with relatively few restrictions on primate research. Replacing animals in studies with human tissue brings its own challenges, which need to be mitigated if the practice is to become widespread. Correlations found in human-tissue biopsies, for example, might require subsequent experiments in animals to establish causality. Conducting such studies in humans could be complex, expensive and ethically fraught. And just because a technique is based on human cells, that doesn't make it necessarily superior. Funders and researchers will need to invest in the validation of these methods, by comparing results of computer predictions or tests using organoids with the results of clinical trials of the same experimental drug. Even Levy emphasizes that animals are also crucial for parts of his team's research. ""We still make use of animal models -- just 70-80% less than the average research group,"" he says. The FDA policy allowing non-animal data to be used to support drug approvals needs to be much better communicated and amplified by the agency, funders and research institutions. And more researchers need to embrace the change. The outcome will be more-rigorous evaluation of experimental medications, and more-meaningful results.",nature,2024-07-16T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02314-8
Menopause research is globally underfunded. Itâ€™s time to change that,"Menopause -- the cessation of menstruation -- will be experienced by the overwhelming majority of women at some time in their lives. It's hallmark symptoms include poor sleep, hot flushes and low mood; it also brings with it an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and memory loss. Yet, it has rarely been a priority for health systems, or indeed for research. That something experienced by half of humanity is not more studied is little short of scandalous. The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health In some parts of the world, the situation might be changing, albeit slowly, as we report this week in a News Feature . The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), for example, is working with researchers to create a strategy for menopause research. Researchers are revisiting the potential of hormone therapy, a once-popular treatment, while also exploring ways to prolong ovarian life and therefore delay the onset of menopause. At the same time, an increasing number of health-care professionals are showing interest in becoming certified to treat menopause. In the United States between 2022 and 2024, for example, there was a fivefold increase in people applying to take the certification exam of the Menopause Society, a non-profit organization in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Many of these initiatives need to become better known. On the funding side, perhaps one of the more surprising things is that, so far, few funders seem to be following in the NIH's footsteps. Women's health: end the disparity in funding Women's health: end the disparity in funding Menopause occurs typically between 45 and 55 years old. It can also occur earlier for a variety of reasons, including natural causes, or because of disease or as a result of treatment. The experience of menopause can be improved through hormone therapy, which works by replenishing some hormones that are depleted during menopause, particularly oestrogen and progesterone. However, early results in 2002 from an influential study by the Women's Health Initiative changed how many women and health-care providers perceive hormone therapy ( Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative Investigators JAMA 288 , 321-333; 2002 ). One of the study's findings was that people who had been through menopause and who were taking oestrogen and a synthetic form of progesterone had a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. Globally, prescriptions for menopause-related hormone therapy dropped sharply. Numbers struggled to recover even after later studies emphasized the limitations of the original findings. Researchers and clinicians are still playing catch-up in trying to get across the message that, as well as managing menopause symptoms, the long-term benefits of menopausal hormone therapy could outweigh the risks for those for whom hormone therapy is a suitable treatment. For this editorial, Nature asked some of the larger health-research funding agencies in the United States and Europe about their record and plans for menopause research. The overwhelming majority of studies in the field of ageing do not consider menopause, according to a paper in Nature Aging ( G. Gilmer et al. Nature Aging 3 , 1500-1508; 2023 ). The NIH established a category for menopause research in 2023, and is working on a research agenda. The sums involved are not huge, it must be said, but this is not a complete surprise. As we have reported before, conditions that mainly affect women garner much less funding than do those that predominantly affect men. The NIH allocated US$56 million to menopause studies in 2023, projected to increase to $58 million this year. Women's health research lacks funding -- these charts show how Women's health research lacks funding -- these charts show how The US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, which has a focus on high-risk, high-reward topics, has two menopause projects that are together worth $13.5 million, with one to extend ovarian function and lifespan, and another to develop ovarian implants to prevent diseases associated with menopause. Horizon Europe, the world's largest multinational research-funding programme, has awarded EUR12 million (US$12.4 million) to a consortium of universities for a project called Caramel, which aims to prevent cardiovascular disease in women aged 40-60. However, Horizon Europe does not have a separate menopause category. Neither does it have a category for women's health, instead including the subject in a general 'health' portfolio of grants. Last October, Pivotal Ventures, an organization established by philanthropist Melinda French Gates, launched a $250-million funding call aimed at organizations around the world that are working to improve women's health. Overall, however, menopause is not a defined category for many of the world's largest philanthropic funders, also including Wellcome in London and the Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. Possibly for this reason, neither of these agencies was able to tell Nature the precise extent of their menopause-related funding. Establishing a separate category of research might seem arcane, but it is unambiguously a sign that funders consider menopause to be a priority. It allows researchers to know how much money is available and how to apply for it; and lets them track what has been spent in the past and who received it. The disruptive nature of menopause and its health impacts have been known perhaps for millennia and frankly should have been a priority topic for health funders for a long time. It is never too late to start.",nature,2025-01-22T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00150-y
"Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits","People in some 70 countries took part in various national elections this year, a record number. And in March, Nature reported that results in at least five polls could either boost or block climate action (see Nature 627 , 22-25; 2024 ). Overall, it has been a dismal year, particularly for science in multilateral policymaking. The tension and mistrust between nations evident in the daily news is affecting the use of science in decision-making. Research is being ignored in international talks designed to meet global challenges, including those addressed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Campaigners, scientists and policymakers are becoming ever more frustrated. Some are taking action through legislative means -- this month, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, has been hearing arguments about states' obligations under international law to protect people from the effects of climate change. Others are opting for a more direct route, through science activism . In the climate-change sector especially, there's a view that the processes of the summits known as Conference of the Parties (COP) have had their day or, at the very least, need to be reformed. The research community needs to carefully and systematically study why scientific knowledge is being pushed out, as a first step to finding a way forward. Let's start with international climate negotiations. Even by COP standards, the COP29 climate-change conference in Baku last month ended with unusual acrimony between rich and poor nations about who is ultimately responsible for tackling the climate crisis. The funds eventually agreed -- US$300 billion annually for developing clean-energy technologies and for nations to adapt to the effects of climate change -- are inadequate to help the world avert dangerous levels of climate change, and to help some of the most vulnerable people deal with its effects. Is the COP29 climate deal a historic breakthrough or letdown? Researchers react Is the COP29 climate deal a historic breakthrough or letdown? Researchers react The UN COP16 biodiversity meeting in Cali, Colombia, also ended without the funding boost needed to restore and protect nature. Countries pledged $163 million, which is orders of magnitude short of the $200 billion a year needed to reach the goal of protecting 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030. Delegates did agree that large companies should pay if they made a profit using genetic information from nature, but payments will be voluntary. The international community is also sharply divided on the scope of an agreement that is being negotiated to end plastics pollution. The latest talks in Busan, South Korea, have been extended into 2025 . Talks on a pandemic treaty have also been pushed to next year. African nations are at odds with Europe and the United States over a request that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should have preferential access to pandemic-related products that are developed using their data. And at the end of last week, delegates left the UN conference on dealing with droughts and desertification (UNCCD) in Riyadh without arranging to begin talks on a legally binding protocol to tackle the issue. However, they did agree to expand the UNCCD's body of independent scientific advisers. September's Summit of the Future in New York City, organized by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres also ended with some positive outcomes, including a bold statement that recognizes science as essential to tackling global challenges in its final document, the Pact for the Future . But questions need to be asked as to how this statement can be implemented in the current, highly polarized political climate. It might seem that the world is in a golden age of science in multilateral policymaking. Researchers at universities, in campaign groups and in industry are attending COPs and other meetings in considerable numbers: at least 3,000 scientists attended last year's COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (see 'COP28 in numbers'). They have a variety of roles. Some advise nations' delegates, the policymakers involved in treaty negotiations. Others are members of official UN science advisory committees. And some come to the meetings to take advantage of the presence of the global media to publicize their research. And yet, despite scientists' presence, it is evident to observers that COP delegates are not taking research into account in the actual talks. If they were, then negotiating positions would not be as polarized as they are becoming. For instance, Nature argued last month that a study of climate finance by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would help to take some of the heat out of disagreements over money. Before the IPCC can commission such a study, a few countries have to propose it. However, until now, there have been no takers. This lack of interest seems like a break from the past, when research helped to shape legally binding agreements, such as the 1989 Montreal Protocol to prohibit the use of ozone-depleting substances, and the 1997 Kyoto Climate Protocol. And in 2015, research was at the core of the design of the SDGs . Even though groups of scientists in several countries have proposed ways to end plastic pollution, they are struggling to make their voices heard at the talks on a plastics treaty. This is because the UN still hasn't organized a formal system for researchers to advise during the discussions. It's worth reflecting for a moment on why research is currently struggling to have an impact. When the present system of science advice in UN meetings was originally established, the United States and European countries were the world's largest economies. Their delegates often dominated proceedings, or at least commanded an outsize presence during talks. Much of the research that underpinned UN environmental agreements also came from these nations, as did the scientists observing the talks and many of the world's influential media outlets covering them. How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work But that world is changing. China is the second largest economy globally and India is on a path to becoming the third. An increasing amount of SDG-related research is now coming from LMICs . At the same time, the place of science in negotiations is affected by this shift in the balance of power. Put simply: when research is performed, or funded, by high-income countries, it is perceived by some in LMICs as being biased in favour of the negotiating positions of the governments of those nations. Overall, the system that scientists use to access and influence UN environmental agreements is under strain. Meeting organizers, delegates and leaders of research institutions must find a way forward together. Science-based decision-making is what will ultimately help the world to resolve the crises it faces. It's important to understand how and why research is being pushed to the margins and what needs to be done to get policy back on track.",nature,2024-12-17T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04113-7
Scientists must hold President Trump to account with courage and unity,"When Donald Trump was first elected to the US presidency in 2016, Nature advised scientists to constructively engage with Trump . We said that the incoming president's contrary approach to evidence, among other things, had no place in modern society. We added that the science community had a responsibility to step up and work with the president and his new administration so that they govern on the basis of research and evidence. 'We need to be ready for a new world': scientists globally react to Trump election 'We need to be ready for a new world': scientists globally react to Trump election And yet, during Trump's first term, the world saw a government that ignored and undermined efforts to address some of the world's greatest problems, such as climate change and a global pandemic. Many researchers left US federal science agencies, their place sometimes taken by lobbyists and political appointees. The United States has now re-elected Donald Trump as president. Many researchers have told Nature that they are in despair , seeing the election result as a step backwards for facts, reason, knowledge and civility. Last week, Nature said that the United States needs a leader who respects evidence . The incoming administration must embody this principle. On behalf of the research community, we will hold it to account if it falls short. We hope that the incoming administration will govern in the best interests of the United States. That means holding on to the best of what the previous administration did, and not returning to some of the policies of the first Trump presidency. The world needs a US president who respects evidence The world needs a US president who respects evidence This includes respecting the scientific consensus when making regulatory decisions in public health, environmental issues, artificial intelligence and elsewhere. This is one of the cornerstones of modern government. Policymakers and politicians retain control over decision-making, but they cannot control the facts. Climate change must also remain a crucial priority. During the past four years, the United States took important steps in recognizing that it is in its own interests to not stand still as global temperatures continue to increase. It enacted policies to support industries and communities through the coming sustainability transition. If those policies are repealed, people on the lowest incomes and those from marginalized communities will be among those most affected. Both the United States and the world are at their best when the country engages internationally. That means not repeating the previous Trump administration's decision to exit the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- an accord aimed at protecting the world from the impacts of climate change, which US scientists helped to craft. And it means continuing to support other important international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations science and cultural organization UNESCO. The US is the world's science superpower -- but for how long? The US is the world's science superpower -- but for how long? Trump's threat to defund the WHO in 2020 was especially dangerous for those low-income countries where the agency's work is crucial for tackling diseases and maintaining standards of public-health infrastructure. Currently, the WHO's epidemiologists, clinicians and logistics personnel are helping to treat and control diseases in countries including Afghanistan, Ukraine, Sudan and Yemen. Diseases do not respect borders: to cooperate and engage with international institutions to fight their spread is in the best interests of the United States. The United States is a nation that welcomes the world's talent, in science and in other fields. That must continue if the country wants to maintain its strength in research and innovation, the bedrock of prosperity. The research community must engage with the new administration with courage, tenacity, strength and unity. At the same time, scientists in the United States must know that they are not alone. The research community is a global one. We need to stand together and stand strong for the challenges that are to come. And that will mean continuing to speak facts to power.",nature,2024-11-06T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03648-z
Vaccines save lives: how can uptake be increased?,"Vaccines save lives. The measles vaccine alone is estimated to have averted 23 million deaths between 2000 and 2018, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Data from a subset of countries where girls are vaccinated against the human papillomavirus show that precancerous cervical lesions in girls aged 15-19 plummeted by 51% within a few years of vaccine rollout 1 . Globally, vaccination rates are increasing for many diseases. However, in 2022 (the latest year for which data are available), there were still 14.3 million 'zero-dose' children -- those who had not received any routine immunizations. A lack of access to vaccines and the high costs of producing and purchasing them are among the main reasons for low uptake, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In high-income countries, vaccine hesitancy is a significant factor 2 . This is fuelled, in part, by misinformation, which is a problem worldwide 3 . Countries already have a range of strategies for boosting uptake. All should study the work of researchers who have been evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions. The burgeoning science of vaccine-uptake effectiveness is throwing up some unexpected results that could help public-health authorities to sharpen their policies -- and save more lives. Bird flu in US cows: where will it end? Bird flu in US cows: where will it end? Take the United States. By October 2022, almost two years after the first COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out, 80% of people in the country aged six months and older had received at least one dose. However, only 33% had received a follow-up booster, which offers the highest possible level of protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The low booster numbers drove some states to investigate how uptake might be increased. Researchers and health authorities have highlighted 'last-mile vaccination delivery' as a major barrier to uptake. In 2021, the White House came up with the idea of encouraging people to get their boosters by offering them free transport to clinics through the ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber. But a study published in Nature last month 4 shows that this might have done little to increase booster uptake. Economist Katherine Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia and her colleagues compared the offer of a free ride with other interventions in a study involving 3.66 million patients of CVS Pharmacy, a retailer that provides vaccination services. The patients, who had all previously been vaccinated against COVID-19, were split into eight groups. One group received a text message offering free transport to the pharmacy; the other seven were sent different text-message reminders to get their boosters. A global pandemic treaty is in sight: don't scupper it A global pandemic treaty is in sight: don't scupper it People offered free transport were not more likely to get vaccinated than were those who received the other kinds of text message. Messages that had a more positive effect included one proposing an appointment for a day of the week and time of day similar to that of a patient's previous vaccination, and one informing the recipient that infection rates were high in their county. ""Our article really highlights the importance of testing policy,"" says study co-author Sean Ellis, also at UPenn. ""Whatever policy we're putting into place, we should be robustly evaluating whether it actually works, so that if it does work, we can scale it up or continue to do it. And if it doesn't, we can move on from it and try something else."" In other words, studies are needed to evaluate whether 'common sense' interventions actually work in practice. Researchers are also helping to evaluate the overall effectiveness of text messaging on vaccine uptake. In a study published in May, Hongyu Guan at Shaanxi Normal University in Xi'an, China, and colleagues used the 2021 Chinese General Social Survey, a periodic national survey of households, to examine the actions of 7,281 people. They found that those who received notifications from their local government or community residents' committees advising them to get vaccinated were twice as likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine than were those who did not 5 . Half a million children die of malaria every year - finally we can change that Half a million children die of malaria every year - finally we can change that The same study showed that the practice also increased influenza vaccine uptake, albeit from a much lower base. Uptake was more than 40% higher for those notified compared with those who did not receive a text message. This finding builds on the work of earlier studies 6 . However, researchers are less certain whether these approaches are effective for people who are reluctant to be vaccinated 7 . In low-income countries, research shows that uptake increases when vaccines are taken into communities. In Sierra Leone, for example, the average person lives 3.5 hours away from a vaccination centre and the cost to travel there exceeds their weekly wage. A study published in March 8 found that significantly more people in the country received their COVID-19 vaccines when mobile teams of vaccinators were deployed to 150 rural communities. Increasing vaccine access and accessibility saves lives, but is only part of the equation. Other interventions are needed to maximize uptake, and these must undergo rigorous testing in different regions and contexts to help health authorities to determine what works. The obvious answer is not always the right one, and the vagaries of human behaviour can thwart seemingly logical solutions.",nature,2024-07-09T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02224-9
More-powerful AI is coming. Academia and industry must oversee it â€” together,"""It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I'm confident we'll get there."" So wrote Sam Altman , the chief executive of OpenAI, a technology firm based in San Francisco, California, on 23 September. This was less than two weeks after the company behind ChatGPT released o1 , its most advanced large language model (LLM) yet. Once confined to the realms of science fiction, the rise of LLMs in the past few years has renewed the relevance of the question of when we might create artificial general intelligence (AGI). Although it lacks a precise definition, AGI broadly refers to an AI system capable of human-level reasoning, generalization, planning and autonomy. How close is AI to human-level intelligence? How close is AI to human-level intelligence? Policymakers everywhere have questions about AGI, including what its benefits and risks will be. These are not easy questions to answer, especially given that much of the work is happening in the private sector , in which studies are not always published openly. But what is clear is that AI companies are laser-focused on giving their systems the whole range of cognitive abilities enjoyed by humans. Companies developing AI models have a strong incentive to maintain the idea that AGI is nigh, to attract interest and therefore investment. There was a consensus among researchers who spoke to Nature for a News Feature published this week (see Nature 636 , 22-25; 2024 ) that large language models (LLMs), such as o1, Google's Gemini and Claude, made by Anthropic, based in San Francisco, have not yet delivered AGI. And, informed by insights from neuroscience, many say that there are good reasons to think that LLMs never will, and that another technology will be needed for AI to achieve human-level intelligence. Despite their breadth of ability -- from generating computer code to summarizing academic articles and answering mathematics questions -- there are fundamental limitations in the way the most powerful LLMs work, which involves essentially devouring a mass of data and using that to predict the next 'token' in a series. That generates plausible answers to a problem, rather than actually solving it. AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think Francois Chollet, a software engineer formerly at Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, have tested o1's performance on tasks that require abstract reasoning and planning, and found that it comes up short of AGI. If AGI is to happen, some researchers think that AI systems would need coherent 'world models', or representations of their surroundings that they can use to test hypotheses, reason, plan and generalize knowledge learnt in one domain to potentially limitless other situations. This is where ideas from neuroscience and cognitive science could propel the next breakthroughs. Yoshua Bengio's team at the University of Montreal, Canada, for example, is exploring alternative AI architectures that would better support the building of coherent world models and the ability to reason using such models. Some researchers argue that the next breakthroughs in AI might come not from the biggest systems, but from smaller, more-energy-efficient AI. Smarter systems in the future could also require less data to train if they had the ability to decide which aspects of their environment to sample, rather than simply ingesting everything they are fed, says Karl Friston, a theoretical neuroscientist at University College London. Such work demonstrates that researchers from an array of fields need to be involved in AI development. This will be necessary to verify what systems are truly capable of, ensure that they live up to the technology companies' claims and identify the breakthroughs needed for development. However, right now, accessing the leading AI systems can be difficult for researchers who don't work at the companies that can afford the vast quantity of graphical processing units (GPUs) needed to train the systems ( A. Khandelwal et al . Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/nt67; 2024 ). ChatGPT broke the Turing test -- the race is on for new ways to assess AI ChatGPT broke the Turing test -- the race is on for new ways to assess AI To give a sense of the scale of activity, in 2021, US government agencies (excluding the Department of Defense) allocated US$1.5 billion to AI research and development, and the European Commission spends around EUR1 billion (US$1.05 billion) annually. By contrast, companies worldwide spent more than $340 billion on AI research in 2021 ( N. Ahmed et al. Science 379 , 884-886; 2023 ). There are ways that governments could fund AI research on a bigger scale, for example by pooling resources. The Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe, a non-profit organization based in The Hague, the Netherlands, has suggested building a 'CERN for AI' that can attract the same level of talent as AI companies do and so create a cutting-edge research environment. It is hard to predict when AGI might arrive -- estimates range from a few years from now to a decade or longer. But more huge advances in AI will certainly happen, and many of them will probably come from industry, considering the scale of investment. To ensure that these advances are beneficial, the research from technology companies needs to be verified using the best current understanding of what constitutes human intelligence, according to neuroscience, cognitive science, social science and other relevant fields. This publicly funded research needs to have a key role in AGI's development. Humanity needs to bring all knowledge to bear so that applications of AI research are robust and its risks are mitigated as much as possible. Governments, companies, research funders and researchers need to recognize their complementary strengths. If they do not, then insights that could help to improve AI will be missed -- and the resulting systems risk being unpredictable and therefore unsafe.",nature,2024-12-06T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03911-3
2025 must be the year when the rules of global finance are reformed,"In 2022, the latest year for which full data are available, the world spent just short of US$10 trillion on health care. The United States was by far the largest single spender, representing 43% of the total. At the other end, around 75 of the poorest countries spent less than 4% of the global total, and many are not allowed to increase this. That's because they owe huge sums to richer countries -- and the lending agreements say that paying off debts has to be prioritized ahead of public spending. Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits This is just one example of how inequity is baked into the world's financial system -- creditors can dictate lending terms to some of the most vulnerable countries without any oversight. However, in June and July 2025, the international community will have an opportunity to ensure that this situation can be consigned to history. Leaders of global financial institutions will meet in Seville, Spain, for a summit on funding the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), of which SDG3 is about ensuring health for all. By some estimates, upwards of $2 trillion annually are needed to achieve the SDGs, according to analysis (see go.nature.com/4iigk6c ) from the UN's trade body UNCTAD, based in Geneva, Switzerland. As we reported in our December 2024 editorial ( Nature 636 , 521-522; 2024 ), the sums of money currently on offer are much lower than what is needed. Delegates should strain every sinew to ensure that the Seville meeting succeeds. Today's 'international financial architecture' has its roots in the 1944 UN Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. This meeting created two global lenders: the World Bank to finance post-war reconstruction, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a sort of 'lender of last resort'. As the most powerful nation to emerge from the war, the United States became the largest shareholder in both the World Bank and the IMF, with veto powers on key policy decisions. Washington DC was chosen as both organizations' headquarters and the dollar became the world's reserve currency -- all countries use it to trade and for borrowing. The rest of the world essentially lives by these rules. Economists knew that the system had flaws. For example, when central banks raise interest rates to bring down inflation, it can make many other countries poorer by putting more pressure on borrowers to find the money needed to keep up with loan repayments. This happened during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation was worsened because many currencies also lost significant value against the US dollar, in part because of restrictions on exports. And so, at a time when countries need to obtain significant extra financing to achieve the SDGs, many are instead battling to remain solvent. And when they go to climate or biodiversity conferences, there's little financing offered, with creditor countries saying they have to prioritize austerity at home. Many low- and middle-income countries have therefore sought alternative routes. China, for example, is now a big global lender in its own right, offering a mix of grants and loans at concessionary rates, independently of the IMF and the World Bank. China is the main shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Together with other countries in the BRICS group -- including Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa -- it has also established another international lender called the New Development Bank. There is a lack of formal coordination between old and new lenders, which is among the reasons the Seville meeting must prioritize financial-governance reform. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres wants to create a coordinating body for international financial institutions. Lenders need to be supervised by regulatory bodies. The world's largest lenders have no such system or body to report to. When a team from the World Bank or the IMF goes into a country with debt distress, there needs to be an 'honest broker' who can effectively protect the country's interests and advocate on its behalf. Rich countries must align science funding with the SDGs Rich countries must align science funding with the SDGs After the 2008 global financial crisis, regulators learnt that they need to have oversight of what is happening, from the level of institutions all the way to entire financial systems. It makes no sense that the largest institutions can still operate without anyone to report to other than their own boards ( A. G. Haldane and R. M. May Nature 469 , 351-355; 2011 ). Another priority for the meeting has to be ensuring that indebted countries are not penalized for things outside of their control, such as inflation caused by a pandemic, having to rebuild after natural disasters or dealing with the effects of climate change. And decisions must always be informed by evidence from a consensus of the research. For example, there is good evidence that, in the long run, it is best that public finance be the main contributor to infrastructure, rather than private capital (see go.nature.com/49t6xey ). This is because public sources do not need returns on their investments at the scale or the speed that private sources do. And this is better for projects that take time to build, or that will need a long time to pay back creditors. It is crucial that the Seville meeting raises sufficient finance for the SDGs and takes concrete steps towards governance reform, building on a long history of previous attempts. Let's make 2025 the year when international finance really does meet the needs of those who require it the most, without exploiting their vulnerabilities.",nature,2024-12-30T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04159-7
Why the genetic-testing revolution left some people behind â€” and what to do about it,"When Mary-Claire King embarked on a painstaking 17-year-long hunt for a gene linked to breast cancer, she had no inkling that its discovery would be saving lives some three decades later . King, an evolutionary geneticist, was trying to solve the mystery of why breast cancer was common in some families. This was during the 1970s, decades before the first human genome was sequenced. In the absence of modern tools such as PCR tests, sequencing and mapping genes took a heroic effort. Cancer researchers at the time were mostly studying tumour-causing viruses, but several individuals having the disease across generations of the same family suggested that considerable danger could lurk in the human genome, too. What is the best time of the month to treat breast cancer? What is the best time of the month to treat breast cancer? ""The worldwide impact of something like this just never crossed my mind,"" says King, who is at the University of Washington in Seattle. ""I was absolutely gobsmacked."" King named the gene BRCA1 . Since then, it has become clear that mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for about 35% of hereditary breast cancers, and that genetic variants of it and a related gene called BRCA2 are also linked to ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Drugs have been developed that target cancers with these variants, and genetic tests are available to identify people who are at risk. But looking back on the impact of BRCA1 's discovery also highlights how far there still is to go. Too few people have access to genetic tests and, even when they do, they have few options to reduce their risk of cancer. Researchers must advocate for and study ways to improve access and to expand the cancer-prevention options available to people who carry BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Huge leap in breast cancer survival rat Huge leap in breast cancer survival rat BRCA1 encodes a protein that is important for repairing damaged DNA. Although King identified the BRCA1 gene and pinpointed its location 1 in 1990, the team that first sequenced it in 1994 included researchers at the precision-medicine firm Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, Utah 2 . Myriad promptly applied for patents on the gene and used this intellectual property to prevent competitors from developing tests for cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations. The high price tag of Myriad's genetic tests kept them out of many people's reach, until a landmark US Supreme Court decision in June 2013 found that such gene patents were invalid . Following the court's decision, test prices in the United States plummeted from around US$3,800 to $250, as other providers surged into the field. Yet, testing remains limited, despite studies 3 finding that expanding BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing to all women could be cost-effective, particularly for those screened between the ages of 20 and 35. There are several reasons for this, including limited health-care access and concerns about privacy. Lack of awareness among primary-care physician s about genetic testing and conflicting guidelines from professional organizations about who should be tested contribute, too. For now, however, even in places where testing is an option, it is often made available only to those at high risk of carrying a cancer-associated form of BRCA1 , including people with a high rate of cancer in their family (see 'Testing times'). Many who are eligible do not get tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: one US study 4 found that only about 35% of eligible individuals with ovarian cancer and 56% of eligible people with breast cancer had been tested. Other problems limit the tests' practical benefits, too. Reports provided to physicians and people with cancer are often unnecessarily complicated, because they list not only mutations known to increase risk, but also any other unusual DNA sequences in the genes -- even if their relevance is unknown. Many tests also provide data on genes unrelated to cancer, launching fresh medical odysseys for people already dealing with a cancer diagnosis. When King accompanied a friend diagnosed with breast cancer to a clinical appointment, the attending doctor waved off suggestions for BRCA1 testing. ""The difficulty with genetic tests,"" they said, ""is that they simply beget more tests."" This scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab This scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab Simplifying tests and equipping medical staff with the knowledge to interpret the results could improve uptake. People who learn that they carry worrisome BRCA1 mutations need better options to either prevent cancer from developing or intercept it at an early stage. This is particularly crucial for reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and aiding its early detection. Whereas mammograms can detect some breast tumours early, there is no equivalent test for ovarian cancer, which is often diagnosed at late stages. At present, cancer detection and prevention are typically achieved by careful monitoring or, in some cases, surgery to remove the breasts and ovaries. ""When I see a 25-year-old woman newly found to have a BRCA1 mutation, I'm mostly having the same conversations now that I did long ago for her options for risk reduction,"" says Susan Domchek, a breast-cancer specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ""We have a lot of work to do."" To improve on this, researchers must develop better means of detecting cancers early, and learn more about the biology of early tumours and why some will go on to become malignant whereas others do not. They must also investigate ways to treat people at earlier stages -- an effort that will require learning more about early cancers' biological hallmarks. By contrast, most treatments are first developed for and tested in people who have advanced disease. By filling the gaps on testing and giving people with harmful mutations better ways to reduce their risk, BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing could become a model for how genetic tests for other cancer risk factors should be implemented. Then, King's crucial discovery will save even more lives.",nature,2024-12-10T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04046-1
Donâ€™t rush rules for sharing digital genetic-sequence information,"Next week, national delegates, including scientists, will meet in Cali, Colombia, for the United Nations COP16 meeting on biodiversity. Boosting the low levels of finance available for biodiversity conservation is high on the agenda, as is trying to tie up some unfinished business that goes back more than three decades. The hope is that negotiators will finally reach an agreement on how lower-income countries can better share in the benefits that stem from their resources -- including any monetary benefits deriving from non-human genetic data. Yet even at this eleventh hour, an agreement on the sharing of these data is some way from being ready. The principle of equitable benefit-sharing is not in question, but more time is needed to bridge gaps between different perspectives on how to implement it. Those gaps will, in turn, be bridged only if policymakers can commission a programme of research to help answer some crucial questions. Researchers globally fear that rushing to finalize the agreement risks putting barriers in the way of the current practice by which researchers are able to quickly share genetic-sequencing data, which are the lifeblood of many scientific fields and are crucial to public health, particularly during health emergencies. Conservation policies must address an overlooked issue: how war affects the environment Conservation policies must address an overlooked issue: how war affects the environment The history of these efforts stretches back to the start of the biodiversity convention, which was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (see go.nature.com/3y0xs7q ). A pledge made at that time for more equitable sharing of biological resources eventually led to the Nagoya protocol, which became international law in 2014 (see go.nature.com/3ab4q9g ). This obliges researchers at universities and corporations in countries that are party to the UN convention to ensure that they have obtained all the necessary permissions when using non-human genetic material from another country. For companies, there is an added requirement to share profits from any commercial products that arise from such work. But the Nagoya protocol applies only to physical samples. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are rich in biodiversity and have been pushing since at least 2016 to expand the definition of non-human genetic material to include digital sequence information (DSI). This is the subject of the 11-page text that is due to be discussed at the Cali meeting (see go.nature.com/3nscyd4 ). The text's authors -- who include researchers representing governments from different world regions, Indigenous people and representatives of UN organizations -- agree on several fundamental principles. These include the need for there to be an agreement on DSI data, as there is for physical samples; for the agreement to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples; and for the agreement to be consistent with the principles of open data and not hinder research and innovation. Moreover, anyone benefiting financially from DSI should contribute a fraction of the benefit to a fund to protect biodiversity. The next 20 years of human genomics must be more equitable and more open The next 20 years of human genomics must be more equitable and more open But the document also contains some 200 items in square brackets -- meaning that there are around 200 things on which the authors still disagree. Among them are how to define DSI (there is no agreement on whether it covers one or all of DNA, RNA and proteins); whether this information should be deposited in existing or new databases; how to define a sequence's country of origin, including whether this is even possible; where permission should be obtained from or how benefits should be apportioned if there is no single country of origin; whether payments should be mandatory; and whether all countries or only rich nations should be liable to pay. These are tricky questions, but they are not unanswerable. What is needed to resolve them is dedicated independent research. Such research is thin on the ground ( A. H. Scholz et al. Nature Commun. 13 , 1086; 2022 ), and policymakers need to commission it so that they can be better informed about the different options being proposed. A document as incomplete as that due to be discussed at Cali is not one on which good decisions can be made. COP16 delegates will also discuss the lack of progress countries have made in finalizing biodiversity action plans . One reason for this is a lack of finance. Researchers estimate that between US$700 billion and $1 trillion is needed annually. However, in 2022, only around $26 billion went into conserving species and ecosystems, according to a report published last month by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (see go.nature.com/3ub1mqg ), a group of wealthy nations. Although some of what is available is in the form of grants, a lot of it comprises loans, which need to be repaid -- with interest. Global lessons from South Africa's rooibos compensation agreement Global lessons from South Africa's rooibos compensation agreement Some of the DSI agreement's proponents see it as at least part of the answer to boosting biodiversity financing in the countries that most need it. But it is likely to disappoint -- as experience with the Nagoya protocol, a comparatively simpler device, shows. In the decade since it came into force, there are few recorded examples of corporations paying local communities for the use of their biological resources. Although in 2019, tea manufacturers compensated South Africa's Khoi and San communities for using their knowledge on rooibos tea without acknowledgement, this agreement took years to realize and only happened because the South African government pushed the companies to pay . Next week's meeting in Cali is important. For delegates from LMICs, such events are among a vanishingly small number of forums where their voices are equal to those of richer, more powerful nations. And the whole world has an interest in the project's success. The case of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus offers a valuable reminder of why some form of benefit sharing from DSI is necessary ( R. Viana et al. Nature 603 , 679-686; 2022 ). Researchers in Botswana and South Africa who discovered it rapidly alerted the world and shared its sequence. This knowledge was used in the manufacture of vaccines -- vaccines that could have saved many more lives had they not reached many African countries too late. And this example also raises yet another issue -- that the discussion at Cali ought to include other international bodies, most notably the World Health Organization. Most importantly, before an agreement is reached on DSI, much more work needs to go into answering the questions contained in those 200-odd sets of square brackets. What no one needs is a rushed mechanism that risks the knowledge sharing on which research and public health depend.",nature,2024-10-16T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03331-3
Dear Donald Trump: A letter from Nature on how to make science thrive,"Dear Mr President-elect, On 20 January, you will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. Congratulations on your win. A majority of US voters have placed their trust in you. That is a tremendous responsibility. We, the editors of the international scientific journal Nature , lay out why, in our view, science is core to an administration's ability to maintain the country's health, prosperity and security . And we outline what researchers will need to help your government to succeed in achieving these goals. Research and innovation are overlapping domains in which the United States has been world-leading for generations. The work of scientists underpins health and prosperity . Take the Human Genome Project: this US$3-billion investment has revolutionized our understanding of diseases. Within a decade of the project's completion, it had added an estimated $1 trillion to the US economy . Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it? Science could solve some of the world's biggest problems. Why aren't governments using it? As you prepare to return to the White House, we urge you not to lose sight of the need for the US government to continue to provide support for researchers -- especially in terms of fundamental science and the opportunity for researchers to collaborate with peers around the world. And we urge you to examine the evidence for what works and what doesn't before announcing new policies. Climate and energy security need to be priorities. From a scientific perspective, there is no question that human activities are warming the planet. The overwhelming consensus of researchers is that all nations are vulnerable to severe disruptions from continued burning of fossil fuels. Disruptive climatic effects are likely to have been a major contributor to the devastating wildfires seen in California this month, to name just the most recent example. Wildfire smoke is a serious health hazard. Many important policies designed to protect people from the effects of climate change, including investment in new energy sources, are in place in the United States. Your administration has an opportunity -- and a responsibility -- to build on this work. Scientists are building giant 'evidence banks' to create policies that actually work Scientists are building giant 'evidence banks' to create policies that actually work But the United States cannot tackle climate change or health issues, such as infectious diseases, on its own. The country must continue to work with and, when appropriate, lead other nations through the global organizations and agreements that it is a party to and, in many cases, helped to establish. International accords are complicated and imperfect, but they can be reformed. The alternative -- of not having them or withdrawing from them -- will put the United States and the rest of the world at greater risk. We urge you to engage. Global cooperation is the only viable approach to global problems. You have also signalled a desire for government reform, including slashing public-sector spending and improving government efficiency. Some researchers are frustrated with aspects of how the government operates -- for instance, how research funds are allocated and how drugs and biomedical products are vetted. One of their concerns is that overly cautious rules might be slowing the roll-out of life-saving treatments. As your administration seeks improved outcomes, we urge you to consult with the widest possible range of stakeholders, including those who study the problems you are looking to solve, as well as those who have lived experience of them. This will provide the best chance of reaching optimal solutions. Useful insights will come from industry. Companies have huge experience of experimenting with product and process innovation, and they feel the impact of poorly thought-out regulations keenly. We also encourage you to talk to organizations representing consumers; patients' groups; researchers studying science and ethics, and science and public policy; and the research departments of regulatory bodies themselves. What Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers What Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers Transparency is a non-negotiable principle in modern societies and is central to the verification of scientific knowledge. The ability to work in open and transparent ways is also core to the jobs of the scientists working as career civil servants in various branches of the federal government. These subject specialists are essential to public safety -- be it in relation to climate change, infectious disease or artificial intelligence. As Nature reports in a News Feature this week , researchers are concerned about the possibility of civil-service staff being replaced each time an administration changes. Such a change would not serve the interests of people in the United States. US science has been transformational for the United States and for the world. Research today is a hugely collaborative enterprise. The big discoveries and innovations happen when researchers are able to communicate with, learn from, visit, and live and work with researchers in different countries. This allows for the efficient exchange of knowledge and for the best and brightest to work together no matter where they happen to have been born, giving breakthroughs the best chance of success. We urge you and your administration to ensure that the United States continues to welcome researchers from all parts of the world. Mr President-elect, science is a self-correcting process in which bad actors and wrong ideas sooner or later get rooted out and fuzzy evidence becomes sharper. That is the joy and the beauty of the method that has made the modern world what it is. The more you can support science, the better it will be for the United States and its people -- and, ultimately, for the planet on which we all depend. If you can do that, it will be a positive legacy for your administration. With best regards, the editors of Nature .",nature,2025-01-15T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00050-1
Science must protect thinking time in a world of instant communication,"Video calls. Instant messaging. Voice calls. E-mails. Social media. Smartphones. Tablets. Laptops. Desktops. More digital devices equals less time to concentrate and to think. The negative effects of this on researchers are tackled by computer scientist Cal Newport in his latest book, Slow Productivity 1 . The book's title challenges the idea, common to many workplaces, that productivity must always increase. A study has shown that science is becoming less disruptive , even though there are now more papers being published and grants awarded than ever before 2 . Newport, who studies technology in the workplace at Georgetown University in Washington DC, says that researchers and other knowledge workers need to slow down and spend more time thinking, to focus on maintaining and improving quality in their work. Newport does the research community a service by shining a spotlight on an overburdened workforce. Institutions should already be accessing the expertise that exists within their walls in the search for answers, but are not doing so. Newer communications technologies have enormous benefits, including speeding up research, as was necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic. But they are also squeezing out thinking time. Newport's book reminds us that there are researchers who will know how to help. Thinking time -- the time needed to concentrate without interruptions has always been central to scholarly work. It is essential to designing experiments, compiling data, assessing results, reviewing literature and, of course, writing. Yet, thinking time is often undervalued; it is rarely, if ever, quantified in employment practices. Is science really getting less disruptive -- and does it matter if it is? Is science really getting less disruptive -- and does it matter if it is? One way to think about the practice of juggling research with e-mail and instant messaging is to visualize someone working next to a physical letterbox. Imagine opening and reading every letter as soon as it arrives, and starting to compose a reply, even as more letters drop through the box -- all the while trying to do your main job. Researchers say that their to-do lists tend to lengthen, in part because colleagues can contact them instantly, often for good reasons. Researchers also often have to choose what to prioritize, which can cause them to feel overwhelmed. Newport gives suggestions on reclaiming thinking time, include limiting the number of items on to-do lists and project teams setting aside time to complete tasks that require all members, thus avoiding individual members sending e-mails to each other. For institutions, Newport recommends a transparent workload management system -- a way for managers to see everything that a colleague is expected to do -- and then to adjust the workload if there are more tasks than there is available time. Undoubtedly good advice, this might be easier to implement in industrial settings than in academic ones. In many academic research laboratories, researchers report to a single principal investigator, with little management structure. This is partly because it is hard to justify to academic funders the budget for paying for management and administration roles. Is science's dominant funding model broken? Is science's dominant funding model broken? But Felicity Mellor, a science-communication researcher at Imperial College London, is sceptical about giving managers a role in thinking time. In many cases, researchers are already feeling the weight of their institution's monitoring and evaluation systems. Mellor argues that including yet another box in an evaluation form might not go down well. She also thinks that institutions will not accept this. ""Can you imagine the response if a scientist filled out a time sheet where it says 'eight hours spent thinking'?"" Ultimately, she says, creating a more supportive research culture needs a much more fundamental change. That suggests an even more radical rethink of the current funding model for academic research, as we wrote last month (see Nature 630 , 793; 2024 ), along with changes to other aspects of academic science. Newport's thesis raises a much more fundamental question: what is the impact of lost concentration time on science -- not just on the structure and process of science, but also on the content and quality of research? In 2014, Mellor co-led a research project, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, called The Silences of Science, published as a book two years later 3 . Researchers discussed this question, and others in a series of workshops, but the work did not continue after the grant expired. Such explorations need to be revived, but they also need to incorporate the impact of artificial-intelligence technologies. These tools are being implemented at pace around the world to automate many routine administrative tasks. Researchers need to evaluate whether such tools can free up more thinking time for researchers; or whether they could have the opposite effect. Communications technologies are sure to evolve further and to continue distracting researchers from their work. More studies investigating the effect of these technologies on science are needed urgently, as are studies on how thinking time can be protected in a world of instant communication. This knowledge will help researchers and institutional leaders to make better decisions about the technologies' deployment -- and, hopefully, allow researchers to carve out that all-important space and time to think.",nature,2024-07-24T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02381-x
AI firms must play fair when they use academic data in training,"No one knows for sure exactly what ChatGPT -- the most famous product of artificial intelligence -- and similar tools were trained on. But millions of academic papers scraped from the web are among the reams of data that have been fed into large language models (LLMs) that generate text, and similar algorithms that make images (see Nature 632 , 715-716; 2024 ). Should the creators of such training data get credit -- and if so, how? There is an urgent need for more clarity around the boundaries of acceptable use. Few LLMs -- even those described as 'open' -- have developers who are upfront about exactly which data were used for training. But information-rich, long-form text, a category that includes many scientific papers, is particularly valuable. According to an investigation by The Washington Post and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, Washington, material from the open-access journal families PLOS and Frontiers features prominently in a data set called C4, which has been used to train LLMs such as Llama, made by the technology giant Meta. It is also widely suspected that, just as copyrighted books have been used to train LLMs, so have non-open-access research papers. Science and the new age of AI: a Nature special Science and the new age of AI: a Nature special One fundamental question concerns what is allowed under current laws. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), based in Geneva, Switzerland, says that it is unclear whether collecting data or using them to create LLM outputs is considered copyright infringement, or whether these activities fall under one of several exemptions, which differ by jurisdiction. Some publishers are seeking clarity in the courts: in an ongoing case, The New York Times has alleged that the tech firms Microsoft and OpenAI -- the company that developed ChatGPT -- copied its articles to train their LLMs . To avoid the risk of litigation, more AI firms are now, as recommended by WIPO, purchasing licences from copyright holders for training data. Content owners are also using code on their websites that tells tools scraping data for LLMs whether they are allowed to do so. Things get much fuzzier when material is published under licences that encourage free distribution and reuse, but that can still have certain restrictions. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization in Mountain View, California, that aims to increase sharing of creative works, says that copying material to train an AI should not generally be treated as infringement. But it also acknowledges concerns about the impact of AI on creators, and how to ensure that AI that is trained on 'the commons' -- the body of freely available material -- contributes to the commons in return. These broader questions of fairness are particularly pressing for artists, writers and coders, whose livelihoods depend on their creative outputs and whose work risks being replaced by the products of generative AI. But they are also highly relevant for researchers. The move towards open-access publishing explicitly favours the free distribution and reuse of scientific work -- and this presumably applies to LLMs, too. Learning from scientific papers can make LLMs better, and some researchers might rejoice if improved AI models could help them to gain new insights. But others are worried about principles such as attribution, the currency by which science operates. Fair attribution is a condition of reuse under CC BY, a commonly used open-access copyright license. In jurisdictions such as the European Union and Japan, there are exemptions to copyright rules that cover factors such as attribution -- for text and data mining in research using automated analysis of sources to find patterns, for example. Some scientists see LLM data-scraping for proprietary LLMs as going well beyond what these exemptions were intended to achieve. Has your paper been used to train an AI model? Almost certainly Has your paper been used to train an AI model? Almost certainly In any case, attribution is impossible when a large commercial LLM uses millions of sources to generate a given output. But when developers create AI tools for use in science, a method known as retrieval-augmented generation could help. This technique doesn't apportion credit to the data that trained the LLM, but does allow the model to cite papers that are relevant to its output, says Lucy Lu Wang, an AI researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle. Giving researchers the ability to opt out of having their work used in LLM training could also ease their worries. Creators have this right under EU law, but it is tough to enforce in practice, says Yaniv Benhamou, who studies digital law and copyright at the University of Geneva. Firms are devising innovative ways to make it easier. Spawning, a start-up company in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has developed tools to allow creators to opt out of data scraping. Some developers are also getting on board: OpenAI's Media Manager tool, for example, allows creators to specify how their works can be used by machine-learning algorithms. Greater transparency can also play a part. The EU's AI Act, which came into force on 1 August, requires developers to publish a summary of the works used to train their AI models. This could bolster creators' ability to opt out, and might serve as a template for other jurisdictions. But it remains to be seen how this will work in practice. Meanwhile, research should continue into whether there is a need for more-radical solutions, such as new kinds of licence or changes to copyright law. Generative AI tools are using a data ecosystem built by open-source movements, yet often ignore the accompanying expectations of reciprocity and reasonable use, says Sylvie Delacroix, a digital-law scholar at King's College London. The tools also risk polluting the Internet with AI-generated content of dubious quality. By failing to redirect users to the human-made sources on which they were built, LLMs could disincentivize original creation. Without putting more power into the hands of creators, the system will come under severe strain. Regulators and companies must act.",nature,2024-08-27T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02757-z
How to stop a looming â€˜splinternetâ€™,"""Did you get the L?"" ""Did you get the O?"" As science writers Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon recount in their 1996 book on the birth of the Internet, Where Wizards Stay Up Late , it took a phone call on 29 October 1969 to confirm that the world's first Internet message had been received. The letters 'L-O-G-I-N' had been typed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, and sent some 500 kilometres up the coast to colleagues at Stanford University. Five years later, in May 1974, two more founding wizards cast their spell. Stanford computer scientist Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, a researcher at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, published the software rules, known as protocols , that enable billions of devices all over the world to share data, images, sounds and video over a single Internet ( V. G. Cerf and R. E. Kahn IEEE Trans. Commun . 22 , 637-648; 1974 ). Half a century on from that decisive moment, Cerf is among the many computer scientists to be concerned about where the Internet will go next. Will AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions? Will AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions? Since the Internet's inception, its governance has been led by scientists and non-governmental organizations. Today, these bodies include standards organizations such as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The IETF is responsible for maintaining and developing the protocols originally developed by Cerf and Kahn. The W3C, created by the web's founder, Tim Berners-Lee, maintains the specific protocols that mean, among other things, that web pages can appear on any appropriately Internet-enabled device. But on 22 September, United Nations member states agreed a 16-page document called the Global Digital Compact (GDC). At its core, this document reflects the desire of the world's governments to take more responsibility for Internet governance. And many scientists are concerned. The compact has been under development for more than a year, but disagreements surfaced in July, when computer scientists including Cerf and Berners-Lee published an open letter saying that existing Internet standards bodies and the technical community have had only weak involvement in the drafting process. This unnecessary rift needs to be closed urgently. The GDC has tasked one of the UN's established science bodies, the Commission on Science and Technology for Development in Geneva, Switzerland, to set up a working group to consider the future of Internet data governance. The group will report in two years' time. It must formally involve the current standards bodies if its recommendations are to be relevant to how the Internet is being used, while maintaining the best of what has made it so successful. Reaching an agreement will not be easy. The UN team is under pressure from member governments determined to get a stronger grip on the Internet so they can protect people -- especially children -- from harm, respond effectively to threats such as cybercrime and disinformation, and balance the benefits and risks posed by artificial intelligence. Extending the Sustainable Development Goals to 2050 -- a road map Extending the Sustainable Development Goals to 2050 -- a road map That will inevitably necessitate some governmental involvement in technical standards. The UN and its science advisers need to ensure that this does not jeopardize the Internet's founding principles: that the world has just one Internet and that its operation is decentralized. These are both matters of wider concern. An Internet governance process that is led by nation states also runs the risk that insurmountable disagreements between countries will lead to individual national versions of the Internet. That is why a decentralized, researcher-led process has been so important, and why it needs to be maintained as far as possible. The principle of a single, global Internet means that no one needs to ask any government for permission to connect their device to the system. Because of the way the underlying protocols work, the sender and receiver are the only people who need to know what information is being sent over the Internet -- mirroring how the postal system works, at least in theory. The final text of the GDC supports the principle of common standards by which information can be exchanged between all parts of the Internet. Its commitments are all framed in terms of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which all nations are signed up to -- and which include protecting freedom of expression and privacy within international law. This is a good start. As the computer scientists say in their letter: ""Government engagement in digital and Internet governance is needed to deal with many abuses of this global system but it is our common responsibility to uphold the bottom-up, collaborative and inclusive model of Internet governance that has served the world for the past half century."" According to the authors of Where Wizards Stay Up Late , it is not an accident that Internet standards borrowed the word 'protocol' from international diplomacy, where it is used to mean an agreement between parties -- as in the 1997 Kyoto climate protocol. In that sense, it is fitting that governments are assuming more responsibility. But as with issues such as global climate policy, the technical-standards community needs to have an assigned place in discussions. When the UN's science commission starts its work, community members need to be there to share their depth of knowledge and to help guard against the risk of 'splinternets'. The Internet tent is big enough to accommodate all those who need to be inside -- not least those who helped to build it in the first place.",nature,2024-09-24T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03110-0
Why arenâ€™t there talks with the Taliban about getting women and girls back into education?,"Three years after the Taliban took over Afghanistan, systemic discrimination against girls and women, including violence, is rampant. Girls remain locked out of education once they reach the age of 12 and women are banned from most jobs, including nearly all forms of research and teaching. The list of prohibitions on women has been extended to include speaking or singing in public. Last week, some 130 women attended a conference in Tirana, Albania -- the largest public gathering of Afghan women who met to discuss the crisis since the takeover. ""In our country, we now live like prisoners,"" one delegate told The Guardian (see go.nature.com/3mostsa ). This shocking situation is made worse by the fact that the international community has no official mechanism or named initiative for talking with the Taliban about getting girls and women back to their lecture halls, libraries and laboratories. In a 22 August interview with the BBC, Richard Bennett, the United Nations special rapporteur for Afghanistan, said that there are no formal talks between the Taliban and the international community to return girls and women to education. He said: ""The elephant in the room is why is there no working group [between the Taliban and other nations] to look at human rights and women's rights."" The Taliban said women could study -- three years on they still can't The Taliban said women could study -- three years on they still can't This is actually rather revealing. It confirms what researchers and human-rights organizations have been saying: world leaders do not attribute the same degree of importance to the rights of girls and women as they do to other issues. The Taliban have banned Bennett from entering the country. Where is the outrage from major world capitals? This situation overall is completely unacceptable. The continued denial of rights also goes against a recommendation to the UN Security Council , the organization's highest decision-making body, by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres. Last November, Guterres told council members that the Taliban needed to comply with international law -- including giving women the right to study and work without restriction -- to be recognized as Afghanistan's legitimate government. This cannot continue. If it does, the international community will be complicit in gender apartheid, which might soon be classed as a crime against humanity by the UN. Since the Taliban takeover, the number of students in Afghanistan's 167 public and private universities and higher-education institutes has more than halved, from 430,000 to just 200,000 students since 2021, according to data published by the UN science and cultural organization UNESCO, based in Paris. More than 2.5 million girls are already out of school, and if the education ban persists, that number could rise to more than 4 million by 2030, the UNESCO data show. The Taliban 'took my life' -- scientists who fled takeover speak out The Taliban 'took my life' -- scientists who fled takeover speak out At the same time, a prolonged drought is contributing to severe food insecurity -- with one in four people not knowing where their next meal will come from. The World Food Programme has put out an urgent appeal for US$617 million. This must be provided without delay. To be clear, humanitarian aid must never come with strings attached. No other country recognizes the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government, and nor does the UN. But this doesn't mean that relations are frozen. It's the opposite, with nations starting to reboot trade and diplomacy with the country. Last week, work started in Afghanistan on a pipeline that will send gas from Turkmenistan to India. In the same week, it was reported that the Taliban are looking to buy military hardware from Russia. And China is helping the Taliban to access some of the world's largest copper deposits, southeast of Kabul. It's a missed opportunity that these initiatives are not contingent on any movement on the education ban. There are separate talks taking place hosted by the UN and Qatar. But here, too, the hosts agreed to the Taliban's demands that no women's organizations be represented and that the agenda for these talks would exclude education. The Taliban are seeking international recognition, including membership of the UN. Afghanistan desperately needs trade deals to revive an economy that is on its knees. Yet, it is unacceptable that the international community has effectively accepted Taliban conditions that there will be no formal talks on the education ban. Taliban spokespeople say that they are listening to their ""sisters"" and working on a solution. No other country that has Islamic law as part of its legal system bans girls and women from education. When asked, representatives of the international community say that they raise the education ban with the Taliban at every available opportunity. This is better than nothing, but warm words of support are little comfort to the millions of girls and women who are in severe distress. For most women, the future is too worrying to contemplate. Researchers are even reporting examples of women contemplating taking their own lives ( A. Q. Mohammadi et al. J. Public Health 46 , e439-e447; 2024 ). There needs to be a mechanism for talks to end the education ban, with objectives, scheduled meetings and agreed timelines.

Mpox: apply COVID lessons to control outbreak in Africa,"Before the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared the mpox outbreak in a growing number of African countries to be a public-health emergency in mid-August, there were fears that the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic would be ignored in this latest public-health crisis. The international community is now starting to get its act together, and some lessons are being applied. Vaccines are available and more can be made. Moreover, a funding facility has been established to buy and distribute them. But in other respects, all is not as it should be in the fight to bring mpox under control and safeguard the lives (and livelihoods) of millions of people in Africa. First, African countries lack the resources to track the disease. This is why there's a large mismatch between the number of suspected cases and those confirmed through laboratory tests. Second, vaccines need to quickly get to where they are needed most. This requires both access to funding and the international donor community to coordinate procurement and delivery with African nations. Third, mpox is a reminder that Africa severely needs its own vaccine manufacturing and regulatory infrastructure. In particular, the African Medicines Agency, a long-planned project to create a single medicines regulator for African countries, must quickly become a reality. Mpox is caused by variants of the monkeypox virus, which was first identified in a human in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1970. It spreads through close contact with someone who is infected, or by contact with materials contaminated with the virus. Mpox symptoms include characteristic lesions, high temperature, sore throat, cough and swollen lymph nodes. A major mpox outbreak was declared in 2022, with cases mostly in the Americas and Europe, but that outbreak is now under control. The latest emergency is caused mainly by a virus lineage called clade Ib. As of 1 September, there had been some 20,000 laboratory-confirmed or suspected mpox cases this year. The overwhelming majority have been in the DRC, although neighbouring Burundi is now seeing a rise (see 'Mpox rising'). Most people will recover after four weeks or less, but this is a potentially fatal disease, and four out of five mpox deaths this year have been in children. A major problem is that the affected countries lack sufficient facilities to identify infected individuals, test them and then trace their contacts. It goes without saying that international aid donors absolutely must prioritize disease surveillance. What are some of the other relevant lessons from COVID-19 -- those that are being applied and those that are not? One important result of that pandemic is that there is money available for the poorest countries to tackle health emergencies, according to Gavi, the vaccine alliance. These countries now have access to a US$500-million fund for vaccines, drugs and testing and contact-tracing when a public-health emergency of international concern is declared -- and extra credit worth up to $2 billion from banks in the European Union and the United States, if required. This 'day zero financing facility' was set up after the COVID-19 pandemic to stop a similar crisis of inequality occurring again. As the coronavirus spread, the WHO and its partners were forced to spend valuable time raising money to pay for vaccines for the lowest-income countries, whereas high-income countries could simply pursue deals with pharmaceutical companies. Mpox is spreading rapidly. Here are the questions researchers are racing to answer Mpox is spreading rapidly. Here are the questions researchers are racing to answer Existing smallpox vaccines have been repurposed for mpox, and two are expected to get an emergency-use licence from the WHO by the middle of September. One of the vaccines, taken in two doses, is called Jynneos and is made by Bavarian Nordic, based in Hellerup, Denmark. A second vaccine, LC16m8, is made by KM Biologics, based in Kumamoto, Japan. Last week, the Africa CDC, Gavi, the WHO and the United Nations' children's charity UNICEF said they were ready to purchase and distribute vaccines. The problems, as with COVID-19, are supply, price and, potentially, a lack of coordination between donors. Bavarian Nordic has stated that it has two million doses ready to distribute this year and that it can make another ten million by the end of next year. But the market price ($70-$100 per dose) will quickly break the bank. Gavi's negotiators will need to use all of their skill and experience to make the price more affordable. The Africa CDC says ten million doses will be needed by next year. So far, Japan has pledged up to 3.6 million, according to the website Think Global Health, which is tracking pledges . The European Union has pledged around half a million; the United States just 60,000. There doesn't seem to be much coordination. Mpox is also a reminder that African countries need to get their 'one stop' medicines regulatory body off the ground. The African Union (AU) has a plan to establish the African Medicines Agency (AMA), modelled on the European Medicines Agency. Once established, the AMA, to be based in Kigali, Rwanda, will support countries during outbreaks and emergencies by ensuring that medicinal products do not need to go through licensing in each AU member state. So far, 38 AU member states have ratified the AMA treaty. However, the project has suffered delays in finalizing its governing board and recruiting its leadership. Growing mpox outbreak prompts WHO to declare global health emergency Growing mpox outbreak prompts WHO to declare global health emergency African countries should be able to access vaccines without a public-health emergency -- just as is the case in other parts of the world. As of now, the continent imports 99% of its vaccines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was much talk of bringing vaccine manufacturing to the continent, but progress has been limited. If anything, things are going backwards. In April, the pharmaceutical company Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 'paused' a plan to create a facility for making mRNA vaccines in Kenya, saying that it had experienced $1 billion in losses and write-downs now that COVID-19 is no longer a priority. In response, the Africa CDC said that ""to blame Africa and Africa CDC for lack of demand for COVID-19 vaccines"" and thereby to put plans to manufacture vaccines in Africa on hold ""only serves to perpetuate the inequity that characterized the response"" to the pandemic. Some measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic mean the world is better positioned to tackle mpox. But in other respects, it looks like business as usual. There has to be a cast-iron commitment on the part of world health leaders not to repeat some of the mistakes of the pandemic if mpox is to be brought under control in Africa.",nature,2024-09-10T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02912-6
Use citizen science to turbocharge big-data projects,"The brain of a fruit fly is so small that it can fit on the head of a pin. And yet, it is an inordinately complex object, encompassing nearly 140,000 neurons and 50 million synapses. It is no wonder, then, that it took 5 years, 50 laboratories and more than 200 people to map it -- a monumental achievement that is the subject of a series of papers this week in Nature 1 - 4 . Brain mapping is one of the most delicate and complex tasks in neuroscience, and even the smallest error can markedly affect the results. The achievement is all the more remarkable considering that around a dozen people working on the project were not full-time academic researchers, but volunteers from all walks of life, from around the world. They collaborated to validate results produced by artificial intelligence (AI). Hundreds of neuroscientists who study fruit flies also volunteered to support the project, and recruited their students. Together, they have been credited as authors. Amateur science is as old as science itself, but this project adds yet another way to involve more brain power in what is increasingly data-hungry research. The FlyWire connectome: neuronal wiring diagram of a complete fly brain The FlyWire connectome: neuronal wiring diagram of a complete fly brain The 'FlyWire connectome' map presented by Mala Murthy, a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey, and her colleagues 1 is already helping to advance neuroscience. The project to create a 'wiring diagram' of connections between neurons discovered 4,581 cell types, many in understudied brain regions 2 . Other groups are using the map to study and make predictions about brain function. For example, researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Puerto Rico have used it to investigate the neurons that control how flies feed and groom themselves 3 . The team simulated the relevant brain circuits and used the model to predict which neurons respond to food stimuli, such as sugar or water. Another team, led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, used the map to predict how specialized neurons in certain parts of the fruit fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) brain receive and process visual information 4 . The researchers used imaging techniques to confirm their predictions in female flies that were between seven and nine days old, underscoring the connectome's power to understand how the brain works. One of the main tasks of the researcher volunteers was to help the academic neuroscientists label the map and double-check its accuracy. Initially, the project's scientists used electron microscopy to take images of slices of the fly brain. They then trained an AI model on these images to create a wiring diagram of millions of synapses and thousands of neurons. These predictions needed to be verified against quality criteria and parameters. Fact-checking millions of data points is time-consuming. Instead, project co-leader Sebastian Seung, a neuroscientist at Princeton University, and his team built an interactive game-like platform called EyeWire, in which volunteers were asked to assemble 3D models of neurons in a mouse retina and zebrafish hindbrain. The 100 best-performing players were then trained to identify various types of cell and then set to work on the real project, to proofread the AI-generated synapses and neurons -- a task that otherwise would have needed another 33 neuroscientists working full time, for at least a year, to complete. ""We thought [this study] would be many, many years in the making,"" says Murthy. ""But as the technology developed, and as we opened up the data, and the [volunteer] community really stepped in and were excited to participate with us, it became a reality. And we completed it, in what I would consider record time."" A complete wiring diagram of the fruit-fly brain A complete wiring diagram of the fruit-fly brain John Ngai, director of the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative at the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, which funded the studies, told Nature that such an approach could be used for larger connectome projects that the BRAIN Initiative is funding. This includes a programme called BRAIN CONNECTS, which involves training people in the research and technical skills required to generate wiring diagrams of mammalian brains. Amateur scientists and volunteers are getting increasingly involved in other areas, too. Earlier this month, researchers at the United Nations Statistics Division in New York City and Open Data Watch, a non-profit organization based in Washington DC, described how citizen scientists are helping to fill in data gaps for the UN Sustainable Develop-ment Goals, especially for marginalized communities 5 . Last year, a study 6 in Nature described how the asteroid Dimorphos became temporarily brighter and redder when NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test spacecraft deliberately hit it . The finding was confirmed by a small group of amateur astronomers who were able to share their observational data with professional scientists through an app. Often, it's the professionals who need to check the work of the amateurs. What's different about the fly-brain work is that the volunteers are helping the full-time scientists to authenticate their findings -- something that could have a much wider application in our data-rich world.",nature,2024-10-02T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03182-y
Hybrid conferences should be the norm â€” optimize them so everyone benefits,"Attending conferences is a crucial way to establish and build networks, especially for scholars early on in their careers. But not everyone who would benefit is equally able to attend. Many researchers have caring responsibilities. The impact is particularly pronounced for women with children, who often find it hard to juggle professional and personal commitments -- thanks, in no small part, to persistent societal expectations that they will be a family's principal carer. In a 2019 study of oncologists, Miriam Knoll, a radiation oncologist at Northwell Health who is based in New York City, and her colleagues found that women attended fewer conferences than did men, and were more likely to cite childcare responsibilities as the reason ( M. A. Knoll et al . JAMA Oncol. 5 , 1503-1504; 2019 ). What's needed is a cultural shift, says Laura Pallett, an immunologist at University College London and one of the authors of a Careers Column published in Nature in May on the difficulties parents face with conference travel ( L. Carter et al. Nature 630 , 517-518; 2024 ). That shift must include two things. First, more targeted support from institutions and funders for those with caring responsibilities who might otherwise not be able to attend conferences. Second, greater effort from conference organizers to make provision for a high-quality hybrid experience. Researcher parents are paying a high price for conference travel -- here's how to fix it Researcher parents are paying a high price for conference travel -- here's how to fix it On the first of these, some progress has already been made -- but it needs to be built on and normalized, all of which requires resources. In the United Kingdom, funders such as UK Research and Innovation and the country's science academy, the Royal Society, offer reimbursements covering childcare, family travel and other care costs incurred outside normal working patterns. For a limited period this year, the African Academy of Sciences (AAS), based in Nairobi, offered funding for researchers who were breastfeeding to pay for someone to travel with them and help care for a child at conferences, says AAS executive director Peggy Oti-Boateng. Such support should be available for other events, and all funders should ""enhance gender-transformative actions"", she adds. Some universities do help to cover childcare costs for staff attending conferences. One is the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which does so through its Elizabeth Caroline Crosby Research Awards. Conference organizers can also play a part, by offering funding and childcare facilities, or at least a list of vetted childcare providers in the local area. ""These kinds of programmes have an impact beyond the individuals they help,"" says Reshma Jagsi, an oncologist and member of the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine. ""It's not just the early-career faculty member who brings their child along to the meeting, but the myriad students who are trying to decide whether they can be happy and successful in a discipline."" Being a parent is a hidden scientific superpower -- here's why Being a parent is a hidden scientific superpower -- here's why The alternative way to make conferences genuinely accessible is to offer more of them virtually, a practice that became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This also has environmental benefits ( M. Klower et al . Nature 583 , 356-359; 2020 ). Nevertheless, some organizers are beginning to step away from virtual meetings. One reason is that it is difficult to organize hybrid events in a way that satisfies both in-person and online delegates, and doing so pushes up costs. A big draw of in-person conferences is the networking and collaboration opportunities, which are hard to replicate in an online or hybrid format. This needs to be addressed to ensure that virtual attendees do not suffer. Another reason is that conference presenters are often reluctant to discuss unpublished research or work in progress in front of a virtual audience. Such work is the lifeblood of conferences, and in-person delegates are able to access and discuss it on the understanding that they respect any requests for data or results to be kept confidential. But such problems exist to be overcome. We would encourage conference organizers to redouble their efforts to find technological fixes and to share best practices -- and for attendees to highlight solutions that have worked for them. Organizing committees should prioritize making their events available online, not only for parents with childcare commitments, but also for people who lack the funds or visas, or are otherwise unable to attend in person. The superhero skills needed to juggle science and motherhood The superhero skills needed to juggle science and motherhood It will not always be possible to offer real-time hybrid events, especially for events held in locations with slow Internet connections or those that are volunteer-led and lack external funding. At a minimum, sessions should be recorded and made available to watch; funders could make this a condition for access to conference grants. There are many potential solutions to the problem of conference accessibility, but their success is context-specific. Interventions should be rigorously monitored to see what works best. ""This hasn't been done before, so a learning agenda is critical,"" says Amie Batson, president of WomenLift Health, a non-profit body based in Seattle, Washington, that promotes gender equity in leadership. ""If there are several options on the table, I expect that in five years you'll learn that three are super-valuable, two were worthless and two new ideas came up. What's important is making sure that you're creating the space to learn and respond to what works for women, families and organizations."" To improve things, the first step is acknowledging some of the problems, according to researchers and institutions that Nature spoke to for this Editorial. Conference organizers and funders need to confront the reality that the childcare status quo disadvantages many researchers and harms science as a whole -- and then start to change it.",nature,2024-08-06T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02533-z
How to support Indigenous Peoples on biodiversity: be rigorous with data,"For at least two decades, scientists, policymakers and journals, including Nature , have cited a statistic without determining its validity. The data point in question is that 80% of global biodiversity is under the stewardship of Indigenous Peoples. There is no doubt that Indigenous communities are core to the conservation of biodiversity, but to say that they are stewards of 80% of the world's genetic, species and ecosystem diversity isn't supported by evidence, as the authors of a Comment article last week stated ( A. Fernandez-Llamazares et al . Nature 633 , 32-35; 2024 ). No basis for claim that 80% of biodiversity is found in Indigenous territories No basis for claim that 80% of biodiversity is found in Indigenous territories A single, unsubstantiated number also does not reflect Indigenous values and world views, the authors add. There are better indicators and statistics on Indigenous communities and biodiversity, says Alvaro Fernandez-Llamazares, a co-author of the Comment article and an ethnobiologist at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain, in an accompanying Nature Podcast . Biodiversity -- defined as the variety of life on Earth, including its variation at the level of genes, species and ecosystems -- is extremely hard to quantify. Even the simplest statements come with great uncertainty: there is no consensus, for example, on the number of species on the planet 1 . There are at least 50 ways to value nature , according to researchers working with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in Bonn, Germany 2 . Podcast: The baseless stat that could be harming Indigenous conservation efforts Podcast: The baseless stat that could be harming Indigenous conservation efforts The authors of the Comment article, three of whom identify as Indigenous, reveal that the 80% statistic seems to have emerged in policy reports, from which it spread into the scientific literature. As of 1 August, the researchers found the 80% claim mentioned in 186 peer-reviewed journal articles. The earliest mention that they found was in a 2002 United Nations document that said that Indigenous Peoples ""nurture 80% of the world's biodiversity on ancestral lands and territories"", without a citation. The number is repeated in an influential 2008 World Bank report . So why might this number appear in policy documents first? It stems from Indigenous Peoples' centuries-old encounters with more-powerful interests, the resulting exploitation and mistreatment, their fight for rights, and the international community's ongoing policy response. Assessing the values of nature to promote a sustainable future Assessing the values of nature to promote a sustainable future Worldwide, there are some 467 million Indigenous People across 90 countries. Today, they are among the poorest, most vulnerable and least protected people in their nations. Some international laws and modern research practices pertaining to biodiversity derive from the 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity. This agreement has its origins in a movement to create protected areas -- ironically, areas often initially created by taking away Indigenous Peoples' rights to land or expelling them. During the negotiation, representatives of low-income countries and Indigenous Peoples fought to ensure that the agreement included provisions for the equitable sharing of biodiversity's benefits, such as profits from food or medicines. By the early 2000s, organizations such as the World Bank were working with Indigenous Peoples' representatives, and examining the impact and legacy of their own previous lending practices on Indigenous Peoples and creating ways to involve them in their decisions. The research community also had work to do. When IPBES was established in 2012, it pledged, for the first time, to incorporate Indigenous and local knowledge in its global scientific assessments of biodiversity. Studies are now being co-produced between Indigenous and non-Indigenous authors. A next step needs to be more studies designed and led by Indigenous authors 3 . Around the world, the struggle for Indigenous rights has a long way to go. Researchers have a crucial role in supporting communities, which includes being rigorous with data. As Fernandez-Llamazarez says in the Nature Podcast, unproven data risk fuelling scepticism on the role of Indigenous communities in biodiversity stewardship.",nature,2024-09-10T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02913-5
COP29: involve the IPCC in defining climate finance,"The United Nations climate bus is heading to Baku, Azerbaijan, for the UN climate conference COP29, which starts on 11 November. With global temperatures hovering close to 1.5 degC higher than pre-industrial levels , the big question hanging over Baku is whether rising temperatures will prompt the international community to take more-urgent action to mitigate global warming and tackle its effects. This COP is being called the 'Finance COP' because a big increase in funding is a top agenda item. Meaningful action against global warming needs a lot more money than what is available now. But representatives of countries will fly into Baku locked in a stalemate over who should pay, and how much. One of the biggest questions of all is, what precisely should be included in climate finance? One action in particular could make a big difference: climate diplomats could formally request that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issue a special report on climate finance. They need to do this before binding decisions are made. Why the timing of climate assessments matters Why the timing of climate assessments matters Next year, countries must update their climate action plans (known as Nationally Determined Contributions , or NDCs), so that their ambition matches what is needed to keep temperatures from reaching dangerous levels. Currently, some of the most common actions include installing more solar- and wind-energy plants and protecting forests and other ecosystems. But the speed and scale of these developments are nothing like what researchers say are needed to prevent average global temperature rises from exceeding the 1.5 degC target set at COP21 in Paris in 2015. Even if all of the current NDCs are honoured, the world is still looking at temperatures rising to 2.1-2.8 degC above pre-industrial levels by 2100. In a scenario in which warming is kept under 1.5 degC, greenhouse-gas emissions need to be 43% lower than 2019 levels by 2030, according to the IPCC. Achieving the above presupposes that eye-wateringly large sums of money can be found to cover the costs of the sustainability transition. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will need to increase their annual investments to around US$2.4 trillion by 2030, according to one widely quoted report from an international group of climate finance researchers that was published for COP28 last year (see go.nature.com/4fgwt1i ). That's around 20 times the climate finance ($116 billion) that went to LMICs in 2022, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published in May . But there's no consensus on these figures, nor indeed on other questions. Who will pay the extra sums and by when? How much should be grants, versus loans? How much should be set aside for climate mitigation, such as funding technologies that help prevent global warming? How much for adaptation measures such as flood defences? Climate negotiators have been meeting all year ahead of COP29, but there's little agreement on what is being called a new collective quantified goal on climate finance . Biases in 'sustainable finance' metrics could hinder lending to those that need it most Biases in 'sustainable finance' metrics could hinder lending to those that need it most High-income countries want LMICs to assume more responsibility for climate finance, whereas LMICs want the opposite -- receiving a greater share of grants as opposed to loans -- to account for the fact that some of the most vulnerable countries are those that are least responsible for climate change. Matters are worsened by there not being an agreed definition for the constituent components of climate finance -- something that Chapter 15 of the IPCC's sixth assessment report on climate finance recognizes (see go.nature.com/4el1luq ). Some say that climate finance should not include funding for things that, strictly speaking, are not wholly about climate change. For example, if money is used to pay for a housing development that is powered by renewable energy, there isn't a consensus on how much of the total cost should be classified as climate finance. Too high a figure risks overstating the amount of money classified as climate finance. That's why Nature is suggesting that the IPCC should be called on to advise. It is the one organization that everyone should trust to establish a base of evidence to help answer questions that are struggling to find consensus. A group of countries would need to make a specific request to the IPCC secretariat, based in Geneva, Switzerland, for a special report on climate finance. The IPCC would then issue a call for evidence. This would trigger funders and researchers to convene, to commission and carry out research that would be included in the special report. The IPCC has played such a part before at key moments in climate policymaking. An IPCC special report was requested after the Paris climate agreement to assess the evidence on the impacts of 1.5 versus 2 degC of warming, as well as the menu of proposed pathways to get to 1.5 degC ( J. E. Livingston & M. Rummukainen Environ. Sci. & Policy. 112 , 10-16; 2020 ). It's a tried and tested way to provide the international community with the knowledge and data needed to make wise decisions. It took around two years between commissioning the report and publishing it, which is why countries need to get their request in early. Climate finance is not small money: even $2.4 trillion is about the gross domestic product of Italy. But in the end, such sums need to be seen as investments that will yield a return, rather than as a cost. It's understandable that there are a range of views, and the IPCC is not the body to decide how much is feasible and on what terms -- responsibility for such decisions falls to country representatives. But the IPCC can assist negotiators by helping to answer their questions on the basis of the latest literature -- while also updating that literature. Amid all the arguments, no one can doubt that a step-change will be needed in climate finance if temperature increases are to be held within safe limits. The IPCC cannot be the decision-maker, but it can advise. Countries should lose no time in asking it to do so.",nature,2024-11-05T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03585-x
