Why is mathematics education failing some of the world’s most talented children?,"Growing up in India, economist Abhijit Banerjee was always intrigued by the impressive mental arithmetic skills of young people working in the stalls at the local fruit and vegetable markets. “I used to tag along with my grandfather” to these markets and “I could see kids ... who could do the mathematics involved”, he told the Nature podcast . “You could buy five things and then give them some money and they would give you the correct change back, you know, quite complicated calculations.” Through his work in India, Banerjee, who is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, revealed that these same young people are doing poorly in tests of mathematical proficiency similar to those that determine their success at school and beyond. The results indicate that maths education must broaden its scope and approaches to serve all — especially the talented and hard-working children from lower-income families. The question is: how? School smart or street smart? Maths skills of children in India tested School smart or street smart? Maths skills of children in India tested Maths education is becoming ever more important worldwide. Written assessments are set to become more complex as countries adapt their schools’ curricula to meet the needs of our increasingly data-rich world, incorporating data and computational literacy along with conventional textbook maths. Proficiency in the kind of maths assessed in written exams is key to careers in computing, engineering, mathematics and science. A sound grasp of principles of mathematical reasoning is also necessary for other professions and for many life skills. In practice, a student leaving school today would ideally need to know, perhaps using basic algebra and statistics knowledge, how to interpret the infographics that fill their social-media feeds. They should have some understanding of coding principles, even if they haven’t written code themselves. And they need to be familiar with, if not be proficient in using, spreadsheets and other programs. Innovative approaches are needed to ensure that children benefit from such education. In a study published last week, Banerjee, economist Esther Duflo at MIT, psychologist Elizabeth Spelke at Harvard University in Cambridge and their colleagues compared the maths proficiency of two groups of young people under the age of 18 years in India ( A. V. Banerjee et al . Nature https://doi.org/n5xz; 2025 ). Both groups attended school, but one group also worked in markets. The researchers found that the working group was more proficient in mental arithmetic than the other one . Yet, those who worked performed poorly in standard written tests of arithmetic problems, such as doing long division. Read the paper: Children’s arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics Read the paper: Children’s arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics The results reveal both the power of learning-by-doing and its pitfalls. This method doesn’t automatically lead to success in existing written tests. To do better, these children need help with mathematical reasoning, to complement their rapid mental addition and subtraction skills. Moreover, if a student is already struggling with written assessments in long division and algebra, telling them that they need to learn how to do statistics and use coding programs, such as Python, will not yield the desired outcomes. Better teaching is crucial, but worldwide, there’s a shortage of trained maths teachers. Changing that and improving how mathematics is taught should be a top priority for education systems, says mathematician and educator Marcus du Sautoy at the University of Oxford, UK. There are, however, several obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this, as studies, including those by science-education researcher Jonathan Osborne at Stanford University in California, have shown ( C. D. Wilson et al. J. Res. Sci. Teach. 61 , 38–69; 2024 ). The first is that many if not most standard assessment systems globally do not reward an understanding of reasoning — that is, how a particular result was arrived at (the stories behind the maths and science). They reward a mastery of the method and an ability to get the right answer. Second, relatively few teachers are skilled at teaching reasoning and describing maths through storytelling, and of those, even fewer teach students from low-income families. These obstacles and others must be overcome. It will require big-picture thinking, assessment of the latest research and action from all those involved in maths-education policy. Banerjee and his colleagues have shone a much-needed light on a reservoir of underappreciated talent. With the right guidance, these children could one day be working in research laboratories, establishing start-up companies — and becoming the maths teachers that their countries so desperately need, not least to help future generations to achieve their full potential.",nature,2025-02-12T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00402-x
Out of Africa: celebrating 100 years of human-origins research,"On 7 February 1925, Nature published an article about a curious fossil unearthed in South Africa 1 . ‘ Australopithecus africanus : The Man-Ape of South Africa’ had been sent in by Australian palaeoanthropologist Raymond Dart, who was then at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. In his memoirs, Adventures with the Missing Link (1959), Dart notes that he was dressing for a wedding when he was distracted by the delivery of two large boxes of rocks, containing the face of Australopithecus and the braincast (known as an endocast) — an internal cast of the braincase formed from sediment — that fitted into the skull, like a ball in a baseball pitcher’s mitt. The specimens’ site of origin — a lime-works and adjacent farmland in Taung, South Africa — was already known as a source of monkey fossils. A humanlike skull 2 had also been found in 1921 at a mine near Broken Hill in what is now Kabwe, Zambia. In The Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin had predicted that the roots of the human lineage lay in Africa. Although Australopithecus had its antecedents, Dart’s discovery was the start of a century-long journey of discovery that has confirmed Darwin’s prediction. 100 years of Australopithecus 100 years of Australopithecus Nature , together with Nature Africa , Nature Communications and Nature Ecology and Evolution , is publishing two collections to commemorate this anniversary. The first includes 100 papers that charted this journey and reveal the part that this journal has played in documenting it. The second delves into the field of palaeoanthropology from the perspective of African scientists today . The skull that commanded Dart’s attention was intermediate in form to those found before. Although that of a non-human ape, the skull clearly had humanlike characteristics, too, as anthropologist Dean Falk at Florida State University in Tallahassee describes in an Essay in this issue . The foramen magnum — the hole through which the spinal cord enters the skull — was underneath, rather than towards the back of, the skull, indicating that its owner had walked upright. The shape of the face and endocast was much more humanlike than apelike. The jaw, too, looked more human than did that of Eoanthropus dawsoni , or Piltdown Man, a supposed ‘missing link’ between humans and other apes from Piltdown village, UK, described in 1912. Dart surmised that Australopithecus adults would have had a brain capacity similar to that of a gorilla. However, the skull was clearly that of a small child. Dart concluded that the fossil vindicated Darwin’s prediction of an African human origin . ‘Taung Child’ fossil offers clues about the evolution of childhood ‘Taung Child’ fossil offers clues about the evolution of childhood Trenchant criticism came thick and fast. The London-based grandees of anthropology noted that the juveniles of humans and other apes looked similar, so Australopithecus could just as easily have been a non-human ape. They might also have been irked by Dart’s comments about the humanlike jaw of Australopithecus . In those days, it was thought that the large brain of humans evolved before the humanlike jaw and the rest of the skeleton. An upright ape with a small brain and humanlike jaw, therefore, went against the grain. It would be decades before Piltdown Man was exposed as a hoax, a mash-up of a modern human skull and an orang-utan jaw, and Australopithecus was finally accepted as being closer to humans than to other apes. Meanwhile, physician-palaeontologist Robert Broom had started unearthing further Australopithecus fossils, showing that Dart’s specimen was not a fluke . And so, the course was set. Eventually the focus of human-origins research moved from southern to East Africa and the name of Louis Leakey began to appear in the scientific record, although in those days of less-thorough sub-editing, he is listed in his first Nature paper ‘Stone Age Man in Kenya Colony’ as ‘Leaky’ 3 . The Taung child: Celebrating 100 years The Taung child: Celebrating 100 years Leakey, the son of a missionary who had come to Kenya to preach to the Kikuyu communities, established a fossil-hunting dynasty, although it was his second wife, Mary (née Nicol), who discovered their breakthrough fossil 4 , then named Zinjanthropus boisei (Nutcracker Man), in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in 1959. Nature became Leakey’s field diary. In the early 1990s, John Maddox, the journal’s then editor-in-chief, explained (in the presence of this editorial’s writer) to Leakey’s son Richard — another distinguished palaeontologist — that all papers in Nature were refereed except, historically, “those from [astronomer] Fred Hoyle and your dad”. Richard was visiting the journal’s London offices and commented on a Nature paper describing a remarkable fossil from Ethiopia, of a species then called Australopithecus ramidus 5 . He said that his wife, palaeoanthropologist Meave Leakey (née Epps), had equally exciting finds to report. Nature subsequently published her paper, too, on a four-million-year-old hominin species from Kenya 6 . Ethiopia was by then on the palaeoanthropological map. Other countries in Africa would soon join it, with key fossils found in Chad 7 , Malawi 8 and Morocco 9 . And Nature was there to document every new bone and tooth. Nowadays, West Africa is in the frame for new and exciting discoveries. The past, as they say, is a different country, and so it was for 1925. Nature back then makes for often grim reading — paternalistic, male-dominated, imperialist, colonialist and, at times, nakedly racist. Had Dart’s paper been submitted today, it would at the very least have included the names of several others, notably, Josephine Salmons, a student demonstrator of anatomy at the same university as Dart, who brought the fossil to his attention. Although things have changed, the field of palaeoanthropology 10 has been slow to recognize the contributions of the many women , including Salmons, and African scholars who made key discoveries. One such researcher was Kamoya Kimeu , one of the greatest observers of human origins, who died in 2022. His successors are, increasingly, leading research today. The collections aim to celebrate all those who contributed to humanity’s evolving understanding of this part of the human story. The people might have changed, but Africa remains the heart of human origins.",nature,2025-02-05T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00282-1
How the World Health Organization can thrive without the United States,"The executive board of the World Health Organization (WHO) is meeting this week, just days after US President Donald Trump made the decision to withdraw the United States from the WHO. This loss of a founding member is, without doubt, a heavy blow; in 2022–23, the United States contributed around one-sixth of the agency’s overall income. In his keynote speech to the board , WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for “constructive dialogue to preserve and strengthen the historic relationship between WHO and the USA”. Even if Trump should change his mind, his move to withdraw the United States must still act as a wake-up call for the WHO’s remaining 193 member countries to step up. The organization cannot allow itself to become so reliant on a single donor again. Vaccines save lives: how can uptake be increased? Vaccines save lives: how can uptake be increased? Part of the difficulty the WHO faces is that it is not easy to succinctly articulate what the agency does. It is the world’s only global authority for coordinating international public-health work. For low-income countries, the WHO provides a lifeline to affordable drugs and vaccines, access to quality standards and help to increase health-care capacity. All countries benefit when the WHO’s actions limit the spread of infectious diseases. The agency’s signature achievement is the eradication of smallpox in 1980. Since then, governments worldwide have given the WHO responsibility for surveillance and control of infectious-disease outbreaks. It works with national health systems to promote good health and to set standards for vaccines and therapeutics. Increasingly, the agency is harnessing science and evidence in its decision-making, through a (still relatively new) office of the chief scientist. Work that the US contribution, which in 2022–23 came to some US$1.3 billion, has helped to fund includes efforts to contain infectious-disease outbreaks such as mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, and Marburg virus disease in Rwanda. The United States has been instrumental in the fight against Ebola virus, as well as in providing humanitarian and emergency-health assistance in areas affected by conflict. The US contribution has been considerable. But the funding gap left by its exit could be filled by the WHO’s remaining members — particularly the high-income and upper-middle-income nations — and philanthropic foundations. Possibly anticipating a US exit, last November the WHO leadership secured $3.8 billion in extra donor pledges, which will go some way towards the additional $7.1 billion needed to cover the organization until 2028. These pledges must be converted into money in the bank without delay. In the past, some donors have suggested structural reforms of the WHO’s governance. It is arguable whether, at this time of crisis, such reform should be the number-one priority. Mpox: apply COVID lessons to control outbreak in Africa Mpox: apply COVID lessons to control outbreak in Africa The WHO, like most large multilateral agencies, is complex. It is both an expert-led standard-setting body and an organization involved in alleviating suffering on the ground. Yet, at the same time, it is political: the head of the WHO is elected by the world’s governments through a vote at the World Health Assembly, a kind of parliament of health ministers. This means that candidates campaign for the post, as do the six elected directors of the WHO’s regional offices. Every WHO director-general, from the first, Brock Chisholm, to the incumbent, Tedros, has had to work within such a political framework. There is an argument for separating the agency’s political and technical functions. However, unless WHO member states all agree — which is unlikely in the current geopolitical climate — the current architecture will not change. That said, the world is very different today compared with 1948, when the WHO was founded. Established regional public-health bodies such as the Pan American Health Organization have been joined by newer ones, notably the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, in setting health-care standards and overseeing their delivery. Philanthropic organizations also offer a source of funding. These beneficial developments are helping to share the load previously carried mainly by national governments and the WHO. Diseases, especially infectious diseases, do not respect borders. That is one of the reasons why the WHO was established as a global body, and it should have meant global responsibility for its funding. As the world’s largest economy, it is understandable that the United States became the WHO’s largest donor, and we hope it will soon rejoin the agency. But if countries genuinely want and value an organization that champions health for all, they must all step up to pay for it.",nature,2025-02-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00283-0
A shout-out for AI studies that don’t make the headlines,"It is not even past January, and 2025 is already proving to be a defining year for artificial intelligence (AI). On 21 January, just one day into his presidency, US President Donald Trump announced the Stargate Project, a joint venture between leading technology companies and financiers in the United States, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. They pledged a staggering US$500 billion to developing AI infrastructure in the United States. Yet only the next day, DeepSeek, an AI-research company based in Hangzhou, China, showed that such vast sums might not be needed. It released DeepSeek-R1, a large language model (LLM) capable of step-by-step tasks analogous to human reasoning — reportedly at a fraction of the cost and computing power of existing LLMs. In early tests, its performance on tasks in chemistry and mathematics matched that of the o1 LLM released last September by OpenAI, a firm based in San Francisco, California. The news of a cheap yet advanced AI has sent the price of some technology stocks into a tailspin. The AI tool that can interpret any spreadsheet instantly The AI tool that can interpret any spreadsheet instantly Amid the various visions for AI that are likely to define the coming years, important studies will continue to be published, but not all will make headlines. They, too, need to be heard about, discussed and debated. One such work was published in Nature earlier this month. It is called ‘Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model’ ( N. Hollman et al. Nature 637 , 319–326; 2025 ), and it could be revolutionary for the field of data science, according to one of its reviewers, Duncan McElfresh, a data engineer at Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto, California, writing in an accompanying News and Views article ( D. C. McElfresh Nature 637 , 274–275; 2025 ). The best-known LLMs are pre-trained on hundreds of billions of examples of actual data, such as text and images. This enables them to answer user queries with a degree of reliability. But what if relevant real-world data do not exist in the required quantities? Can AI still provide reliable answers when trained on fewer data sets? This is a key question for researchers who use AI to make predictions from tabulated data sets, of which there is nowhere near the required quantity for training AI models. The Nature study suggests that reliable results could be achieved if AI models are trained on ‘synthetic data’ — randomly generated data that mimic the statistical properties of real-world data. This advance is the work of computer scientists Noah Hollman, Samuel Müller and Frank Hutter at the University of Freiburg, Germany, and their colleagues. Their model is called TabPFN and is designed to analyse tabulated data, such as those found in spreadsheets. Typically, a user creates a spreadsheet by populating rows and columns with data, and uses mathematical models to make inferences or projections from those data. TabPFN can make predictions on any small data set, ranging from those used in accounting and finance to those from genomics and neuroscience. Moreover, the model predictions are accurate even though it is trained entirely without real-world data, but instead on 100 million randomly generated data sets. AI firms must play fair when they use academic data in training AI firms must play fair when they use academic data in training Synthetic data do not come free of risks, such as the danger of producing inaccurate results, or hallucinations. This is partly why it is important that such studies are replicated. Replication, a cornerstone of science, also reassures users that they can trust the results of their queries. Enhancing trust in AI, along with minimizing harms, must remain a global priority, even though it seems to have been downgraded by Trump. The president has rescinded an executive order by his predecessor, which called on the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and AI companies to collaborate to improve both trust in and the safety of AI , including for the use of synthetic data. Trump’s new executive order, which is called ‘Removing barriers to US leadership in artificial intelligence’, neglects to use the word ‘safety’. Last November, NIST published a report on methods for authenticating AI content and tracking its provenance (see go.nature.com/42c21tn ). Researchers should build on these efforts and not let them go to waste. Hollman and colleagues’ work is an example of necessity spurring innovation: the researchers realized that there were not enough accessible real-world data sets to train their model, and so they found an alternative approach. It remains the case that all AI models, whether trained on synthetic or real-world data, are still black boxes: users and regulators do not know how a result is reached. So, as 2025 brings more exciting developments, let’s not forget the studies that attempt to understand the ‘how and why’ of AI, and the methods papers, too. They are as important as the publications that announce the breakthroughs.",nature,2025-01-29T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00214-z
Humanity needs to diversify its lithium sources,"Nations are moving away from energy supplied mainly by fossil fuels to using renewable sources, but this transition relies on devices that we all take for granted: batteries. Humanity needs more of them and quickly, especially for electric vehicles, which use up most available battery power. In 2016, the global inbuilt battery capacity in all electric vehicles was around 50 gigawatt hours. By 2023, that figure had surged to almost 800 gigawatt hours . And, by 2035, according to one scenario considered by the International Energy Agency, it could be at least ten times that in 2023 — assuming that countries meet their fossil-fuel reduction pledges (see go.nature.com/4avqdax ). The rechargeable battery is not as new as many might surmise; it is, in fact, more than 150 years old. The first such device was a lead-acid battery, invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Planté. The technology was used to power the first electric cars that were developed at the turn of the twentieth century. The battery’s descendants are still providing electrical charge to petrol and diesel engines. Today, lithium is the element of choice in the weighty boxes that power electric vehicles. The lithium-ion rechargeable battery isn’t a spring chicken either: materials scientists John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino developed the device in the 1970s and 1980s (although they had to wait until 2019 to receive a Nobel prize for the breakthrough). Lithium is the smallest metallic atom in the periodic table under ambient conditions, and the lightest of the alkali metals. This means that it can carry a lot of electric charge for its size, and that the element can be found in lots of places, from mineral deposits to salty water. Ten years left to redesign lithium-ion batteries Ten years left to redesign lithium-ion batteries The United States Geological Survey estimates that the known sources of lithium globally comprise around 105 million tonnes, of which 28 million tonnes can be extracted economically with current technologies (see go.nature.com/4hshays ). That could be around a century’s worth of battery supplies. The global annual demand for lithium is around 200,000 tonnes today, although it is projected to increase sevenfold by 2040, the International Energy Agency says (see go.nature.com/4jabduz ). Having an ample supply is good news. But the bad news is that most of the known accessible lithium deposits are found in just a few countries. Although Australia is currently the world’s largest producer of lithium, about half of the world’s known reserves are contained in salt flats in the ‘lithium triangle’ on the borders of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. China also has considerable reserves. Extracting lithium from these sources is an energy-intensive process . Large amounts are needed to pump water from its source into huge ponds, where the water evaporates, leaving behind salts. These salts are further processed and separated to obtain lithium-rich minerals. All stages of the process use considerable quantities of fresh water, often in arid locations, where this resource is scarce. Up to two million litres of water are needed to extract a tonne of lithium, according to some estimates. An obvious alternative is to obtain lithium from brines, such as seawater; the element is abundant in the world’s oceans. But at 0.1–0.2 parts per million, extracting the metal from these sources is challenging technically and, as is the case for lithium mining, it also has a considerable environmental footprint. Lithium extraction from low quality brines Lithium extraction from low quality brines For these reasons, brines are not considered a dependable source. But, as materials scientists Ping He, Haosheng Zhou and their colleagues at Nanjing University in China explain in a Review article in Nature , there are ways to improve existing methods of separating lithium from lower-quality sources, such as developing chemicals that grab lithium more effectively or using special filters and electricity that can separate it out ( S. Yang et al . Nature 636 , 309–321; 2024 ). The good news is that several techniques, from improved filters to better precipitation methods, are being developed to do just that. However, to fully exploit lower-quality lithium sources, the authors say, research needs to go back to the basics of understanding how low concentrations of tiny ions can be separated, and then build back up to improve on the technologies currently being developed. Researchers are also examining alternatives to lithium, including sodium . The element sits directly below lithium in the periodic table, has similar chemical properties and is easier to source, but its atoms are heavier. Extraction is only one part of the story. When it comes to the full process of producing lithium batteries, only one country has worked out what to do at scale: China’s government and companies have invested heavily in all stages of electric-vehicle development, including batteries. This is partly to satisfy domestic demand: more than half of new vehicles are electric. Although the nation is responsible for mining around 20% of the world’s lithium, it refines almost 60%. When it comes to making lithium-ion battery components, China is responsible for making more than 80% of each battery part used globally. Other countries need to work out how they too can access this crucial energy source. The final part of the picture is to improve the batteries themselves. Battery performance must be enhanced; they need to last longer and be fully or mostly recyclable. In all respects, lithium is the key.",nature,2025-01-28T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00213-0
Menopause research is globally underfunded. It’s time to change that,"Menopause — the cessation of menstruation — will be experienced by the overwhelming majority of women at some time in their lives. It’s hallmark symptoms include poor sleep, hot flushes and low mood; it also brings with it an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and memory loss. Yet, it has rarely been a priority for health systems, or indeed for research. That something experienced by half of humanity is not more studied is little short of scandalous. The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women’s health The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women’s health In some parts of the world, the situation might be changing, albeit slowly, as we report this week in a News Feature . The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), for example, is working with researchers to create a strategy for menopause research. Researchers are revisiting the potential of hormone therapy, a once-popular treatment, while also exploring ways to prolong ovarian life and therefore delay the onset of menopause. At the same time, an increasing number of health-care professionals are showing interest in becoming certified to treat menopause. In the United States between 2022 and 2024, for example, there was a fivefold increase in people applying to take the certification exam of the Menopause Society, a non-profit organization in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Many of these initiatives need to become better known. On the funding side, perhaps one of the more surprising things is that, so far, few funders seem to be following in the NIH’s footsteps. Women’s health: end the disparity in funding Women’s health: end the disparity in funding Menopause occurs typically between 45 and 55 years old. It can also occur earlier for a variety of reasons, including natural causes, or because of disease or as a result of treatment. The experience of menopause can be improved through hormone therapy, which works by replenishing some hormones that are depleted during menopause, particularly oestrogen and progesterone. However, early results in 2002 from an influential study by the Women’s Health Initiative changed how many women and health-care providers perceive hormone therapy ( Writing Group for the Women’s Health Initiative Investigators JAMA 288 , 321–333; 2002 ). One of the study’s findings was that people who had been through menopause and who were taking oestrogen and a synthetic form of progesterone had a slightly elevated risk of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke. Globally, prescriptions for menopause-related hormone therapy dropped sharply. Numbers struggled to recover even after later studies emphasized the limitations of the original findings. Researchers and clinicians are still playing catch-up in trying to get across the message that, as well as managing menopause symptoms, the long-term benefits of menopausal hormone therapy could outweigh the risks for those for whom hormone therapy is a suitable treatment. For this editorial, Nature asked some of the larger health-research funding agencies in the United States and Europe about their record and plans for menopause research. The overwhelming majority of studies in the field of ageing do not consider menopause, according to a paper in Nature Aging ( G. Gilmer et al. Nature Aging 3 , 1500–1508; 2023 ). The NIH established a category for menopause research in 2023, and is working on a research agenda. The sums involved are not huge, it must be said, but this is not a complete surprise. As we have reported before, conditions that mainly affect women garner much less funding than do those that predominantly affect men. The NIH allocated US$56 million to menopause studies in 2023, projected to increase to $58 million this year. Women’s health research lacks funding — these charts show how Women’s health research lacks funding — these charts show how The US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, which has a focus on high-risk, high-reward topics, has two menopause projects that are together worth $13.5 million, with one to extend ovarian function and lifespan, and another to develop ovarian implants to prevent diseases associated with menopause. Horizon Europe, the world’s largest multinational research-funding programme, has awarded €12 million (US$12.4 million) to a consortium of universities for a project called Caramel, which aims to prevent cardiovascular disease in women aged 40–60. However, Horizon Europe does not have a separate menopause category. Neither does it have a category for women’s health, instead including the subject in a general ‘health’ portfolio of grants. Last October, Pivotal Ventures, an organization established by philanthropist Melinda French Gates, launched a $250-million funding call aimed at organizations around the world that are working to improve women’s health. Overall, however, menopause is not a defined category for many of the world’s largest philanthropic funders, also including Wellcome in London and the Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. Possibly for this reason, neither of these agencies was able to tell Nature the precise extent of their menopause-related funding. Establishing a separate category of research might seem arcane, but it is unambiguously a sign that funders consider menopause to be a priority. It allows researchers to know how much money is available and how to apply for it; and lets them track what has been spent in the past and who received it. The disruptive nature of menopause and its health impacts have been known perhaps for millennia and frankly should have been a priority topic for health funders for a long time. It is never too late to start.",nature,2025-01-22T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00150-y
Dear Donald Trump: A letter from Nature on how to make science thrive,"Dear Mr President-elect, On 20 January, you will be sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. Congratulations on your win. A majority of US voters have placed their trust in you. That is a tremendous responsibility. We, the editors of the international scientific journal Nature , lay out why, in our view, science is core to an administration’s ability to maintain the country’s health, prosperity and security . And we outline what researchers will need to help your government to succeed in achieving these goals. Research and innovation are overlapping domains in which the United States has been world-leading for generations. The work of scientists underpins health and prosperity . Take the Human Genome Project: this US$3-billion investment has revolutionized our understanding of diseases. Within a decade of the project’s completion, it had added an estimated $1 trillion to the US economy . Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it? Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it? As you prepare to return to the White House, we urge you not to lose sight of the need for the US government to continue to provide support for researchers — especially in terms of fundamental science and the opportunity for researchers to collaborate with peers around the world. And we urge you to examine the evidence for what works and what doesn’t before announcing new policies. Climate and energy security need to be priorities. From a scientific perspective, there is no question that human activities are warming the planet. The overwhelming consensus of researchers is that all nations are vulnerable to severe disruptions from continued burning of fossil fuels. Disruptive climatic effects are likely to have been a major contributor to the devastating wildfires seen in California this month, to name just the most recent example. Wildfire smoke is a serious health hazard. Many important policies designed to protect people from the effects of climate change, including investment in new energy sources, are in place in the United States. Your administration has an opportunity — and a responsibility — to build on this work. Scientists are building giant ‘evidence banks’ to create policies that actually work Scientists are building giant ‘evidence banks’ to create policies that actually work But the United States cannot tackle climate change or health issues, such as infectious diseases, on its own. The country must continue to work with and, when appropriate, lead other nations through the global organizations and agreements that it is a party to and, in many cases, helped to establish. International accords are complicated and imperfect, but they can be reformed. The alternative — of not having them or withdrawing from them — will put the United States and the rest of the world at greater risk. We urge you to engage. Global cooperation is the only viable approach to global problems. You have also signalled a desire for government reform, including slashing public-sector spending and improving government efficiency. Some researchers are frustrated with aspects of how the government operates — for instance, how research funds are allocated and how drugs and biomedical products are vetted. One of their concerns is that overly cautious rules might be slowing the roll-out of life-saving treatments. As your administration seeks improved outcomes, we urge you to consult with the widest possible range of stakeholders, including those who study the problems you are looking to solve, as well as those who have lived experience of them. This will provide the best chance of reaching optimal solutions. Useful insights will come from industry. Companies have huge experience of experimenting with product and process innovation, and they feel the impact of poorly thought-out regulations keenly. We also encourage you to talk to organizations representing consumers; patients’ groups; researchers studying science and ethics, and science and public policy; and the research departments of regulatory bodies themselves. What Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers What Trump 2.0 means for science: the likely winners and losers Transparency is a non-negotiable principle in modern societies and is central to the verification of scientific knowledge. The ability to work in open and transparent ways is also core to the jobs of the scientists working as career civil servants in various branches of the federal government. These subject specialists are essential to public safety — be it in relation to climate change, infectious disease or artificial intelligence. As Nature reports in a News Feature this week , researchers are concerned about the possibility of civil-service staff being replaced each time an administration changes. Such a change would not serve the interests of people in the United States. US science has been transformational for the United States and for the world. Research today is a hugely collaborative enterprise. The big discoveries and innovations happen when researchers are able to communicate with, learn from, visit, and live and work with researchers in different countries. This allows for the efficient exchange of knowledge and for the best and brightest to work together no matter where they happen to have been born, giving breakthroughs the best chance of success. We urge you and your administration to ensure that the United States continues to welcome researchers from all parts of the world. Mr President-elect, science is a self-correcting process in which bad actors and wrong ideas sooner or later get rooted out and fuzzy evidence becomes sharper. That is the joy and the beauty of the method that has made the modern world what it is. The more you can support science, the better it will be for the United States and its people — and, ultimately, for the planet on which we all depend. If you can do that, it will be a positive legacy for your administration.

How science recruiters and job applicants can get on the same page,"Every year, tens of thousands of people around the world apply for research jobs armed with postgraduate qualifications and specialized knowledge, only for their carefully crafted applications to seemingly vanish into a digital void. At the same time, recruiters report that they are unable to find appropriate candidates for open positions. Last year, 46% of around 1,000 respondents to a survey of research hiring managers from academia and industry told Nature ’s Careers team that a lack of what they regard as ‘high-calibre’ candidates is their topmost concern (see go.nature.com/3drcqnz ). Killer questions at science job interviews and how to ace them Killer questions at science job interviews and how to ace them One key cause of this mismatch is the perception that someone with science qualifications is fully qualified for research work. The reality is that, often, a PhD or a first postdoctoral post is the equivalent of an entry-level qualification, with the holder needing further advice, guidance, mentoring and experience before they can work independently. Shifting generational priorities also play a part. For example, most current early-career scientists are millennials, born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s. They are often digitally savvy and bring with them strong collaborative instincts and a desire to see their work have societal impact. They also tend to value work–life balance and career flexibility, which might not always square with the priorities of the scientists interviewing them for jobs. Meanwhile, employers responding to Nature ’s survey report that candidates often lack creative thinking, problem-solving and communication skills and qualities such as persistence, passion and tenacity. However, there’s little by way of structured training for jobseekers on how they can learn or show evidence for these characteristics . Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach. But three interventions could make a difference. As Nature has argued before , universities and other research-training institutions can do more to expand the focus of PhD training beyond the academic track. This means providing advice and guidance about what career paths and job opportunities might be available for researchers in companies, the public sector and non-governmental organizations. This could come, for example, through talks from alumni or former university-based staff who have transitioned to other sectors. For those looking to build their careers at universities, institutions could learn from other public- or private-sector employers by implementing job-shadowing schemes, for example, in which undergraduate students follow postdocs for a week. Want a new job in science? Six charts to help you land it Want a new job in science? Six charts to help you land it The large online platforms that connect researchers to potential employers need to become less robotic. Often, candidates will submit a job application in response to an advertisement and hear nothing back beyond an automated acknowledgement. Many recruiters state that they will not provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants. That is understandable for positions that might receive a large number of applicants. But it is also demoralizing for jobseekers, and gives the impression of an uncaring employer — not somewhere where the most talented people would want to go and work. Some recruiters told Nature that they prefer to hire through their professional networks, rather than rely on the big online platforms. This is partly to weed out cut-and-paste applications, or those that seem to have been generated using artificial-intelligence tools. This shows the continued importance of networks for career development, and means that those entering the job market should receive training in how to build networks. Employers need to consider the benefits of structured training for early-career researchers, as a way to boost critical thinking and analytical skills. This could be done by reproducing the training schemes commonly used by large pharmaceutical, technology, consulting, finance and legal firms. They often include rotations so that new hires can experience working in different departments for short periods. Such schemes do not need to cost the Earth — a legitimate concern for small- and medium-sized companies. There are other models, too, such as short-term internships. How job-seeking scientists should walk the line between high-calibre and humble How job-seeking scientists should walk the line between high-calibre and humble Overall, universities and other training bodies must accept that they need to work harder to understand the challenges that science jobseekers face and make it their mission to provide students and trainees with the skills to succeed in the current job market. The stakes here aren’t just about individual careers. Failing to properly prepare researchers for professional success wastes not only researchers’ potential but also society’s investment in scientific training. The path forward requires jobseekers and recruiters to understand each other better. Candidates would benefit from learning why recruiters are dissatisfied with the calibre of applicants. Institutions, for their part, must see themselves as architects of scientific careers. This means acknowledging that professional preparation isn’t a distraction from research excellence — it is an essential component of it.",nature,2025-01-14T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00049-8
Quantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution,"It is rare for a scientific idea or theory to fundamentally change our perspective on reality. One such revolutionary moment is being celebrated in 2025, which the United Nations has declared to be the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology . This marks the centenary of the advent of quantum mechanics, which began in a flurry of papers 100 years ago. Just as it would be impossible to make sense of modern biology without Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, our fundamental understanding of the physical world is now rooted in quantum principles. Modern physics is quantum physics. The word quantum refers to the way matter absorbs or releases energy — in discrete packets, or quanta. Its use in physics comes from the German word quant , which is derived from a Latin term meaning ‘how much’. In around 1900, physicists such as Max Planck and Albert Einstein began to describe, in an ad hoc way, why several phenomena of the subatomic realm could not be explained using the classical mechanics developed by Isaac Newton and others some two centuries earlier. Then, in 1925, quantum came to be used to describe the fundamentals of an entirely new form of mechanics — the branch of physics that describes the relationship between forces and the motion of physical objects. How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago As science historian Kristian Camilleri describes in an Essay on the startling developments of that year and those that followed, the physicist Werner Heisenberg travelled to the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea in the summer of 1925 in search of relief from severe hay fever. Shortly after this, he submitted to the journal Zeitschrift für Physik a paper whose title translates as ‘On quantum-theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic and mechanical relationships’ ( W. Heisenberg Z. Physik 33 , 879–893; 1925 ). This prompted further studies in the following months by Heisenberg and his close collaborators, as well as work using an alternative approach by Erwin Schrödinger. The revolution did not begin with physicists throwing away the laws of classical mechanics, but with their radically reinterpreting classical concepts such as energy and momentum. However, it did require its initiators to abandon dearly held common-sense ideas — for example, the expectation that subatomic objects such as particles have a well-defined position and momentum at any given time. Instead, the physicists found that natural phenomena had an inherently unknowable nature. Classical physics, in other words, is only an approximate representation of reality, and manifests itself only at the macroscopic level. A century on, this insight into the nature of the physical world still thrills and bamboozles in equal measures. Many Nature readers will know about the philosophical quandaries raised by quantum cats that are simultaneously dead and alive, and about the industry that is growing around quantum computing . Others will know how quantum ideas gave rise to the lasers that beam information through the cables of the Internet, and the transistors that provide the processing power of electronic chips. But quantum ideas also shape our understanding of nature, at all levels, explaining why solid objects don’t fall apart and how stars shine and, ultimately, die. Commemorative events are being planned all over the world for the coming 12 months. They include an opening ceremony for the UN year at the headquarters of the UN scientific organization UNESCO in Paris in February; special events at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California, in March; and a workshop for physicists on Heligoland in June. The organizers’ collective ambition is to celebrate not just the centenary of quantum mechanics, but also the science and applications that arose from it in the past century — and to explore how quantum physics might bring further change in the century to come. This billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed? This billion-dollar firm plans to build giant quantum computers from light. Can it succeed? In May, Ghana, the country that originally proposed that the UN proclaim 2025 the year of quantum science, is hosting an international conference on the topic in Kumasi. And in August, science historians will meet to celebrate the quantum century in Salvador de Bahia in Brazil. This meeting will be the high point of a 20-year research programme that set out to re-examine the development of quantum theory. One major aim of that work, says historian Michel Janssen at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was to establish the contributions of a collective of scientists, many of whom — particularly women — have not been recognized in the history of the field. These “hidden figures” include Lucy Mensing, who was a member of the same group as Heisenberg and worked out some of the first applications of his quantum-mechanical theory, says Daniela Monaldi, a historian at York University in Toronto, Canada. One of the most notable events of the year will be the publication of a biographical volume of essays on 16 of them, Women in the History of Quantum Physics . For all that it has already brought, the quantum revolution still has unfinished business. In the years in which researchers were laying the foundations of quantum mechanics, they also began to rebuild other branches of physics — such as the study of electromagnetism, and states of matter — from quantum foundations. They also looked to extend their theories to encompass objects that move at close to light speed, something that the original quantum theory did not. These efforts drastically expanded the scope of quantum science and led researchers to develop the standard model of particles and fields, a process that finally came together in the 1970s. ‘A truly remarkable breakthrough’: Google’s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone ‘A truly remarkable breakthrough’: Google’s new quantum chip achieves accuracy milestone The standard model has been incredibly successful, culminating in the 2012 discovery of its linchpin elementary particle, the Higgs boson. But these extensions lie on less-solid theoretical ground than quantum mechanics does — and leave several phenomena unexplained, such as the nature of the ‘dark matter’ that seems to greatly outweigh conventional, visible matter in the wider cosmos. Moreover, one important phenomenon, gravity, still resists being quantized. Other conceptual problems of quantum physics remain open. In particular, researchers struggle to understand what exactly happens when experiments ‘collapse’ the fuzzy probabilities of quantum objects into one precise measurement, a key step in creating the — still remorselessly classical — macroscopic world we live in. Over the past few decades, researchers have been developing ways to turn these quirks of quantum reality into useful technologies. The resulting applications in computing, ultra-secure communications and innovative scientific instruments are still in their nascent stages. Quantum theory keeps on giving. This year is an opportunity to celebrate and to make the broader public aware of the role that quantum physics has in their lives — and to inspire future generations, whoever they are and wherever they are in the world, to contribute to another quantum century.",nature,2025-01-08T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00014-5
We need to talk about human genome editing,"Scientists know about tens of thousands of DNA variants that are associated with human diseases. On their own, the vast majority of these variants have small effects. But taken together, the result can be substantial. The effects of modifying multiple variants at once, known as polygenic genome editing, is the subject of an analysis published this week in Nature ( P. M. Visscher et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08300-4; 2025 ). Read the paper: Heritable polygenic editing as a potential frontier in genomic medicine Read the paper: Heritable polygenic editing as a potential frontier in genomic medicine The study reveals that polygenic genome editing in human embryos could substantially reduce the likelihood of certain diseases occurring, but it raises concerns, not least the renewed threat of eugenics. There are other caveats too, the researchers report. Nature is publishing this work because it is important to start a conversation about what could happen if more-sophisticated gene-editing technologies become available, which could be the case within 30 years, the authors say. Societies need to consider relevant benefits and risks before that day comes. Peter Visscher, a statistician and geneticist at the University of Queensland, Australia, and his colleagues modelled the consequences of simultaneously editing specific variants linked to a number of diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and major depressive disorder (MDD). Gene-editing tools currently in development, called multiplex technologies, are projected in the coming decades to enable rapid precision DNA editing at tens, or even hundreds, of locations. The researchers found that, in some cases, editing a single variant associated with a polygenic disease can have strong effects, and, with the exception of MDD, editing up to ten genes associated with a disease can reduce its lifetime prevalence by an order of magnitude. Human embryo editing against disease is unsafe and unproven — despite rosy predictions Human embryo editing against disease is unsafe and unproven — despite rosy predictions This would be a huge achievement. However, the authors also include an extensive discussion of the study’s limitations and challenges. The fear that polygenic gene editing could be used for eugenics looms large among them, and is, in part, why no country currently allows genome editing in a human embryo, even for single variants. There are also significant technical caveats. The authors say that polygenic editing is unlikely to benefit the wider population in any realistic timeframe, because the technology is available only through in vitro fertilization. There are also not yet enough known causal variants for common diseases. Other limitations to the findings include the fact that many diseases are also caused by non-genetic factors, which are harder to model. Furthermore, a successful new treatment for one of the diseases is likely to reduce the need for human genome editing. There are also pleiotropic effects to consider: a gene variant that is a risk factor for one disease could offer protection against another. And then there’s the risk that these technologies will widen inequality and social divisions, because the costs will probably be substantial. These issues need society-wide discussion. The past few decades have shown that new technologies are being developed ahead of conversations on their ethics or social and environmental impacts. From the atomic bomb to artificial intelligence, discussions of risks, benefits, safety, regulation and transparency have had to play catch-up. As recently as 2018, biophysicist He Jiankui shocked the world by announcing that he’d created genetically edited babies. The mistake should not be repeated. Although it will be some decades before human-gene-editing science and technologies can be applied with precision and at scale, they are on their way; this is not a hypothetical issue. The intervening time should be used wisely. Societies need to be ready, understand the upsides and the dangers, and know what to do when that time comes.",nature,2025-01-08T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00015-4
2025 must be the year when the rules of global finance are reformed,"In 2022, the latest year for which full data are available, the world spent just short of US$10 trillion on health care. The United States was by far the largest single spender, representing 43% of the total. At the other end, around 75 of the poorest countries spent less than 4% of the global total, and many are not allowed to increase this. That’s because they owe huge sums to richer countries — and the lending agreements say that paying off debts has to be prioritized ahead of public spending. Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits This is just one example of how inequity is baked into the world’s financial system — creditors can dictate lending terms to some of the most vulnerable countries without any oversight. However, in June and July 2025, the international community will have an opportunity to ensure that this situation can be consigned to history. Leaders of global financial institutions will meet in Seville, Spain, for a summit on funding the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), of which SDG3 is about ensuring health for all. By some estimates, upwards of $2 trillion annually are needed to achieve the SDGs, according to analysis (see go.nature.com/4iigk6c ) from the UN’s trade body UNCTAD, based in Geneva, Switzerland. As we reported in our December 2024 editorial ( Nature 636 , 521–522; 2024 ), the sums of money currently on offer are much lower than what is needed. Delegates should strain every sinew to ensure that the Seville meeting succeeds. Today’s ‘international financial architecture’ has its roots in the 1944 UN Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. This meeting created two global lenders: the World Bank to finance post-war reconstruction, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a sort of ‘lender of last resort’. As the most powerful nation to emerge from the war, the United States became the largest shareholder in both the World Bank and the IMF, with veto powers on key policy decisions. Washington DC was chosen as both organizations’ headquarters and the dollar became the world’s reserve currency — all countries use it to trade and for borrowing. The rest of the world essentially lives by these rules. Economists knew that the system had flaws. For example, when central banks raise interest rates to bring down inflation, it can make many other countries poorer by putting more pressure on borrowers to find the money needed to keep up with loan repayments. This happened during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation was worsened because many currencies also lost significant value against the US dollar, in part because of restrictions on exports. And so, at a time when countries need to obtain significant extra financing to achieve the SDGs, many are instead battling to remain solvent. And when they go to climate or biodiversity conferences, there’s little financing offered, with creditor countries saying they have to prioritize austerity at home. Many low- and middle-income countries have therefore sought alternative routes. China, for example, is now a big global lender in its own right, offering a mix of grants and loans at concessionary rates, independently of the IMF and the World Bank. China is the main shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Together with other countries in the BRICS group — including Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa — it has also established another international lender called the New Development Bank. There is a lack of formal coordination between old and new lenders, which is among the reasons the Seville meeting must prioritize financial-governance reform. UN secretary-general António Guterres wants to create a coordinating body for international financial institutions. Lenders need to be supervised by regulatory bodies. The world’s largest lenders have no such system or body to report to. When a team from the World Bank or the IMF goes into a country with debt distress, there needs to be an ‘honest broker’ who can effectively protect the country’s interests and advocate on its behalf. Rich countries must align science funding with the SDGs Rich countries must align science funding with the SDGs After the 2008 global financial crisis, regulators learnt that they need to have oversight of what is happening, from the level of institutions all the way to entire financial systems. It makes no sense that the largest institutions can still operate without anyone to report to other than their own boards ( A. G. Haldane and R. M. May Nature 469 , 351–355; 2011 ). Another priority for the meeting has to be ensuring that indebted countries are not penalized for things outside of their control, such as inflation caused by a pandemic, having to rebuild after natural disasters or dealing with the effects of climate change. And decisions must always be informed by evidence from a consensus of the research. For example, there is good evidence that, in the long run, it is best that public finance be the main contributor to infrastructure, rather than private capital (see go.nature.com/49t6xey ). This is because public sources do not need returns on their investments at the scale or the speed that private sources do. And this is better for projects that take time to build, or that will need a long time to pay back creditors. It is crucial that the Seville meeting raises sufficient finance for the SDGs and takes concrete steps towards governance reform, building on a long history of previous attempts. Let’s make 2025 the year when international finance really does meet the needs of those who require it the most, without exploiting their vulnerabilities.",nature,2024-12-30T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04159-7
Give ‘science for peace’ a chance,"The fall of the regime of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, which brought widespread joy and optimism , was a rare and welcome development in what has mostly been another devastating year of violence and conflict around the world. Wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan have made the past year one of the deadliest in recent times, according to the latest Armed Conflict Survey (see go.nature.com/3z565x ), produced by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), based in London. Worldwide, nearly 200,000 people were killed between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, a 37% rise from the previous 12-month period. Mark Rutte, the former Netherlands prime minister, now head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), said last week that NATO must prepare for a “wartime mindset”, and urged member states to allocate more money to military budgets. In 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, world military spending had risen to an all-time high of nearly US$2.5 trillion, the ninth consecutive annual increase (see go.nature.com/4gggmuf ). In Africa, military spending was one-fifth higher than it was in 2022. But are more wars inevitable? Why can’t peace be more of a priority? These questions need to be asked, and they make a new initiative called Science 4 Peace Africa all the more timely. What’s next for Syria’s science: a view from Nature ’s reporter who was a refugee What’s next for Syria’s science: a view from Nature ’s reporter who was a refugee At last week’s African Academy of Sciences (AAS) general assembly in Abuja, Nigeria, Lise Korsten, president of the AAS, which is headquartered in Nairobi, and Sara Clarke-Habibi, a peace-building specialist at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) in Geneva, Switzerland, outlined a way for the African scientific community to work with stakeholders in the pursuit of peace and in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Korsten and Clarke-Habibi have set themselves a monumental task, and they are asking the right questions. Perhaps most importantly, their plan does not assume that wars are inevitable. Africa’s leaders and their international partners need to sit up and listen to what they are proposing. Science 4 Peace Africa aims to establish the main drivers of conflict in the continent and see how science cooperation can address them. The approach has two aspects: first, specialists across disciplines and sectors, including research, policy and humanitarian relief, will map existing peace-building initiatives that involve the scientific community and highlight future opportunities. This will then feed into more-detailed consultations for each region. The second aspect is capacity-building: the initiative will train students and researchers in using peace-building tools in education and scholarship. “Research, innovation and teaching can actually reinforce conflict drivers when not developed in a conflict-sensitive way,” Clarke-Habibi and Korsten write in the project’s concept note . A fresh start for the African Academy of Sciences A fresh start for the African Academy of Sciences This is important work not just for the knowledge and skills it will generate, but also because it will give scientists visibility in fields in which they can lack influence. Science is often not well represented in diplomacy or peace-building, a point also made in a Communications Engineering comment article published last month ( M. M. López et al. Commun. Eng. 3 , 159; 2024 ). The authors of the article say that peace-building efforts are led by people with backgrounds in social and political sciences, law, diplomacy and humanitarian relief. Those with backgrounds in science, engineering and technology need to be among those doing strategic planning. Peace itself is foundational to the SDGs, not least SDG 16: peace, justice and strong institutions. “When regions are destabilized, research is often interrupted, resources diverted, partnerships falter and knowledge exchange and innovation uptake come to a halt,” say Clarke-Habibi and Korsten. Peace-building organizations such as the Pugwash Conferences on Science in World Affairs were established by scientists in the wake of previous global conflicts. But, they are finding it tough to be heard amid the constant and rising drumbeat of war. The AAS and UNITAR have an innovative plan. It has seed funding from South Africa’s government, and now needs support from other funders and policymakers. There is no law of nature that says that there must be more conflicts and that more people must lose their lives.",nature,2024-12-18T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04114-6
"Good COPs, bad COPs: science struggles in a year of environmental summits","People in some 70 countries took part in various national elections this year, a record number. And in March, Nature reported that results in at least five polls could either boost or block climate action (see Nature 627 , 22–25; 2024 ). Overall, it has been a dismal year, particularly for science in multilateral policymaking. The tension and mistrust between nations evident in the daily news is affecting the use of science in decision-making. Research is being ignored in international talks designed to meet global challenges, including those addressed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Campaigners, scientists and policymakers are becoming ever more frustrated. Some are taking action through legislative means — this month, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, has been hearing arguments about states’ obligations under international law to protect people from the effects of climate change. Others are opting for a more direct route, through science activism . In the climate-change sector especially, there’s a view that the processes of the summits known as Conference of the Parties (COP) have had their day or, at the very least, need to be reformed. The research community needs to carefully and systematically study why scientific knowledge is being pushed out, as a first step to finding a way forward. Let’s start with international climate negotiations. Even by COP standards, the COP29 climate-change conference in Baku last month ended with unusual acrimony between rich and poor nations about who is ultimately responsible for tackling the climate crisis. The funds eventually agreed — US$300 billion annually for developing clean-energy technologies and for nations to adapt to the effects of climate change — are inadequate to help the world avert dangerous levels of climate change, and to help some of the most vulnerable people deal with its effects. Is the COP29 climate deal a historic breakthrough or letdown? Researchers react Is the COP29 climate deal a historic breakthrough or letdown? Researchers react The UN COP16 biodiversity meeting in Cali, Colombia, also ended without the funding boost needed to restore and protect nature. Countries pledged $163 million, which is orders of magnitude short of the $200 billion a year needed to reach the goal of protecting 30% of the world’s land and seas by 2030. Delegates did agree that large companies should pay if they made a profit using genetic information from nature, but payments will be voluntary. The international community is also sharply divided on the scope of an agreement that is being negotiated to end plastics pollution. The latest talks in Busan, South Korea, have been extended into 2025 . Talks on a pandemic treaty have also been pushed to next year. African nations are at odds with Europe and the United States over a request that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) should have preferential access to pandemic-related products that are developed using their data. And at the end of last week, delegates left the UN conference on dealing with droughts and desertification (UNCCD) in Riyadh without arranging to begin talks on a legally binding protocol to tackle the issue. However, they did agree to expand the UNCCD’s body of independent scientific advisers. September’s Summit of the Future in New York City, organized by UN secretary-general António Guterres also ended with some positive outcomes, including a bold statement that recognizes science as essential to tackling global challenges in its final document, the Pact for the Future . But questions need to be asked as to how this statement can be implemented in the current, highly polarized political climate. It might seem that the world is in a golden age of science in multilateral policymaking. Researchers at universities, in campaign groups and in industry are attending COPs and other meetings in considerable numbers: at least 3,000 scientists attended last year’s COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (see ‘COP28 in numbers’). They have a variety of roles. Some advise nations’ delegates, the policymakers involved in treaty negotiations. Others are members of official UN science advisory committees. And some come to the meetings to take advantage of the presence of the global media to publicize their research. And yet, despite scientists’ presence, it is evident to observers that COP delegates are not taking research into account in the actual talks. If they were, then negotiating positions would not be as polarized as they are becoming. For instance, Nature argued last month that a study of climate finance by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would help to take some of the heat out of disagreements over money. Before the IPCC can commission such a study, a few countries have to propose it. However, until now, there have been no takers. This lack of interest seems like a break from the past, when research helped to shape legally binding agreements, such as the 1989 Montreal Protocol to prohibit the use of ozone-depleting substances, and the 1997 Kyoto Climate Protocol. And in 2015, research was at the core of the design of the SDGs . Even though groups of scientists in several countries have proposed ways to end plastic pollution, they are struggling to make their voices heard at the talks on a plastics treaty. This is because the UN still hasn’t organized a formal system for researchers to advise during the discussions. It’s worth reflecting for a moment on why research is currently struggling to have an impact. When the present system of science advice in UN meetings was originally established, the United States and European countries were the world’s largest economies. Their delegates often dominated proceedings, or at least commanded an outsize presence during talks. Much of the research that underpinned UN environmental agreements also came from these nations, as did the scientists observing the talks and many of the world’s influential media outlets covering them. How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work But that world is changing. China is the second largest economy globally and India is on a path to becoming the third. An increasing amount of SDG-related research is now coming from LMICs . At the same time, the place of science in negotiations is affected by this shift in the balance of power. Put simply: when research is performed, or funded, by high-income countries, it is perceived by some in LMICs as being biased in favour of the negotiating positions of the governments of those nations. Overall, the system that scientists use to access and influence UN environmental agreements is under strain.

Why the genetic-testing revolution left some people behind — and what to do about it,"When Mary-Claire King embarked on a painstaking 17-year-long hunt for a gene linked to breast cancer, she had no inkling that its discovery would be saving lives some three decades later . King, an evolutionary geneticist, was trying to solve the mystery of why breast cancer was common in some families. This was during the 1970s, decades before the first human genome was sequenced. In the absence of modern tools such as PCR tests, sequencing and mapping genes took a heroic effort. Cancer researchers at the time were mostly studying tumour-causing viruses, but several individuals having the disease across generations of the same family suggested that considerable danger could lurk in the human genome, too. What is the best time of the month to treat breast cancer? What is the best time of the month to treat breast cancer? “The worldwide impact of something like this just never crossed my mind,” says King, who is at the University of Washington in Seattle. “I was absolutely gobsmacked.” King named the gene BRCA1 . Since then, it has become clear that mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for about 35% of hereditary breast cancers, and that genetic variants of it and a related gene called BRCA2 are also linked to ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Drugs have been developed that target cancers with these variants, and genetic tests are available to identify people who are at risk. But looking back on the impact of BRCA1 ’s discovery also highlights how far there still is to go. Too few people have access to genetic tests and, even when they do, they have few options to reduce their risk of cancer. Researchers must advocate for and study ways to improve access and to expand the cancer-prevention options available to people who carry BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Huge leap in breast cancer survival rat Huge leap in breast cancer survival rat BRCA1 encodes a protein that is important for repairing damaged DNA. Although King identified the BRCA1 gene and pinpointed its location 1 in 1990, the team that first sequenced it in 1994 included researchers at the precision-medicine firm Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, Utah 2 . Myriad promptly applied for patents on the gene and used this intellectual property to prevent competitors from developing tests for cancer-associated BRCA1 mutations. The high price tag of Myriad’s genetic tests kept them out of many people’s reach, until a landmark US Supreme Court decision in June 2013 found that such gene patents were invalid . Following the court’s decision, test prices in the United States plummeted from around US$3,800 to $250, as other providers surged into the field. Yet, testing remains limited, despite studies 3 finding that expanding BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing to all women could be cost-effective, particularly for those screened between the ages of 20 and 35. There are several reasons for this, including limited health-care access and concerns about privacy. Lack of awareness among primary-care physician s about genetic testing and conflicting guidelines from professional organizations about who should be tested contribute, too. For now, however, even in places where testing is an option, it is often made available only to those at high risk of carrying a cancer-associated form of BRCA1 , including people with a high rate of cancer in their family (see ‘Testing times’). Many who are eligible do not get tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: one US study 4 found that only about 35% of eligible individuals with ovarian cancer and 56% of eligible people with breast cancer had been tested. Other problems limit the tests’ practical benefits, too. Reports provided to physicians and people with cancer are often unnecessarily complicated, because they list not only mutations known to increase risk, but also any other unusual DNA sequences in the genes — even if their relevance is unknown. Many tests also provide data on genes unrelated to cancer, launching fresh medical odysseys for people already dealing with a cancer diagnosis. When King accompanied a friend diagnosed with breast cancer to a clinical appointment, the attending doctor waved off suggestions for BRCA1 testing. “The difficulty with genetic tests,” they said, “is that they simply beget more tests.” This scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab This scientist treated her own cancer with viruses she grew in the lab Simplifying tests and equipping medical staff with the knowledge to interpret the results could improve uptake. People who learn that they carry worrisome BRCA1 mutations need better options to either prevent cancer from developing or intercept it at an early stage. This is particularly crucial for reducing the risk of ovarian cancer and aiding its early detection. Whereas mammograms can detect some breast tumours early, there is no equivalent test for ovarian cancer, which is often diagnosed at late stages. At present, cancer detection and prevention are typically achieved by careful monitoring or, in some cases, surgery to remove the breasts and ovaries. “When I see a 25-year-old woman newly found to have a BRCA1 mutation, I’m mostly having the same conversations now that I did long ago for her options for risk reduction,” says Susan Domchek, a breast-cancer specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. “We have a lot of work to do.” To improve on this, researchers must develop better means of detecting cancers early, and learn more about the biology of early tumours and why some will go on to become malignant whereas others do not. They must also investigate ways to treat people at earlier stages — an effort that will require learning more about early cancers’ biological hallmarks. By contrast, most treatments are first developed for and tested in people who have advanced disease. By filling the gaps on testing and giving people with harmful mutations better ways to reduce their risk, BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing could become a model for how genetic tests for other cancer risk factors should be implemented. Then, King’s crucial discovery will save even more lives.",nature,2024-12-10T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-04046-1
More-powerful AI is coming. Academia and industry must oversee it — together,"“It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.” So wrote Sam Altman , the chief executive of OpenAI, a technology firm based in San Francisco, California, on 23 September. This was less than two weeks after the company behind ChatGPT released o1 , its most advanced large language model (LLM) yet. Once confined to the realms of science fiction, the rise of LLMs in the past few years has renewed the relevance of the question of when we might create artificial general intelligence (AGI). Although it lacks a precise definition, AGI broadly refers to an AI system capable of human-level reasoning, generalization, planning and autonomy. How close is AI to human-level intelligence? How close is AI to human-level intelligence? Policymakers everywhere have questions about AGI, including what its benefits and risks will be. These are not easy questions to answer, especially given that much of the work is happening in the private sector , in which studies are not always published openly. But what is clear is that AI companies are laser-focused on giving their systems the whole range of cognitive abilities enjoyed by humans. Companies developing AI models have a strong incentive to maintain the idea that AGI is nigh, to attract interest and therefore investment. There was a consensus among researchers who spoke to Nature for a News Feature published this week (see Nature 636 , 22–25; 2024 ) that large language models (LLMs), such as o1, Google’s Gemini and Claude, made by Anthropic, based in San Francisco, have not yet delivered AGI. And, informed by insights from neuroscience, many say that there are good reasons to think that LLMs never will, and that another technology will be needed for AI to achieve human-level intelligence. Despite their breadth of ability — from generating computer code to summarizing academic articles and answering mathematics questions — there are fundamental limitations in the way the most powerful LLMs work, which involves essentially devouring a mass of data and using that to predict the next ‘token’ in a series. That generates plausible answers to a problem, rather than actually solving it. AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think François Chollet, a software engineer formerly at Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Subbarao Kambhampati, a computer scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe, have tested o1’s performance on tasks that require abstract reasoning and planning, and found that it comes up short of AGI. If AGI is to happen, some researchers think that AI systems would need coherent ‘world models’, or representations of their surroundings that they can use to test hypotheses, reason, plan and generalize knowledge learnt in one domain to potentially limitless other situations. This is where ideas from neuroscience and cognitive science could propel the next breakthroughs. Yoshua Bengio’s team at the University of Montreal, Canada, for example, is exploring alternative AI architectures that would better support the building of coherent world models and the ability to reason using such models. Some researchers argue that the next breakthroughs in AI might come not from the biggest systems, but from smaller, more-energy-efficient AI. Smarter systems in the future could also require less data to train if they had the ability to decide which aspects of their environment to sample, rather than simply ingesting everything they are fed, says Karl Friston, a theoretical neuroscientist at University College London. Such work demonstrates that researchers from an array of fields need to be involved in AI development. This will be necessary to verify what systems are truly capable of, ensure that they live up to the technology companies’ claims and identify the breakthroughs needed for development. However, right now, accessing the leading AI systems can be difficult for researchers who don’t work at the companies that can afford the vast quantity of graphical processing units (GPUs) needed to train the systems ( A. Khandelwal et al . Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/nt67; 2024 ). ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI To give a sense of the scale of activity, in 2021, US government agencies (excluding the Department of Defense) allocated US$1.5 billion to AI research and development, and the European Commission spends around €1 billion (US$1.05 billion) annually. By contrast, companies worldwide spent more than $340 billion on AI research in 2021 ( N. Ahmed et al. Science 379 , 884–886; 2023 ). There are ways that governments could fund AI research on a bigger scale, for example by pooling resources. The Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe, a non-profit organization based in The Hague, the Netherlands, has suggested building a ‘CERN for AI’ that can attract the same level of talent as AI companies do and so create a cutting-edge research environment. It is hard to predict when AGI might arrive — estimates range from a few years from now to a decade or longer. But more huge advances in AI will certainly happen, and many of them will probably come from industry, considering the scale of investment. To ensure that these advances are beneficial, the research from technology companies needs to be verified using the best current understanding of what constitutes human intelligence, according to neuroscience, cognitive science, social science and other relevant fields. This publicly funded research needs to have a key role in AGI’s development. Humanity needs to bring all knowledge to bear so that applications of AI research are robust and its risks are mitigated as much as possible. Governments, companies, research funders and researchers need to recognize their complementary strengths. If they do not, then insights that could help to improve AI will be missed — and the resulting systems risk being unpredictable and therefore unsafe.",nature,2024-12-06T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03911-3
Advising governments about science is essential but difficult. So train people to do it,"Earlier this year, Nature asked science-policy specialists which country is particularly good at ensuring science is factored into government decisions. The question mystified many respondents. “Not aware of any,” wrote one. “None have enviable systems,” wrote another. “Very hard to say,” said a third. Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it? Science could solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Why aren’t governments using it? That sums up the poor opinion that many have of science advice to governments. Nature ’s survey was sent to several thousand people worldwide, most of whom are affiliated to the International Network of Government Science Advice (INGSA), a global association of researchers and policymakers, based in Auckland, New Zealand. Some 80% of the nearly 400 respondents rated their country’s science-advice system as being patchy, poor or very poor. Blame lay on both sides: 77% said that policymakers and politicians ignore and undervalue science advice, and 73% said that researchers fail to understand policy. That dismal verdict is worrying. It has been nearly five years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many scientists had difficulty giving governments advice and politicians struggled to implement it . And yet, it seems that only a few countries have stopped to make repairs. Governments today are wrestling with climate change, infectious diseases, artificial intelligence and wars. To address these issues effectively, they need knowledge from research. More than 70% of survey respondents said that misinformation and disinformation obscure science advice. Having political leaders who are receptive to science is one essential ingredient for effective science advice. Another is having people who can deliver it well. It is a misconception to think that someone successful in research will also succeed in politics and policymaking, in which events move faster than in academia and the style of delivery is as important as what is said. Improving global science advice — and therefore improving the world — needs people with better training and skills for the job. Why we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments Why we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments That brilliant scientists often prove ineffectual in government has been clear since at least the mid-1960s, when the first cross-government chief scientific adviser was appointed in the United Kingdom. “Having gained access to the corridors of power, scientists could not find their way to the men’s room,” wrote science journalist Peter Ritchie Calder, in his 1975 memoir Scientists in the British Government . Politicians weren’t much better, he added: they were “deferential, even gullible, but, by and large, they did not know the right questions to ask”. A lot has changed in the intervening years. Today, many countries have well-established formal systems in which governments call on chief science advisers, national academies and committees of scientists to inform policy with evidence from research. Beyond this, research shapes policy in a spectrum of ways, from think-tank reports to scientist–politician meet-and-greets. Aside from an understanding of science, a core attribute for science advisers is a good grasp of: how governments and their departments work; the goals and deadlines of policymakers; and how evidence can be appropriately added to the mix. That experience can be gained, for example, through fellowships or internships in government agencies. In the United States, the American Association for the Advancement of Science runs one well-known fellowship in Washington DC. There are many more. Another requirement is a repertoire of people skills: the ability to communicate complex ideas in succinct, everyday language; the capacity to build trusting relationships, so that politicians have faith in the information they receive and that their confidences will not be breached; being able to respectfully understand others’ views and priorities, however different. “Only in this way can you hope to convey the evidence to them in a way that helps them understand and appreciate it,” says Mark Ferguson, who was Ireland’s chief science adviser between 2012 and 2022. Training scientists in policy is one approach. Also important is to nurture an emerging group known as knowledge brokers — people specialized in incorporating research evidence into the machinery of government. AI tools as science policy advisers? The potential and the pitfalls AI tools as science policy advisers? The potential and the pitfalls A growing number of institutions worldwide offer training to both scientists and knowledge brokers. One is the International Institute for Science Diplomacy and Sustainability in Kuala Lumpur, which was founded last year by Zakri Abdul Hamid, a former science adviser to Malaysia’s prime minister. The institute trains people to bridge science and international diplomacy, preparing them for United Nations climate meetings, for instance. INGSA offers training too, but wants to do more, says Rémi Quirion, chief scientist of Québec, Canada, and INGSA’s president. Research funders and employers need to incentivize researchers to do science-advice training and work. Some 60% of survey respondents said that funders’ failure to do so was an impediment to science advice. These efforts need to be informed by evidence. A study in 2022 identified more than 1,900 initiatives worldwide aimed at promoting greater engagement between policymakers and researchers, from the collaborative production of policy briefs to networking events ( K. Oliver et al . Evid. Policy 18 , 691—713; 2022 ). Only 6% had been evaluated to assess how well they worked. Today’s challenges are galvanizing interest in science policy among young people who see it as a more direct way to have an impact than pure research. That’s good news. It is easy for researchers to gripe that politicians don’t understand science. A better response is to learn about politics and policy, and to get involved.",nature,2024-12-04T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03910-4
"A plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time","More than two years ago, Nature urged the international community to put science front and centre as nations embarked on talks to agree a treaty to end plastics pollution. Such an agreement is needed urgently. Around 400 million tonnes of plastics are produced each year, and this figure is expected to double by 2040. Of all the plastics that have ever been produced, only about 9% have been recycled. If left unchecked, and if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, plastics production and disposal are projected to be responsible for 15% of permitted carbon emissions by 2050. But the effort to curb plastics pollution is, at best, a work in progress. The latest round of talks in Busan, South Korea, broke up on 1 December without a treaty being formally agreed. Campaign groups and representatives of many countries — especially island states, which see the effects of plastics pollution every day, as plastics wash up on their coastlines — were visibly angry and frustrated. How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work How to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work The meeting’s outcome was not a surprise. International agreements can take years to finalize. This is particularly true of complex accords that involve the regulation of individual chemicals and chemical products. Talks on the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention took more than a decade, from start to finish, before the agreement opened for signatures in 1993. The makings of a text for a plastics treaty are now in place and negotiators will reconvene within a year to continue talks. Although delegates’ frustrations are justified, the commitment to continuing the discussions and the ambition of most participating countries to secure a strong agreement are positive, says Samuel Winton, a researcher at the Global Plastics Policy Centre at the University of Portsmouth, UK, who is studying the negotiations as they unfold . There have been five rounds of negotiations since talks on an agreement got the green light at the UN Environment Assembly in March 2022. The proposed agreement will cover polymers and microplastics — particles less than five millimetres long — and products that contain them. UN plastics treaty: don’t let lobbyists drown out researchers UN plastics treaty: don’t let lobbyists drown out researchers It will include a list of named products to be regulated. There will also be provision for chemicals and products to be exempt from the treaty, but the criteria for these are yet to be defined. The treaty will have a “financial mechanism” — that is, some form of funding attached. Who will contribute, what the fund should total and what it is intended to be used for all remain to be agreed. Some of these questions might end up being parked until after the treaty text has been finalized and the first conference of the parties (or COP meeting) is held. We know from COP meetings on other topics that it is extremely difficult for participants to reach an agreement when there are too many issues in contention. One area on which the latest meeting reached, at best, a fragile consensus was the part of the text that says that any eventual agreement must cover the “full life cycle” of plastics. This was in no small part because what is meant by full life cycle still needs to be defined. Most countries interpret it as including both the production and disposal of plastics. However, some 30 countries that extract and sell fossil fuels — including Kuwait, Russia and Saudi Arabia — oppose the idea of setting limits on plastics production and would prefer the treaty to concentrate on regulating waste flows. This is an area in which a role for scientists will be key, both to help define terms according to a consensus of the evidence and to undertake research to bridge any knowledge gaps. Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre Landmark treaty on plastic pollution must put scientific evidence front and centre That said, scientists have found it hard to get access to talks on the treaty. This is partly down to logistics — there are around 2,000 accredited observers allowed to attend the talks, out of a total of 3,300 participants, and meeting rooms cannot accommodate these numbers. Another reason, according to researchers at the Centre for Science and Environment, a think tank in New Delhi, is that some decisions were made in closed groups of countries that did not permit observers to attend. This is not a positive development, because it risks undermining trust in what should be a transparent process. Observers represent industry, non-governmental groups and academic research. So far, each negotiating session has seen more representatives from the fossil-fuel industry than the last, according to the Center for International Environmental Law, a non-governmental organization in Washington DC (see go.nature.com/3zgjzba ). These voices cannot be allowed to dominate. The UN Environment Programme, based in Nairobi, is the overall host for the talks, and has still not announced how it will formally incorporate independent scientific advice. It should delay no further in addressing this: a formal role for scientists is essential. Both the treaty’s text, including its definitions, and the post-treaty implementation plans must be based on an accepted consensus of the research evidence. It is clear that the majority of countries do not want a weak treaty and are not going to compromise just to get a text over the line. And although all nations are looking to protect their own interests, no country doubts the need for an agreement to end plastics pollution. The status quo cannot continue — and scientists must guide the way, both during the negotiations and to ensure that the treaty, once finalized, is observed.",nature,2024-12-03T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03932-y
"In the big data era, prioritize statistical significance in study design","‘Experimental design’: these words signal a section of a research paper that many readers might be inclined to scan fleetingly, before moving on to the actual findings. But a study in Nature this week should make all researchers — both readers and writers of papers — consider dwelling a little more on the methods part of the scientific process. Read the paper: Study design features increase replicability in brain-wide association studies Read the paper: Study design features increase replicability in brain-wide association studies The study, led by Simon Vandekar, a biostatistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, is on how to make brain-wide association studies (BWAS) more robust ( K. Kang et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08260-9; 2024 ). The core idea of BWAS is to study collections of brain images using statistical tools and machine-learning algorithms. This is to predict what specific brain features or patterns of activity are associated with traits or behaviours, for example an ability to reason abstractly or a tendency to experience particular negative emotions. But BWAS have a perennial, and well-known, problem of low replicability: two studies on the same topic can come to different conclusions. Much of the problem is that some BWAS studies need huge sample numbers to reflect effects accurately. Small sample sizes can exaggerate the relationship of a certain brain feature to a behaviour or trait. In the similar field of genome-wide association studies — which seek to relate differences in DNA with traits in health or disease — the problem of unreliability is being overcome by gathering data sets with tens of thousands of samples from participants. However, in the case of the brain, this is much more difficult, especially for researchers outside Europe and the United States. One hour of scanning in a molecular resonance imaging (MRI) machine costs about US$1,000. The US National Institutes of Health distributes around $2 billion for neuroimaging research each year, but few other countries have this level of resource. Vandekar and his colleagues suggest that concentrating on quality, rather than quantity, could be one answer. They analysed more than 100,000 MRI scans from healthy adults and healthy children, as well as scans from children with mental-health conditions. Design tips for reproducible studies linking the brain to behaviour Design tips for reproducible studies linking the brain to behaviour Their aim was to explore how factors such as age, sex, cognitive function and mental health are associated with brain structure and function across diverse study designs. For example, one study explored how brain volume changes with age. Vandekar and his co-authors found that, compared with one-off scans of multiple people — cross-sectional studies — repeated MRI scans of the same people over time yielded more-robust results (see R. J. Chauvin and N. U. F. Dosenbach Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-03650-5; 2024 ). Such longitudinal studies have long proved their worth in areas of science such as identifying biomarkers for chronic or degenerative diseases ( Y. Guo et al. Nature Aging 4 , 247–260; 2024 ). Although they don’t work for some types of question for which cross-sectional studies are needed, longitudinal studies are good at ruling out irrelevant factors that looked as if they might be implicated during small cross-sectional studies. There are caveats, however: researchers conducting longitudinal studies must, for instance, take care to leave long enough gaps between measurements in any one individual if they are to capture meaningful and statistically significant differences over time. Vandekar and his colleagues also emphasize that researchers must account both for changes that happen in individuals over time and for differences between individuals. All research needs to be planned. For BWAS, selecting participants in such a way as to achieve robust results and using the right statistical models can improve the trustworthiness of findings without an automatic need for massive sample sizes. The benefits of statistical rigour, in turn, highlight the need for more collaboration between statisticians and neuroscientists, as they use more-sophisticated data-handling methods in their research. These findings will be valuable to the neuroscience community, and deserve wider attention. Many fields of science are plunging into data-driven discovery, increasingly assisted by the pattern-seeking abilities of artificial-intelligence algorithms. As they do so, questions of correlation and causation, and of ensuring that findings are statistically significant and reproducible, are becoming ever more pertinent. That means researchers must not skate over experimental design, whether they are reading a paper or writing one. Greater attention to research methods, and to how a study obtains the signal of its effect, is the way to make sure that results stand the test of time.",nature,2024-11-27T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03843-y
Act now to stop millions of research papers from disappearing,"Millions of research articles are absent from major digital archives. This worrying finding, which Nature reported on earlier this year , was laid bare in a study by Martin Eve, who studies technology and publishing at Birkbeck, University of London. Eve sampled more than seven million articles with unique digital object identifiers (DOIs), a string of characters used to identify and link to specific publications, such as scholarly articles and official reports. Of these, he found that more than two million were ‘missing’ from archives — that is, they were not preserved in major archives that ensure literature can be found in the future ( M. P. Eve J. Libr. Sch. Commun. 12 , eP16288; 2024 ). Eve, who is also a research developer at Crossref, an organization that registers DOIs, carried out the study in an effort to better understand a problem librarians and archivists already knew about — that although researchers are generating knowledge at an unprecedented rate, it is not necessarily being stored safely for the future. One contributing factor is that not all journals or scholarly societies survive in perpetuity. For example, a 2021 study found that a lack of comprehensive and open archiving meant that 174 open-access journals, covering all major research topics and geographical regions, vanished from the web in the first two decades of this millennium ( M. Laakso et al. J. Assoc. Inf. Sci. Technol. 72 , 1099–1112; 2021 ). Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet Millions of research papers at risk of disappearing from the Internet A lack of long-term archiving particularly affects institutions in low- and middle-income countries, less-affluent institutions in rich countries and smaller, under-resourced journals worldwide. Yet it’s not clear whether researchers, institutions and governments have fully taken the problem on board. “Preservation is an issue and it’s an issue that everyone flags, but it’s not an easy issue to solve,” says Iryna Kuchma, the open-access programme manager at Electronic Information for Libraries, a non-profit organization in Vilnius that aims to improve people’s access to digital information. “More and more journals are being established with less and less checks and balances,” says Ginny Hendricks, chief programme officer at Crossref, who is based in London. “You’ve got the big publishers, who are doing a decent job, but then there’s half the journals in the world that are run on a shoestring, and it costs them money to have some kind of service from preservation networks, if they even know about them.” For this Editorial, Nature asked librarians, archivists, scholars and international organizations for suggestions on how to improve the situation. Researchers, institutions and funders should take note of what they can do to help. At the heart of the problem is a lack of money, infrastructure and expertise to archive digital resources. “Digital preservation is expensive and also quite difficult,” says Kathleen Shearer, who is based in Montreal, Canada, and is the executive director of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories, a global network of scholarly archives. “It is not just about creating backup copies of things. It is about the active management of content over time in a rapidly evolving technological environment.” For institutions that can afford it, one solution is to pay a preservation archive to safeguard content. Examples include Portico, based in New York City, and CLOCKSS, based in Stanford, California, both of which count a raft of publishers and libraries as customers. But archiving is often not prioritized when money is tight, as it generally is for publishers in low-resource settings. “That is more of a challenge because a lot of these journals are small and they’re more at risk because they don’t have their own robust infrastructures for platforms and preservation services themselves,” says Kate Wittenberg, Portico’s managing director. Another option could be for institutions and funding bodies to include text and data archiving as a requirement in research projects, along with publishing papers. At a minimum, this would mean depositing work in institutional repositories, in cases in which such facilities exist. When they don’t, making archiving mandatory would compel researchers and their funding bodies to think hard and find solutions to meet an archiving requirement. Making archiving obligatory would also encourage universities that don’t yet operate their own repositories to work towards instituting them. “Universities are one of the most enduring elements of our society,” says Hussein Suleman, a digital libraries scholar at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. “If we adopted this widely, this would be a safeguarding mechanism for the knowledge of our current generation so the future generations can access it.” A further option is for more countries to implement ‘legal deposit libraries’ — keystone libraries into which authors or publishers are obliged to deposit new work. The concept was originally devised so that at least one institution always had a publicly available copy of every published book, but in some countries it has since been expanded to include research works. Further expanding it would not offer a complete solution, because material archived in legal deposit is not easy to find — but it could be done as an absolute minimum to ensure that copies of scholarship continue to exist if their originators are no longer able to support archiving. More or better coordination “between the big players globally” is also needed, says Hendricks. And global should not only mean Western, she adds. Increasing people’s access to knowledge and increasing the visibility of new research is rightly a focus for global research-publishing policy. Archiving is core to this — and core to scholarship itself. As Eve told Nature in March: “Our entire epistemology of science and research relies on the chain of footnotes.” If access to this knowledge becomes more restricted, the research that survives will be dominated by institutions, such as those in Europe and the United States, that have the funds to safeguard their research in archives. Action must be taken now to ensure that records of the scholarship undertaken by everyone, everywhere, can exist in perpetuity.",nature,2024-11-26T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03842-z
‘Forever’ chemicals can be destroyed with clever chemistry — now test these techniques outside the lab,"A simple chemical bond between carbon and fluorine atoms changed the world — for the better, and then for the worse. Such bonds lie at the heart of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of compounds, numbering in the millions, that are remarkably water-, heat- and greaseproof. Discovered in the 1930s with the advent of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, branded as Teflon), these chemicals make pans non-stick and keep the rain off our jackets. Varieties of cosmetics, fire-retardant foam, kitchen utensils, metal coatings, packaging, textiles and more all contain them. But they have become known as ‘forever chemicals’ because they are difficult to break down, persisting in the environment for perhaps 1,000 years or more. They are also ‘everywhere’ chemicals, in that they can be found in rivers and on the tops of mountains. This would not be such a problem, except that the chemicals are highly toxic, having been linked to developmental problems and conditions ranging from cancer to immune-system suppression. The world is belatedly starting to act, both to stop forever chemicals entering the environment and to clean up those already there. But more action is needed — and faster. Catalysts degrade forever chemicals with visible light Catalysts degrade forever chemicals with visible light The carbon–fluorine (C–F) bond is one of the strongest in organic chemistry, requiring huge amounts of energy to break down, at huge expense. But now two papers in Nature 1 , 2 describe two low-energy ways to overcome the C–F bond. Both methods combine a catalyst with some relatively simple chemistry driven by the energy of visible light. In each case, the catalyst absorbs light that then triggers a reaction. Chemist Garret Miyake at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and his colleagues use this absorbed energy to reduce the C–F bond to carbon–hydrogen — albeit not in Teflon 1 . Yan-Biao Kang, a chemist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, and his colleagues uses this energy to break the bond and the overall molecule down to smaller constituent parts 2 , in temperatures as low as 40 °C. Both papers, without doubt, mark a major step forward. Important next steps include using these ideas in real-world settings, for example to develop catalysts that work in waste water or that can be used to clean up PFAS in contaminated soils. If a method can be adapted so that it is powered by sunlight, that would be of huge benefit. Any solutions that emerge from such developments will address only part of the problem. There’s an urgent need both for updated regulation of chemicals, and for more research into safer alternatives to PFAS that do the same things without harming human health and the environment. On the regulatory front, scientists advising the European Chemicals Agency are considering a proposal from countries including Germany and the Netherlands to ban 10,000 PFAS substances currently in everyday use. At the global level, the Stockholm Convention, an international agreement that bans persistent organic pollutants, is revisiting its latest list which classifies only three types of PFAS as banned substances. Could the world go PFAS-free? Proposal to ban ‘forever chemicals’ fuels debate Could the world go PFAS-free? Proposal to ban ‘forever chemicals’ fuels debate It is equally important to stop PFAS entering the water supply. In 2021, the European Environment Agency (working under the European Union’s Drinking Water Directive) for the first time set upper limits on PFAS levels in water. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has gone further . In April, it set safe limits for drinking water, under which there will be ‘close to zero’ levels of certain PFAS. The European proposal doesn’t yet extend to banning PFAS in applications such as medicine or transport, for the simple reason that these chemicals are still too useful and adequate alternatives are yet to be found. C–F bonds in pharmaceuticals allow molecules to remain stable, which is necessary for products’ shelf life. Medicinal chemists are trying to make drug molecules that contain C–F bonds but can biodegrade safely once they leave the body. In some circumstances, PFAS have replaced other harmful chemicals — for example, outdated, ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants. Non-fluorinated refrigerants are also available, including ammonia and carbon dioxide, but large-scale roll out will need regulatory input. A lot of clever chemistry, together with updated regulation, will be needed to ensure that forever chemicals finally become never chemicals.",nature,2024-11-20T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03753-z
"To boost science, the growing BRICS group must embrace inclusion and transparency","When economics researcher Jim O’Neill coined the acronym BRIC in 2001, it was to highlight the potential of four up-and-coming world economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China. O’Neill, who had authored a 16-page research paper for the investment bank Goldman Sachs, couldn’t have imagined that these countries would decide they had so much in common that they would form their own intergovernmental organization. The first formal summit of the BRIC network was held in 2009. The following year, the group became BRICS when South Africa joined. At this year’s annual meeting, held last month in Kazan, Russia, the group expanded once more, formally admitting Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. ‘BRICS’ nations are collaborating on science but need a bigger global platform ‘BRICS’ nations are collaborating on science but need a bigger global platform The latest BRICS expansion comes at a point at which the network can take stock, review its processes and see how it can fully embrace its collaborative potential. In particular, it should be embracing transparency and inclusion in all it does, not least in science. Talk to policy researchers and policymakers in high-income countries about BRICS and you will hear decidedly mixed views. Some see it as an ‘anti-Western’ alliance, whereas others dismiss it as a mere talkfest. Whether justified or not, such criticisms miss a bigger point. BRICS represents a long-held ambition for what is also called south–south cooperation: the idea that nations at similar stages of economic development want to meet and learn from each other. Since its foundation, BRICS has blossomed as one forum for such cooperation . When it comes to scientific collaboration, the BRICS group has taken an approach almost opposite to that of networks such as the larger G20 (to which all five pre-2024 BRICS members also belong). Formal research collaboration involving G20 nations as a single unit is minimal. However, there are BRICS networks for astronomers, environmental scientists, geographers, life scientists and statisticians, among other fields. This year, new groupings have been announced for researchers in humanities and social sciences, in public health and in nuclear medicine. There’s already a BRICS network of policy-research think tanks, and a grouping of BRICS universities. There is also a network for young scientists (under 40 years old), which will be meeting later this month. The countries maintaining research ties with Russia despite Ukraine The countries maintaining research ties with Russia despite Ukraine That makes for a lot of meeting and talking. Each year, a different BRICS member takes the chair and organizes events, and that’s a good thing. India set up more than 100 events in 2022; according to South Africa’s BRICS events calendar, the tally increased to 200 last year under the country’s leadership. But BRICS countries could be doing a lot better in documenting these activities. Some of the biggest beneficiaries could be their researchers, those with expertise who might wish to contribute, but who might not be part of official BRICS networks. Although the country that holds the chair each year produces a website advertising events and publishes short press releases, with some exceptions these say relatively little about the breadth and depth of activity taking place, including any publications that might emerge. All BRICS chairs should be publishing agendas, aims, objectives and reports from meetings. They should also publish reviews of ideas and proposals being presented. Just this year, for example, the BRICS countries agreed to develop their own indicators for research evaluation and performance, or scientometrics. That is not a small undertaking. There is likely to be a proposal written by a team of researchers, presented in advance to country representatives for their review and comments; there would be a rough timetable for implementation, and names of people to contact. This needs to be publicly available. COP26 didn’t solve everything — but researchers must stay engaged COP26 didn’t solve everything — but researchers must stay engaged The United Nations, including its Sustainable Development Goals, which the BRICS members are committed to, provides one model for how to do things. UN agencies publish detailed documentation before, during and after meetings. Equally importantly, observers (researchers, representatives of non-governmental organizations, businesses and the media) are invited to witness and report on events. Implementation is often a challenge, as Nature has reported ( Nature 599 , 347; 2021 ), but the principle is not in doubt. The expanded BRICS gives low- and-middle-income countries a platform to share experiences. And the group is expected to become even bigger. Saudi Arabia could be the next to join, with at least another 13 countries understood to be candidates. But this expansion must be accompanied by both inclusion and accessibility of information, at a minimum. Transparency is a non-negotiable principle in science. As the BRICS group expands, boosting its research collaboration, now is the time to become both more transparent and more inclusive in all of its processes.",nature,2024-11-12T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03673-y
Scientists must hold President Trump to account with courage and unity,"When Donald Trump was first elected to the US presidency in 2016, Nature advised scientists to constructively engage with Trump . We said that the incoming president’s contrary approach to evidence, among other things, had no place in modern society. We added that the science community had a responsibility to step up and work with the president and his new administration so that they govern on the basis of research and evidence. ‘We need to be ready for a new world’: scientists globally react to Trump election ‘We need to be ready for a new world’: scientists globally react to Trump election And yet, during Trump’s first term, the world saw a government that ignored and undermined efforts to address some of the world’s greatest problems, such as climate change and a global pandemic. Many researchers left US federal science agencies, their place sometimes taken by lobbyists and political appointees. The United States has now re-elected Donald Trump as president. Many researchers have told Nature that they are in despair , seeing the election result as a step backwards for facts, reason, knowledge and civility. Last week, Nature said that the United States needs a leader who respects evidence . The incoming administration must embody this principle. On behalf of the research community, we will hold it to account if it falls short. We hope that the incoming administration will govern in the best interests of the United States. That means holding on to the best of what the previous administration did, and not returning to some of the policies of the first Trump presidency. The world needs a US president who respects evidence The world needs a US president who respects evidence This includes respecting the scientific consensus when making regulatory decisions in public health, environmental issues, artificial intelligence and elsewhere. This is one of the cornerstones of modern government. Policymakers and politicians retain control over decision-making, but they cannot control the facts. Climate change must also remain a crucial priority. During the past four years, the United States took important steps in recognizing that it is in its own interests to not stand still as global temperatures continue to increase. It enacted policies to support industries and communities through the coming sustainability transition. If those policies are repealed, people on the lowest incomes and those from marginalized communities will be among those most affected. Both the United States and the world are at their best when the country engages internationally. That means not repeating the previous Trump administration’s decision to exit the 2015 Paris climate agreement — an accord aimed at protecting the world from the impacts of climate change, which US scientists helped to craft. And it means continuing to support other important international organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations science and cultural organization UNESCO. The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long? The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long? Trump’s threat to defund the WHO in 2020 was especially dangerous for those low-income countries where the agency’s work is crucial for tackling diseases and maintaining standards of public-health infrastructure. Currently, the WHO’s epidemiologists, clinicians and logistics personnel are helping to treat and control diseases in countries including Afghanistan, Ukraine, Sudan and Yemen. Diseases do not respect borders: to cooperate and engage with international institutions to fight their spread is in the best interests of the United States. The United States is a nation that welcomes the world’s talent, in science and in other fields. That must continue if the country wants to maintain its strength in research and innovation, the bedrock of prosperity. The research community must engage with the new administration with courage, tenacity, strength and unity. At the same time, scientists in the United States must know that they are not alone. The research community is a global one. We need to stand together and stand strong for the challenges that are to come. And that will mean continuing to speak facts to power.",nature,2024-11-06T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03648-z
COP29: involve the IPCC in defining climate finance,"The United Nations climate bus is heading to Baku, Azerbaijan, for the UN climate conference COP29, which starts on 11 November. With global temperatures hovering close to 1.5 °C higher than pre-industrial levels , the big question hanging over Baku is whether rising temperatures will prompt the international community to take more-urgent action to mitigate global warming and tackle its effects. This COP is being called the ‘Finance COP’ because a big increase in funding is a top agenda item. Meaningful action against global warming needs a lot more money than what is available now. But representatives of countries will fly into Baku locked in a stalemate over who should pay, and how much. One of the biggest questions of all is, what precisely should be included in climate finance? One action in particular could make a big difference: climate diplomats could formally request that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issue a special report on climate finance. They need to do this before binding decisions are made. Why the timing of climate assessments matters Why the timing of climate assessments matters Next year, countries must update their climate action plans (known as Nationally Determined Contributions , or NDCs), so that their ambition matches what is needed to keep temperatures from reaching dangerous levels. Currently, some of the most common actions include installing more solar- and wind-energy plants and protecting forests and other ecosystems. But the speed and scale of these developments are nothing like what researchers say are needed to prevent average global temperature rises from exceeding the 1.5 °C target set at COP21 in Paris in 2015. Even if all of the current NDCs are honoured, the world is still looking at temperatures rising to 2.1–2.8 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. In a scenario in which warming is kept under 1.5 °C, greenhouse-gas emissions need to be 43% lower than 2019 levels by 2030, according to the IPCC. Achieving the above presupposes that eye-wateringly large sums of money can be found to cover the costs of the sustainability transition. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) will need to increase their annual investments to around US$2.4 trillion by 2030, according to one widely quoted report from an international group of climate finance researchers that was published for COP28 last year (see go.nature.com/4fgwt1i ). That’s around 20 times the climate finance ($116 billion) that went to LMICs in 2022, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published in May . But there’s no consensus on these figures, nor indeed on other questions. Who will pay the extra sums and by when? How much should be grants, versus loans? How much should be set aside for climate mitigation, such as funding technologies that help prevent global warming? How much for adaptation measures such as flood defences? Climate negotiators have been meeting all year ahead of COP29, but there’s little agreement on what is being called a new collective quantified goal on climate finance . Biases in ‘sustainable finance’ metrics could hinder lending to those that need it most Biases in ‘sustainable finance’ metrics could hinder lending to those that need it most High-income countries want LMICs to assume more responsibility for climate finance, whereas LMICs want the opposite — receiving a greater share of grants as opposed to loans — to account for the fact that some of the most vulnerable countries are those that are least responsible for climate change. Matters are worsened by there not being an agreed definition for the constituent components of climate finance — something that Chapter 15 of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report on climate finance recognizes (see go.nature.com/4el1luq ). Some say that climate finance should not include funding for things that, strictly speaking, are not wholly about climate change. For example, if money is used to pay for a housing development that is powered by renewable energy, there isn’t a consensus on how much of the total cost should be classified as climate finance. Too high a figure risks overstating the amount of money classified as climate finance. That’s why Nature is suggesting that the IPCC should be called on to advise. It is the one organization that everyone should trust to establish a base of evidence to help answer questions that are struggling to find consensus. A group of countries would need to make a specific request to the IPCC secretariat, based in Geneva, Switzerland, for a special report on climate finance. The IPCC would then issue a call for evidence. This would trigger funders and researchers to convene, to commission and carry out research that would be included in the special report. The IPCC has played such a part before at key moments in climate policymaking. An IPCC special report was requested after the Paris climate agreement to assess the evidence on the impacts of 1.5 versus 2 °C of warming, as well as the menu of proposed pathways to get to 1.5 °C ( J. E. Livingston & M. Rummukainen Environ. Sci. & Policy. 112 , 10–16; 2020 ). It’s a tried and tested way to provide the international community with the knowledge and data needed to make wise decisions. It took around two years between commissioning the report and publishing it, which is why countries need to get their request in early. Climate finance is not small money: even $2.4 trillion is about the gross domestic product of Italy. But in the end, such sums need to be seen as investments that will yield a return, rather than as a cost. It’s understandable that there are a range of views, and the IPCC is not the body to decide how much is feasible and on what terms — responsibility for such decisions falls to country representatives. But the IPCC can assist negotiators by helping to answer their questions on the basis of the latest literature — while also updating that literature. Amid all the arguments, no one can doubt that a step-change will be needed in climate finance if temperature increases are to be held within safe limits. The IPCC cannot be the decision-maker, but it can advise. Countries should lose no time in asking it to do so.",nature,2024-11-05T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03585-x
A thaw in scientific relations could help clear the air in India and Pakistan,"A toxic haze has descended over a land area shared by some 500 million people in the northern parts of India and Pakistan. Its sources include the industrial emissions, domestic fires and diesel and petrol exhausts that form the largest components of air pollution in many parts of the world. But during winter in South Asia, crop residue burning is estimated to be the biggest source. It is an annual event that massively worsens the region’s atmospheric concentrations of fine particulate matter — that measuring 2.5 micrometres or less in diameter. These concentrations already exceed the safe limit advised by the World Health Organization. Air pollution is a leading cause of child death and is devastating for the communities that have to endure it. It also contains climate-altering compounds. Read the paper: Bureaucrat incentives reduce crop burning and child mortality in South Asia Read the paper: Bureaucrat incentives reduce crop burning and child mortality in South Asia In Nature this week, researchers show how the field of computational social science, along with publicly available data, could help authorities in India and Pakistan begin to address a problem that affects both nations ( G. Dipoppa & S. Gulzar Nature 634 , 1125–1131; 2024 ). The work also highlights what could be achieved if scientific links between the two countries were not frozen as a result of worsening relations between their governments. An overdue thaw could save lives and improve health in both nations. The annual winter burning of crop waste in South Asia has its roots in earlier science. High-yielding crop varieties born of 1960s-era green-revolution technologies, combined with mechanization, have enabled farmers in the nations’ agricultural heartlands to grow wheat and rice on the same fields in the same year. Once a rice crop has been harvested, farmers burn millions of tonnes of leftover materials, clearing the land for the wheat-planting season. The resulting haze cuts visibility to a few metres, shuts schools, impedes road transport and causes flights to be cancelled. Researchers are actively studying both the extent of the pollution and prevention strategies. Gemma Dipoppa at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Saad Gulzar at Princeton University in New Jersey have examined the authorities’ responses to the fires in India and Pakistan over a ten-year period, from 2012 to 2022. The authors compared fire, air pollution and wind-speed data with police and court records of action taken against farmers. They also studied the effects of the pollution on health. Burning crop waste is against the law in both countries and violations can lead to farmers being fined or even imprisoned. But many are willing to take that risk. And the sheer number of farmers lighting fires at the same time makes it unfeasible for the authorities to deal with them all. Local government actions can curb air pollution in India and Pakistan Local government actions can curb air pollution in India and Pakistan The authors found that officials in both countries are more likely to take action against farmers if winds are blowing pollution across home turf, and that crop residue burning decreases as a result. They also found that this effect is larger in areas close to the border between the two countries — in other words, farmers in both nations are more likely to be penalized for crop residue burning if the wind is blowing towards their own side. This raises questions that would benefit from further enquiry. For example, to what extent might India’s and Pakistan’s authorities be cancelling out each other’s pollution-control efforts close to the border? And on days when one country is putting resources into dealing with high levels of pollution within its own borders, is it also receiving more pollution from its neighbour? Further research — both analyses of remote data and field-based studies — will help researchers to understand the perspectives of farmers and the factors underlying the actions of government officials. Efforts to answer these and other questions would benefit from greater collaboration. However, at present, there are minimal links between researchers in India and Pakistan. Non-governmental links (sometimes called track-two diplomacy), including scientific connections, are the weakest they have been in around a decade. Scientists used to be able to meet through the eight-country South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), based in Kathmandu, but SAARC has not been functioning, mainly because of the continuing tensions between India and Pakistan. The agricultural scientists’ committee has not met in five years. There’s a strong case for such links to be revived. So much could be gained if researchers in the two nations could communicate better, work together and study each other’s situation. Dipoppa and Gulzar’s work illustrates what can be achieved with open data, and why science should not be done solely within national borders. When it comes to addressing problems with a regional or global dimension — and when people’s lives and health are at stake — policymakers must prioritize collaboration.",nature,2024-10-30T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03485-0
The world needs a US president who respects evidence,"Next week, US voters will go to the polls to elect a new president, along with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This election will take place at a time of extreme uncertainty, both for the United States and for the world. The two candidates, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, represent vastly different views of the challenges and opportunities that the country faces, and the role of the United States on the international stage. The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long? The US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long? Like all elections, the 5 November vote is about much more than science. However, the fate of scientific research, evidence-based lawmaking and the government’s receptiveness to independent science-policy advice will be key determinants of the country’s future course and long-term well-being. And, as we reported in a News Feature on 23 October ( Nature 634 , 770–774; 2024 ), US science could be at an inflection point: the election and a range of domestic and global forces could challenge the primacy that the country has held since the Second World War. A priority for both the winning presidential candidate and the new members of Congress must be ensuring that US science continues to thrive. This is essential if the world is to solve shared challenges , such as the climate crisis, inequality and societal divisions — and that means retaining the openness and collaborative spirit that have characterized US science for much of the past 75 years. US scientists work with peers around the world, which has helped to position the country at the centre of fundamental, applied and translational research, while creating bonds of friendship and collegiality between US researchers and their international collaborators. These bonds are needed now more than ever. The United States needs leaders who fully understand the responsibilities that come with power and, moreover, are wholeheartedly committed to respecting facts or the consensus of evidence while governing. Harris, the vice-president under President Joe Biden, is a former US senator; before that, she was a public prosecutor and attorney general in California. In her previous and current roles, she has broadly sought to advance policies that are in line with the scientific consensus and with the objective of keeping people safe and protecting public health and the environment. What Kamala Harris’s historic bid for the US presidency means for science What Kamala Harris’s historic bid for the US presidency means for science The Biden–Harris administration’s signature achievement is the plan to invest more than US$1 trillion in climate and clean-energy technologies over a decade — albeit while overseeing record levels of production of oil and natural gas in the short term. A landmark piece of legislation passed by Congress in 2022, called The Inflation Reduction Act, is a historic investment that seeks to modernize US manufacturing and create jobs in the clean-technology industry. At the same time, the administration has sought to craft and implement plans to insulate regulatory agencies , such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), from political interference. Harris said on 22 October that her administration will not be a continuation of the Biden presidency. She has said she wants to build an “opportunity economy”. Precisely what that means is yet to be defined — a science- and evidence-based approach needs to be at its core. That record is in stark contrast to what happened during Trump’s presidency, from 2017 to 2021. As president, Trump not only repeatedly ignored research-informed knowledge, but also undermined national and global science and public-health agencies . He has denied climate science, lied about the federal government’s response to hurricane forecasts and asked scientists to investigate whether disinfectants could be used to treat people with COVID-19. He pulled the United States out of the World Health Organization in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. He withdrew the country from both the Paris climate agreement and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (also called the Iran nuclear deal) — both of which the United States had helped to craft. He instilled fear at the EPA, including by rolling back climate policies and making it harder for its research workforce to be able to function independently of politicians, as many EPA scientists told Nature at the time . If anything, Trump’s speech has coarsened. In the past few weeks alone, he has falsely claimed that millions of migrants are “pouring into our country from prisons, jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums” and eating people’s pets, and that members of the Democratic Party support the execution of babies after birth. Effort to ‘Trump-proof’ US science grows, but will it succeed? Effort to ‘Trump-proof’ US science grows, but will it succeed? The risks of a second Trump presidency continue to mount. It wouldn’t be easy for a new administration to reverse the investments pledged by the Inflation Reduction Act, but Trump has promised to try. He has said he will ramp up fossil-fuel production and promised to reclassify the positions of tens of thousands of federal employees, including scientists and senior officials in the executive branch of government. That is an alarming development that would require reversing the rule that the Biden administration has crafted to prevent such action. It would undermine a basic premise of modern governance the world over: that scientific and technical specialists working in government are recruited for their expertise, not on the basis of their loyalty to the president or a political party, which is what Trump wants to do. Political leaders, irrespective of party membership or ideology, generally agree on the need for a society that creates jobs, promotes better health and advances science. But solutions for the world’s mounting problems can come only from a shared, accurate understanding of reality. A lack of regard for the law and evidence fosters mistrust of scientists and institutions of state. That, in turn, weakens the foundations of democracy, both in the United States and around the world. A second Trump presidency would have an even more destabilizing effect globally, giving the green light to yet more leaders like him.",nature,2024-10-28T00:00:00Z,EDITORIAL,Commentary,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03417-y
