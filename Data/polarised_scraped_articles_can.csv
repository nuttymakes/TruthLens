The Trump baby blimp could make a comeback - as protesters gear up in the UK,"The UK's Stop Trump Coalition has released a statement on the day of Donald Trump's second inauguration - 20 January - pledging to ""mobilise in our thousands and our millions"". It has been signed by more than a thousand grassroots campaigners, trade unionists, climate activists and others. Unfortunately, the original Trump baby blimp - whose images were shared around the world - may not feature. It currently resides in the Museum of London The Coalition organised some of the biggest protests in British history in response to the president's state visits in 2017 and 2018. Back in July 2018, more than 250,000 people turned out in London for a Stop Trump protest: As BBC News reported at the time: Rather than a red carpet, there was a sea of people, as two large marches took place - one led by Women's March London and another by the Stop Trump Coalition. The crowds had strong messages for the president - from their problems with his policies to hair styling tips. They were determined to make their voices heard, or at least create a lot of noise to make their point - that they did not want President Trump in the country. Now, the Stop Trump coalition is re-grouping - and protests are expected in London and across the world today as Trump is sworn in. Zoe Gardner, a spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: In the coming weeks, we are likely to witness appalling attacks on migrants and minorities in America - just as we saw with the racist 'Muslim ban' in the opening days of the first Trump administration in 2017. It is essential that there is a broad, democratic coalition which can bring together the opposition to Trumpism - and to the new far right here in the UK. That means mobilising in big numbers, but it also means working to network and strengthen movements on climate, anti-racism, migrants' rights, feminism, LGBT rights and other touchstone issues, alongside the trade union movement and the left. We will look to respond to the Trump administration's first policies and to bring together the resistance to the politics of bigotry and division in the US and around the world. The statement, which has been signed by more than a thousand people, reads: ""The second inauguration is a dark moment. The far right is on the march, with a common agenda of right-wing nationalism, racism, sexism, LGBT-phobia, climate denialism, union-busting, authoritarianism, and elite impunity. They represent the interests of a wealthy elite who use bigotry and dishonesty to divide us against each other. No matter Trump's claims, illegal occupations and crimes against humanity continue - whether perpetrated by Israel in Palestine or by Russia in Ukraine. ""We are not shocked by this situation. Trump and Musk - and Farage and Badenoch - are symptoms of the failure of our political and economic system. Free market economics and austerity laid the ground. By failing to challenge the far right on immigration and other key issues, and instead mirroring their rhetoric and narratives, Starmer - like Macron, Harris and Scholz - is handing victory to the far right. ""During Trump's first presidency, the Stop Trump Coalition helped organise some of the biggest demonstrations in British history against his state visits. There are millions of people in the UK who want to fight back against the far right, stop runaway climate change, and stand for just peace across the world. There will be mass opposition to political cooperation with the Trump administration, and to any trade deal that threatens our NHS or food standards. ""Fighting back means mobilising in our thousands and in our millions - but it must also mean a more fundamental effort to unite and strengthen movements dedicated to social and environmental justice, working class organisation, and universal human and civil rights. We pledge ourselves to that work, and to building a resistance to Trump and the politics he represents.""",Canary,2025-01-20T13:01:21+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/stop-trump-uk/
The blame game: the rise in false allegations of maternal abuse in long Covid and disability,"With Donald Trump's election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women's rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right - just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there's always someone else to blame - not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations - almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It's one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It's another to be blamed for your child's disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. ""Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called ""Functional Somatic Syndromes"" (FSS) and ""Medically Unexplained Syndromes"" (MUS) umbrellas"". DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there's a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument - with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It's such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there's no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke's Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It's more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope - one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, 'Keeping Children Safe in Education' changed the phrase 'deliberately missing' education to 'unexplainable and/or persistent absence' in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it's easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem - all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism. It supplies simple answers, shifts the blame game on to the individual - all to avoid institutional due diligence. It is no wonder that women have been caught in the crosshairs. We have become an easy target for complex problems.",Canary,2025-01-19T12:51:45+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/fii-long-covid/
"DWP complaints up 38%, with Universal Credit causing chaos for countless families","The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has seen a 38% increase in just three years in the number of claimants making official complaints against it. Moreover, the head of the independent body responsible for dealing with claimant complaints has slammed the DWP for "" simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should"". It comes amid a startling 83% increase in the number of complaints accepted by the independent body, too. Perhaps the best summing up of the situation is to be found in one DWP complaint, where it told a dying claimant that they owed it PS89,000 - when they didn't actually owe anything at all. The Independent Case Examiner's (ICE) 2023-2024 annual report offers insight into the complaint-handling process within the DWP. It outlines recurring patterns of administrative errors, delays, and the inadequate treatment of vulnerable claimants. All this suggests that DWP has not fully embraced the principles of accountability and effective service delivery. The ICE office serves as a mediator between the public and the DWP, tasked with investigating complaints of maladministration. For the reporting year, the ICE office experienced a 38% increase in complaints compared to the past three years, highlighting a growing dissatisfaction among claimants. Among the complaints accepted for examination, nearly 50% were fully or partially upheld, a figure indicative of consistent service failures. The report asserts a commitment to fostering improvements within the DWP. However, the patterns observed - such as poor communication, lack of prompt action, and insufficient redress - raise questions about DWP's ability to enact meaningful change based on ICE recommendations. The ICE report documents various categories of complaints, such as Universal Credit, disability benefits, debt management, and child maintenance, among others. Universal Credit remained the most complained-about benefit, reflecting its complexity and the impact of policy decisions such as mandatory recovery of overpayments caused by administrative errors. It also had one of the highest rates of complaints being upheld. However, Universal Credit was also subject to one of the most shocking complaints about the DWP. In May 2021, Customers A and B made a joint Universal Credit claim but received no payments as their income exceeded the entitlement threshold. B declared a serious health condition and later claimed New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). In early 2022, A reported that the couple would soon receive capital exceeding PS16,000, which temporarily affected their Universal Credit claim, requiring a DWP decision on whether the claim should close or the capital disregarded. The DWP took three months to decide, initially miscalculating capital and incorrectly applying nearly PS89,000 from the start of the claim. Although the error was corrected the same day, delays led to a PS300 Universal Credit overpayment, which was referred for recovery without notifying A. The claim was eventually closed mid-2022, and Debt Management later contacted A and B to recover the overpayment. A challenged the overpayment, citing distress due to B's terminal condition. DWP's subsequent errors included sending a letter erroneously claiming a debt of PS89,000. After further review, DWP acknowledged the mistake and revised the debt to nil. However, their errors caused significant distress during B's final days. The DWP offered just PS200 in compensation - despite A saying that the DWP's actions had hastened B's death. Universal Credit's framework's rigidity and lack of proportionality in overpayment recovery indicate structural deficiencies. Vulnerable claimants, unaware of overpayments, are disproportionately penalized, undermining the principles of fairness and trust. The transition from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and related issues in communication exacerbated hardships for claimants. For example, a parent contested DWP's abrupt change in the appointee for their child's DLA without notification. Despite prolonged distress and inconvenience, DWP delayed in resolving the issue, later reinstating the rightful appointee and arrears under ICE's direction. Procedural lapses in notifying stakeholders and delayed responses expose a failure in safeguarding the interests of dependent and vulnerable groups, violating procedural justice. Debt management, a critical area of claimant dissatisfaction, highlighted inconsistencies in application processing and lack of proactive communication. For example, a claimant requesting Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) faced months of delays due to repeated administrative missteps. Despite escalating financial hardship, the DWP failed to address urgent needs until ICE's intervention. The neglect of claimants' immediate financial crises underscores systemic inefficiencies. Such failures question the robustness of the DWP's operational oversight. The ICE report identifies systemic weaknesses within the DWP: The report commends the DWP's incremental changes, such as revised guidance for vulnerable claimants and improved debt management procedures. However, the critical lens reveals these measures as reactive rather than preventative. ICE's Service Improvement Observations (SIOs) repeatedly cite issues stemming from outdated policies or failure to act on past recommendations. Head of ICE Joanna Wallace said of the DWP: Given that there is some delay between the events a customer is complaining about, and my office seeing a complaint, it can be frustrating to still see complaints about things I know DWP have addressed. She particularly noted that Universal Credit was an issue, saying: Overpayments to students would be one example from this last year - I raised this concern and the action DWP had taken to stop repetition in my previous annual report, but these customers with these concerns have continued to come to my office and some of these cases have been amongst the most concerning I've seen. In no small part this is because Universal Credit procedures require all overpayments to be recovered, regardless of their cause. This can mean that a customer can do absolutely everything they should have done in terms of telling DWP about their circumstances, but due to administrative error be overpaid. And overall, Wallace said: I agreed with a customer's view that they had not received the service they should, and that DWP hadn't recognised that fully, in about half the cases I saw during this last year. Most often, as I've commented before, this is due to the department simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should. The 2023-2024 ICE report underscores persistent challenges in DWP's complaint-handling mechanisms - but also its overall conduct. While incremental improvements are evident, the prevalence of service failures, particularly affecting vulnerable groups, demonstrates an urgent need for systemic reforms. Claimants' case studies expose a troubling pattern of indifference and inefficiency, further showing that the department is barely fit for purpose.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:08:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/dwp-complaints-report/
Government BURIED damning report in DWP PIP failings to try and push through reforms,"It's been revealed by a leading disability news outlet that the previous Conservative government tried to bury a damning report into the DWP PIP system and its failings. We only know this thanks to the tenacity of one journalist. However, the issue raises further questions about the approach of the now-Labour Party government. In January 2024, Conservative ministers chose to withhold a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) report that highlighted significant issues within the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) system. This decision occurred just days before the release of a green paper proposing substantial changes to it. We only know this information thanks to John Pring at Disability News Service (DNS). As Pring wrote: DNS has obtained copies of emails exchanged last year between ministers and advisers, which show how the minister for disabled people, Mims Davies (pictured above, left), was asked to approve the publication of four Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research reports in January 2024. The unreleased report contained testimonies from disabled individuals who had undergone PIP assessments and received zero points, rendering them ineligible for support. One participant, diagnosed with ME and confined to bed for all but half an hour daily, described the assessment process as dismissive, noting that attempts to elaborate on his condition were abruptly halted. Such experiences left claimants feeling ""broken,"" ""numb,"" and ""fuming."" Internal emails obtained through Pring's freedom of information request revealed that on 29 January 2024, minister for disabled people Mims Davies was asked to approve the publication of four DWP research reports. This included the critical PIP study. A response on 8 February suggested delaying its release due to ongoing policy development. It cautioned that publication could ""set hares running."" The final decision to withhold the report was made on 24 April, just five days before the green paper's publication. On 29 April 2024, work and pensions secretary Mel Stride introduced the ""Modernising Support for Independent Living"" green paper. In this, the government expressed concerns over rising PIP expenditures. It also questioned the benefit's value. The paper proposed making it more challenging to claim PIP and suggested replacing cash payments with vouchers or one-off grants, a move described by campaigners as a ""brutal, ideological attack"" on disabled people's support. The timing of these events indicates a deliberate effort by ministers to suppress evidence of the PIP system's deficiencies. It would have laid cover for advancing policies that could further restrict support for chronically ill and disabled people. The news comes as the DWP lost a court case over ex-Tory ministers' reforms to the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Concerningly, the Labour government has already indicated it may go ahead with the changes, regardless.",Canary,2025-01-17T12:13:36+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/government-buried-dwp-pip-report/
Keir Starmer's OWN council is under pressure over its FINANCIAL ties to Israel,"On Monday 20 January, Keir Starmer's own council is set to decide whether to divest from companies complicit in Israel's genocide and the illegal occupation of Palestine, after thousands of residents demand action. Over 4,000 locals in prime minister Starmer's own constituency have signed a petition demanding Camden Council divest from companies complicit in human rights abuses and the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Led by Camden Friends of Palestine, the petition calls for transparency and divestment from companies such as BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and RTX: arms manufacturers that supply weapons to Israel. A series of shocking Freedom of Information (FOI) requests exposed that Camden Pension Fund is currently investing millions of pounds in funds connected to these companies. Despite repeated attempts by the council to avoid scrutiny - canceling meetings, closing the public gallery, refusing deputations, and even involving police - this petition has forced Camden Council to hold a crucial debate and vote on divestment on Monday 20 January. A Camden resident and spokesperson for Camden Friends of Palestine said: Camden council has repeatedly ignored the wishes of its communities, actively sidestepping demands for ethical investment. This petition will make Starmer's own council confront the question of divestment face on, for the whole of Camden to see. There is clearly a huge groundswell of support for divestment from these companies that are currently supplying weapons to Israel. The council must end its complicity now. Any other option but divestment would mean councillors prioritising a career in Starmer's Labour party over the communities they represent, opposition to genocide and international law. Presenting the petition to the councillors will be two Camden residents: Lubaba Khalid, a Palestinian resident, and Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos. Both are vocal in their stance against the British government's complicity in genocide and will be representing the 4,000 local residents who signed the petition calling for divestment. It is widely considered that Camden Council is dominated by Starmer's wing of the Labour Party. In the 2024 summer election, several councillors from Camden Council were rewarded with MP seats by the Labour Party. These include former council leader Georgia Gould, who became an MP, along with Danny Beales and Lloyd Hatton, both of whom also transitioned from local politics to parliament. This demonstrates Camden's importance as a key political power base for Starmer's Labour. Camden is represented by two MPs, one of whom is the PM who's constituency covers more 60% of the wards in the Camden Council. Starmer's majority was significantly reduced in the 2024 summer election - down from 22,766 in 2019 to just 11,572. This sharp decline highlights growing discontent in the constituency, in large part due to his position on Palestine and his support for the apartheid state of Israel. The decision the council faces follows the likes of Waltham Forest who committed to arms trade divestment amid pressure from Palestine activists. Local residents and activists will gather outside Camden Town Hall on Monday 20 January to show their support for divestment and urge councillors to vote in favour of the community led presentation:",Canary,2025-01-20T12:12:08+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/camden-council-bds-starmer/
Now the UN has directly intervened in the Palestine Action 'Filton 18' case,"The United Nations (UN) has formally intervened in the case of the Palestine Action 'Filton 18' - currently on remand over their action at a UK-based Israel-supplying arms factory owned by Elbit Systems. The UN letter, while polite, does not pull any punches - and exposes the misuse of counter-terror laws and blatant state-sanctioned mistreatment of the activists. However, the UK government has responded - and it hides behind bureaucracy while bordering on contemptuous. In August 2024 Palestine Action activists disrupted Israeli weapons production at the Filton, Bristol research hub of Elbit Systems - Israel's largest arms firm. This brand new PS35m research and development hub of Israel's biggest weapons firm opened in June 2023, and was attended by the UK-Israeli Ambassador Hotevely, and Elbit's CEO Bezhalel Machlis - who has frequently boasted of the company's central role in Israel's military, during the ongoing Gaza genocide. An initial seven people were detained under police abuse of 'Counter Terror' powers. More police raids and arrests followed in the months since, most recently in November. A total of 18 people now arrested, detained, and held under 'Counter Terror' powers - despite being charged with criminal charges - before a trial in November 2025. Many had their homes and property damaged and some of their families and loved ones were also subjected to police violence, while conditions for those inside prison include arbitrary and repressive restrictions. Though initially charged under terrorism statutes, the activists were later prosecuted for standard criminal offenses like criminal damage and aggravated burglary. However, it is the state's initial use of counter-terror laws, and its treatment of the Filton 18, that the UN is concerned about. You can read the full letter here. It is from: The UN panel has identified several key areas of concern: Misapplication of Counter-Terrorism Laws: Arrests and pre-trial detentions under counter-terrorism legislation lacked credible links to terrorism, raising concerns about overbroad definitions in UK law. Actions involving property damage, while unlawful, do not meet the international threshold for terrorism, which includes intent to cause serious harm or compel governments through intimidation. On this, the UN letter specifically states: The information received suggests that the UK police have exercised significant powers under counter-terrorism legislation despite the absence of a credible connection between the activists' conduct to terrorism as properly defined, and in circumstances where provisions of the ordinary criminal law would strike a more appropriate balance between the rights of the individual and the interests of national security. In this respect, it is welcome that the accused are not to be prosecuted for any terrorism offences, properly reflecting the character of their acts as ordinary criminal offences. However, we are concerned that the activists were arrested on terrorism charges at an earlier stage and that counter-terrorism detention extended detention powers were used in that connection. Detention Conditions: Activists faced restricted communication with family and legal counsel. High-security designations due to alleged ""terrorist connections"" limited their access to cultural and religious practices, exacerbating psychological and physical challenges during remand. Procedural Violations: Prolonged incommunicado detention and delayed access to legal representation contravened international human rights standards, including Articles 9 and 19 of the ICCPR Impact on Freedom of Expression: Using counter-terrorism laws against political dissent could deter legitimate protest activities in a democratic society, infringing on freedoms of expression and assembly. The UN panel then goes onto to demand answers from the UK government. Specifically it has asked it to: Provide any additional information and/or comment(s) you may have on the above-mentioned allegations Explain the factual and legal grounds justifying the alleged arrest and detention of the activists under counter-terrorism laws. Please explain the reason why, and at what period of the activists' detention, the CPS decided to downgrade the charges to ordinary offences. Please also detail the basis for the CPS' submission that the offences have a ""terrorist connection"". Explain whether the definition of terrorism in UK law will be amended to exclude acts of advocacy, dissent, protest, or industrial action in a democratic society where they are no intended to cause death or serious injury with a terrorist purpose. Outline the measures taken to safeguard the activists' procedural rights in detention and their right to a fair trial, including their right to access legal representation immediately after their arrest and to ensure that their families are promptly notified of their detention, including any transfers between detention facilities. Explain the measures taken to ensure the activists' access to family visits, medication and health care in detention, and to protect their cultural and religious rights, and detail how these measures are compatible with international human rights standards. Please indicate whether their restrictive high security conditions in detention will be lifted. Now, the UK government has responded. You can read the full response here. It has addressed each of the UN's questions. However, the response demonstrates several shortcomings in transparency and accountability. Firstly, the repeated emphasis on the inability to comment due to ongoing legal proceedings, while procedurally valid, limits meaningful engagement with the substantive allegations. This reliance on legal constraints to withhold information appears to prioritise procedural safety over addressing international concerns regarding human rights practices. For example, the UK government specifically states: Beyond this publicly available information, it would not be appropriate for the UK Government to comment further, particularly when criminal proceedings are ongoing. This principle applies to all criminal investigations and trials and helps ensure the integrity of those processes. However, the Filton 18 have not been charged under counter-terror laws. Therefore, it seems obtuse at best to argue that this element of the situation cannot be discussed. Additionally, the document extensively defends the use of counter-terrorism laws, arguing they are applied judiciously and independently of government influence. However, it fails to sufficiently address criticisms about the broad and potentially ambiguous definition of terrorism under UK law, particularly its application to acts of advocacy, dissent, or protest. The response leans heavily on previous affirmations of the law's robustness by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, but it does not adequately explain how these laws are regularly reviewed to prevent misuse against activists. The government's explanation regarding procedural safeguards, such as the provision of legal representation, family notifications, and access to healthcare and religious rights, is thorough but overly reliant on citing existing frameworks rather than presenting evidence of their effective implementation. This approach gives the impression of a defensive rather than proactive stance on addressing potential rights violations in detention. Furthermore, the document highlights the UK Government's insistence on the independence of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, and judiciary. While this independence is critical, the failure to engage substantively with the activists' specific allegations raises concerns about the adequacy of procedural protections, particularly for politically sensitive cases. Of course, what we do know is that former Labour Party MP, John Woodcock (Lord Walney) has heavily influenced the state in terms of applying counter-terror laws to legitimate activism. As the Canary previously wrote, Just Stop Oil activists all received shocking prison sentences only months after the disgraced John 'Lord Walney' Woodcock, paid oil and arms industry lobbyist, called for groups who oppose his clients' interests, to be silenced and jailed. He also floated the idea that groups like Palestine Action should be labelled as terrorists. Prior to Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain remained extremely unusual. In 2020, Boris Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords, and gave him the role of 'Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption'. He used that role to obtain the following paid positions: The terms of his engagement required him to disclose any conflicts of interest directly to the Home Office, but it is unclear whether he did so. In May he published a report, falsely presented to the public and to parliament as 'independent'. This called for groups such as Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil to be treated as organised criminals. He also suggested that jury acquittals in the trials of such cases were a 'problem' that needed to be addressed. The surprise is not that Walney acts in his clients' interests, but rather that the Labour government continues to present him to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. He remains in post, despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024. The thin end of this wedge is the UN's intervention over the Filton 18. This is because their situation is a microcosm of what is happening in both the UK, but also around the Global North in terms of increasingly authoritarian, right-wing governments cracking down on people that are disrupting the quickly-faltering corporate capitalist system. Back in the UK, though, Palestine Action, its activists, and their supporters, must now wait for the UN to consider and then respond to the UK government's response. The UN's intervention is welcome - but it remains to be seen whether or not the UK government will listen or even respond appropriately, and review the Filton 18's cases.",Canary,2025-01-27T19:42:59+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/27/palestine-action-filton-un-intervenes/
Gaie Delap spent her 78th birthday in prison - and people came out to show solidarity,"A vigil to mark unjustly imprisoned Just Stop Oil activist Gaie Delap's 78th birthday was held outside Eastwood Park Prison on Friday 10th January. It came after she was sent back to prison - despite having served her sentence - because of failures of the criminal justice system. The vigil for Gaie a peaceful and dignified Quaker-led occasion accompanied by family and friends: https://x.com/JustStop_Oil/status/1878396377899655427 It is now three weeks since Gaie was arrested and returned to prison following systemic failings in the management of her home detention curfew. These include evidence of deceit on the part of Serco EMS who manage tagging arrangements on behalf of the Ministry of Justice (see our New Year's statement). Gaie's brother, Mick, who visited her last Friday said: Despite her outrage, tempered with resignation, she tries to stay strong. She knows about the vigil. She is overwhelmed with the messages of support she has received. The best birthday present for her would be that common sense and justice prevail and lead to her re-release. Lily Pridie, her daughter, had this message for her mother: Please stay strong and keep your spirits up. We are so proud of you. Thousands of people are supporting you. Let's hope that something positive comes out as a result of this awful situation. One of the organisers of the vigil Jo Flanagan said: The vigil will be supported by dozens of singers from the Climate Choir Movement which started in Bristol. Several of the organisers of this movement are Quakers and know Gaie personally and attend the same Quaker Meeting House in Bristol including the two co- founders. Many of the principles on which the choir it is founded align with Quaker values including peacefully singing 'truth to power' and standing up against injustice. Close friend Mike Campbell added: Gaie makes it clear too that this is not just about her situation. There are other countless women who are impacted by tagging failures. She told us about a woman released late and then recalled because there was no available bus to get home in time for their curfew. She also witnesses daily the impact of imprisonment on other women, those with mental health problems, addiction issues, mothers separated from their children. Like Gaie, these are women who should not be in prison. Another birthday present for Gaie arrived early. This was in the form of a song called Eastwood Park Blues, written and performed by the Blue House Buoys, with a call to Shabana Mahmood, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Timpson, Prisons Minister to 'free Gaie Delap'. ""Dearest Gaie, we shower you with love"", said a spokesperson for group. Carla Denyer, Green MP for Bristol Central, said ""My heart goes out to Gaie who is spending her 78th birthday behind bars - all because the private company responsible for fitting electronic tags couldn't find one the right size for her. I know her friends and family are desperate to see her come home. Gaie has not broken bail conditions, neither is she a threat to the public. I find it beyond belief that a solution cannot be found to get Gaie home"": As Gaie's MP I have tried everything I can to challenge the decision to send her back to prison - including writing to the prisons minister Lord Timpson and the probation service - and I will continue to push for her release. Hannah Greer, of the Good Law Project who are crowdfunding for Gaie's legal fees, said: You should not be in prison on your birthday. On behalf of the hundreds of supporters whose generosity has so far raised over PS20,000 you have our continued support and we send birthday greetings. Melanie Jameson from Quakers in Criminal Justice who are upholding Gaie on her birthday said ""With prisons overflowing, this is no place for peaceful climate protesters. In Gaie's case, we are appalled that Serco's failings have led to her recall"". You can support Just Stop Oil here.",Canary,2025-01-12T12:21:46+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/12/gaie-delap-case/
U-turn from Assisted Dying Bill Committee is barely a win,"In (another) last-minute U-turn, sponsor Kim Leadbeater has finally agreed to hear from a representative of a Deaf and Disabled People's Organisation (DDPO) during an oral evidence session for her controversial Assisted Dying Bill, currently making its way through Parliament. However, DDPO's feel this fig leaf at the final hour is too little, too late in a parliamentary process that has consistently excluded them - and still is. In November, parliament passed Kim Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life Bill) at second reading. MPs voted 330 to 275 - giving it a firm majority of 55. This was despite the fact that every single DPPO - all 350 - has opposed it from the start, and urged MPs to listen to them. Currently, the bill is at the committee stage, and is in the process of gathering evidence. From the start however, Leadbeater had skewed the committee membership in favour of assisted dying. As the Canary pointed out, the majority are also supporters of Leadbeater's bill in its current form, or have made indications they'd want to expand it. Most notably though, Leadbeater had included just one disabled MP in the committee - who happens to be pro-assisted dying. Then, during the first session, Leadbeater and her supporters in the committee voted to exclude disabled activist Ellen Clifford from the upcoming evidence sessions. Clifford is co-ordinator for the UK Deaf and Disabled People's Monitoring Coalition. Specifically, Labour MP Naz Shah had brought a series of amendments to the witness list. One of these was to add Clifford to the line-up. Unsurprisingly, the committee quickly shot this down. Now however, Leadbeater seems to have changed her mind about excluding DDPOs from the sessions - in a probable backhanded way. On Tuesday 28 January, the committee began taking oral evidence from a number of witnesses. Crucially, freshly updated and published amendments showed that Leadbeater had added Disability Rights UK (DR UK) to an upcoming oral evidence session. But here's the catch: Leadbeater has shoehorned DR UK in during an hour-long slot alongside four other witnesses. That the Canary can tell, there are no other slots split between so many witnesses at once. Disability Rights UK is a DDPO that represents 350 organisations. It's also an active member of the UK Deaf and Disabled People's Monitoring Coalition that Clifford co-ordinates. The Coalition welcomed the decision to include DR UK. However, it believes the move has come too late in a process that has been inaccessible and dismissive of deaf and disabled people's concerns. Clifford said that: It's good news that the Committee will be able to hear the perspective from organisations run and controlled by Deaf and Disabled people. Our organisations have expertise in a number of the very complex and difficult issues at the heart of this bill. These are key issues that MPs need to understand before they can be expected to vote in an informed way, for example the lack of any clear line between terminal illness and disability, the difficulties that even very experienced professionals have in detecting coercion, issues about capacity and so on. It is vital that the Committee does not look at legalisation of assisted dying as an abstract question but fully considers the range of evidence that could be at their disposal about the workability of the bill and its implications. Chief Executive of DR UK Kamran Mallick said: It's welcome that the Committee has revised its decision and now included DDPOs within the list of witnesses giving oral evidence over the next few days. Disability Rights UK represents 350 different organisations and are also part of a wider collaborative network of organisations that includes grassroots disabled people led campaign groups and trade union disability committees. No DDPO in the UK is in favour of Assisted Suicide. That isn't some dogmatic, entrenched position. Disability Rights UK only recently changed our position from neutral to against. This is on the basis of Deaf and Disabled people's lived experiences backed up by robust evidence and expertise in disability issues."" Leadbeater and supporters of the Bill have tried to argue that since it's scope is limited to terminally ill patients, it won't impact chronically ill, deaf, and disabled people. However, in an unequal society that disproportionately marginalises disabled people, this is also very clearly not the case. From a higher likelihood of living in poverty, to restricted access to social care support, mental health services, and timely medical care, there are enormous inequities disadvantaging disabled communities. These limited options and support for them to live their lives well mean that they do not have equal chances if they become terminally ill either. Therefore, the suggestion that the Bill is not about chronically ill, deaf and disabled people shows an alarming lack of understanding from MPs. One such example is that of Kevin Caulfield. In his early thirties, he was diagnosed with a 'terminal' HIV-related neurological condition with a prognosis of less than six months to live. He was in a desperate situation both physically and mentally. Caulfield has freely admitted he was so desperate he may well have ""jumped at"" the opportunity of 'assisted dying'. And significantly, he would meet all the criteria of the proposed Bill. However, 27 years later, he is still here. Sharing his story, Caulfield said: At the time I was desperate and may well have jumped at the chance of the choice of ""assisted suicide"". But it would have been a very loaded choice, not a choice at all in my opinion. Why? Because I was scared, I felt I had no control, losing functions by the day or enough relevant support. Assisted dying would have given me a focus when what I needed was more time with loved ones and frank conversations about how to deal better with multiple symptoms. That's why it's so critical to listen to and take seriously Disabled people with relevant experience. Morally that is the right thing to but that takes time and resources to really involve us in accessible ways. Anyone with a terminal diagnosis is a Disabled person in law and yet we are not as Disabled people being treated with equity in this rapid process. It's so important that Parliament does really engage with Disabled Peoples Organisations otherwise they risk getting this very wrong. Of course, if the Bill passes, what Caulfield described would become a very real danger for many disabled people. Spokesperson for Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC) Paula Peters therefore underscored that: We need our voices to be heard about what life is like for disabled people, especially after a decade and a half of austerity. Anyone who is disabled who becomes terminally ill or those with progressive conditions are experiencing that within a context of cuts to all the vital services we rely on to survive. In 2016 the United Nations found the UK government guilty of grave and systematic violations of disabled people's rights. Since then, things have got much worse. According to the new government's plans things are set to get much worse still. You can't give disabled people an equal choice to die until you give us more of an equal choice to live. There are more than 16.1 million of us across the UK so the equalities impacts on should not be an insignificant consideration. Yet, hearing disabled people's voices has been precisely what MPs and the entire process have been failing to do. For one, because Leadbeater introduced this as a private bill, it isn't subject to the Equality Act 2010 in the same way a public bill from the government would be. It is therefore exempt from duties to make sure disabled people have the same opportunities to engage with it as non-disabled people. And it shows. At the start of January, the call for written evidence submissions went out. However, this did not provide information in accessible formats. Moreover, there was no clear information about the deadlines for submitting evidence to the Committee in time for amendments to be made. On top of this, the Telegraph has noted that there are just five weeks to submit evidence: before MPs begin scrutinising the Bill on Feb 11. Paraphrasing, the outlet highlighted Clifford's separate and vital point that: Government-led public consultations on disability issues must last for a minimum of 12 weeks. In short, the pace of the bill process is hugely inaccessible to many chronically ill and disabled people. The lack of targeted outreach and resistance to including a DDPO representative has made it unjustifiably difficult for disabled people to inform the Committee of their concerns and fears about the Bill. Therefore, CEO of Inclusion London Tracey Lazard said on this: We are relieved that a DDPO will now be heard from by MPs on the Committee. However, our concerns about lack of engagement are much wider than just oral evidence. The bill is travelling through Parliament at a speed that is completely inaccessible to Deaf and Disabled people. The cards are powerfully stacked against Deaf and Disabled people to be able to share our expertise with MPs as they scrutinise such an important bill.",Canary,2025-01-29T09:48:03+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/assisted-dying-bill-committee-druk/
Starmer torpedoes legislation that would force him to deliver on his own promises,"Keir Starmer has ordered Labour Party MPs to drop their commitment to the Climate and Nature Bill. The landmark legislation would make the UK's targets to tackle the climate crisis emergency legally binding. The Labour leadership had insisted that clauses in the bill that make agreements at international climate summits like those at the UN and in Paris binding must be removed. The bill would place legal responsibility on the government to either mobilise the private sector or introduce a public Green New Deal, as the only ways to ensure the UK meets its climate targets. That's through mandating a government strategy within 18 months of the bill passing. One climate target announced in November is for the UK to reduce its emissions by 81% as of 2035. With the threat of losing the whip, Labour sponsors of the bill agreed that a vote wouldn't go ahead in exchange for more input from the backbenchers into environment legislation. Issues other than Starmer blocking this bill is that the government has only pledged a measly PS8bn for Great British Energy as a vehicle for private sector investment in renewable energy. At the same time, Starmer has issued PS22bn on carbon capture projects that don't work and merely prop up the fossil fuel industry. In fact, the entire framing of 'net zero' functions to greenwash fossil fuels - it's as if we don't really need to transition to renewables (which are cheaper and without air pollution anyway). It places failed carbon capture projects front and centre. In parliament, co-sponsor of the bill Clive Lewis challenged chancellor Rachel Reeves' comments at Davos that growth comes before the climate: I don't want to see growth that comes at the cost of my daughter and her generation's future... I'm afraid to say that you cannot have growth on a dead planet. Politicians need to understand that... You cannot pick growth out of the air and say biodiversity will come in second place, climate will come after. They are all interlinked. And Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer said: Frankly it's nothing short of a national embarrassment for the government to struggle so hard to avoid legally committing to the promises they've already made on the international stage. In the Commons, Labour MP Nadia Whittome added: There is no more important choice than our very future. We have to choose to serve the interests of people here in the UK and right across the globe. And stand up to the wealthy and powerful determined to enrich themselves at the expense of people and our planet. Unfortunately, the Starmer leadership has shown once again that it's not committed to solving the climate emergency through torpedoing the bill.",Canary,2025-01-26T12:21:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/26/starmer-climate-nature-bill/
Jeremy Corbyn slams Met Police's wilful 'inaccuracies' following mass-arrests at Palestine march,"On Saturday 18 January, Britons once again took to the streets to show their support for the people of Palestine. As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as ""fascist"" police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn's response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn's former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers' body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel's genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included ""domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide."" The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel's wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel's genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn't turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned 'second phase' of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn't mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It's alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it's not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions ""go away"" and that they'll be ""locked up"". On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn't come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn't be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It's all the same system; it's all the same violence; we're just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won't hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.",Canary,2025-01-19T14:01:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-met-police-palestine-march/
What better way to end the month than to watch Wes Streeting being heckled?,"The Fabian Society's New Year Conference hosting Wes Streeting as the keynote speaker was disrupted by an activist calling on the Labour Party to end tree-burning subsidies for Drax Power Station. Yet days before, left-wing Labour MP Barry Gardiner came out fighting over the company - calling it ""not fit and proper"". The Fabian conference on Saturday 25 January together key government ministers, journalists, and organisations, this year around the theme 'Britain 2030'. An activist interrupted health secretary Wes Streeting's speech to draw attention to the 'devastating' health impacts of biomass production: They accused the government of funding toxic air pollution in the UK and abroad by subsidising Drax and the biomass industry using a levy off UK energy bills. Another protester spoke out as well: Labour is currently considering whether to grant further subsidies to Drax, the UK's single largest carbon emitter which also makes considerable donations to the Labour Party, when its current subsidies run out in 2027. More than 40 environmental NGOs are calling on the government to reject this proposal. Drax has repeatedly been accused of 'driving environmental racism' through their woody biomass pellet production process, with high levels of toxic pollutants emitted on production sites predominantly located in low-income communities of colour: Around midday on 25 January, partway through the keynote speech, an activist disrupted the event - challenging Wes Streeting over his party's refusal to rule out renewing subsidies for Drax. Standing up in the hall to address him directly, the activist highlighted the inherent health risks of climate inaction. 'We cannot heal the NHS on a sick planet!' the protestor told Streeting. Members of the audience could be heard cheering for the activist. She was taken out of the room by security: Rosie Gloster, spokesperson for Axe Drax, said: The Government has the opportunity to end years of suffering inflicted on communities abroad by ending subsidies for Drax. There are whole communities struggling to breathe in the US due to Drax's operations. Drax is destroying vital forests, poisoning communities and polluting our planet. As Secretary of State for Health Wes Streeting must listen to the communities abroad suffering the devastating health impacts of Drax's dirty pollution and put an end to subsidies for Drax. By contract, Labour Party MP Barry Gardiner accused Drax of 'not being fit and proper'. It was during the Climate and Nature Bill debate last week - the Bill that Labour torpedoed. Gardiner said: We cannot allow the damage to old growth and to virgin forests that we know is happening in Canada... The people concerned in Drax are not fit and proper to run the company, and we should not be paying them. Sam Simmons, spokesperson for Climate Resistance, said: It's never been more obvious that the climate crisis is a health crisis. In the space of three months we've seen thousands lose their homes to the LA wildfires, mass power outages in Scotland and Ireland from storm Eowyn, and hundreds of deaths in the Valencia floods. It is an outrage in the wake of all these catastrophes that our energy bills are still being used to fund environmentally destructive projects like Drax Power Station. If the Labour government wants to protect the health of UK citizens it must end tree-burning subsidies now.

Activists left a message for an Israel-supplying company in Glasgow,"On January 23rd, activists targeted Kelvinside Electronics in Glasgow, spraying the interior with red paint and leaving signs that read: ""Drop Leonardo Contract"" and ""Don't Profit from Genocide"": Kelvinside Electronics has supplied services for both Leonardo and Thales. Leonardo, one of the worlds largest arms manufacturers, has close ties to the Israeli state and to the Israeli based Elbit Systems, a major supplier of the Israeli army. The Edinburgh site manufactures the laser-targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, the model used by Israel to bomb Gaza. Thales UK is also closely linked to Elbit Systems, with whom it produces the Watchkeeper drone. In July the International Court of Justice (ICJ) set out clear obligations for UN states. This includes; not supporting Israel's unlawful acts and the unlawful situation it has created in the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and ensuring Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. A spokesperson for the activists said ""Leonardo and Thales do not supply weapons systems to Israel in isolation - they require a network of inter-company contracts to function. By targeting Kelvinside Electronics we are directly responding to calls from Palestine to disrupt the supply chain of arms from Scotland to Israel"": It is unconscionable to profit from genocide and human suffering. Boycott Thales and Leonardo. Don't make Scotland a hospitable place for the business of war and colonialism. Although a fragile ceasefire has taken effect in Gaza, Israeli aggression has intensified in the Occupied West Bank. While 90 Palestinian captives were released on the first day of the ceasefire, just as many were arrested by Israeli forces in the West Bank in the following 24 hours. As one of his first acts in office, Donald Trump has dropped sanctions on extremist settler organisations and individuals, giving tacit support to further illegal land grabs. And on Tuesday the 21st January the Israeli military launched a large scale attack on the city of Jenin. A spokesperson for the activists said: After a 15 month war of extermination on the people of Gaza, we welcome the news of a ceasefire with cautious hope, but not complacency. Israel has repeatedly violated the terms of the ceasefire, it continues to bomb Lebanon, Syria and Yemen and only days after the agreement has killed at least 10 and injured 70 in airstrikes on Jenin in the Occupied West Bank. Extremist settler organisations are planning land grabs in North Gaza and South Lebanon; we fear we are witnessing the next phase of a genocidal logic. Just as Israeli oppression is not going to end with this ceasefire, we will not stop taking action to disrupt Scottish complicity in the war machine.

Campaigners have 'discovered' ANOTHER company exporting arms to Israel,"Local campaigners have uncovered a previously-missed company that is actually now one of the biggest UK arms exporters to Israel - therefore, complicit in its genocide. Meet G&H Artemis. On Monday 13 January, campaigners across the south west stopped business at Gooch and Housego's (G&H) Artemis site in Plymouth: The action marks the start of a new campaign - Shut Down G&H - committed to shutting down a company that's deeply complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza: According to research by Campaign Against Arms Trade, G&H, with the acquisition of Phoenix Optical Technologies last year, is now the largest recipient of single issue arms export licenses to Israel between October 2021 and May 2023. G&H Artemis export a range of military equipment to Israel, including components for head up/down displays for military aircraft. G&H Artemis provide optical and laser technology for head up displays. On the ground, activists reported that many of the workers couldn't gain entry to the factory due to the disruption. A spokesperson for Shut Down G&H said ""this act of resistance was inspired by the growing awareness that G&H is directly implicated in the murder of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is unconscionable. As the local community, we are taking action to reject our city's complicity in Israel's genocide and display our unequivocal solidarity with the struggle for Palestinian life, freedom, and self-determination"": Today's action is only the start. G&H have offices across the South West. We can and we must shut them down! The Canary asked G&H Artemis for comment - but the company declined to provide us with one. Campaign Against Arms Trade's media coordinator, Emily Apple, said: It's great to see this campaign being launched today. For too long G&H has got away with slipping under the radar. It should be a household name. Everyone should know this company is complicit in and profiting from Israel's genocide. In only imposing a partial arms suspension, this government has made it clear that it will continue to prioritise arms dealers' profits over Palestinian lives and international law. It's therefore down to ordinary people across the country to take action and say no to the genocide profiteers on their doorsteps.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:57:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/gh-artemis/
Starmer ends a disastrous week with his most ridiculous pledge yet,"Prime minister Keir Starmer has had another bad week. While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven't all ended with a punchline. That's because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn't finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn't: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled - but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) - which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around PS416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths - this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the ""stomach or the balls"" to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: ""Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election."" Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a 'fighter': While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun - a newspaper which has been in decline for years - he's not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he's also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer's war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain's disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: ""We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,"" Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. ""I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he's going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off."" We're sure he does remind himself of that; we're sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can't keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they're just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn't understand that while you can get away with telling people 'I will deliver'; you can't get away with delivering people shit once you're in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet - the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is 'yes'; the long answer is 'ha ha ha ha ha, yes'. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced - a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don't know how long he'll last as prime minister, but we do know there'll be serious talk of him going if this year's local elections go as badly as people are predicting.",Canary,2025-01-19T11:34:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/starmer-new-policy/
"For the first time since records began, fewer poor students are going to university","For the first time since records began, there has been a decline in the number of the poorest students who end up going to university. Young people from free school meals (FSM) backgrounds fell further behind their peers in England in progressing to higher education from 2021/2022 to 2022/23, with the gap in terms of numbers progressing increasing to over 210,000. The areas with less than one in five FSM learners go onto higher education are drawn mainly from rural and coastal communities. The Access to Higher Education and Regional Inequality: who is missing out? report looks in-depth at progression to higher education for young people from FSM backgrounds across regions and local areas in England from 2005/06 to 2022/23. Key findings in the report include: The report argues that the government needs to build on the success of national collaborative university outreach initiatives that support those from low-income backgrounds, which were first launched 21 years ago with the Aimhigher programme. A new programme should be launched where universities combine their resources working with those 16 and under alongside local targets for FSM learners progressing to higher education. The report is produced by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON), which is the national organisation for supporting access to higher education for those from under-represented groups in the United Kingdom based at the University of West London. As Professor Graeme Atherton, Director of NEON and author of the report states: This year's data shows a worrying slowdown in progress in terms of widening access to higher education and shows again clearly the huge differences in future opportunities that young people from low-income backgrounds face across the country. As the government looks to break down regional inequalities post levelling up, higher education progression has to be a central concern.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:44:15+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/university-admissions-poorest-students/
OFFICIAL: the top 10% richest have more wealth than the REST OF US COMBINED,"New analysis by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) published on Friday 24 January reveals that the top 10% of households have more financial wealth than the other 90% combined: While the top 10% have average financial wealth greater than the rest combined, many households struggle to save anything at all. One in five have negative net financial wealth, which means their debts exceed any financial wealth they have. The TUC says this shows the urgent need for an economic reset, which the Employment Rights Bill will help to deliver by tackling the scourge of insecure work and making work pay. Under the Conservative Party, real wages grew by just 0.3% a year - compared to 1.5% from 1997 to 2010. The TUC estimates that the average worker would be PS117 a week better off had pay increased since 2010 at the same pace as between 1997 and 2010. Pay growth during Conservative-led government from 2010-2024 was worse than for any other period of government since the 1920s. The same government also has the worst record on living standards since records began in 1955. At the same time, the number of people in insecure work soared by one million between 2011 and 2023 to 4.1 million. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: We need an economy that delivers better living standards and security for all - not just those at the top. Under the Conservatives, the wealthiest feathered their nests while working people suffered an epidemic of insecure work and the worst pay crisis in two centuries. And many households have struggled to save anything at all. That's not right. It's time to move away from the broken economic model which saw insecure work explode and living standards squeezed. That's why the Government's Employment Rights Bill is so important - it will help deliver the economic reset working people desperately need.",Canary,2025-01-24T19:35:53+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/24/official-the-top-10-richest-have-more-wealth-than-the-rest-of-us-combined/
Leicester and Birmingham students keep resisting university complicity in Gaza genocide,"Students remain on the frontline of resistance against institutional complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza. In Leicester, five students are set to go on hunger strike following their university's harsh repression of anti-genocide protests. In Birmingham, meanwhile, students and others are calling for their university to protect the right to protest amid controversial disciplinary proceedings. According to a press release from Leicester Action for Palestine, five University of Leicester students will start a hunger strike on Wednesday 15 January ""over the university's complicity in genocide"". The statement says: This act of protest follows severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower, and is inspired by the thousands of Palestinian political prisoners who have hunger struck in the past, as well as our comrades at the Swansea encampment who went on strike for over a week, securing PS5 million of divestment from Barclays bank in the process. They want the university to ""stop banking with Barclays bank"", ""disclose and divest"" from companies complicit in the Gaza genocide, and to ""demilitarise"" the campus by cutting ""ties with arms companies currently aiding and profiting off of the genocide"". Regarding the latter, the statement explains that: this includes the 7 and a half million pound research deal with Rolls Royce and Siemens through the school of engineering. Rolls Royce help to produce the F-35's Israel is using to drop bombs on children and Siemens provided key infrastructure to illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Updates on the hunger strike will appear on @leicsaction4pal on Instagram. Student-staff coalition BhamLiberatedZone, meanwhile, released a press release explaining how the University of Birmingham is: under fire for disciplining two students involved in protests against the university's financial ties to companies allegedly complicit in human rights violations in Palestine. The ""coalition of students, staff, alumni, and public supporters"" wants the university to drop disciplinary investigations and ""to protect students' rights to protest"". The coalition calls Antonia Listrat and Mariyah Ali's treatment ""a deeply prejudiced, management-driven disciplinary process"". It asserts: The university has accused them of intimidation and participating in unauthorized protests, but activists argue these allegations are exaggerated, rooted in anti-Palestinian racism, and part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on campus. Their protest demanded the university's: divestment from over PS76 million in investments and partnerships with companies allegedly tied to the genocide of Palestinian people. But as the statement says: The students have highlighted a pattern of alleged Islamophobia and racial prejudice, including the labelling of Palestinian flags as ""threatening"" and the removal of such flags from campus, as well as harassment of students wearing Palestine badges. They argue such actions demonstrate systemic repression of pro-Palestinian activism under the guise of maintaining campus safety. The ""prolonged process"", meanwhile, ""has caused significant stress and harm to the students' wellbeing, reflecting a punitive approach to silencing dissent"". Campaigners want the university: to drop the disciplinary actions, respect free speech, and address growing calls for divestment and ethical investment practices.",Canary,2025-01-14T16:34:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/leicester-birmingham-students/
"Patients are dying because of profit-driven political decisions - so in 2025, EveryDoctor is stepping things up","In 2025, campaign group EveryDoctor is stepping up its work to save the NHS from privatisation, and build a functioning, flourishing healthcare system for patients and staff alike. However, there's work to do. The group wants to grow its following from thousands, to a vibrant patient and staff community of millions. It feels it will take nothing short of this to turn things around because: millions of people are currently being profoundly failed by politicians In short, the group aims to transform its campaign community into something more: a movement. Its ambitious goal comes amidst another spate of alarming news stories over the appalling state of things in the NHS. What's more, EveryDoctor founder (and Canary columnist) Julia Grace Patterson has crunched the numbers on patient deaths - and the situation is actually worse than the headlines suggest. By the close of 2024, and into the New Year already, the media has been awash with dire developments in the NHS. A 'quad-demic' storm of influenza, Covid, norovirus, and RSV has been overwhelming NHS hospitals across the country. More than a dozen hospitals have now declared ""critical incidents"" as hospitalisations mount up, and services are swamped. Meanwhile, headlines abound about intractable wait times, and lack of available beds. Patients entering NHS hospitals face a disgraceful situation - first a major problem during the Covid pandemic - but now tragically commonplace. The phrase ""corridor care"" has firmly cemented itself into the British vernacular. In December, 54,000 patients waited on trolleys longer than 12 hours for hospitals to admit them to wards. EveryDoctor's Patterson has laid out the devastating cost of all this in a Tiktok video. Specifically, she analysed the Royal College of General Medicine (RCEM)'s statistics showing the toll long wait times have been having. Horrifyingly, she highlighted that almost 300 patient deaths a week can be linked to long waits. In short, this atrocious state of affairs is putting patients' lives at risk. So, as all these crises in the NHS unfold, the Labour government has answered with yet more plans for privatising the public healthcare system. EveryDoctor wrote to its supporters on the situation that: This government released big plans for the NHS last week, and those plans involved further privatisation. This government has failed to invest properly in emergency services, and patients in A and E departments are receiving urgent treatment in corridors. Its latest foray into opening the NHS up to further backdoor privatisation comes in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the Canary's James Wright highlighted, AI companies likely had a little help from science and technology secretary Peter Kyle. Also an acting vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Kyle has repeatedly rubbed shoulders with a who's who of AI's most prolific lobbyists. Given this, Wright pointed out that Kyle likely had a hand in this latest NHS AI privatisation manoeuvre. Of course, all this is barely the tip of the iceberg of privatisation's manifold fallouts for the NHS. Therefore, turning things around in the NHS will take a momentous groundswell of action. And it's why Patterson and the EveryDoctor team have declared their intention to build a bold movement to ""fearlessly"" fight back. Since 2019, EveryDoctor has been campaigning against this unrelenting tide of private profiteering in the UK's health service. The group has put out critical research on NHS privatisation. It has met with MPs, and created far-reaching public awareness campaigns. Most recently, it ran a powerful campaign to engage MPs with a doctor-led manifesto for fixing the NHS. Alongside volunteers and the public, the group brought these ideas to 117 MPs and their teams. However, Patterson lamented how to date, none of it has yet been enough. So she spelled out that: we need to think a lot bigger now. Much, much bigger. We need millions of people to know what we're doing and to stand together with us to fight for the NHS. In just the first two weeks of 2025, EveryDoctor has already set a number of things in motion. The group has called on the Liberal Democrats to collaborate in holding the Labour government to account for the emergency situation in A&E departments. It is also organising urgent meetings with MPs about this too. And EveryDoctor has started the year off with a social media bang too. The Tiktok video Patterson posted on the RCEM statistics went viral. Off the back of this, NHS staff, film-makers, and members of the public have been flooding the group's inbox with offers of support. Of course, this is only the start. EveryDoctor has many more plans in the works for the year ahead. Patterson set out to supporters that: There is only a point to our campaigning if we do it fearlessly, relentlessly, boldly, and loudly. I can only lead EveryDoctor if I will do it fearlessly. So that's what I am going to do - that's what we are going to do. I went back to TikTok this morning and continued making videos. We're starting daily YouTube videos this week. We're hiring into our team. We're completing our research into the financial links between MPs and the private healthcare sector. And we have so much more to do... Going forward, she hopes that many more people will join EveryDoctor's community to work together in saving the NHS for the millions that depend on it. You can keep up with EveryDoctor's vital work by joining its WhatsApp community. The group is also fundraising to ramp up the reach and impact of all its upcoming plans. If you're in a position to donate, you can do so here.",Canary,2025-01-15T16:09:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/everydoctor-campaign/
Capital Radio North Wales is being abolished - but people are fighting back,"Cymdeithas yr Iaith has called on officers of the commercial radio company Global Radio to reverse its decision to abolish Welsh language provision of Capital Radio North Wales, and has asked the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Ofcom, about its part in the decision. Global seems to have made the decision following the introduction of the Media Act (2024) by the parliament in Westminster last year. The new law abolishes any regulations on the content and formatting of commercial radio stations. According to the organisation, this confirms the need to devolve powers over broadcasting from Westminster to Wales. In the letter to Ofcom over Capital Radio North Wales, Carl Morris, Chair of Cymdeithas yr Iaith's Media Group, wrote: As you are aware, the proper coverage of the nations and regions in the UK by broadcasting and media organisations is a key part of government policy, and a particular responsibility of Ofcom. So too is government support for the Welsh language across radio and other forms of communications. We were therefore dismayed and deeply concerned to learn of Global's plans. The letter calls on Global not to continue with its intention and on Ofcom to stop such a decision because of its impact on the Welsh language and communities: Capital provides Welsh-language provision and music to an audience that would not necessarily choose to listen to the BBC's Welsh-language provision. Bringing it to an end would undermine the ideal of plurality in the Welsh medium broadcasting. In addition it will be a blow to local communities in north Wales, and lead to the loss of jobs and other opportunities. Your decision would therefore be extremely damaging, linguistically, on a community level and economically Carl Morris added: It is clear that neither politicians in Westminster or Ofcom are interested in the benefits of the Welsh language and our communities, and that the Welsh Government needs to get on with the plans to establish a Broadcasting and Communications Advisory Body for Wales as a first step towards the devolution of broadcasting. Mae Cymdeithas yr Iaith wedi galw ar swyddogion cwmni radio masnachol Global Radio i wrthdroi ei benderfyniad i ddiddymu darpariaeth Gymraeg Capital North Wales, ac wedi gofyn i'r awdurdod rheoleiddio ar gyfer telethrebu, Ofcom, am ei ran yn y penderfyniad. Mae'n debyg i Global wneud y penderfyniad yn sgil cyflwyno Deddf Cyfryngau newydd gan Senedd San Steffan y llynedd, wnaeth ddiddymu unrhyw reoliadau ar gynnwys a fformatio gorsafoedd radio masnachol. Yn ol y mudiad, mae hyn yn cadarnhau'r angen i ddatganoli grymoedd dros ddarlledu o San Steffan i Gymru. Yn y llythyr at Ofcom, ysgrifennodd Carl Morris, Cadeirydd Grwp Digidol Cymdeithas yr Iaith: Byddwch yn ymwybodol bod darpariaeth briodol ar draws cenhedloedd a rhanbarthau y Derynas Gyfunol yn rhan allweddol o bolisi llywodraethol, ac yn gyfrifoldeb penodol i Ofcom. Felly hefyd mae cefnogaeth lywodraethol i ddarpariaeth Gymraeg ar y radio a'r cyfryngau yn ehangach Rydym felly yn hynod siomedig a phryderus o glywed am gynlluniau Global. Mae'r llythyr yn galw ar Global i beidio parhau a'i fwriad ac ar Ofcom i atal penderfyniad o'r math oherwydd ei effaith ar y Gymraeg a chymunedau: Mae Capital yn dod a darpariaeth a cherddoriaeth Gymraeg at gynulleidfa na fyddai o reidrwydd yn dewis gwrando ar ddarpariaeth Gymraeg y BBC. Bydd yn tanseilio'r delfryd o blwraliaeth darlledu yn y Gymraeg. Yn ogystal bydd yn ergyd i gymunedau lleol yn ngogledd Cymru, ac yn arwain at golli swyddi a chyfleoedd eraill. Byddai'r penderfyniad yn hynod niweidiol yn ieithyddol, yn gymunedol ac yn economaidd. Ychwanegodd Carl Morris: Mae'n amlwg nad oes gan wleidyddion yn San Steffan nac Ofcom ddiddordeb ym muddiannau'r Gymraeg a'n cymunedau, a bod angen i Lywodraeth Cymru symud ymlaen a'r cynlluniau i sefydlu Corff Cynghori ar Ddarlledu a Chyfathrebu i Gymru fel cam cyntaf tuag at ddatganoli darlledu.",Canary,2025-01-21T12:51:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/capital-radio-north-wales/
Majority of UK believe the super rich have too much influence over politics,"Two of thirds of Britons hold the opinion that the super rich have too much influence over UK politics, according to polling from Opinium for the Fairness Foundation. The charity's new report details that 25 senior figures from politics, business, and academia hold a consensus that growing inequality risks societal collapse. Supporting that idea, the polling found 63% of Britons believe the super rich hold too much power in UK politics, 40% think the same about business and religion and 38% for international bodies like the EU. The report builds on previous research from the Fairness Foundation that found a dramatic increase in the absolute wealth gap over a recent decade. The gap between the poorest 10% and richest 10% of people in the UK increased by 48% between 2011 and 2019. For the actual amounts: in 2011, the richest 10% held PS7.5 trillion in wealth and by 2019 that had increased to PS11 trillion. (And the wealthiest 1% owns not far off half of this, in both cases). By contrast, the poorest 10% went from PS12bn in debt to PS11bn in debt during that time. There's also been a relative decline of the middle class. The wealth gap between the middle 10% and the richest 10% rose by 49% over the same period. Between the group of 25 figures from society, ""there was agreement with the suggestion that we are currently on a trajectory of decline, with wealth inequality undermining social cohesion and a risk of further deterioration without intervention"". They argued that ""wealthy interests have effectively captured media and political narratives, using their dominance of the national conversation to argue that the status quo is the only way"". Indeed, only 7% of UK people attend private school. Yet research from the Sutton Trust found that 43% of the UK's top journalists went to a fee paying school. Another way to see how the very rich dominate politics is through the education of politicians themselves. Boris Johnson was the 20th prime minister (out of 58) to have attended Eton. More broadly, only 11 prime ministers were educated at non-fee paying schools and many of those at grammar schools. We know a super rich minority funds the Conservative party. But even Labour under Keir Starmer's stewardship has super rich people bankrolling it. Since he became leader in April 2020, the party has accepted 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping PS23.6m from just a handful of people. The report recommends ""reforming our political system, for example by strengthening our inadequate lobbying regulations."" The Labour Party government is so far doing worse than the previous Conservatives on corporate lobbying, Spotlight on Corruption warned in a December briefing. Of 12 recommendations for government transparency and the lobbying register on Spotlight on Corruption's 'scorecard', the Tories fully met three, while Labour has fully met just one proposal. Neither party has committed to including so-called 'informal' lobbying arrangements in the transparency releases, meaning friendly influence remains off the books. And consultant lobbyists do not even have to declare the subject matter of their lobbying at present. The report notes there are precedents to significant reforms: ""The most obvious recent example is the 1945 creation of the welfare state, but... Britain in the 19th century avoided the revolutions that swept continental Europe through a series of enlightened economic and political reforms, such as the Great Reform Act and the repeal of the Corn Laws"".",Canary,2025-01-28T18:58:38+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/fairness-foundation-report/
Does Britain execute children abroad? Damning new evidence suggests it does.,"The ongoing controversy over RAF Akrotiri's participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza is not the only scandal relating to British armed forces. Because the Afghanistan Inquiry into possible UK Special Forces (UKSF) war crimes has just revealed that SAS officers had a ""golden pass allowing them to get away with murder"" from 2010 to 2013. This is according to a former senior Special Boat Service (SBS) officer who, along with others, had raised concerns in 2011 about SAS executions and cover-ups. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick faced criticism in 2024 for ""casually revealing a UK extra-judicial assassination program designed to evade ECHR jurisdiction"". And there were many official denials. But the revelations from the Afghanistan Inquiry suggest that this type of behaviour may indeed be commonplace. The inquiry's closed hearings do not allow attendance by members of the public, the media, or the legal teams of bereaved families. As the BBC reports: Senior SBS officers told the inquiry of deep concerns that the SAS, fresh from aggressive, high-tempo operations in Iraq, was being driven by kill counts - the number of dead they could achieve in each operation. A junior officer of the SBS, meanwhile, reported how an SAS member had spoken ""about a pillow being put over the head of someone before they were killed with a pistol"". They added that ""some of those killed by the SAS had been children"" likely younger than 16. In an email, another SBS officer showed concern about what might happen if they didn't speak out: When the next WikiLeaks occurs then we will be dragged down with them One said that ""basically, there appears to be a culture there of 'shut up, don't question'"". The low level of accountability for the SAS was apparently ""astonishing"". British support for and participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza has been utterly damning. But the UK seems not to reserve impunity only for its allies' crimes. Instead, it seems to be how things work with our own forces too.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:53:10+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/sas-murder/
Vile Reeves seethes and LIES when questioned on tax bung to the rich,"If you ignore their words and observe their actions, Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer have been clear on what they intend for Britain. Their mission is to dismantle the welfare state, privatise what's left of the public good, and direct more money to the rich. This is why this week the Labour Party simultaneously promised to attack poor, sick, and disabled people via the DWP at the same time that they 'softened' tax changes for non-doms. In other words, these Labour folk are nasty pieces of work; something which was obvious to everyone when chancellor Rachel Reeves did the interview circuit on 26 January: On 16 January, Canary writer Rachel Charlton-Dailey reported that: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled - but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) - which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around PS416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths - this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. Labour have all sorts of excuses for why they're doing this, including: Addressing these one by one, disability benefits fraud is close to 0% - i.e. it basically doesn't exist. We also doubt Labour is serious about wanting to get people into work when it's now talking about taking away benefit claimants' driving licenses. We further doubt they want to save the country money when they've announced plans to go soft on taxing wealthy non-doms. Interviewing chancellor Reeves on Sunday 26 January, Trevor Phillips asked: The point I'm really driving at here is that for some some people, this concession, let's call it that, to non doms, contrasts with what you're doing to other people. And this morning, you've now written that you're going to tackle... the spiralling benefits bill by taking away people's driving licenses, getting people off the sick. Now this may be justified, but many working people will think that non doms get sympathy and people on welfare get 'tough love'. An angry Reeves responded: If people aren't entitled to benefits, they shouldn't be getting them. We've got good news for Reeves here; this is already what's happening (bar the 0.1% engaged in Disability Living Allowance fraud, accounting for less than PS1m in total). She continued: And at the moment, we waste billions of pounds as a country every year in giving money to people who aren't entitled to it. No, we don't actually, as noted above. We spend money trying to give sick and disabled people some level of support and dignity, and we spend far less on that than we should. Reeves continued again: And what we're saying is if you're ripping off the state and ripping off other taxpayers, we will take money directly out of your bank account, and you risk losing your driving license. So proper penalties for people who, frankly, are getting money that they are not entitled to, and we'll crack down on that. By the end of the forecast period, we're gonna be raising more than PS4bn a year by cracking down on fraud and error. Again, no you're not, you're going to 'raise' extra money by making sick and disabled people destitute, as a recent court hearing demonstrated (reported by John Pring of Disability News Service): Finding DWP's actions unlawful, Mr Justice Calver said in his 42-page judgment that the eight-week consultation - issued by Stride in September 2023 - had failed to explain that planned reforms to the work capability assessment (WCA) would cut the benefits of 424,000 disabled people, with many worse off by at least PS416 a month. If the reforms became law, those 424,000 disabled people would also have to comply with work-related requirements and face the possibility of sanctions, while another 33,000 disabled claimants who were already in the limited capability for work group would now have to comply with even tougher work-related requirements and potential sanctions. The same article clarified that the move wasn't about helping sick and disabled people; it was about making their lives worse for the purpose of penny pinching: Stride had failed to make it clear that one of the key motives for his reforms was to cut spending by about PS3 billion over four years. He and his ministers had claimed that the reforms were intended to support more disabled people into work, yet only 15,000 of the 457,000 affected were expected by DWP to enter employment. Internal DWP documents, revealed during the legal case, showed that nearly 100,000 more disabled people could be forced into poverty. Many responded to negatively to the loathsome Reeves and her appearance: Others are criticising Reeves writing in the Scum 'newspaper': People are also increasingly commenting on what an incompetent, robotic weirdo Reeves is: Some are pointing out that the state of affairs under Starmer and Reeves was all so very predictable: To be clear, Labour would need to do far more than just increase non dom taxes if they were serious about spiralling wealth inequality. As Tax Justice UK note, fairer taxation would include: New taxes on wealth We're campaigning for a new wealth tax: a 2% levy on individuals who own assets worth more than PS10 million - it would affect 0.04% of the UK population and would raise PS24 billion a year. We're also campaigning to apply national insurance to investment income, raising up to PS10.2 billion a year. Reform existing taxes on wealth Those who get their income from stocks, shares and other assets often pay far less tax than those who work. We campaign for the tax rates on these forms of income to be equalised with income tax. So we all pay the same rates. It could raise PS16.7 billion a year. Clamp down on tax havens Hundreds of billions of pounds are lost every single year to tax avoidance via tax havens. We campaign for global action against tax havens. We're demanding more transparency - and global minimum rates of tax, so countries aren't undercutting each other. Figures such as Gary Stevenson of Gary's Economics are also highlighting the issue spiralling wealth inequality: You don't hear Labour talking about this because they don't want to make things better for everyone; they simply want to keep the scam going for the benefit of their wealthy donors. Let's not mince words - Labour and Reeves are reprehensible and incompetent politicians who are repeating the privatisation and austerity failures of the past few decades. Surprise, surprise; repeating the same mistakes isn't going to lead to prosperity, and targeting impoverished sick and disabled people over billionaire layabouts isn't going to fix the economy.",Canary,2025-01-26T11:45:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/26/rachel-reeves-non-doms-welfare-interview/
There' no 'ceasefire' in the corporate media's pro-Israel bias. Just look at the BBC.,"The producer of a shocking new film - Censoring Palestine - about the coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza in the corporate media claims state censorship of the coverage is intensifying despite the ceasefire. Norman Thomas, producer of Censoring Palestine said: Since October 2023, mainstream media outlets like the BBC have concentrated on trying to play down what most people consider an Israeli genocide going in Palestine. But now, since the ceasefire, they have what's even a bigger problem -- which is playing down the part Britain has played in the genocide. Censoring Palestine will be premiered in London on Wednesday 22 January. It's the latest production from Platform Films who in 2023 made the controversial Oh Jeremy Corbyn - The Big Lie telling the rise and fall of the former Labour Party leader. Thomas said: Our previous film showed how the media helped bring down Jeremy Corbyn with smears and lies. Our new film shows the media committing an even worse crime -- trying to hide a genocide. He argues that the need to censor coverage has been made much more urgent since it's emerged that Britain made a much bigger contribution to the Israeli war effort than simply supplying military equipment, but was involved in spying, reconnaissance, and other operations. Thomas said: It's clear now the British government hasn't just been complicit in genocide, it has taken part in it. And the British prime minister and other ministers may well find themselves charged with war crimes. This is sensational news but our mainstream media is giving it no coverage whatsoever. Moreover, he argues that the BBC, as the state broadcaster, is playing a lead role in the censorship. It's NO accident that the police, on the pretext of protecting a synagogue, are trying to stop pro-Palestine protesters demonstrating near the BBC offices in London. This is a case of the state trying to shore up censorship in the most blatant and disgraceful way. The film also shows the way that counter-terrorism laws are being used to silence voices of protest and dissent. Thomas said: Dawn raids on journalists, an academic being arrested for making a speech, protesters being jailed without bail for long periods of time - and all using what appear to be totally false and ridiculous accusations of terrorism. Our film paints a picture of a British establishment desperate to conceal the part it's played in the horrific crimes against humanity in Palestine. The film features interviews with Alexei Sayle, Roger Waters, and veteran film director Ken Loach - who speaks revealingly of his own experience with censorship in the past. In the film he totally condemns the role of the BBC in coverage of Gaza. ""The BBC is acting as an arm of the state,"" he says. Especially powerful in the film, Thomas said, are the contributions of the mothers of two young activists imprisoned for taking action to stop the manufacture of drones in Britain for use in Palestine. He said: Protest is being equated with dissent in an outrageous and unjust way Platform Films has made films for the BBC and Channel Four. Its film Oh Jeremy Corbyn - The Big Lie hit the UK headlines when it was axed from Glastonbury Festival in 2023 following an online campaign led by pro-Israel bodies. Censoring Palestine will get its first London screening in the Genesis Cinema, 93-95 Mile End Road E14UJ, at 6.40pm Wednesday 22 January, before going on general release. The screening will be followed by an open discussion with Alexei Sayle, journalist Sarah Wilkinson, the mothers of three imprisoned pro-Palestine activists, Stop The War Convenor Lindsey German, and the filmmakers.

"5,000 nurses come forward to expose the dire state of the NHS. It's a ""wake up call"" to Labour.","Over 5,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), a large UK and international union, have presented evidence showing the dire state of our NHS. Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN general secretary, said the findings are a ""wake-up call"" to Labour. The report, entitled On the frontline of the UK's corridor care crisis, details testimony from nurses who observed patients dying in corridors, on trolleys and in chairs in waiting rooms. The crisis is also defined by nurses treating patients not only in corridors but in storerooms, carparks, offices and even toilets. There, patients have no access to critical equipment like oxygen or vital signs monitoring systems. There were also multiple testimonies of healthcare staff feeling that the scandal of corridor care has or can delay emergency procedures such as CPR. Further, nurses said corridor care was ""routine"" at their hospital or even happening ""permanently"". Generally, the sheer volume of NHS nurses who have significant experience with corridor care is shocking. One pointed out that one nurse and a healthcare assistant were looking after 20-30 patients in a corridor. The report notes that selected testimonies already reflect the experience of many nurses. One said: I was redeployed from my shift in critical care to the emergency department - where I had never worked before. All bays were full and I also had 4 male patients on trolleys in the corridor who had been there since the previous night awaiting a hospital bed as all were admitted. This made for a concerning and difficult time since the patients were confused, there was no name allocated to a bed area as they were in corridors - staff knew these as 'spaces' as they were regularly used. Another said: Utilising corridors on daily basis now with patients staying up to 24 hours in these locations. Also seeing patient in the back of ambulances due to lack of flow through the system. Patients constantly receive poor dignity, are frustrated, in some cases refuse treatment and self discharge against advice due to situation placing them at risk of significant adverse event that would likely not have happened had the system been functioning as intended. This is demoralising for staff who wish to provide exceptional care, in some cases has led to long term sickness through depression and burn out, and has significantly increased staff turnover as it is no longer viewed as a sustainable career option for nurses and has diluted the overall knowledge and subsequent safety of the department. I have worked in Emergency care for nearly 20 years and have never seen it as bad as it is today, frankly it is embarrassing. Labour aren't providing enough capital funding to fix the healthcare infrastructure we already have, let alone expanding buildings and technology to meet demand. So how will the corridor crisis end under their administration? Healthcare leaders have previously said hospitals are ""outright dangerous"" due to years of underfunding. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS needs an extra PS6.7bn per year to maintain its estate. Labour has claimed it's providing an ""additional"" PS13.6bn in capital funding, but that's actually a PS3.1bn increase on the 2023-24 capital budget. The party is reportedly considering fresh private finance initiative (PFI) scams. That's instead of the government providing sufficient public funding, the private sector loans the money off the books. Through PFI, the public purse is hugely overcharged for infrastructure in a heist of billions of pounds. Former Blairite advisor and now UK ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson is one of the figures behind the push for Labour to adopt PFI. Reeves has also walked back the headline figure in Labour's budget of a PS22.6bn increase in NHS day-to-day spending, through announcing a 5% cut to each governmental department. That leaves the spending increase at PS7.6bn. This is far short of what's required for the Long-term Workforce Plan. Rather than investing in the NHS, Keir Starmer's Labour seems to be using the crisis as an opportunity for the private healthcare sector (which donates to Labour) to make cash from the struggling service. On 6 January, Starmer announced that the private sector will deliver an additional million appointments, scans, and operations a year. This is a 20% increase on the current private provision of five million operations, appointments and tests annually. This is not the answer - as anyone working in the NHS will tell you.",Canary,2025-01-16T19:50:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/nhs-rcn-report/
The Renters' Rights Bill is a victory says ACORN - but there's still a huge flaw,"As it enters its final stage in the House of Commons, community union ACORN has heralded the Renters' Rights Bill ""a huge victory for the organised renter's movement"". However, the proposed legislation is still not without its pitfalls. The Renters' Rights Bill is on the way to delivering improved security and standards for renters, including: A new addition, debated at the 'report stage' in parliament on Tuesday 14 January, would see an end to landlords being able to charge rent in advance of a tenancy starting. This is a key issue that ACORN has been campaigning on, and is welcome news for the many renters struggling to secure a place to call home. Low income people, young families and those on benefits are more likely to be asked for several months, or even longer, of rent up front, something that is simply not possible for many. More widely however, the Bill fails to seriously address the issue of unaffordable housing. This is why ACORN has been working alongside partners in the Renters Reform Coalition and MPs to support amendments in this area. One of these amendments, expected to be debated this afternoon, proposes a cap on in tenancy rent rises, to prevent landlords from hiking rents and evicting tenants through the back door. But if we are truly to tackle the burning issue of unaffordable homes, the government needs to introduce controls to stop spiralling rental costs. That's why ACORN is supporting amendments such as the one put forward by Carla Denyer MP, calling for a national 'living rent' commission to set rent levels between tenancies, taking into account factors such as the home's condition, size and local incomes. Martin Mawdsley, a renter in Liverpool and ACORN representative said: The changes promised in the Renters' Rights Bill can't come soon enough for the millions of renters living in poor conditions, extortionately priced homes and with the threat of eviction through no fault of their own hanging over their heads. We're pleased to see the hard work of our members over the last decade paying off, and we're glad that the Government has listened to us and will ban bidding wars and landlords being able to change many months worth of rent up front, two areas that ACORN has been campaigning on across the country. But as most renters are spending way more than 30% of their income on rent, and prices just keep rising, we still need more action to make rented homes more affordable. That's why we're calling for in-tenancy rent rises to be capped and rent controls to be brought in.",Canary,2025-01-14T13:48:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/renters-rights-bill-acorn/
The March for Palestine is STILL ON - despite the Met Police's attempt to disrupt it,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators will gather in London on Saturday as they have done throughout the 15 months of Israel's genocide in Gaza. This will be the eve of the ceasefire that Palestinians and their supporters around the world have desperately sought as Israel carried out a barbaric assault on Gaza with catastrophic results. Ending the bombing is only the start. Israel's siege on Gaza must be lifted immediately to enable the flow of vital humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. The ceasefire must be permanent. The genocidal onslaught in Gaza is rooted in decades of oppression - ethnic cleansing, settler-colonisation, military occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. It has been enabled by decades of support for Israel from UK governments, corporations and institutions. For all these reasons and more, we will continue our campaigns and demonstrations such as that tomorrow in London. Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and its Coalition partners have organised 22 major demonstrations since October 2023, working with the police authorities. The marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful and well-ordered as the police themselves have accepted. However, this protest has suffered from heavy handed police obstruction using powers under the Public Order Act that erode our democratic rights. The Met Police originally agreed the route of the march, BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, in November 2024, but have this month reneged on their undertaking on the grounds that it would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel's actions - including MPs, trade unions leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 900 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of a march. Over the past week the Met Police have imposed a series of repressive conditions to prevent us marching and have even attempted to impose a route that the Board of Deputies announced they had suggested to the police. This has been firmly rejected by the Palestine Coalition - it is an affront that pro-Israel groups can attempt to decide where we can or cannot march. Despite intensive efforts to reach a compromise with the Met, it has so far refused to accept or offer a reasonable solution. However, we will assemble on Whitehall on Saturday at noon. We reiterate our call on the police to lift their repressive conditions and allow us to march. If they continue to refuse to do so and prevent us from marching, we will be rallying in Whitehall to protest. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said : Israel's genocide has not ended. Even now, while we await a ceasefire, Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are dying from bombardment, and suffering from lack of medical care, food and shelter. We demand a permanent ceasefire, an end to the siege of Gaza and the immediate provision of massive humanitarian aid. It is absolutely legitimate and necessary for us in the UK to be holding our government to account for it's military, diplomatic and economic support of Israel, which continues to be investigated by the world courts for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But this protest has been marred by political policing which is an attack on our fundamental democratic rights. The Met has seemingly accepted and acted upon the arguments of pro-Israel groups that seek to delegitimise our protest as antisemitic or a threat to Jewish people. This is a gross distortion of the truth. There is not a single instance of our marches posing any threat to synagogues or Jewish individuals. Indeed, we count a large, self-organised Jewish bloc as some of our most indefatigable supporters. The Met's approach has been confrontational, heavy-handed and intransigent. Their use of powers under the Public Order Act has been based on flimsy grounds and arbitrarily applied, which erodes the right of peaceful protest that is fundamental in a democracy. Despite this, our protest tomorrow will go ahead - we call on all those who seek justice for Palestine to stand with us.",Canary,2025-01-17T16:58:23+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/march-for-palestine-route/
Nine climate-wrecking insurance giants just got their Wi-Fi CUT OFF by activists,"Activists from Shut The System have cut fiber optic cables to offices of hundreds of insurance companies, in a new form of non-violent direct action. They call on insurance companies to immediately end all underwriting for fossil fuel expansion and demand robust transition plans from fossil fuel clients. The action has caused huge levels of disruption with hours of work lost for insurance providers. These include three of the world's largest fossil fuel insurers, AXA, W.R. Berkely, AIG and more than 400 agents at Lloyd's of London and London's iconic Walkie Talkie tower: The group shut the following insurers down: Birmingham: Sheffield: Leeds: Shut The System took action against these companies due to their critical role underpinning the fossil fuel economy through underwriting contracts and investments. The sector is simultaneously withdrawing coverage from climate-affected regions and raising premiums for households due to extreme-weather related events. A Shut The System activist said: If these powerful companies don't make public statements that they will stop driving fossil fuel expansion and destroying life on Earth, then we have no choice but to stop them ourselves. We will not give up until insurance companies take responsible action. In recent years, the insurance sector has felt escalating pressure from environmental campaigners resulting in a string of breakthroughs. The insurer, Probitas, ruled out insuring West Cumbria Coal Mine and East African Crude Oil Pipeline after activists sprayed paint over their offices; and Zurich introduced new fossil fuel exclusion policies following negotiations with protesters. The group took action on the day that climate science-denier Donald Trump is inaugurated into the White House for a second term, following his scathing remarks about the UK's energy policies, saying the UK should 'get rid of windmills'. The growing urgency for the insurance industry to take the lead in addressing the climate crisis comes as we exceed the 1.5C critical threshold for global warming faster than many climate scientists predicted. This comes amidst of some of the worst wildfires ever seen in Los Angeles and severe flooding in the UK forcing thousands to evacuate their homes.",Canary,2025-01-20T17:24:25+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/20/insurance-companies-wi-fi-shut-the-system/
Chris Nineham to speak publicly on Wednesday over his arrest at pro-Palestine march,"Chris Nineham, co-founder of the Stop The War Coalition, will speak publicly for the first time tomorrow (Wednesday 22 January). It is following his arrest at Saturday's Palestine March in London. Chris Nineham, who was the chief steward of the demo, was one of 77 arrests made by police in what has been widely viewed as a major crackdown on the pro-Palestine protest movement. He will speak at the premiere screening of a new film about the censorship of coverage of events in Gaza in a London cinema on 22 January. Also at the screening will be author and comedian Alexei Sayle and the mothers of three young female activists, who, it's claimed, have been unjustly imprisoned for taking direct action in support of Palestine. The producer of the film Censoring Palestine Norman Thomas said: The police crackdown on pro-Palestine protesters on Saturday marks a new phase in escalating state censorship. This, combined with the outrageous use of counter terrorism laws to arrest journalists and activists, means we are seeing the biggest attack on the freedom of speech in living memory. The police claimed this was to do with protecting a synagogue, but their real intentions were obvious -- to deter any challenge to the state broadcaster, the BBC, and to do this in as harsh a way as possible designed to intimidate people from doing it again. Thomas believes the police are acting on direction from the government. He said: Keir Starmer is really showing his true authoritarian colours. He is criminalising dissent and using the police to enforce state censorship. The BBC does not show us the truth about what's happening in Gaza and now we're not allowed to protest against the distorted version they're handing us. Censoring Palestine explores the way the media has covered events in Gaza since October 2023 and documents what it claims are systematic efforts to suppress the ""genocidal truth"" of the conflict. It includes interviews with film director Ken Loach talking about his own experiences of censorship and the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Ben Jamal who was also interviewed under caution for his part in Saturday's protest. Censoring Palestine is the latest production from Platform Films makers of Oh Jeremy Corbyn - The Big Lie which was controversially axed by Glastonbury Festival in 2023 after an online campaign by pro-Israel lobby groups. The film will be screened in the Genesis Cinema in London on Wednesday 22 January at 6.40pm. The screening will be followed by an open discussion with Chris Nineham, Alexei Sayle, journalist Sarah Wilkinson, the mothers of three imprisoned pro-Palestine activists, Stop The War Convenor Lindsey German, and the filmmakers.

Met Police already threatening peaceful protesters at the 'Lord Walney' 16 appeal hearing,"16 Just Stop Oil supporters are appealing their draconian sentences at the Court of Appeal today and tomorrow. The mass appeal concerns 16 political prisoners with combined sentences of 41 years handed down between July and September 2024. They are known as the Lord Walney 16. On Thursday, the second day of the hearing, at noon, the campaign group Defend Our Juries will stage a lawful and peaceful protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the wrongful silencing and jailing of the political opponents of the arms and oil industries. A spokesperson for the Met Police said: We're aware of plans for a protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice. Officers will be deployed in the area to ensure any incidents are swiftly dealt with. People gathered on the first day of the appeal: All 16 Just Stop Oil supporters were jailed in the months following the publication of a report to the government written by a paid lobbyist for the oil and arms industry that called for groups such as Just Stop Oil and Palestine Action to be banned in a similar way to terrorist organisations. John Woodcock, formerly a Labour MP and now a crossbench peer, published a report on 'political violence' in May 2024, which was falsely presented to the public and Parliament as 'independent'. The appeal concerns the four and five year prison sentences handed down in July 2024 to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam and four co-defendants for taking part in a Zoom call to discuss a planned protest on the M25. It also includes the 20 month sentence imposed on 78 year old grandmother Gaie Delap and four co-defendants who carried out the M25 gantry protest in November 2022, as well as the 18 month to 3 year sentences imposed on four supporters who dug and occupied tunnels under a road leading to the Navigator Oil Terminal in Essex in August 2022. Also under review are the sentences imposed by Judge Hehir on the ""soup throwers"" Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland. They were sentenced to two years and twenty months respectively after they threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers in October 2022, leaving the painting unharmed. A Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: Our broken political system is on trial today. This case is not about whether peaceful climate defenders deserve to be punished with long prison sentences. It is about whether it is acceptable in a democracy to allow wealthy fossil fuel executives to dictate our laws, pervert our criminal justice system and silence all opposition to their destructive and harmful business. Just Stop Oil supporters in prison are political prisoners. They are not there because they disrupted or harmed everyday people - if that were the case, the water company bosses, Post Office execs and those responsible for the Grenfell disaster would be behind bars. No, they are there because Just Stop Oil threatens the profits of the fossil fuel industry. We say to the government you can lock us up but more people will take our place as the extreme consequences of climate breakdown become more apparent. We will not be deterred, we are more afraid of the collapse of ordered civil society than arrest and imprisonment. We are acting in self-defence and to protect our families and communities. We refuse to be bystanders to the ultimate crime against humanity and life on earth. The appeal will be heard by the most senior Judge in England and Wales, Lady Chief Justice Baroness Carr, Mr Justice Lavender and Mr Justice Griffiths. The 16 are represented by Danny Friedman KC and Brenda Campbell KC. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are supporting the group with written submissions to the courts and up to 1,000 supporters are expected to show solidarity by gathering outside the court tomorrow. The outcome of the appeal could be decided any time from a few days to eight weeks following the hearing. At the trial of the 'Whole Truth Five', Judge Hehir ruled that climate issues were 'irrelevant and inadmissible', dismissing them as mere 'political opinion and belief. He handed down a sentence of five years to Just Stop Oil co-founder Roger Hallam, while Daniel Shaw, Lucia Whittaker De Abreu , Louise Lancaster and Cressida Gethin were each sentenced to four years. Michel Forst, UN special rapporteur has previously described these sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother, who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Gaie was sentenced, alongside four co-defendants, to twenty months imprisonment in August 2024 for her part in an action on the M25 in November 2022. Four (including Gaie) were released early, three of whom have been successfully tagged. On day one, Wednesday 29 January, BBC News reported that: Danny Friedman KC, one of several lawyers representing the group, said some of the sentences were ""the highest of their kind in modern British history"". He said that if the terms were allowed to stand, it would mark a ""paradigm shift in this area of criminal law sentencing"". The court was told the protesters ""acted in the knowledge that they would be prosecuted"", but ""none of the applicants acted out of self-interest"". Mr Friedman said: ""What these applicants did by way of collective, non-violent protest, whether one likes it or not, was for the interests of the public, of the planet, and of future generations."" ""They did what they did out of sacrifice,"" he added. The Labour government continues to present Lord Walney to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. Despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024, Lord Walney remains in position. Prior to Lord Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain were unusual.",Canary,2025-01-29T15:55:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/29/just-stop-oil-lord-walney-16-appeal/
A hung jury in the latest Just Stop Oil trial shows the nonsense of these prosecutions,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who sprayed Heathrow departure boards with orange paint during the Oil Kills, international uprising to end fossil fuels last July have won a temporary reprieve as their jury failed to reach a majority decision. Phoebe Plummer and Jane Touil were appearing before judge Duncan at Isleworth Crown Court accused of criminal damage over PS5,000 for their action on 30 July 2024 to demand a fossil fuel treaty to end oil and gas by 2030. The trial, which lasted nine days, ended when the jury failed to reach a majority decision. The judge has scheduled a retrial for May 2026. Phoebe was remanded for 58 days and Jane for 14 days following the action in which the pair used fire extinguishers to spray water-based paint at the departure boards in the terminal. The Crown alleged that the Just Stop Oil action caused PS8,000 worth of damages. Phoebe is currently serving a two year prison sentence for criminal damage for throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting in October 2022. They were sentenced by Judge Hehir at South Crown Court on 27 September 2024, a sentence that is now being challenged in an appeal scheduled for 29-30 January 2025. During the trial, Judge Duncan ruled out the defence of necessity, saying this did not extend to civil disobedience and what she called the Just Stop Oil defendants' ""honestly held opinions"" about climate change. Jane Touil responded that: It is not accurate to say that I am acting on my beliefs. It [the climate crisis] is not 'a cause'. This is physics, an objective reality. I can see that everything is at risk. We only do the right thing if we know what's going on. Phoebe was not allowed to be present in court to make their closing speech as during the course of the trial, the heating system in the holding cells at Isleworth Crown court, contracted to the private company Serco broke down and no one currently in custody could be produced in court. A Just Stop Oil supporter who was present throughout the trial said that: Phoebe and Jane had all their substantial defences removed, a severely mismanaged prosecution, logistical nightmares and a jury that was told to completely disregard their motivations. This is absolutely huge! In her closing speech Phoebe Plummer said: I have struggled with not being able to talk about the climate crisis - hearing it being called irrelevant feels inhumane and dishonest. The prosecution says I'm 'committed to breaking the law'; my only commitment is to act in line with my conscience. They say 'I do what I like without thinking about the law'. I don't think following the law and doing the right thing are always the same thing. I cannot be a bystander to suffering where I see it. Nonviolence means being honest and living in line with the truth. I need to tell the truth about what I see. I act in a way that I think will be effective in saving life. When a doctor breaks a rib while doing CPR the doctor's intent is still obviously saving life not causing grievous bodily harm, the context always matters.",Canary,2025-01-16T15:12:04+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/16/just-stop-oil-hung-jury/
DWP admits cost of living payments failed to properly support disabled people,"Chronically ill and disabled Universal Credit claimants saw their health deteriorate across the course of 2023 - despite receiving the former Conservative government's flagship cost of living payments. In other words, the extra payment failed to enable recipients to maintain their health amidst the spiralling rise in living expenses. Crucially, the Department for Work and Pension's (DWP) own report has confirmed what we already knew - that the additional payments didn't ""scratch the surface"" of chronically ill and disabled claimants' financial struggles. Between 2022 and 2024, the Conservative government awarded two rounds of cost of living payments to some benefits claimants. However, the Canary's Steve Topple calculated at the time that the DWP was denying these to around 1.6 million people. Notably, this included many chronically ill and disabled people. This is because the DWP didn't include certain benefits in its eligibility criteria for them. Among those it excluded were disability benefits such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA). The government made it so contributory or new-style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) also didn't qualify for the payment. Instead, the government made a one-off PS150 lump sum to people claiming disability benefits such as PIP and DLA. It paid this out in April 2023. At the time, many were raising the alarm bells over this woefully insufficient offering. Now, the DWP's own report confirms what the Canary and others had been saying all along. That is, that the paltry payment didn't make a dent in chronically ill and disabled people's expenses under the soaring cost of utilities and essentials. The Conservative government originally launched a review into the cost of living payments in late 2023. The DWP has now published this. And the results are about what you might expect. The evaluation surveyed claimants receiving the most recent round of payments. This covered the department giving people PS900, split into three payments across 2023, and early 2024. It paid the first one in April 2023, the second payment of PS300 in October/November that year, and the third payment of PS299 in February 2024. For this cohort, it attained 2,608 survey responses in total. On top of this, it evaluated the impacts of the pensioner cost of living payment. In particular, it gave this to pensioners that received the Winter Fuel Payment (WFP). It increased PS200/300 payments to PS500 for households with a resident of State Pension age. For households with a resident over 80, it went up to PS600. In this instance, 1,022 pensioners responded to the survey. It also reviewed the so-called disability cost of living payment. There were 881 responses for this group. Needless to say, this one-off payment was a drop in the ocean to chronically ill and disabled claimants. Recipients of the 'disability' cost of living payment described its impact: as minimal. They felt that PS150 was not enough to make a difference to the cost of living pressures they were facing Of course, this is likely because the small one-off lump sum paled in comparison to the soaring cost of living. That's not even to mention that majority of disabled claimant recipients had significant additional health-related expenses. The review found this to be the case in 68% of the people it surveyed over the payment. So it's little wonder that one recipient summed up the situation saying: It didn't really scratch the surface of what we have to pay. It just kind of disappeared in the bank account, really. However, as it turns out, the cost of living payment didn't do a lot of good for those that got it either. Even for chronically ill and disabled people the DWP did give the main cost of living payment to, it was little more than a short-lived stopgap measure. Notably, disabled claimants comprised 63% of the survey's main cost of living payment recipients. So to start, the report identified how these disabled recipients had additional health-related expenses for things like medical costs, transport, and aids. Then, it noted how disabled recipients had: increasingly struggled to meet those expenses. For the core cost of living payment recipients, 43% had expressed how the rising prices of living essentials had meant their extra health-related costs: had become a lot harder to afford over the last year. In other words, spiralling prices of goods and services was eating up money that chronically ill and disabled people might have directed towards managing and living with their conditions. Only just over half (54%) of disabled cost of living recipients were able to spend any of their payment on their health needs. To make matters worse, chronically ill and disabled recipients already had higher costs to contend with in the first place. Predictably then, the report said that recipients: who had additional health-related expenses were more likely to feel that energy bills, food, and other bills had become more difficult to afford over the last year, compared to those without additional health-related expenses. Obviously, the increased costs of living essentials had therefore hit chronically ill and disabled people harder. The report acknowledged this further, stating that: Qualitative interviews revealed that health needs could also lead to higher costs. For example, recipients noticed a significant increase in energy and utility bills driven by using more electricity for medical equipment like mobility scooters and oxygen containers. Participants also needed to keep the heating on for longer to manage conditions like arthritis, as colder temperatures would aggravate the pain. This was also true for older participants who kept their heating on to support their mobility. Crucially though, the survey followed up with recipients after the cost of living payments. This revealed that the DWP's three the cost of living payments had made no difference to them being able to cover their health-related expenses. Instead, it found that: a large proportion of recipients continued to find health-related expenses difficult to afford. Most significantly however, the follow-up highlighted how: participants experienced a deterioration in their physical health over the course of the study. To sum up: the health of chronically ill and disabled recipients of the PS900 cost of living payment had actually got worse during the period the DWP had paid this out. Of course, this also impacted family members acting as carers for their chronically ill and disabled loved ones. Specifically, it detailed that it had exacerbated their mental health due to the: compounding pressure of additional caring duties and the need to work more hours to meet rising costs. This on top of the fact that people claiming Carer's Allowance were also ineligible for the payment only makes that all the worse too. The report skirted around offering an explanation for this, noting only that: This decline was attributed to either worsening pre-existing health conditions or diagnoses of new conditions. Participants noted that their declining health led to additional expenses, such as the cost of taxis to attend frequent hospital appointments. However, it's not hard to put two and two together. It should be obvious that not being able to afford a) essentials, and b) extra health costs (arguably also essentials) would cause people's health to decline. Other parts of the report underscored this too, if not directly drawing the explicit connection. For instance, the evaluation categorised cost of living recipients into one of three groups according to their financial circumstances. Predictably then, group C - the one least able to afford everyday essentials - were the cost of living recipients more likely to have additional expenses. It made up the bulk, at 46% of survey respondents. These included extra costs for things like rent, debt, childcare, and school expenses. And naturally, healthcare costs came into this too. Specifically, 59% of this group had added healthcare-related spending. This compared to 45% for group A - comprising 22% of recipients - who were those that could most afford the increased cost of living. It tracks too then that proportionally, more in group C actually reported that their financial situation had gotten worse. This was at more than four times the rate - 42% - to 10% of group A respondents. Given there were significantly more people in group C, that also means many more people who'd already been struggling to make ends meet, now found themselves worse off despite the cost of living payments. In other words, the cost of living payments were worth a lot less in practical terms, and had a much smaller impact for the poorest, most marginalised claimants. Largely though, it showed that chronically ill and disabled claimants were also more likely to have multiple expense pressures at once. This would have compounded the impact of rising bills and costs for these recipients, ultimately further eroding the payment's impact in alleviating them. But perhaps most significantly, nearly three-quarters of the survey respondents were living in absolute poverty. For the analysis, this equated to a dual household (minus children) with a weekly pre-tax income below PS368. Of course, this rate varied according to the composition of the household. The evaluation didn't identify the number of disabled recipients living in absolute poverty. However, given the fact that 63% of respondents were disabled, it means that disabled recipients would have made up a significant proportion of the near three-quarters in absolute poverty. With substantial numbers of recipients starting out in absolute poverty - it's little wonder the cost of living payment hardly made a dent. In other words, claimants were already living on paltry, inadequate incomes. And the fact that the majority of cost of living recipients were poor, is even less surprising when you factor in rates of employment in the survey pool. This was just 26% of claimants getting the cost of living payment in the survey. Plus, group C respondents were more likely to be employed. In short then, this means that for most recipients, Universal Credit would have been a major source of their income. Yet, successive governments have ensured that benefits are not enough for people to live on. In part, this is because they've repeatedly failed to raise benefits in line with inflation. As Topple has also pointed out, the Universal Credit 'increases' in 2023 were in fact real-terms cuts. It meant that claimants were in fact worse off than before the Coronavirus pandemic. Unsurprisingly, those losing out from the flat-rate payment as opposed to the DWP actually uprating Universal Credit in line with inflation included families with three or more children, and some households with disabled residents. Low and behold then that the evaluation also identified that recipients of households with three or more children were both: Notably, this also meant that single mothers were particularly underserved by the cost of living payments. This is because they made up 94% of the single parents in the survey. In short then, the soaring costs of bills and essentials were still a disaster for women, children, and disabled Universal Credit claimants. This was the case even with the extra PS900 cost of living payments. Overall, the report found that the cost of living payments' impact was temporary for all recipients. It drove home that while they initially helped: recipients to avoid taking on additional debt and had a notable short-term impact, these positive financial effects were typically temporary. By the end of the next month, recipients were facing the same financial challenges again Ultimately then, the fact is, the cost of living payments were merely a sticking plaster. Crucially, they didn't even take claimants back to the starting line in terms of meeting the soaring costs of everyday living necessities. So not only did the DWP leave vast numbers of chronically ill and disabled people without this support, the ones it did provide it to, it utterly failed anyway. Of course, the former Conservative government stopped this payment in February 2024. It's extremely unlikely the new Labour government will now look to reinstate this in any form. In short: the DWP hasn't published this now with any intention to build an improved and more inclusive scheme. Quite the opposite in fact. On Wednesday 29 January, chancellor Rachel Reeves will instead set out the government's new plans to cut people's benefits. Not to mention that this will finally reveal what Labour intends to do with disability benefits specifically. It's looking likely this will involve denying these benefits to many people needing them going forward. So there's fat chance the Labour-led DWP is going to heed the evaluation's findings and make welfare genuinely meet chronically ill and disabled people's needs. Because, why on Earth would it want to do that? Not when it can scapegoat them for the problems of its own design instead.",Canary,2025-01-28T10:00:15+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/cost-of-living-payments-dwp-analysis/
Palestine Action political prisoner FREE - but just as THREE others are arrested,"On Friday 24 January, a Palestine Action political prisoner was released from HMP Dovegate after spending almost a month on remand. It was over a Christmas Day action at UAV Engines - a company directly complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Bryn Higgs, from Ullapool, was arrested on 25 December 2024 alongside four others following an action which destroyed the walls at the premises of UAV Engines Ltd - Shenstone's Israeli drone factory: In a hearing at Stafford Crown Court, Bryn was granted bail - ahead of a trial set for January 2026. At the time of his arrest, Higgs was awaiting charges for a previous action targeting the same factory in July. He was charged on Boxing Day and remanded to prison on 27 December: UAV Engines is operated by Elbit Systems, Israel's biggest weapons manufacturer, and produces engines for Elbit's killer drones. In addition to making engines for Elbit's Hermes 450 drone, which has been deployed as a mass-murder device throughout the Gaza genocide, the UEL AR731 Wankel-type rotary engine, produced at the Staffordshire factory, is being used in Israeli Harop Kamikaze drones, which are currently being upgraded to kill autonomously. Elbit have dishonestly claimed that they do not export to Israel, but this is disproven by export license data for military end use: Every day UAV Engines factory loses production, Palestinian lives are saved, and Palestine Action have been targeting the plant since the start of our four-year long direct action campaign. Blockades, occupations, vehicular lock-ons, and now another assault on the factory roof, have shut the plant down repeatedly. UAV Engines most recent accounts show that the company is now losing money - nearly half a million by the end of 2023. Speaking before his arrest, Higgs said: The spotlight should always be on be on Palestine and the Palestinians' struggle for equal human rights under international law, and against Israel's apartheid, ethnic cleansing, occupation and genocide. Meanwhile, on Monday 27 January three other Palestine Action actionists were nicked by cops. It was over a previous action at Elbit's Kent factory:",Canary,2025-01-27T11:58:31+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/palestine-action-bryn-higgs/
A family GP has been JAILED for attacking... PETROL PUMPS with Just Stop Oil,"A family doctor has been sentenced to one year in prison for taking action with climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil. Dr Patrick Hart took action in August 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. Esso is a subsidiary of the Oil giant Exxon Mobil which infamously concealed the alarming findings of its own scientists, which showed that fossil fuels caused global warming. Exxon subsequently ploughed millions into a disinformation campaign which initially sewed doubt and later confusion around the emerging climate science. In his closing statement at Chelmsford Crown Court during his trial, Hart said: I disrupted people as an act of care. I damaged the petrol pump screens as an act of care, because in times of great peril, a caring person has to stand up for what is right. My actions have already cost me greatly. I have been handed a suspended prison sentence, and thousands of pounds in costs through a civil injunction for this exact same action. I have been penalised at work and stand to be suspended or lose my licence to practise as a doctor. But I regret nothing. Because to not do it, would have been to give up on caring, and that would be worse. In the face of the permanent collapse of our climate, our economy, our society and life on Earth, the only thing that keeps me going is our continued capacity as people to care, regardless of what happens. Yes, I fear prison, but I am ready to go if I must Hart has already faced civil charges for this action and been fined, as the Thurrock Esso petrol station is subject to a private injunction. He will also face a tribunal after being referred for a disciplinary hearing by his professional regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). In the last 12 months, the GMC has suspended two doctors from the medical register following their convictions for non-violent climate protest. As such Hart stands to be penalised three times for the same action. Before sentencing, Hart said: Right now, the greatest health threat to all of us is the unfolding climate catastrophe. It is the greatest health threat we have ever faced. All healthcare workers have a responsibility to protect the health of their patients. If we do not stand up to the oil and gas executives who are wreaking havoc on our climate and the politicians who enable them, if we do not end the burning of fossil fuels, then we will have failed as a profession and the health systems that we have developed over centuries will collapse. I will continue to fight against the death sentence of fossil fuels for as long as I have strength in me. I have no greater duty as a doctor at this moment in history. Today's sentencing comes after a jury found three Just Stop Oil supporters 'not guilty' in June of 2024 for disabling petrol pumps in the same manner as Hart. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

The repression of the pro-Palestine movement at Birmingham University should be a national scandal,"Expressing ourselves freely is a basic human right, and freedom of speech is an important part of this expression. Nowhere is it more important than in universities, where ideas need to be challenged, new perspectives developed, and independent thinking among students and staff should be the norm. Although the Equality Act is already in place on campuses, to make sure students are protected from harassment and unlawful discrimination, censorship has become a real issue in recent years, and there are growing concerns that not enough is being done to uphold free speech in colleges and universities. Students, staff, and union members, in campuses across Britain, are facing growing repression and intimidation tactics, because of their actions, words and beliefs, and the University of Birmingham (UoB) is no exception. Peaceful protest over Israel's genocide in Gaza has resulted in UoB students facing disciplinary procedures, which may even result in expulsion and prevent them from graduating. This attempt to clampdown on dissent comes at a time when the university has also revised its Code of Practice on Freedom of Speech, carried out without consultation with the staff unions, or any explanation as to how the changes were linked to new aspects of the law. The University of Birmingham branch of the University and College Union (BUCU) believes there are several issues with its effectiveness, so have submitted a set of changes to the Code, which it says make it workable, and addresses legitimate safety concerns, but does not inhibit free speech. Andrew Olson is Vice President of BUCU, and Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Birmingham. He told the Canary: What we found, examining the code, were many problems. It is very broad - seemingly covering all activities of teaching and research, so that it's not clear what you don't have to ask permission for. There is also no obligation on the University to have an open and transparent process for making decisions. Every event must have a named organiser, and they need to ask for authorization 14 days before any event, otherwise they could be refused. This could frequently be reasonable but won't be if activities are responding to changing events. The University has also asked for 'measures to ensure opposing views can be put forward lawfully'. But, in many contexts, whether university seminars or demonstrations and protests, people are advocating for a particular view. That cannot be prohibited if there is to be free and open discussion, debate and protest. According to Olson, it is now unclear to some staff members whether they will get into trouble for discussing something, so they start to think 'That's a controversial topic, I'd better not include that'. This includes not just those working in areas such as the Middle East, but also those talking about topics such as gender, race and class. But, he says, if these staff knew they were protected, they would not think like this. ""I think its important to have that space in a university, where these types of conversations are allowed, even encouraged, and where the university supports that. The university is unlikely to care about, or want to control all these different areas but, if someone else suddenly becomes interested in them, they then have the tools to do that,"" Olson explains. Back in December 2023, the UoB prevented the go ahead of an event discussing law in Palestine, because of the inclusion on the flyer, of watermelons, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity. The discussion was cancelled at the last minute, with no explanation given at the time, although UoB eventually claimed the event was only postponed and would take place at a later date, but this has never happened. Olson said: In my mind, indefinite postponement is the same thing as cancelling. But normally they don't do that. The main way we see this code operating to keep debate invisible, or make sure it doesn't happen, or keep it away from the rest of the university community, is not through explicit forbidding of things. Instead, they operate through active intimidation, and making people view lots of things to get activities approved. They delay things and set vague conditions that mean activities are either difficult to do, or are less effective. Students, staff and UCU members say the university not only uses tactics of intimidation against them, but also accuses them of acts of intimidation. Olson noted: They have done this to me. I went with the students to the Vice Chancellor's office, to deliver a letter about the situation in Gaza and University involvement in related activities. It was from the students and also signed by both unions - UCU and UNISON. Afterwards, I was accused of intimidating staff from the VC's office. I was there as a member of staff to support students, as a member of the UCU, representing the local branch as an officer, and as an open member of the group who could be a point of reference for both staff and students. The students were fearful because they felt threatened by the university. I felt that I could provide a supportive presence, and act as a potential mediator if the situation required that. The students were insistent, but not threatening, about wanting to see the VC, but he was not in. We delivered the letter and that was it. So I was surprised to be contacted by the Director of Human Resources afterwards. One student, who wants to remain anonymous, was part of the committee of UoB Friends of Palestine, and therefore had to attend many meetings with the Vice Chancellor and other university staff. This meant he was known to the university. He told the Canary: I received an unexpected email from the uni, saying I was being investigated, but I had no idea what it was about. At their meeting, I was blamed for being at a protest, although I was not even on campus. I was shown a video of an 'unauthorized' protest, and a student who was obviously not me. They knew it wasn't me but wanted to pin the blame on someone. They asked me if I had organized the protest, knew who had organized it, or knew who had taken part in it. But I knew nothing, as I was not there, and the university had to admit it was wrong. But the false accusations are nothing new. Back in 2014, UoB student Simon Furse accused the university of using legal action to deter dissent on campus, as he was cleared of assaulting a security guard during a protest about tuition fees. The case against him collapsed although not before Furse and other students were arrested, disciplined, and suspended from the university when a video emerged showing the story had been fabricated. The University of Birmingham is also currently taking disciplinary action against two of its students. Antonia Listrat, a final year International Law and Globalization student, started her disciplinary process last October, and her hearing is today (28 January). She is accused of participating in 'unauthorised' protests, for being part of the pop up encampment on campus during welcome week, and protesting outside the university Investment Subcommittee meeting last May. Listrat argues that: Senior management were at the Welcome Week event, taking photos and intimidating us. We were told they were going to find out who we were and expel all of us. It was never just me, it was a group effort, and I was never an organiser. It's not feasible to have organisers. We do not want anyone to have a target on their back, and be named. The university's said we've been threatening and intimidating, and using inappropriate language or behaviour, but these claims are part of a larger pattern of criminalizing students. It's rooted in anti-Palestinian racism. We wear Palestinian Keffiyehs to cover our faces, but during the student encampment court case last year, someone from the university gave evidence against us, saying students were wearing balaclavas to intimidate people. We weren't wearing balaclavas. No one has ever worn a balaclava, and we are not intimidating! They also said we were threatening to Jewish students, but this isn't the case. There are Jewish students who are pro-Palestinian and protest with us. Although the International Court of Justice has ruled Israel's occupation of Palestine to be illegal, Amnesty International has concluded Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, governments are still not acting. Listrat says: It's up to the people to uphold the law, if the governments don't do it. But this disciplinary has made me feel like my right to protest has been violated and denied. So many people are scared right now, and feel desperate they can't take any action because of potential consequences. It's horrible. Protesting has been a way of doing something and it's been great for my mental health, but now that's been suppressed and I've been silenced, it feels like I've been disempowered. Mariyah Ali, a final year English and Creative Writing student at the UoB, wanted to take a PGCE and become a teacher, but now has no idea if she will even graduate this summer. Disciplinary action is also being taken against Ali, after she attended the protest outside the Investments Committee meeting last year. She told the Canary: As students, we're taught you get educated to get a good job, have critical thinking, and also to make the world a better place. How am I going to make the world a better place, when the university I learn and study at is involved in a genocide? I feel the university is a complicit institution, because it has research partnerships, working with arms companies that fund and give weapons to Israel. I didn't sign up to be involved in that when I came to the University of Birmingham. If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come, but now that I do have that information, I feel that we, as students, have a moral responsibility to fight that. After 15 minutes of chanting, being told to leave, and photographed by a staff member, Ali says the meeting stopped and staff left through a back door. Shortly afterwards, the students decided it was now not worth continuing, so they stopped the protest and left. Two weeks went by, before Ali received a disciplinary letter from the university, the only member of the protest to get one. This was followed, in June, by an interview in which Ali was accused of being intimidating, using offensive language and disrupting the university's business. ""The point of a protest is to be disruptive. However, I did deny the fact that I was intimidating or threatening in any way, as protesting against genocide definitely isn't intimidating, and it's my right! It feels like the university is trying to target specific individuals and use us as examples to scare the rest of the student movement on campus,"" she says. Ali claims she then emailed the university, asking for timelines and evidence, but received no reply. In September, after hearing nothing, and not even knowing if she could go into her final year with a disciplinary, Ali again messaged the university. This time they responded, saying she could go into her final year and keep studying, while they investigate. Back in summer, UoB took its students to court, in an effort to shut down their pro-Palestine encampment on its grounds - a move which Ali described at the time as a 'censoring tactic'. The university won, so Ali, who was the only named defendant, was required to pay the legal fees - which amounted to PS60,000. She instead signed a contract with the university, in which she forfeited her rights to protest on campus. If there is a breach of contract, not only will Ali have to pay the PS60K fine but she will also get a criminal conviction. Ali told the Canary: They say I can't be involved in any 'unauthorised' protest - but they haven't highlighted what an unauthorised protest actually is. I have only been participating in the student-staff ones, as these have been organised by the unions and so there is a level of safety involved here. It's been hard because security know who I am, and I know they are watching me. These things are all happening at the same time to me, and I'm in my final year. It's affected me mentally, and very much academically. Unlike other universities, the University of Birmingham has no timeframe for disciplinary processes, and it's not possible to graduate with an ongoing disciplinary. I don't feel the uni is following the procedures. This has been ongoing since my second year but, during the whole process, they're not giving me any evidence for what I've been accused of. The only thing they mentioned in the interview is that they have eyewitness statements from Student Affairs. Earlier this month, she was told her disciplinary had been escalated, and she had been found guilty of breaking the rules. The news came as Ali and Listrat are increasing their efforts to get justice. They have not only launched a petition - which they hope everyone will sign - calling on the UoB to drop the disciplinary action against then, uphold free speech, and end the repression of pro-Palestine student activism on campus, but have also set up the UoB 2 Campaign. Their campaigns have gained the support of many people, including Jeremy Corbyn MP, the musician Brian Eno, and UN Special Rapporteur, Gina Romero: As UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association, Romero is committed to promoting and protecting these rights worldwide. According to her, the response of universities to pro-Palestine solidarity protests has 'exposed a hostile environment for the exercise of fundamental rights, including freedom of peaceful assembly and association'. Romero told the Canary: Reports of violence, harassment, and academic reprisals against students and faculty--particularly Palestinian and Arab individuals--severely undermine freedom of expression and discourage public participation. This risks alienating a generation and eroding trust in democratic processes. I have specifically raised concerns with the University of Birmingham about allegations of harassment and disciplinary actions tied to its protest authorization system, which appears to conflict with international standards on the right to peaceful protest. To date, I have not received a response. Universities must recognize that their responsibility extends beyond campus borders - their actions have the potential to shape political discourse, culture, civic education, and ultimately, the future sustainability of democracy, freedoms and human rights. The University of Birmingham was contacted for comment on the above points, and also asked why they have, so far, failed to respond to respond to the letter from Gina Romero, UN Special Rapporteur. A University of Birmingham spokesperson came back to us with this expected reply: The University of Birmingham has a very strong and longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom - supported by our Code of Practice. In the last term alone, supported by our Freedom of Speech process, several activities, events, and protests organised by those wishing to express their support of Palestine, as well as a range of other issues of concern to members of the University community, have taken place on campus. We are unable to comment on active case matters involving individual students. According to Dr Lucie Ryzova, Senior Lecturer in Middle East History at UoB, and a BUCU Committee Member, the failure to think critically - and push back against censorship and self-censorship alike - is what enables the banality of evil. Ryzova says her colleagues' apparent indifference to the genocide in Gaza - either through fear of being accused of antisemitism, or the misguided perception that they have a duty to support their Jewish friends and colleagues - have left her feeling angry, deeply disenchanted, and increasingly alienated from her white British academic colleagues. She told the Canary: At this point, this is either due to ignorance or covert racism. The inability to distinguish between Jewishness and Zionism is as prevalent among my supposedly intellectual colleagues as it is inexcusable. These university professors are supposed to be the intelligentsia. No, they are not! They are either cowards, ignoramuses or racists. It is blatantly obvious that Israel is a fascist regime, bent on realizing the 'final solution' for the Palestinians. Support for it among many white Western audiences is really about maintaining white supremacy. University management has attempted to intimidate and silence Ryzova several times. In one instance, she was called to the office of her 'line manager' to talk about a 'matter of concern'. It turned out that she made a Zionist student feel 'uncomfortable', while teaching her specialist topic, modern Egypt: My line manager said I needed to make sure all my students feel 'comfortable', but I said nope. We teach slavery, which makes some white people feel uncomfortable; does that mean we are not supposed to teach it? Or suppose a colleague teaches about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are we supposed to take the Russian perspective into account and care about the feelings of Russian people in the room? But Ryzova says there was another incident, this time a 'painful and revengeful' one, 'which had been prepared a long time ago, and came out of nowhere'. As part of an informal departmental seminar, which did not need permission as it was behind closed doors and had no outside guests, they had a debate on Gaza. But it did not go well. Ryzova, says she was yelled at by a Zionist colleague, who said Gaza should not be discussed. The incident faded away but, nine months later, in October 2024, when she organized and chaired the seminar as usual, there was a misunderstanding between two of her colleagues, which had nothing to do with politics: My line manager sent me a message saying I wasn't doing my job properly, and we needed to rethink the seminar because of past complaints against my organizing and chairing of it. They said I was creating an 'insufficiently inclusive environment'. I fought back, and brought testimonies by many colleagues saying the opposite, but to no avail. So, they've closed down the whole seminar, because in January 2024 I spoke about Gaza. It's like they'd been waiting all that time for the right opportunity to shut me down. Although the academic futures of Ali and Listrat futures are uncertain, they hope a public outcry may lead to the disciplinary actions being dropped, as has recently happened at the London School of Economics (LSE). Disciplinary action it took against seven of its students has ended, after a powerful campaign and huge public outcry. LSE had banned the students from campus, and given them disciplinary action after a protest over LSE's investments in companies complicit in the Gaza genocide.

The #Hastings3 are free - and already planning another pro-Palestine protest,"Three men prosecuted for taking part in a peaceful protest at arms manufacturer General Dynamics were found not guilty of all charges at Brighton Law Courts on Wednesday 22 January. Laurie Holden, 72, Clem McCulloch, 33, and Thomas Delves, 25 - collectively known as the #Hastings3 - were arrested for aggravated trespass on 29 February 2024 during an early morning protest at one of the firm's two sites in Hastings, East Sussex. The three told the court that they were at General Dynamics on that day to disrupt the business of the weapons manufacturers and to slow production down. Illustrator Thomas Delves, 25, said: I believed it was the right thing to do to stop the weapons factory in any way I could because it was supplying weapons to a genocide in Gaza. I thought my actions would have a somewhat immediate impact as the promise of the weapons gave confidence to the Israeli government to continue. He said he had decided to sit in front of one of their entrances as it was both ""peaceful but still effective"". Retired train driver Laurie Holden said: There was a genocide going on, the ultimate crime against humanity and General Dynamics was playing a major role in that crime, making a lot of weapons, like 2,000 lb bombs. I know people in Gaza who were being affected by it. The two were arrested for aggravated trespass but as they were being forcibly removed from the protest, McCulloch said he got upset and decided to stand in their place: I believed it was the right thing to do. I knew General Dynamics manufactured arms and related equipment which were used not just during the genocide but in the years previously, providing ordinance and equipment to the IDF to be used in Palestine. All three were physically dragged from the protest and held in a cell for 13 hours before being charged under a Section 69 order of failing to comply with an order from the police to move off land when directed to do so. The court heard evidence for the prosecution from the two arresting officers PC's Freeman and Johnson as well as General Dynamics' UK Head of Security Mr Hoffman, who gave his evidence behind a screen claiming he feared repercussions if the defendants saw his face. Protest police liaison officer PC Freeman said he had worked alongside the protest organisers for a number of months and confirmed that all the actions were peaceful. He added that on the day ""it was a very peaceful protest and my only concern was the fire exit"". In court, body cam footage worn by PC Freeman showed him asking Delves and Holden to move out of the way of the door, to which Holden replied: We're more concerned with the weapons that are being made in this building. Stopping a genocide is far more important. We want to stop genocide, that's why we're here. Later in court, when asked if he would have got out of the way if there was a fire in the building, Mr Delves said: Of course. The idea was to get people out of the building! The court heard on PC Freeman's body cam footage that when a female protestor asked if she could stay on site, PC Freeman confirmed that she could and they were only interested in clearing the fire exits. Defence counsel moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds of no case to answer since the three men were simply instructed to move away from an exit they were blocking and not given clear direction to 'leave the land'. ""There must be some degree of formality other than just 'get out of the way'"" argued Sergent. After hearing all the evidence in the case, district judge Amanda Kelly concluded: It seems to be agreed that there was no clear order given to the men of what they were being told to do or where to go. She found all three not guilty. ""This is a total vindication of the #Hastings3"" said Katy Colley, chair of the Hastings and District Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest: It was outrageous that our friends were put through this ordeal for nearly a year, dragged through a criminal court case at a huge cost to the taxpayer. And for what? To protect Genocide Dynamics, which has been supplying weapons to a state which is in the dock for genocide. Our friends our heroes. They put their bodies on the line to try to stop a genocide. They did what they could to prevent the senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent Palestinians. General Dynamics are the criminals. It was telling that while our friends held their heads high and spoke openly of their motives, the head of security was hiding behind a screen. Perhaps he is ashamed of defending merchants of death. This whole case should never have happened. The justice system is being abused to criminalise peaceful protest, wasting precious court time and taxpayer money to defend a company that makes billions in profits every year from death and destruction. General Dynamics is the world's fifth largest arms company. It made all the MK80 bombs that were dropped on Gaza over 15 months, resulting in over 47,000 confirmed deaths and massive destruction to homes and civilian infrastructure. The company, which has two sites in Hastings, has been the target of 14 local protests since Israel's assault on the besieged enclave began which, in a statement submitted to court in June, General Dynamics admitted had ""significantly disrupted operations"" onsite. It read: The frequency and presence of unauthorized individuals on our sites, in combination with flags/placards referencing 'Genocide Dynamics' as opposed to 'General Dynamics' has likely damaged our business's reputation. If this negative perception continues this could result in a decline in patronage and a loss of trust within the community. The statement went on: These ongoing incidents of trespassing have significantly disrupted our operations and had a detrimental impact on our business, employees and third parties in a number of ways. Trespassers have frequently interrupted our business operations. This includes interference with daily activities, delays in service delivery, and the necessity to temporarily close sections of our premises for security reasons. Such disruptions are likely to have led to a decrease in productivity as staff have had to adjust their locations and hours of work in response. Speaking outside court after the verdict Laurie Holden pledged to continue the campaign to stop General Dynamics supplying military equipment to Israel and appealed for people to join him at the next protest at the General Dynamics site at 10am on Friday 24 January, followed by a protest rally against General Dynamics in Hastings Town Centre on Saturday 1 February at 12pm.",Canary,2025-01-23T14:00:06+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/23/hastings-3-trial/
150 MPs and public figures slam the Met over pro-Palestine BBC march restriction,"Cross-party MPs and peers, trade union general secretaries, cultural figures and celebrities, writers, journalists, health workers and civil society organisations and activists have condemned police attempts to stop an agreed Protest for Palestine taking place at the BBC on Saturday 18 January. In a statement issued today (10 January) by the six organisations behind the national Palestine marches, and supported by at least 150 high profile individuals and organisations, including Liberty, Amnesty International UK, and Greenpeace, the Metropolitan Police are accused of misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. Among those to have signed the statement are musician Brian Eno, singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, actors Mark Rylance, Khalid Abdalla, Nadia Sawalha and Juliet Stevenson, author Susan Abulhawa, economist Yanis Varoufakis, Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty and Asad Rehman, executive director, War on Want, along with several leading health workers, including London Hospital A&E doctor Dr Andrew Myerson. Labour, Independent, Green, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein and SNP MPs have signed, while trade union leaders include PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, the NEU's Daniel Kebede and FBU leader Matt Wrack. The route of the march was agreed by the Met in November. They have now reneged on that agreement, citing possible disruption to a synagogue, which is not on the route of the march. Making the point about the preciousness of the rights to freedom of speech and protest the statement concludes: It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned. We strongly condemn police attempts to stop an agreed march for Palestine from protesting at the BBC on 18 January. The route for the march was confirmed with the Police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police is reneging on the agreement and has stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution - it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. The police should not be misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that the march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue which is not even on the march route. As the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that pro-Palestine marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that Jewish people have been joining the marches in their thousands. The rights to protest and free speech are precious. It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned.

Labour woos big business in Davos but the rip off was on full display,"Davos refers to the World Economic Forum, which meets annually in January. Multinational corporations, usually with a turnover of at least five billion dollars, fund it as members at a fee of PS52,000. So of course the Labour Party government was there this year. Unless your a member, costs of attendance for those invited can exceed PS250,000 with items like a hot dog costing $43. Is this the place that's going to solve key global issues such as spiralling inequality? Not long before Davos, Oxfam released figures on the scale of billionaire riches as of 2024. It found that last year global billionaire wealth increased by $2 trillion. Oxfam argues that ""extreme billionaire wealth is largely unmerited"" partly because 60% of their wealth is either inherited, from monopolies or from crony connections. Rather than tackling this, Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves is at Davos making yet more concessions to big business. She said: We have been listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community. As such, she has relaxed some rules of the transitionary period for ending non-dom super rich tax breaks in the UK. That's after the corporate media made noise about the super rich planning to leave the country. But Tax Justice Network has documented that just 0.01% of super rich households relocated after Norway, Sweden, and Denmark introduced increased wealth tax reforms. And Reeves hasn't introduced any, but is continuing the Tories' plan of ending non dom status. Another issue Davos seems unlikely to solve is the climate crisis. At the event, Reeves and business secretary Jonathan Reynolds met leaders of banks such as Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and Barclays. It's seven years since the Paris climate agreement was adopted. Yet the world's 60 largest private banks have invested $6.9 trillion in fossil fuels since then. And Lloyds, Barclays, and HSBC have all maintained large investments in planet-destroying carbon energy. On top of that, Reeves said at Davos that her plan for growth supersedes the climate emergency. That's shocking, but unfortunately unsurprising. In a further attempt to woo big business, Starmer has announced he will block legal challenges to infrastructure projects (that should be publicly-owned rather than for-profit, anyway). Niall Toru, senior lawyer at Friends of the Earth, rubbished Starmer's right-wing chest beating: No one is above the law, not even the government. Friends of the Earth only brings cases we think are strong and necessary to protect people and nature from unlawful harm - and considering our string of recent legal wins, so do the courts. It is deeply concerning that Labour is attempting to scapegoat claimants. If ministers don't want to be challenged in the courts, they should act within the law, because already cases aren't allowed to proceed unless they have merit. It was two years ago when Starmer made his position clear that he opts for the super rich over representative democracy. In January 2023, Emily Maitlis asked Labour Party leader Keir Starmer: You have to choose now between Davos or Westminster? Starmer replied: Davos What more is there to say?",Canary,2025-01-24T15:33:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/24/labour-davos/
25 charities call on Labour to free Gaie Delap just as she's given 20 more days in prison,"Climate protester Gaie Delap has been told that she must serve a further 20 days in prison for being ""unlawfully at large"" - just as 25 leading charities call on the Labour government to release her. Gaie's additional 20 days is accounted for by the days that followed Serco/EMS's report of 28 November on their failure to fit an appropriate tag on her wrist, and her eventual return to prison just before Christmas. During this time, waiting to be arrested, she was fully compliant with her curfew and did nothing wrong. As has been previously disclosed, Serco/EMS reported they were unable to fit a tag because their smallest straps were too big for her wrists, despite them being within the usual range for UK females. EMS also reported the reason for breach as ""refusal for install [sic]"", saying Gaie ""would not let us install Electronic Equipment during our visits"". This was a lie. She has never refused a tag or any other EMS Electronic Equipment. Instead of being released on the expected date of 17 March as stated in her recall papers, Gaie has now been informed by prison authorities that she will be kept in prison until 7 April. Her recall will have cost the public purse PS20,000. Family and friends, in parallel with legal approaches, have appealed to Labour Party minister Shabana Mahmood, secretary of state for justice who made the decision to recall, to use her discretionary powers to rescind this decision. This latest news coincides with the release of an open letter from twenty-five charities calling on Shabana Mahmood to revoke Gaie's recall to prison to ensure her re-release on Home Detention Curfew under conditions that respect her health and dignity. You can read the open letter here. Part of it says that ""this situation is not an isolated incident but part of a broader pattern of failures associated with private contractors managing electronic monitoring services. Notably, Serco has previously been implicated in overcharging the UK government for electronic tagging, including billing for individuals who were deceased, incarcerated, or had left the country"": These historical and ongoing issues underscore the systemic problems inherent in outsourcing critical public services to private entities without adequate oversight. Mick Delap, Gaie's brother said: How come that it has proved so impossible to fit this normal-sized woman, who desperately wants to have electronic monitoring, with any one of the many different forms of monitoring available to the authorities? That was true of the time she was waiting at home, and has continued to be true in the month since she has been back in prison. How come that there has been a deafening silence from the Ministry of Justice since Gaie's return to prison despite numerous appeals from her family, friends and her MP? And, perhaps most crucially, how come those with ultimate responsibility for the proper functioning of Serco/EMS - the MoJ and Parliament - are so blatantly failing to hold them to account? Family friend Mike Campbell added: A flawed process led to Gaie's recall. This will cost the taxpayer up to PS20,000. Her re-incarceration represents a clear miscarriage of justice. She now faces double jeopardy, two punitive measures resulting solely from the unavailability of suitable electronic monitoring equipment. This is a cruel decision. Our criminal justice and penal system has failed, in Gaie's case, to meet the standards of proportionality, fairness, and respect for human dignity that should be the cornerstone of justice in the UK. Immediate action is required to correct this systemic failing not just for the sake of Gaie, but of hundreds of women being failed by the system. The Ministry of Justice will know how to access a number of electronic monitoring devices suitable for use by Gaie. There is no possible reason for one of these not to be fitted while she is in prison and then released.",Canary,2025-01-28T11:25:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/gaie-delap-recalled/
Shell was given a stark reminder of its role in events like the LA wildfires,"Fossil Free London staged a protest outside Shell's global HQ, the Shell Centre, on Southbank on Wednesday 15 January, in protest over the role fossil fuel corporations like Shell's have in exacerbating the climate crisis. Dressed in red and orange, signs read ""It's not a tragedy, it's a crime"", chanting ""Shell did this"": A London firefighter joined the crowd, holding a placard saying ""Big oil makes our job harder"": Shell continues to drill for new fossil fuels, making fires like the ones we are seeing in LA much more likely. In March 2024, Shell defied climate experts and rolled back their green targets, pledging to keep oil production steady until 2030. Wildfires across Los Angeles have now killed at least 24 people, and burned down more than 12,000 homes and businesses. Scientists warn these fires are driven in intensity by heat and drought; both conditions are directly linked to and made increasingly common by the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that emissions from fossil fuels are the biggest cause of climate change. Fossil fuel corporations have been aware of climate change and its effects as early as 1977, but continued to expand oil and gas production. Joanna Warrington, who attended the protest with Fossil Free London, said: LA is on fire, and it's big oil that sparked the match and fanned the flames. Corporations like Shell have known for decades the disasters their fossil fuels would cause, but spent billions delaying climate action and funding misinformation to protect their business interests. As devastating events like these become more commonplace, its vital blame is put on the oily bosses who profit whilst our homes burn. Andy Warren, a London firefighter, said: Firefighters know that the increasingly frequent and destructive wildfires we face are the responsibility of the fossil fuel industry and its disregard for human life. These companies have known about the effects of their profiteering for decades and it is high time they were taken into public ownership and their profits used to fund a just green transition. No fire service in the world will be a match for the disasters that come if we carry on as we are.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:35:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/shell-protest-wildfires/
"AI seeks to profit from NHS data, with a little help from a 'Labour Friend of Israel'","Artificial intelligence (AI) profit-makers look set to get their hands on NHS data. And lobbying Labour Friends of Israel vice chair Peter Kyle probably played a role. Backdoor privatisation of the NHS is nothing new. Thatcherism paved the way, 2010s austerity made things worse, and then the Covid-19 pandemic helped to push things further. Now, with the economy predictably struggling under Keir Starmer's Tory continuity government, his neoliberal crack team have suggested that handing NHS and other data to AI companies could help to turn things around. In reality, however, it looks very much like corporate money and influence have triumphed again. Media outlets are currently asking questions like ""Has Rachel Reeves crashed the economy?"" and ""Why has Labour Failed So Badly on the Economy?"" The answer, says economist Richard Murphy, is that Reeves has made a conscious ideological choice to avoid the steps necessary to improve the economy. He is also doubtful that artificial intelligence is able to make a big difference without a fundamental shift in the government's positions. Nonetheless, the Times reported on 12 January that: the health service is set to make its archives of scans, biodata and anonymised patients records available for the first time to train the latest AI models. Ministers think their plans will ""attract billions of pounds of investment from American tech firms"". And the awful Peter Kyle, now secretary of state for Science, Innovation and Technology, compared AI development to ""the nuclear race"" of the 1940s and 50s. A lovely, hopeful image to place into our minds. Importantly, however, WeOwnIt founder Cat Hobbs asked: When did the British public give our permission or mandate to use OUR health data to make a profit for private companies? As the Guardian wrote, meanwhile, Starmer ""put concerns over privacy, disinformation and discrimination to one side"" when announcing the AI push. ""I don't think that we should have a defensive stance here"", he said. He would say that though, as a corporate crony who happily welcomed a dodgy donation of ""PS4m from [a] tax haven-based hedge fund with shares in oil and arms"", which also ""stood to profit"" from Israel's genocide in Gaza. The fund had invested, for example, in billionaire Israel and Trump fanboy Peter Thiel's spy tech company Palantir. You know, the pro-Israel company with ""deep ties to British and American security agencies"", access to our NHS data, and experience helping to smear progressives, back right-wing causes, and mistreat vulnerable people. Kate Brimsted from law firm Shoosmiths warned about ""the substantial data privacy, confidentiality and security challenges that accompany this initiative"". The Guardian has already reported on serious flaws with previous government uses of AI. But officials claim they'll ""take into account national security and ethical concerns"", just like they've 'taken into account' concerns about the genocide in Gaza while still participating in and legitimising it. AI companies' mission to profit from NHS and other data, however, needs government insiders. And while massive corporate donations from dodgy hedge funds helps, constant lobbying is key. And Peter Kyle is no stranger to lobbyists' hospitality. In 2024, openDemocracy reported on how: Hakluyt is a globally operating corporate strategy firm that advises some of the largest companies in the world across all sectors. It spun out of MI6 and despite attempts to shake off its reputation for remaining relatively 'close' to the intelligence services in the years since, it is still widely regarded as a retirement home for spies. It added that Hakluyt: forked out several thousand pounds to ferry... Kyle around San Francisco earlier this year. We know that Kyle sat down with senior figures at all the big silicon valley firms while he was there: Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, Open AI et al. On top of that, the firm ""arranged a secretive dinner for Kyle to meet with more influential people"". openDemocracy also called Kyle's role ""one of the most lobbyable briefs in government"". And in the run-up to the 2024 election (in which he lost thousands of votes partly over his support for Israel amid its genocide), he ""benefited from external support in his office... with the consultancy Public Digital providing a member of staff four days per week to support on policy"" and him benefiting ""one day per week from the expertise of a member of staff from Faculty AI"". The latter firm: co-authored a substantial policy report titled 'Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State'. The report was published with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change... The lobbying apparently worked. Because Kyle and his colleagues are now opening the door for AI profit-making in the NHS and beyond. Starmer's Labour is a disgrace. And as many on the left predicted, its corporate cronyism and the lack of a mass left-wing alternative has helped to make Reform UK the second most popular party in Britain, and a real contender for power in the next election. The need for the left to come together to present a strong front against the far right and its Tory-Labour enablers is more urgent than ever.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:40:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/labour-ai-policy/
People rally at the Old Bailey in support of the Palestine Action Filton 18,"Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them - and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the 'Filton 18' political prisoners have entered 'not guilty' pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel's largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including 'quadcopter' drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a 'terrorism connection'. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel's largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK's complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a ""terror connection"" in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates ""terrorism powers being misused"" to ""circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention"". The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison - including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.",Canary,2025-01-19T15:02:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/filton-18-trial/
Over 40 legal experts call for inquiry into Met handling of Palestine March - as its boss gets caught out,"Over 40 prominent UK legal scholars have condemned the actions of the Met Police in relation to Saturday 18 January's Palestine March in London in a letter to the home secretary. They have called the Met's approach to policing ""an abuse of police powers"" and called on the government repeal repressive legislation and defend the right to protest as a cornerstone of democracy. It comes as news has broken of the Met Police boss schmoozing with the pro-Zionist organisation the British Board of Deputies AFTER Saturday's march Events on Saturday at the national Palestine protest have drawn a wave of criticism from across the political and social spectrum towards the Metropolitan Police. The Met reneged on a previous agreement to allow a march from BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, a route taken several times before. It then sought to impose a route the pro-Israel Board of Deputies publicly claimed that it had proposed to the police. This was rejected by the Palestine Coalition organising group. Finally, the Met banned any alternative march route allowing only a rally in Whitehall. On the day there was a massive police presence, with police obstructing the gathering for the rally in many respects. There was an unusually high number of arrests of protestors. The chief steward who organises the demonstrations for the Palestine Coalition in discussion with police was violently arrested on the day, and with the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, subsequently charged with offences under the Public Order Act. It has emerged that the day after the protest the Met Police chief Mark Rowley addressed a meeting of the Board of Deputies in which he boasted he had ""used conditions on the protests more than we ever have done before"", and that his team imposed ""sharper and stronger conditions"" on the organisers of the demonstration. As Middle East Eye reported; The day after the rally, on Sunday, Rowley gave a speech at an event held by the pro-Israel Board of Deputies of British Jews, where he said that ""the powers to condition protests are quite limited - we've used conditions on the protests more than we ever have done before in terms of times, constraints, routes"". ""We have to take into account the Human Rights Act, that's what the law says, and of course the rights of all communities, the rights of protesters and freedom of speech, etc,"" Rowley said. The Board of Deputies supported Israel's war on Gaza and slammed the Labour government for imposing a partial arms embargo on Israel in September. It was also one of the groups that reportedly urged the Met to ban the pro-Palestine march's original route. Dr. Paul O'Connell, Reader in Law, SOAS University of London said: This letter is signed by over 40 leading lawyers and academics. People who, in one capacity or another, have worked on issues related to human rights and the rule of law for decades. It shows, in no uncertain terms, that these experts have the gravest of concerns about the policing of the PSC demonstration on 18 January 2025, and more generally about the assault on the right to protest in Britain. Freedom to assemble and protest is the very lifeblood of a democratic society. If people protesting the commission of a genocide in Gaza are not safe to do so, then it bodes ill for individual freedom and democratic life in Britain in the twenty-first century. The Home Secretary, and anyone else in a position of authority, has an obligation to act now, to make sure that the law and police tactics in Britain protect and facilitate the right to protest, as required by regional and international human rights treaties that Britain is a party to.",Canary,2025-01-21T16:55:41+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/met-police-palestine-march-inquiry/
A scathing new report on child poverty just shamed the Labour Party,"The UK government won't see progress on child poverty by the end of this parliament - even with high economic growth - if investment in social security does not form a part of its child poverty strategy. As the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) publishes its annual UK Poverty report, new analysis shows that under central OBR projections, only Scotland will see child poverty rates fall by 2029, demonstrating the power of social security policy in tackling poverty. In the central scenario, without further policy changes, by 2029: While the Scottish Government does appear to be making progress, it will remain some way off reaching its child poverty reduction targets without further action. JRF is also cautioning that children mustn't pay the price for the ups and downs in the economy. Any cuts to welfare spending are very likely to pull more families into poverty, as our social security system is already out of step with the costs families are facing. The leading annual barometer of poverty from the JRF finds that in the UK: The child poverty outlook across the four nations is shameful, with only Scotland showing some improvement JRF examined changes in child poverty levels between January 2025 and January 2029 based on different assumptions about the growth of the UK economy. If the UK economy grows in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast over the next 4 years, child poverty rates in Scotland, already lower than the rest of the UK, will fall further by 2029. This results in a difference of nearly 10 percentage points between Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2029, up from 7 percentage points in 2025. A strong economy can increase wages and employment but will not in itself reduce poverty. Even if the UK economy grows significantly more than expected, overall child poverty rates show little change and could even rise if growth benefits higher income households more than lower income ones. Specific, targeted policies are needed if child poverty rates are to come down. JRF analysis shows that none of the 9 English regions are likely to see a fall in child poverty between 2024 and 2029, with 5 regions modelled as having increases over the period and the remaining regions showing no change. In previous years, differences in child poverty rates across the UK nations were driven by lower average housing costs in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, JRF's latest analysis shows a similar reduction in poverty levels before housing costs are taken into account for children in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK. This strongly suggests that welfare policies, such as the Scottish Child Payment and mitigating the two-child limit from 2026, which boost the incomes of the parents of who receive them, are behind Scotland bucking the trend of rising child poverty rates elsewhere in the UK. The UK Government's child poverty strategy must abolish the two-child limit and introduce a protected minimum amount of support to Universal Credit. Later this year the UK Government will publish an 'ambitious' cross-government child poverty strategy. Any respectable child poverty strategy must include action on social security. Currently, our social security system doesn't reflect the cost of life's essentials as well as the reality that some families have higher costs or need to make one income stretch further, including larger families and lone parent families. These families are disproportionately impacted by specific welfare policies such as the two-child limit and the benefit cap. Along with abolishing the two-child limit, the UK Government must introduce a protected minimum amount of support below Universal Credit's current basic rate. This would restrict the amount that benefit payments can be reduced by the benefit cap. This would also represent a first step towards an Essentials Guarantee in Universal Credit, ensuring that everyone can afford essentials like food and household bills. Paul Kissack, Chief Executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: Growing levels of poverty and insecurity are acting as a tightening brake on growth and opportunity. We can't expect children to be ready for school or able to learn if they're going without the basics. Growing up in poverty can also lead to poor health, increasing pressure on the NHS. Child poverty will only be driven down through focused, deliberate and determined policy action. Even very strong economic growth won't automatically change the picture. Policy action must start with the system designed to help people meet their costs of living - social security. At the moment that system is not only failing to do its job but, worse, actively pushing some people into deeper poverty, through cruel limits and caps. The good news is that change - meaningful change to people's lives - is possible and can be achieved quickly. We know this from our recent history, and from different approaches across the UK. The British public believes that everyone should be able to afford the essentials. With its child poverty strategy later this year the Government has the opportunity to show it agrees. Any credible child poverty strategy must include policies that rebuild the tattered social security system. The wellbeing of millions of children depends on that. And so do the Government's wider ambitions for improved living standards and opportunity. JRF's annual UK Poverty report also finds that poverty rates in 2022/23 were broadly flat, remaining at a similar level to before the pandemic [9]: Responding to the report, Cllr Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: No child should ever grow up in poverty and this report underlines the urgency of the Government's Child Poverty Strategy. As this report confirms, the most effective way to support low-income families and lift them out of poverty is through an adequately resourced national safety net. This needs to be alongside sustainable long-term funding for vital local services provided by councils, such as advice services, local welfare assistance, housing and employment support.

Now British Palestinians have weighed in over the Met Police/Palestine march scandal,"A letter organised by the British Palestinian Committee, the largest umbrella organisation of Palestinian groups in this country, has expressed grave concern at Met policing of a pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January, which resulted in 77 arrests and charges under the Public Order being brought against organisers. The letter to the home secretary Yvette Cooper joins calls for an independent inquiry and the dropping of charges against those arrested. It adds to the demands from civil society organisations such as such as Liberty and Amnesty International UK for the repealing of repressive Public Order legislation. The letter says the issue has ""profound implications for the British Palestinian community and its ongoing struggle for justice"". Events on Saturday at the national Palestine protest have drawn a wave of criticism from across the political and social spectrum towards the Met Police. The Met reneged on a previous agreement to allow a march from BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, a route taken several times before. It then sought to impose a route the pro-Israel Board of Deputies publicly claimed that it had proposed to the police. This was rejected by the Palestine Coalition organising group. Finally, the Met banned any alternative march route allowing only a rally in Whitehall. On the day there was a massive police presence, with police obstructing the gathering for the rally in many respects. There was an unusually high number of arrests of protestors. The chief steward who organises the demonstrations for the Palestine Coalition in discussion with police was violently arrested on the day, and with the director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign subsequently charged with offences under the Public Order Act. Two MPs - Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell - who attended the protest have also been interviewed under caution by the police. BPC said that the British Palestinian community is disproportionately affected by restrictions on rights to protest, and ""the curtailment of these rights, combined with the policing of protests in a manner that appears politically motivated, not only undermines democratic freedoms but also silences voices advocating for justice and human rights"". Dr Sara Husseini, director of the BPC, said: The policing crackdown seen on 18th January sits in a wider context of criminalisation and repression of our community and those advocating for Palestinian rights in Britain. Palestinians in Britain have seen repeated and intensifying attacks on our ability to express ourselves, describe our history and experiences, and advocate for our inalienable rights. This is particularly egregious at a time when we have watched 15 months of Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza, for which our own government in Britain has provided continual, near unchecked, military, diplomatic and political support.",Canary,2025-01-28T11:36:21+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/british-palestinian-committee/
One in six UK workers skipping meals as cost of living crisis deepens under Labour,"A survey from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has found that more than one in six UK adults working full time or part time have had to skip meals to make ends meet. The figures come as workers have undergone the largest squeeze in real term pay since Napoleonic times. Real wage growth fell from between 2007-2019 by 0.2%. And it has only improved slightly since, with workers still worse off than they were from before the financial crash and the cost of living crisis continuing. The Labour Party's first budget failed to address the crisis through measures such as public ownership of essentials (including renewable energy), price controls on essentials and significant rebalancing wealth taxes. Switzerland has kept inflation much lower through its energy security and price controls. The country's electricity production is 60% from hydropower and 29% from nuclear. On top of that, the Swiss government has issued price controls on 30% of goods and services in the country. This shields its citizens from profiteering price hikes (greedflation) and international gas markets (fossilflation). In the budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves did increase capital gains tax. But she also boasted that we have still have the lowest rate of the G7. Proponents of an increased rate argue that people living off investments shouldn't pay less tax than those working. Equalising capital gains with income tax rates would rebalance the economy by a further PS12.7bn on top of the PS2.5bn from Labour's increase in the budget. The budget's improvements were piecemeal: Reeves also increased the minimum wage from PS11.44 to PS12.21 (a 6.7% rise) from April 2025. Workers have undergone the biggest hit to living standards since the 1950s. Food prices generally rose by 19% from March 2022 until March 2023. But some key foods such as pasta and vegetable oil are up by at least 60%. Indeed, in 2023, 61% of the poorest fifth of households reported cutting back on food. And the findings from the TUC umbrella group chime with this. While 17% of worker respondents (more than one in six) said they had skipped meals in the past three months, 8% said they skipped meals most days to make ends meet. Further, 24% said they made large or significant cut backs in food spending over the past year. And 31% of working adults said they never or only occasionally put the heating on. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak had positive things to say about Labour's Employee Rights Bill, currently at committee stage in parliament. The bill would ban zero hours contracts, among other measures. Nowak also said: After 14 years of Tory chaos and stagnation, we urgently need to boost living standards and to get more money into people's pockets. This is vital for workers and for local economies too",Canary,2025-01-13T20:30:31+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/cost-of-living-skipping-meals/
Palestine Action has a new company in its sights over Israel's genocide in Gaza,"Palestine Action Scotland targeted the offices of military parts manufacturer Parker Hannifin at its Glasgow production facility overnight on Monday 13 January, damaging the building and covering it in red paint, which it said was 'symbolic of the Palestinian blood on the hands of the company'. The building on Seaford Road South, which Parker Hannifin describes as a 'state-of-the-art production facility' for its Parker Pradifa technology division, had multiple windows smashed during the nighttime action. Its walls and signage, as well as the interior of the building, were sprayed with red paint: A Palestine Action Scotland spokesperson said the activists who carried out the direct action did so because Parker Hannifin is a supplier to Leonardo and other major weapons companies that make military products used by Israel's forces in its attacks on Gaza. Leonardo has extensive ties to the Israeli state and makes parts for Apache helicopters and targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, which have been used by Israel to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza, destroying homes and civilian infrastructure, and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Leonardo's site in Edinburgh has been targeted and shut down by activists multiple times since Israel's ongoing destruction of Gaza intensified in October 2023. Parker Hannifin itself has been involved in the design, development, testing and production of the F-35. Its fuel systems and components are used for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It provides systems for military helicopters and drones to companies including Leonardo Helicopters. Its products are designed to meet specialist military-ready specifications for use in missiles, ordnance and aircraft, as well as use in flight control systems, jet engines and landing gear. The action was the first time that activists in Scotland have targeted Parker Hannifin for its links to the destruction of Gaza, which is described as genocide in a case brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa and 11 other countries. An investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Palestine Action Scotland's spokesperson said: We are sickened that the continuing genocide is made possible by companies based in Scotland that are happy to profit by designing, making and selling products that result in the mass murder of Palestinian people in Gaza. Every company that chooses to be part of the supply chain to Israel's military, including Parker Hannifin, shares responsibility for and profits from the shredding of children's bodies in Gaza, and we will not rest until they cut all their connections to that chain of brutality. By carrying out this action, we intervened directly to disrupt the flow of technology that enables the ongoing genocide. Parker Hannifin has blood on its hands and will remain a target until it cuts its ties to complicit companies including Leonardo and stops supplying essential parts and materials without which apartheid Israel's weapons could not cause the horrors being committed every day against the Palestinian people. In taking this action, we have been inspired by and acted in solidarity with our friends and comrades in Gaza and throughout all of Palestine, from river to sea. We look forward to celebrating the liberation of Palestine with you in the near future.",Canary,2025-01-13T15:46:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-action-parker-hannifin/
Met Police under pressure as outcry increases over Palestine BBC protest ban,"Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and Coalition partners are today issuing a statement that reaffirms their determination to lead a protest at BBC headquarters in central London despite the efforts of the Met Police to prevent a March for Palestine which it previously agreed to in November 2024. Over the weekend a flurry of public figures have criticised the decision by the Met to use conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the protest at the BBC on Portland Place, on the grounds that this would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months of the Gaza genocide. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel's actions - including MPs, trade union leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 800 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of the march. PSC are calling on all those who support an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel's genocide in Gaza, as well as everyone who believes in the democratic right to protest, to join them in London at 12 noon on Saturday 18 January for the March for Palestine. The March for Palestine will assemble in Whitehall, which will allow people to form up in massive numbers in an orderly fashion, and then they will march towards the BBC. Organisers have written today to the Met Police seeking a meeting and asking them to work with them to ensure the march can proceed peacefully and finish with a protest outside the BBC. The groups call upon the Met to drop any restrictions which would prevent this. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said: Hundreds of thousands of people wish to continue to protest at our Government's ongoing complicity with Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people, which reports this week suggested may have killed tens of thousands more than the suggested figure of 46,000. They also wish to protest at the complicity of the BBC which has failed to report the facts of this genocide, as revealed in recent investigations. There are no legitimate grounds for the Police to impede our proposal to march from Whitehall to the BBC, finishing with a rally outside its HQ. We call upon the Met Police to make clear they will drop any conditions which will deny the right to protest as planned.",Canary,2025-01-13T21:04:11+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-march-18-january-bbc/
"McDonnell brands Treasury response to bond markets turbulence ""economically inept""","Former Labour Party shadow chancellor John McDonnell has denounced the Treasury for reportedly planning to use bond markets turbulence as an excuse to cut welfare: The issue is that the bond market itself attaches debt to the financing of public services in a form of corporate welfare. The gilt set up constrains government and functions as a tool for private finance to extract money from the public. This week, Reform MP Rupert Lowe tabled a bill to ban quantitative easing. He said: Our moral decline is clearly evident as true capitalism has been undermined by regular intervention, increasing state regulation and a growing, bloated and inefficient state Regulation often means the standards that uphold quality in society. And the idea the state is necessarily inefficient makes no sense, given public ownership of essential services brings down prices for people and businesses. It also helps control inflation through keeping pricing low on the essentials society needs, like water, energy (say, through a Green New Deal) and the internet. And it's inflation that is a key driver of the increase in price of government bonds. It's a merry-go-round of con artistry. Essentials are a risk free investment for the state to run (and can do in a way that's accountable to the people). That's because we aren't going to wake up one day and say we don't need water anymore or we're going to stop using electricity and live in caves. Lowe further described quantitative easing as a ""national ponzi scheme"". But what we have at present is that money is created when private banks issue loans to people. This is a system where we rent our money from private banks, rather than the state issuing it without interest. Money could be cost price, rather than effective usury. As the Bank of England explains on its website: Most of the money in the economy is created, not by printing presses at the central bank, but by banks when they provide loans... Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Positive Money, meanwhile, estimates that 97% of the money in the economy is created in this way. So, McDonnell was right to call out just how the Labour government is responding to the bond markets. Whether it listens or not remains to be seen.",Canary,2025-01-12T11:11:36+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/12/bond-markets/
Corbyn pushes government on RAF base's role in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"On 8 January 2025, independent MP Jeremy Corbyn pushed Keir Starmer's government for transparency on the role that a strategically important RAF base is playing in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. The previous day, Corbyn described in his letter that foreign office parliamentary under-secretary Hamish Falconer had responded to a question of his ""during an Urgent Question on Northern Gaza"". And the former Labour Party leader said Falconer had ""failed to answer or acknowledge my question on the use of the British air base in Cyprus, RAF Akrotiri"". He insisted that: My constituents deserve to know the full scale of this government's complicity and participation in genocide. With this in mind, Corbyn asked for clarification on three important follow-up questions: 3. Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be deployed in Gaza? 4. How many US Air Force flights have flown from RAF Akrotiri to Israel since 7 October 2023? 5. Has your government sought legal advice over the continued use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israeli military operations? And he warned the government to be careful with its actions for legal reasons: Your government will be aware that the ICC has issued arrest warrants to Israeli officials. The government should also be aware that if it knowingly sends weapons to a government whose leader is wanted for war crimes, then it is not immune to the long arm of international law. He was referring to the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issuing arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's former defence minister Yoav Gallant back in November 2024. Both the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government have used RAF Akrotiri (the unique colonial relic on occupied Cypriot land which is part of the ""largest Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom"") to lend a helping hand to Israeli war criminals. So far, RAF Akrotiri has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. And as Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of ""a country which is participating"" in Israel's genocide - ""a direct participant"". Corbyn's original question, that Falconer failed to answer properly, was: Will Britain continue supplying weapons, including parts for jet planes, and allowing the use of RAF Akrotiri as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be used to destroy life in Gaza? And that's a question that everyone in the country should be asking their MPs regularly and repeatedly until British participation in the genocide ends.",Canary,2025-01-09T10:10:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/corbyn-raf-akrotiri/
The swans are back at Sadler's Wells - but they're not Tchaikovsky's,"Fossil Free London activists disrupted the closing performance of Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake at Sadler's Wells on Sunday 26 January, to urge the theatre to cut ties with Barclays over the bank's funding of fossil fuels and arms. The demonstration began with 10 protesters dressed in Swan Lake costumes staging a ""die-in"" outside the theatre, accompanied by a cellist: The protesters fell to the ground next to a banner that read, ""Barclays Funds Bombs and Big Oil"". Meanwhile, leaflets explaining the protest were distributed to theatregoers. Just before the show began; a large banner was unfurled from a second-floor balcony inside the building, reading ""Drop Barclays"": Security escorted the campaigners out of the building: Barclays is a major sponsor of Sadler's Wells. The chair of the Sadler's Wells board of trustees, Nigel Higgins, also serves as the chairman of Barclays. Since the 2016 Paris Agreement, Barclays has been Europe's biggest financier of fossil fuels. They channel vast sums of money to oil giants like Shell and BP, whose continued expansion of fossil fuel production drives us ever closer to climate collapse. Furthermore, a 2024 investigation revealed Barclays invests over PS2 billion in shares, and provides loans and underwriting worth PS6.1 billion, to companies whose weapons, components and military technology have been used in Israel's attacks on Palestinians. Fossil Free London performed a similar stunt at Sadler's Wells in December 2024. Joanna Warrington, a Fossil Free London spokesperson said: It's time for Sadler's Wells to stop dancing around this issue, and stop partnering with Barclays. A bank that fuels genocide and climate breakdown. For as long as they do so, they're complicit in the devastating extreme weather events and untold violence we're seeing strewn across the news daily. Because, thanks to Sadler's Wells' cultural power, this sponsorship enables Barclays to hide behind a facade of corporate responsibility. All whilst they continue to bankroll industries that kill. It's time Sadler's Wells took a stand against the oily financiers set on destroying everything we love, all to line their pockets.",Canary,2025-01-27T14:32:05+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/swan-lake-sadlers-wells-protest/
Cops try to disrupt a Palestine Action meeting - just as the group target Elbit director's business,"Palestine Action targeted the new London premises of an Elbit Director's consultancy firm, Eagle Strategic Consulting Limited, on Tuesday 14 January. However, at the same time in Bristol cops were 'visiting' the venue where a group meeting is being held in Bristol. Coincidence? Palestine Action activists shattered the windows and sprayed the company's new London address in red paint to symbolise the company's continued complicity in Palestinian bloodshed: Eagle Strategic acts as a consultancy firm for weapons manufacturers and is wholly owned by Richard Applegate, the former Chairman and current 'head of strategy and new business' for Israeli weapons firm Elbit Systems UK. This is the second time his lobbying company have been targeted by the direct action network, with Palestine Action shattering windows and spray painting the building of the Dorset premises in March 2024. Applegate has a long history of lobbying for the Israeli arms company, previously boasting about pulling off a covert political lobbying campaign which secured a PS500m from the MOD, by ensuring his ""fingerprints weren't over any of it"". He was caught by journalists admitting that he had applied pressure by ""infecting"" the system at ""every level"". According to Israeli media, Elbit provides up to 80% of the Israeli military's land based military equipment and 85% of its military drones. It supplies vast numbers of munitions and missiles - including the 'Iron Sting' recently developed and deployed for the first time in the 2023-2024 Genocide in Gaza, along with wide categories of surveillance technologies, targeting systems, and innumerate other armaments. Meanwhile, as Palestine Action posted, cops visited the People's Republic of Stokes Croft; a venue that is hosting a meeting of the group: Called ""Smashing the genocide-industrial complex"", the meeting will look at what activists can learn ""about effective direct action from the courageous efforts of Palestine Action?"". No wonder the cops weren't happy. The venue and the group refused to be intimidated, however, and the meeting is due to go ahead as planned. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We remain committed to targeting all firms and associations which enable Israel's weapons trade to continue fuelling genocide. There is no space for war criminals on our streets and those responsible for mass murder must be held accountable. Applegate can't hide behind his consulting firm and changing its premise doesn't change a thing. We've hit Eagle Strategic before, we'll hit them again and we'll keep taking action until we've shut down Elbit Systems for good.",Canary,2025-01-14T15:34:58+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/palestine-action-eagle-strategic/
Corbyn and McDonnell leave police station after being INTERVIEWED UNDER CAUTION by Met,"Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have been interviewed under caution by the Met Police. It was over the force's alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met - accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media - 'doorstopping' the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn's response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police's actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel's genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours' notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day - notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children's marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers - including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures - would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines - the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, 'please filter through.' When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation - a maximum of 25 people - be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to 'pass this up the line for a decision.' While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police's actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.",Canary,2025-01-19T17:21:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-mcdonnell-met-police/
£18m in compensation to rape survivors in ONE YEAR - yet charging rates still at 5%,"The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) has paid out more than PS18m in compensation to survivors in the last year. Yet of the hundreds and thousands of rape and sexual offences reported to UK police forces in the last year, an average of 5% resulted in a charge, a new investigation has revealed. This is no improvement on previous figures. It comes as minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls Jess Phillips says survivors are being ""let down time and time again"". New data obtained by Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice (SACA) has revealed that between September 2023 and 2024, a total of 189,774 offences were reported to police forces across the UK but just 9,093 resulted in a charge - averaging around 5%. While there will be cases that may be still under investigation or where some other resolution has been reached, Sexual Abuse Claims Specialist, Ellie Lamey says it is ""staggeringly low"" and ""it is important survivors know that support is available"". 31 out of 43 UK police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request in full within the deadline. The highest number of rape or sexual offences by far were reported to Greater Manchester Police, of which there were 56,428 in the year up to September 2024. Of those, 3,723 resulted in a charge or summons, according to the force's figures. London's Met Police recorded the second-highest number of offences, standing at 27,213 with 1,415 resulting in a charge or summons. Out of 31 forces across England and Wales, 97% revealed that the most common age group for rape and sexual offence survivors and victims in the last year was under 18 years: The latest figures from the Home Office show nearly 1.9m violent or sexual crimes in England and Wales were closed without a suspect being caught or charged in the year to June 2024 - about 89% of all offences given an outcome. Minister Jess Phillips said: It is completely unacceptable that fewer and fewer violent and sexual crimes are being solved, with more victims being let down time and time again. The severity of these numbers prove why violence against women and girls is a national emergency and that is why we have set out our unprecedented mission to halve it in a decade. Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice also obtained new data from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) - which is a government-backed organisation that can offer compensation to survivors of sexual abuse. In the last year, the CICA received 13,313 applications from victims and survivors of sexual assault or abuse. Of those, 1,763 received compensation - that's just 13%. CICA Specialist at SACA, Ellie Lamey said: The number of sexual assault/abuse victims who have applied for CIC is staggeringly low compared to the number of offences being reported to police forces across the UK. This, along with mammoth delays in the court system and the early release of prisoners is, of course, hugely concerning for survivors: SACA's investigation also uncovered the main reasons why survivors are rejected by the CICA. It is obvious the blame is put onto victims and survivors. The main reasons were: In the last year, the organisation paid out compensation totalling PS18,463,509.85 to victims and survivors of sexual abuse - that's an average payout of PS10,472.77 per claimant. Lamey added: It is so important that victims know there is support available for them and not to be deterred or fearful of rejection. Victims should be aware that they can report historical periods of abuse/assaults to the police, regardless of the amount of time that has passed. Victims can avoid rejections by ensuring they fully cooperate with the police in bringing the assailant to justice as well as seeking appropriate medical attention regarding any physical or psychological injuries sustained from the assault they are a victim of. CICA data from 2020-2022 shows that 18 per cent of applications are submitted outside of the two-year time limit, and of these 61% went on to receive an award. With relevant evidence, we can provide exceptional circumstances that have contributed to the delay in a victim submitting an application. Sexual Abuse Compensation Advice (SACA) offers a specialist service for anyone looking for support and advice after being affected by rape or sexual assault. They operate a 24-hour helpline and live chat service which you can access on their website.",Canary,2025-01-23T15:01:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694203
Just Stop Oil take bold action - because Darwin would be turning in his grave,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted Charles Darwin's grave to demand that the UK government works with others to phase out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. At around 9:30am on Monday 13 January, two Just Stop Oil supporters entered Westminster Abbey and proceeded to use spray chalk to write '1.5 Is Dead' on Charles Darwin's grave: This was referencing the news that the world has exceeded the 'safe' 1.5 degree warming limit agreed by world leaders in Paris in 2015. The supporters could be heard saying ""2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. Millions are being displaced, California is on fire and we have lost three quarters of all wildlife since the 1970's. Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The government's plans will take us to over 3 degrees of warming. This will destroy everything we love. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030"": One of those taking action was Alyson Lee who said: Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we have already exceeded the so-called safe temperature rise of 1.5 degrees, and are heading for over 3 degrees of warming. This rapidly accelerating crisis means huge parts of the world will become unable to support life, resulting in millions of refugees, social collapse and extinction for countless species."" Despite lots of fine words from international leaders, emissions are still rising. Without real action, words are useless, you cannot negotiate with the laws of physics. We need mass civil disobedience now, join us on the streets and help us reclaim parliament this April. Also taking action was Di Bligh who stated: Darwin once said- 'It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works cooperatively against common threats. Last year was the hottest since modern humans evolved. If we do not work together to reign in the corporations and billionaires driving us beyond our means, humanity will not be able to adapt to what is coming. We are on course to lose everything, and politicians are doing nowhere near enough to prevent it. How many will we have to bury as a result of climate breakdown and who will be left to mourn them? Just Stop Oil's action came as the death toll rises to 24 in California, as fires continue to rip across the state. The fires have been driven by climate breakdown after decades of drought, followed by rapid swings between extreme wet and dry conditions in the past two years. This has created large areas of 'tinder dry' vegetation, creating the perfect conditions for uncontrollable wildfires. Meanwhile, the Copernicus Climate Change Service has confirmed that 2024 was the first year on record with a global average temperature exceeding 1.5degC above pre-industrial levels. All continents except Australasia and Antarctica experienced their hottest year on record, with 11 months of the year exceeding the 1.5degC level. All ten of the hottest years on record have fallen within the last decade. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again this April.

Met Police just BLOCKED a pro-Palestine protest from marching outside the BBC,"Today (Wednesday 8 January) the Palestine Coalition have been informed by the Met Police that they intend to go back on a previous agreement and impose conditions to prevent us marching from BBC HQ at Portland Place on Saturday 18 January. We have already announced our intention to assemble outside the BBC to protest against the pro-Israel bias of its coverage - something recently highlighted in a detailed report by journalist Owen Jones to which the Corporation has so far not responded. We utterly condemn this attempt to use repressive powers to prevent our planned protest at the BBC. The route for the march was confirmed with the police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police has now reneged on our agreement and stated its intention to prevent our protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution - it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. It is unacceptable for the police to misuse public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that our march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue. It follows representations from pro-Israel groups and activists who have been publicly calling for action to be taken to curtail our right to protest against Israel's ongoing genocide. This includes the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis who has openly celebrated the horrific and criminal actions of the Israeli military in Gaza, describing them as the ""most outstanding possible thing that a decent responsible country can do"". In fact, the closest synagogue to the BBC is not even on the route of the march. Moreover, as the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that our marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that every march has been joined by thousands of Jewish people - many in an organised Jewish bloc - and addressed by Jewish speakers on the demonstration platforms. Representatives of the Jewish bloc have written to the police seeking a meeting to express their concerns that the police are choosing to listen solely to pro-Israel Jewish voices, but they have not had any response. We firmly reject any attempt to suppress our right to campaign for an end to Israel's genocidal violence and decades long violations of the rights of the Palestinian people. In the past few weeks, Israel has intensified its indiscriminate attacks including against hospitals and civilians sheltering in so-called 'humanitarian safe zones.' It is this and the ongoing complicity of the British government in these crimes that continues to bring people onto the streets in huge numbers. Our marches represent a diverse cross section of the public including the Palestinian community, many of whom are relatives of those killed by Israel. We remain in dialogue with the Metropolitan Police but call on them to immediately abandon their intention to prevent our protest at the BBC. We call on all those who are rightly outraged by Israel's ongoing genocide and those who uphold the democratic right to protest to join us when we march in London on Saturday 18 January.

REVEALED: MSM disproportionately targets mental health-related DWP claimants in attack articles,"Disabled people living with mental health conditions came on the receiving end of an exponential surge in corporate media attacks against benefit claimants in 2024. Across the year, the right-wing press cranked up its concerted campaign to vilify chronically ill and disabled claimants more than eleven-fold. But significantly, over half of this coverage featured references to mental health as a leading factor in the recent post-pandemic-height rise in claims. Of course, the substantial uptick in attention on claimants with mental health conditions could have devastating ramifications in the real world. The Canary's analysis comes amidst ""senior government"" sources tipping off the Telegraph that Labour Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ministers plan to proceed with some iteration of the former Conservative government's brutal Personal Independence Payment (PIP) reforms. Already then, this media-manufactured outrage is serving as a convenient pretext for the Labour government to unleash an ideological swathe of new austerity assaults to the welfare system. It's all a crucial reminder of how the right-wing manoeuvres to single out disabled demographics as undeserving of social security support. The Canary unveiled that in 2024, the corporate media enormously ramped up its scapegoating of disability benefit claimants. Specifically, coverage of disability benefits in the Telegraph, the Times, and the Daily Mail together sky-rocketed more than 1130% from 2023's output. But notably, the Canary's research also found that the three outlets had certain marginalised demographics in their sights in particular. The outlets honed in on mental health within the context of disability benefits and unemployment specifically in at least 23 articles (7.7%). In total, the three outlets put out 147 articles either focusing on mental health and disability benefits, or mentioning the two. Notably, the Canary only included articles that did so in a way that made a connection between the two, or at minimum implied it. It meant that nearly half the articles in the Canary's data drew attention to mental health in the context of disability benefit claims and unemployment. They published the majority of these - 135 - in 2024 alone. What's more, they weren't the only marginalised group the mainstream hate-merchants put in the firing line for benefit clampdowns either. Neurodivergent stigma featured heavily across the corporate outlets' output too - again showing a marked increase in 2024. Articles attributed the rise in disability benefit claims to the increase in claims from autistic people, and people with ADHD. There were 19 pieces (6.4%) that specifically focused on these in the three outlets' coverage. All but one of these they wrote in 2024. Neurodivergence and the connection to disability benefits cropped up across 39 articles within our analysis time-frame all told (13.1%). The Telegraph published just two of these in 2023, while neither the Times nor the Daily Mail linked these in articles before 2024. The results offer more proof - if we needed it - that the right-wing press and government have a blatant joined-up agenda to strip disabled people of their benefits wherever they can whip up politically-motivated moral panic. Where mental health was concerned, a clear narrative emerged. Specifically, the outlets visibly capitalised on the Covid pandemic's psychological fallout. In particular, they visibly did so to prey on claimants with mental health conditions. Articles frequently posited pandemic lockdowns and school closures as a key factor in the surge of mental health problems among young people. Naturally, the right-wing press has been quick to condemn Covid protection measures that helped to shield more clinically vulnerable populations at the height of the pandemic. A Times article in January 2024 proclaimed that: The effect of lockdown and school closures on the mental health of young people has also meant more need help with everyday life, officials believe By contrast, as for the trauma of living through a global deadly and disabling pandemic, it was tumbleweed from the trio. So between them, outlets simultaneously blamed protections that were vital for keeping chronically ill and disabled people safe, while at the same time managing to punch down on people psychologically disabled by the pandemic. Of course, leave it to the right-wing foghorns to deal a double-blow of ableism in one. However, more than this, it's patently clear that the aim was to invalidate new cases of mental health diagnoses. The Canary's data uncovered a chicken-and-egg style dance between the corporate media and halls of power. We identified how conversations on mental health and disability benefits first appeared noticeably in January 2023. Then, in September 2023, then DWP boss Mel Stride announced proposals for a dangerous tightening of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Notably, this included honing in on mental health claimants. Significantly, the Tories' response to the consultation stated how the government would: specify the circumstances, and physical and mental health conditions, for which LCWRA [limited capability for work-related activity] Substantial Risk should apply. In other words, the DWP will decide who this descriptor will apply to going forward. Or, in short, it will obviously move the goalposts to exclude many people living with mental health conditions. Up to that point in September, we had found at least seven articles that disparaged the rise in mental health-related claims. Of course, we can't say for certain that these shaped the government's thinking. However, it seems no coincidence that right-wing talking heads had been harping on about it not long before it took root in the establishment echo-chambers of Westminster. Arguably, timing is everything where the corporate press treads. So, it was also no mistake that it started stepping up its vitriol against claimants with mental health conditions in 2024 either. In other words, the Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail planted the seed in the public consciousness. Policy-makers took up this convenient narrative and scapegoat. And on the merry-go-round of client media revolving door politics continued. It's easy to see how the corporate media fear-mongering then paved the way for politicians making a political football out of disabled people with mental health conditions. In fact, the Canary's data helped plot a notable timeline of this very development as well. Between January and the end of March 2024, the three posted a flurry of articles that directly honed in on this connection: Cue, a disgusting diatribe from Stride. On 20 March, he opined to the Telegraph on all things stereotyping and stigmatising mental health. He made classic bogus contention of work as a health outcome, claiming that: we seem to have forgotten that work is good for mental health If that weren't bad enough, Stride took to the dismissive and downright despicable diminishing of people's mental health. He derided it as the ""normal ups and downs of human life"" and a case of people ""feeling rather down and bluesy"". The corporate media had been banging on about all this so vehemently, that it gave Stride the perfect ready-made justification for his atrocious claims. And that of course was the entire point. It should therefore come as little surprise that the Tory government followed this up with a raft of ludicrous welfare reform proposals too. Less surprising still: that people with mental health conditions were a particular target. In April 2024, the Tories launched their toxic proposals for changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP). As with the WCA changes, this would also legislate to shut people with mental health conditions out from the disability benefits system. Naturally though, it wasn't the end of it when Labour took to the helm either. Unsurprisingly, Labour's DWP chief hate-hawker Liz Kendall has certainly been living up to her arch-right-wing ideology. While she made a big song and dance that she wasn't jumping on her predecessor's ""bluesy"" bandwagon - she basically did anyway. In November, she suggested that ""self-diagnosed"" mental health had contributed to the rise in people unable to work. So, that would be: people unable to access underfunded mental health diagnosis services then? What's more, it was all wrapped up in a grandstanding over sanction threats, naturally. However, more than her disgraceful diatribes, she has gone pedal to the metal on policy-making as well. For instance, job coaches in more mental health settings is one example of Labour amping up this hostile offensive. Moreover, lo and behold, Labour appears to now be mulling some of these PIP reforms too. And if it seems a little too on the nose that anonymous ""senior government"" sources were spilling the tea to the Telegraph, it really shouldn't. This is what the client media do best. The DWP is scratching the Telegraph's back with an insider tip off. Conversely, the dutiful mouthpiece is doing the government's dirty work, in preemptively announcing it. A shameless PR-type move to lessen the reputational blow this Spring? It seems highly plausible. The dataset also reinforced the fact that it has been a similar story for neurodivergent claimants. The first piece the Canary found goading the link was a Telegraph article in August 2023 titled: Number of children on disability benefit jumps after surge in ADHD and autism cases Of course, many of the articles revolved around this bogus notion the right-wing scapegoat-mongers have been spouting. Specifically, this is that healthcare professionals are over-diagnosing people with ADHD and autism. Naturally, the implication in the coverage seems to be that autistic people, and people with ADHD shouldn't be claiming disability benefits either. Broadly, the articles are also suggesting that many have been wrongly diagnosed, and ergo again, should not be eligible to claim disability-based social support. The Canary's Rachel Charlton-Dailey has been documenting this. In August, she debunked one of these shameful tirades. And notably, the article was emblematic of the broader discourse at play across the Canary's dataset. For one, it had all the hallmarks of the most classic ableist tropes around neurodivergence. Overdiagnosis made its cameo appearance, as did a sweep of antiquated terms which Charlton-Dailey incisively pointed out the outlet had used to ""delegitimise the conditions"". Significantly though, it was the Telegraph's deployment of misleading statistics to underpin its nonsense claims that was most characteristic of the articles in our dataset. In its case, it made a number of deliberate categorical conflations to misrepresent the figures. Charlton-Dailey explained that: Despite linking the two and putting the main total of 730,000 kids with DLA - much, much further down, the article itself explains that less than half of claims (337,000) were for ""neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and Asperger's syndrome"". They then pulled out that 72,500 kids claimed benefits for ""hyperkinetic syndrome - also known as ADHD"", despite making it sound like a separate figure this will have actually gone in with the 337k. Separately, Fullfact also eviscerated the statistical claims of the piece. The article (still) claims that: The number of parents claiming disability benefits for children with conditions such as ADHD and autism has surged by 200,000 since lockdown, new figures reveal. However, this simply isn't true. As Fullfact detailed, that increase instead: refers to the total increase in DLA claims for under-18s, rather than only those related to ADHD and autism. Naturally, there were other problematic parts of the article too. But the bottom line was that it was using inaccurate, manipulated figures to make neurodivergent claimants a target of public acrimony. In reality, neurodivergent claimants actually made up a small fraction of the overall increases. Not that it should matter anyway. Regardless, it hasn't stopped outlet's spewing a slew of headlines all making the same bogus over-egged connection. Other shitty takes on neurodivergent disability claims? What the Times outlandishly branded ""a new industry"" of ""disability influencers"". It tracks that the ableist bigot soapbox would frame a community of disabled people helping other disabled people with the notoriously inaccessible disability benefits process, in this egregiously derogatory way. The bullshit insinuation is of course that neurodivergent people are gaming the system - go figure. And like with the media fanfare over mental health claims, politicians haven't passed up the opportunity to pounce on all this either. Amidst his vile comments on mental health in April, Stride also questioned whether people with ADHD and learning disabled people should be entitled to disability benefits. Predictably, the right-wing outlets have continued with all this in 2025. Less than two weeks in, and establishment shill the Telegraph was platforming former New Labour prime minister Tony Blair's odious warnings to the government on mental health. He revived the ghost of DWP Tory past, parroting Stride's facetious ""ups and downs"" of life drivel. In tandem, Kendall's self-diagnosis claims made a cameo appearance. Once again, it perfectly illustrated how indistinguishable Labour's welfare rhetoric is from the Tories. Ultimately, disabled people know all too well where corporate media scapegoating leads. This latest maligning of mental health and neurodivergence is invariably a warning signal for the next round of callous cuts and reforms. Of course, they won't be the only demographics in line for this. The Canary has documented how it's part of a broader-scale attack on disabled claimants en masse. We don't know the details of what Labour has in store yet this Spring. However, all chatter from the government so far points in the direction of some form of the dangerous WCA and PIP reforms. What is clear is that if it takes its cue from the corporate media's crackdown circus, it will spell more misery and harm for neurodivergent folks and disabled people with mental health conditions alike.",Canary,2025-01-13T12:07:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/msm-mental-health-dwp/
Landlords banked £56.2bn in rent from young people in ONE year. We need to end the scam immediately.,"People under 45 are paying 66% of all rent in Britain. This amounted to a record PS56.2bn for 2024, according to research from housing agents Hamptons. The total amount of rent paid by under 45s has increased by a startling 59% over the past decade, reflecting eye-watering price increases as much as additional renters. The thing is, landlords do not provide housing. They simply set up an extortionate toll gate between people and shelter. They middle-man between us and builders in an atmosphere of artificial scarcity. Instead, the state should provide housing at cost price for people, paid back in affordably monthly sums. This would pop the housing bubble, bringing down the price of housing across the board. From 1995 to 2020, the 'value' of UK housing wealth increased from PS1 trillion to PS5.7 trillion. What's ridiculous is that banks create new money to fund large mortgages that, in turn, inflate the price of housing. According to the Office of National Statistics, average UK private rents increased by 9.1% in the year up until November 2024. The Bank of England raised interest rates in response to the inflation crisis, which is partly caused by our lack of a Green New Deal for energy and lack of price controls or public ownership for essentials. Higher mortgage rates mean even less people can afford to buy a home a home, contributing to the number of under 45s renting rising by 149,000 to 3,4 million last year. Indeed, prices are so expensive that as of 2022, homes cost as much - relative to average earnings - as they did in 1876. So we have a situation where under 45s are wasting PS56.2bn in passive income for landlords in a single year. That's income that could be invested into home and land ownership for citizens under a state issued plan. The huge private landlord robbery also leads to a high benefits bill. The British state pays 88% (or PS26.8bn) of the housing budget on subsidising landlords with either legacy housing benefit or the housing element of universal credit. The Labour government has pledged to build 1.5 million new homes during this parliament. But chancellor Rachel Reeves has also said that they aren't going to spend any public money doing this. So it remains to be seen how many will be affordable, social housing. Another issue is worker shortages in the construction industry. For one, the Home Builders Federation (HBF) has said that the UK ""does not have a sufficient talent pipeline"" of builders to meet the goal. Therefore, it is likely the problem of private landlords extorting their tenants is not going anywhere anytime soon.",Canary,2025-01-22T10:17:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/landlords-banked-56-2bn-in-rent-from-young-people-in-one-year-we-need-to-end-the-scam-immediately/
Green Party politicians rally behind people arrested at Saturday's pro-Palestine march,"Two Green Party politicians have hit back at the Met Police over the arrests of peaceful protesters on Saturday 18 January at the Palestine March in London. Following this weekend's disgraceful policing tactics from the Met Police against protestors organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) to urge the British government to stop arming Israel, Green Party London Assembly Member Zoe Garbett issued the following statement: ""I'm outraged at the way the Met handled this weekend's protest. Policing is about choices, and it was the Met's choice to arrest peaceful protestors at such unnecessarily high rates. ""The Met cannot have it both ways: repeatedly changing where and how protests can occur, arresting people for breaching overly complex protest restrictions, and posting misleading public statements after the fact is not the way to facilitate protest. ""The Met complains when protest groups don't engage with them, yet when groups like Palestine Solidarity Campaign do work with them in good faith, it seems the Met can't do the same. ""I plan to confront the Met Commissioner directly over this weekend's events the next time he sits before the Assembly. Londoners deserve to know exactly who their police officers are protecting and serving."" Meanwhile, deputy Green Party leader and AM Zack Polanski wrote to home secretary Yvette Cooper. He said the following: ""I am a London Assembly member who attended and spoke at the peaceful Palestine Solidarity rally this weekend. ""The police were informed of our intention to protest against the decision to ban the march to the BBC. It was announced that a small delegation would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC and lay flowers to commemorate the deceased if and when we were stopped by the police. Among our group were parliamentarians Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, along with many community organisations. ""As shown in many videos, police had agreed through negotiation that the delegation could pass through and lay flowers. However, they subsequently allowed a much larger group into Trafalgar Square. It is concerning to see Metropolitan Police tweets falsely stating that people were ""forcing through."" ""Such language feeds false and often racist narratives about the Palestine Solidarity Campaign's protests that have been peaceful. ""I'm also disturbed by your own communications suggesting there was an intention to disrupt a synagogue. Many Jewish participants, including myself, find this accusation offensive. The goal was to protest the BBC's failure to report the genocide accurately, and this was planned quite some distance from the synagogue and way after services had ended. ""Public trust in our institutions is already fragile. Politicising the police and smearing innocent people only worsens this. I urge you to review the evidence including footage from body worn cameras from the event, retract your comments and clarify the situation with the Metropolitan Police.",Canary,2025-01-21T13:45:35+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/met-police-palestine-march/
Badenoch's 'pupil improvements' claim at PMQs was actually from fiddled figures,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said: The OECD found children in England rose up global league tables in maths, reading and science. Conservative government action means English schools now top the Western world But a University College London (UCL) study found ""serious flaws"" in the government's education statistics. The OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) data compares attainment by 15 year old pupils across developed countries. UCL found that in the UK for 2018 about 40% of students were not included in the statistics. This could result in those with lower attainment being excluded from the data, given freedom of information requests by UCL showed schools with lower grades were less likely to participate in the study. Badenoch and Starmer both argued at PMQs that vast academisation has improved standards. Starmer said: Mr Speaker, it was Labour that introduced academies in the first place to drive up standards In 2010, around 6% of secondary schools were academies. Now 81.9% of secondaries are academies, along with 42.7% of primary schools. But, in another study, UCL found no educational improvement as a result of children attending multi-academy chains. And an Education Policy Institute (EPI) report found that academy chains are ""over-represented in the lowest performing groups"" for primary schools. It's no wonder the National Education Union (NEU) are against academisation. When it comes to GCSEs, the results have slumped to 2010 levels, underscoring the idea that academisation has driven up standards is misplaced. One issue with academies is the 'top slicing' of excessive executive pay, funded by the public purse. 44 academy trust CEOs now earn more than PS200,000 per year in what resembles the corporate sector. That's wage rises of up to 50% in five years. Whereas, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. From 2010 to 2016, schools could become academies if they 'voluntarily chose to'. But this choice is not as voluntary as was made out. From 2010, the Tory government cut the education budget by 25% over four years. At the same time, they told schools that they will award them PS25,000 and increase their budget by up to 10% if they become academies. Thus, schools do not choose to become academies because they believe they are better, but to survive arbitrary austerity conditions imposed by the government. The Tories then mandated the transition to academies in 2016. There's no evidence it has improved anything (and some to the contrary).",Canary,2025-01-22T20:43:56+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/pmqs-22-january/
13 Holocaust survivors and descendants slam Met Police over Palestine demo ban at BBC,"Thirteen Holocaust survivors and survivor descendants have just signed a joint letter protesting against the Met Police's plans to prevent the next Palestine march from gathering outside the BBC headquarters on 18 January. As survivors of the Jewish genocide, or descendants of such survivors, the 13 say they are in despair at the UK government's complicity in Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. This is especially the case when this same government intends to commemorate other genocides - including that of the group's Jewish relatives - on Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. How any politician can commemorate past genocides while openly supporting an ongoing genocide is something future historians will study with horror and disbelief. But this just makes it all the more important for those of us who oppose all genocides to continue to protest. Naturally, the government and other supporters of Israeli crimes want to discredit and suppress our protests. Having run out of other arguments, they can only resort to claims that people's demonstrations are somehow antisemitic. As survivors and survivor descendants, the 13 individuals say they take antisemitism extremely seriously. Consequently, they would always make sure of their facts before accusing anyone of antisemitism. Unfortunately, many supporters of Israel are rarely so careful and they routinely accuse anyone they disagree with of antisemitism without any evidence. Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos spoke at a Palestine rally in Hyde Park in April: Note the respect with which the crowd listens to Stephen. This is not the sort of crowd that would ever chant the horrible phrase 'genocide of Jews' - yet this is the sort of completely unsubstantiated claim that the right-wing press are resorting too in order to have Palestine demos banned. The 13 also took part in a previous Palestine demo near the BBC headquarters on 18 May: The BBC also broadcast interviews with them there on that day and their journalists will have witnessed the overwhelmingly warm reception from the crowd. The letter from the 13 reads in full as follows: The Metropolitan police intend to ban the 18 January Palestine march from the area around the BBC headquarters in Portland Place in London. Their excuse is that Jewish attendees at a synagogue that is well away from the march route will suffer 'disruption' of their religious worship. We are writing as Jewish Holocaust survivors, and descendants of survivors, to protest against this clear attempt to dissuade people from opposing the Gaza genocide. Along with thousands of other openly Jewish protesters, we have attended numerous Palestine demos in London and have received nothing but support and warmth from our fellow demonstrators. To suggest that the 18 January march is a threat to Jews, or is in any way antisemitic, is simply a fabrication in order to restrict everyone's right to protest.

It's obvious why Keir Starmer brushed off a question on toxic political donations at PMQs,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on 8 January, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey questioned the prime minister on party donations: While the honourable member for Clacton may miss out on his big allowance from Elon Musk, the spectre of the richest man in the world trying to buy a British political party should give us all pause for thought. And after years of the Conservatives taking millions of pounds of Russian money, will the prime minister now work with us to bring in long overdue reforms of party funding. So that power in this country lies with the voters and not wealthy overseas oligarchs. Musk is reportedly considering a donation of up to $100m to Reform, although he has now called for its leader Nigel Farage to resign over a disagreement about far-right fascist Tommy Robinson. The thing is, at PMQs Keir Starmer shrugged off the pressing issue of rich people buying our politics, saying: I think we all had a smile... when the honourable member said how cool it was to have the support of Musk, only for Musk to say he should be removed just a few hours later... Of course we're looking at the question of funding more generally. It's no wonder Starmer is so blase about the corrupting impact of large political donations in politics. Since he became leader in April 2020, the Labour Party has accepted a total of 61 donations above PS100,000 from individuals or corporations. That includes 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping PS23.6m from just a handful of people. And the corrupting influence can be seen through the PS4m from Quadrature Capital. This a tax haven-based hedge fund with investments in weapons, fossil fuels and private healthcare. Indeed, Labour has even appointed Rachel Kyte as its climate envoy. She also sits on the advisory board of Quadrature Charitable Foundation. By contrast, throughout Jeremy Corbyn's leadership from 2015-2019 the party only received a total of five donations above PS100,000 from individuals or corporations. Instead, donations from those other than trade unions tended to be small amounts from various members of the electorate and funds driven from a mass increase in party membership. Too bad much of the British electorate slept on the opportunity of making Corbyn prime minister. And the situation is worse than super rich individuals and corporations buying influence through donations. Recent research from Transparency International has found that one in every ten pounds donated to UK parties comes from outright dubious sources. That includes where corruption, cash for access, fraud or money laundering has been specifically alleged or proven.

"Another year, another arms dealers' dinner is facing disruption by protesters","Protesters vow that arms dealers and politicians will not dine in peace at their PS265-PS540-a-head annual dinner - as they prepare another year of disruption to the event. The Aerospace, Defence & Security (ADS) Group is an arms-industry trade body that represents most of the world's biggest arms firms. And according to Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), every year it holds a dinner to ""bring politicians together with reps from [the] world's biggest arms companies"". The dinner is a prestigious lobbying and networking event for many of the companies complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Event sponsors include companies directly complicit in Israel's genocide including BAE Systems and Babcock. BAE Systems is the lead partner in the F-35 combat aircraft programme. The UK makes 15% of every F-35 Israel used to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza. The F-35 license was exempted from Labour's partial arms suspension despite evidence that Israel used F-35s to commit war crimes. In 2024, the ADS dinner was attended by over 1200 people, including 40+ members of parliament, eight government ministers, opposition front benchers, and international delegations. Also in attendance was arms trade lobbyist and so-called 'independent' government advisor on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney aka John Woodcock. Walney complained to GB News in 2024 that attendees had to ""run the gauntlet"" of protesters to attend the event. Emily Apple, CAAT's media coordinator, said: The people attending this dinner are dining on the profits of genocide. This disgusting event is nothing more than a lobbying opportunity for war criminals. These arms dealers are merchants of death, fuelling conflict worldwide, in order to line their pockets. The contacts and conversations that happen at events like this lead to deadly consequences and our protest will ensure that those attending have to confront the reality of these murderous deals. In 2024, CAAT disrupted the event as well: The sycophants at Marriot told the Canary last year: We are a hospitality company that provides public accommodations and function space. Acceptance of business does not indicate support, or endorsement of any group or individual. In line with our guest privacy policies, we do not discuss details of our guests or the groups with whom we do business. Clearly, Marriot hasn't heard of BDS. Nor is it concerned with the UK arms industry's appalling track record in Gaza and the Occupied Territories. The protest will take place on Tuesday 28 January, 6pm, at JW Marriott Grosvenor House London, 86-90 Park Lane, London W1K 7TN.",Canary,2025-01-27T21:35:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/marriot-ads-dinner-2025/
The Lord Walney 16's appeal is a battle for justice - for all of us,"Over two days on 29 and 30 January, the Court of Appeal will review the jail sentences imposed on 16 supporters of Just Stop Oil between July and September 2024: the Lord Walney 16. The sentences include the five-year prison sentence imposed on Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil, for taking part in a Zoom call to plan a protest against new oil and gas licences, and the two-year sentence passed on Phoebe Plummer after she threw soup at the glass covering Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Also among the group of 16 is Gaie Delap, the 78-year-old grandmother who was recalled to prison just before Christmas, because SERCO failed to provide a tag that could fit a woman's wrist. Known collectively as the 'Lord' Walney 16, all received shocking prison sentences only months after the disgraced John 'Lord Walney' Woodcock, paid oil and arms industry lobbyist, called for groups who oppose his clients' interests, to be silenced and jailed. Prior to Walney's report in May 2024, jail sentences for peaceful protest in Britain remained extremely unusual. The UN has previously described the sentences as 'not acceptable in a democracy'. The rationale given for these sentences is 'deterrence', i.e. to prevent further nonviolent direct action, such as sitting in the road. But the sentences have in fact sparked a new wave of direct action under the banner, Free Political Prisoners, which unites diverse movements such as Palestine Action, Animal Rising, and Just Stop Oil. The campaign has called for a meeting with Richard Hermer KC, the government's Attorney General, to discuss political interference in the justice process by oil and arms industry lobbyists and the silencing and jailing of people for shining a light on corporate crimes. In September and October 2024, more than 300 people occupied the roads outside Southwark Crown Court and the Ministry of Justice respectively. It is expected that more than 1,000 will occupy the Strand, blocking it to traffic, on 30 January between 12.30pm and 2pm. Backers of the 16 planning to attend outside court include TV personalities Chris Packham and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, comedians. Mark Thomas and Robin Ince, artist Gavin Turk, politicians Caroline Lucas, Norman Baker and baroness Jenny Jones, and singer-songwriter Billy Bragg. Solidarity actions are expected outside British embassies in a number of countries, from the Netherlands to Guyana. The concealment of evidence that threatens corporate profits is a recurring theme in the British political and legal systems. The Post Office scandal arose from Fujitsu concealing the flaws in its Horizon programme. 72 people lost their lives in Grenfell Tower after Arconic suppressed evidence of the dangers of its cladding. For decades Big Oil has waged campaigns of public misinformation over the known impacts of burning its products, using the same PR firms as the tobacco industry. Now its lobbyists are driving the silencing and repression of those exposing the industry's lies. The disgraced 'Lord' Walney resigned from the Labour Party in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct which have still not been investigated. In 2020, Boris Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords, and gave him the role of 'Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption'. He used that role to obtain the following paid positions: The terms of his engagement required him to disclose any conflicts of interest directly to the Home Office, but it is unclear whether he did so. In May he published a report, falsely presented to the public and to parliament as 'independent'. This called for groups such as Palestine Action and Just Stop Oil to be treated as organised criminals. He also suggested that jury acquittals in the trials of such cases were a 'problem' that needed to be addressed. The surprise is not that Walney acts in his clients' interests, but rather that the Labour government continues to present him to the public as 'independent', encouraging judges to act on his recommendations. He remains in post, despite a previous commitment by the Home Office to review his role by the end of October 2024. A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries said: The real question for the Court of Appeal is whether corruption of the legal process, by oil and arms industry lobbyists, is acceptable in a democracy Lex Korte, Free Political Prisoners spokesperson, comments: Oil barons and arms dealers are the worst amongst us. They kill and maim, poison and pollute for profit. They have bought our governments, legal systems and media outlets. They own the newspaper in your hand. They use it to tell you that the people standing up to them are the bad guys and deserve to be put in prison, for blocking a road or protecting a forest. They write our laws and tell our judges how to sentence their opponents. They threaten our democracy and our survival. They must be stopped. Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Zoe Cohen said: Every citizen should have the right to effective protest. It's a crucial part of democracy. These excessive sentences are designed to put people off protesting. But the laws that enable these sentences were written by think tanks that are funded by the corporations, oil money and the obscenely rich - the same actors who are responsible for brutal inequality and driving us to extinction. Who gave them the power to write our laws? It is shameful that the new government has not yet repealed these laws and restored the right of ordinary people to effective protest. We can push back against this repression when we come together to peacefully resist.",Canary,2025-01-23T10:49:40+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694215
Palestine Action's #Filton18 are in court TOMORROW - and need YOUR support,"On Friday 17 January, the Palestine Action #Filton18 political prisoners will appear at the Old Bailey, London, to enter their pleas for the first time since their arrest. They are expected to plead 'not guilty' to charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and, for some, violent disorder, after an August action against Israel's Elbit Systems research hub in Filton, Bristol. The action saw activists enter the site, operated by Israel's largest weapons company, and dismantle the weapons of war inside - including the Elbit 'quadcopter' models used for targeted killings of children in Gaza. Ten of the #Filton18 have been imprisoned since their arrest in August 2024, with a further eight arrested and imprisoned since November, all of them subjected to abuse of 'Counter Terror' powers by the British State. The Crown Prosecution Service are alleging that the charges faced have a 'terrorism connection'. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton case demonstrates ""terrorism powers being misused"" to ""circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention"". The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison - including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy. Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company, is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza - providing over 85% of Israel's armed drones, along with a wide range of munitions, armaments, and military equipment, all of which it markets internationally as having been ""battle-tested"" on Palestinians. From Britain, the subsidiary 'Elbit Systems UK' is a major exporter to Israel of military drone components, along with arms including weapons sights. The Filton weapons hub was opened in July 2023, with Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotevely in attendance praising the site for the ""very best of Israeli technology"", alongside Elbit's CEO Bezalel Machlis.

SEND system in England falling apart at the seams - thanks to the Tories,"The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee's report Support for children and young people with special educational needs published on 15 January highlights significant challenges within England's Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system. Notably, it outlines how funding over the past ten years has not matched demand - as the previous Conservative Party governments let the SEND system fall into a state of disrepair. As BBC News reported: In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system ""in disarray"", ""mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money"". An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England. The Department for Education (DfE) said the government was ""making progress"" on the issue with a PS1bn investment in Send. Despite a 58% increase in high needs funding over the past decade, the number of children with Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plans has surged by 140%, leading to funding not keeping pace with demand. This disparity has resulted in stagnant outcomes for children, eroding parental confidence in the system. The Public Accounts Committee summed up by saying: The Department of Education will be unable to make the fundamental reforms needed without a clear, costed plan to measure progress, which it is lacking. To do this it needs a clear vision of what an inclusive education would look like, better data to target funding, and to deliver a system where all those with critical roles work together. This includes the Department for Health and Social Care, who must play their part in reducing long waits for support. With more than 40,000 children waiting over 12 weeks for speech and language therapy alone as at June 2024, timely access to health expertise constitutes a significant barrier in a struggling system. Recommendations: The Local Government Association was particularly concerned by the report. Councillor Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: The Committee is right to describe the failing SEND system as an emergency, and its report reflects councils' long-standing concerns over the need for more inclusive provision and the immense financial pressures on councils to be adequately addressed. It is vital the Government urgently sets out a comprehensive reform plan that ensures children and their families get the support they need and deserve. This must include ensuring councils on a financially stable footing, with high needs deficits written off. Otherwise, many councils will face a financial cliff-edge, and be faced with having to cut other services to balance budgets through no fault of their own, or their residents. Without urgent action, the report warns of a ""lost generation"" of children who may leave school without receiving the necessary support, emphasising the critical need for systemic reform to meet the growing demands and complexities of SEND provision in England.",Canary,2025-01-15T13:52:46+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/send-england/
"Instead of tracking UK flights supporting genocide, the Telegraph is tracking refugee boats","RAF Akrotiri has been participating in Israel's genocide in Gaza for over a year. But the Telegraph is one of many mainstream media outlets in the UK which have failed to report on that. Instead, the Telegraph thinks its big and clever to publish a ""small boats tracker"" focusing on the people who have been escaping war, poverty, and repression to seek a better life in the UK. We absolutely should talk about immigration, of course. Because Britain is ageing, and we have big skills shortages. Many employers, especially in key areas like health and care, can't fill their vacancies. Successive governments, meanwhile, refuse to invest appropriately in the education and healthcare sectors to improve the situation. And although people from other countries have a great track record of stepping in to help while contributing more to public finances than average Brits, governments routinely place obstacles to them doing so. This situation needs to change. Because British citizens aren't going to magically have more kids overnight. Childcare and housing costs keep rising, incomes and job stability are a big concern, and the future isn't looking particularly bright, so it's no wonder that people who can make an informed choice either choose not to have kids or to delay doing so. The Telegraph points out that ""smugglers have ferried more than 150,000 migrants across the English Channel since government records began in 2018 - most often in inflatable small boats"". That's in six years, and 93% of those people claimed asylum (authorities usually accept only around half of these claims). To put this into perspective, the UK allowed around 213,000 people from Ukraine in less than two years between 2022 and 2024. As the government's own statistics clarify: The number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in the UK in 2022 was equivalent to the number of people granted refuge in the UK from all origins, in total, between 2014 and 2021. Nonetheless, the Telegraph doesn't appear to have had a 'Ukrainian refugee tracker'. Ukrainians didn't really need to arrive in boats. People from countries the UK and its allies have invaded or interfered with in the past, however, do. As the Telegraph says, the most common countries people on the small refugee boats came from last year were Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Iran. The real crisis surrounding immigration is that British governments don't take responsibility for their actions or address the true causes of immigration. Britain is a junior partner to the destructive US imperialist project, furthering conflicts abroad for its economic benefit. The right thing to do would be to welcome in civilians who suffer as a result. But because racism and xenophobia are effective tools for distracting people from the super-rich individuals and their lackeys who are truly responsible for Britain's problems, the country only opens its arms wide when the victims are white Christians. Economic demand pulls people to the UK. And what pushes people from their own countries is the urge to seek a better life by escaping from death, destruction, repression, and poverty resulting from the global economic system which US imperialism champions. There are solutions out there, but none are likely to happen any time soon: We desperately need to find a sustainable global way of living, without exploitation. But propagandists like the Telegraph prefer to keep people in rich nations distracted by scaremongering about people from poor nations. To challenge that, every time we speak about immigration we need to centre the conversation on the small number of obscenely wealthy people who accumulate extreme levels of money as a direct or indirect result of the poverty or suffering of others. That is the system responsible for everything, and that needs to be our focus.",Canary,2025-01-28T16:29:20+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/28/telegraph-asylum-seekers-tracker/
New: PFI for schools has made OFFSHORE companies £1 BILLION profit,"Private Finance Initiative (PFI) continues to have a legacy in the education sector, with repayment costs being 3.3 times larger on average than the value of the infrastructure they built, according to new research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The news comes just as the Labour Party government has been eyeing yet more PFI-style deals - and therefore, the report should ring alarms bells. The report explores the use and impact of PFI, finding that PS13.5 billion is spent by local authorities every two-to-five years on PFI repayments. Between 2018 and 2023, PS4.2 billion (31%) of all PFI spending by local authorities was on interest rates alone. Despite delivering over PS80 billion worth of public assets over the years, the PFI model was retired in 2018 after becoming synonymous with high costs and inflexible contracts and due to the 'fiscal risks' it posed to the public sector. 845 schools have been built and/or are maintained by a PFI contract, covering nearly half a million pupils. This new analysis finds that PFI schools are financially worse off than non-PFI schools, after controlling for key characteristics. In particular: However, there is, no significant evidence that PFI schools are more likely to be failing than non-PFI schools. The study also looks at the financial accounts of PFI providers, finding that: Of these eight companies, five are registered in offshore tax havens. While many consider the PFI experiment to be a failure, the current government may look to reintroduce a new version to finance its 'decade of national renewal', given the updated spending rules still do not leave sufficient headroom to finance all this expansion through conventional fiscal policy. However, to do so it will need to learn from the lessons of the past, which will remain challenging given the lack of institutional knowledge over the use and impact of PFI. Author of the report and NIESR senior economist Max Mosley, said: The core question that remains for the government to answer when considering a reintroduced PFI model is whether these risks are worth it. It is argued that removing the limits from infrastructure projects can be achieved with simple adjustments to fiscal rules or by simply removing investment from fiscal rules altogether. The judgment the government must make is a simple risk and reward one: whether the risks of introducing the Public Private Partnership model outlined in this work are better or worse than the risks to further changes in spending rules. It is the view of this report that it would be difficult not to side with the latter.",Canary,2025-01-23T09:38:13+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/23/pfi-schools/
Youth Demand made it to the BBC at Saturday's Palestine March - and were promptly nicked,"Three Youth Demand supporters defied Met Police restrictions on the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign (PSC) demonstration on Saturday 18 January by standing outside the BBC with signs. Youth Demand are calling for a two-way arms embargo on Israel and for the new UK government to halt all new oil and gas licences granted since 2021. At around 4:00pm, the three were arrested under Section 14 of the Public Order Act after marching to the BBC and standing on the pavement with signs, defying the conditions imposed on the protest by the Met. One Youth Demand supporter was holding a sign saying ""Can I protest here?"", another held a completely blank sign: A Youth Demand spokesperson said: The BBC heralds itself as an institution built on truth, but it has treated genocide like a matter of opinion. We see the BBCs previous and ongoing complicity in the destruction of Palestine, and we recognise that when our institutions fail us it is down to the people to tell the truth We will not comply with the repressive conditions imposed by the Met police in order to silence dissent and protect the interests of a genocidal state. Our government is complicit in the genocide of the Palestinian people and we refuse to stand by and watch it happen. On February 1st, we will announce our plan to take resistance to a whole new level. Our spineless politicians have armed Israel for 15 months and now want us to go home and forget about Gaza, but we will not forget their crimes. It's time for all of us to escalate our resistance and to fight for nothing less than full liberation. On Wednesday 15 January the genocidal Israeli regime finally submitted to international pressure and agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza. On the same day, the PSC called for ""defiance"" of the Met Police ban on their demo at the BBC and said they would not go back on their commitment to hold march in support of the Palestinian people, and against Israel's genocide. After negotiations with the police, the PSC finally agreed to the demand of a static assembly at Whitehall, not the BBC. Meanwhile, since agreeing to a ceasefire Israeli Defense Forces have continued to drop bombs, killing over 100 Palestinians. Youth Demand summed up by saying: A ceasefire agreement is nowhere near Palestinian liberation. This ludicrous display of repression proves that the government believes we are a threat. So in 2025, we go big. On Saturday 1 February, the group is holding a launch event for 2025's actions. All the details are here.

Why Starmer's Labour is rapidly losing Britain's support,"Most people in Britain are not happy with Keir Starmer's Labour Party government. And that's not only because of the prime minister's despicable support for Israel's genocide in Gaza. A new YouGov poll shows that the main reasons Labour is haemorrhaging support right now, making it the third party in British politics just months after the brutal collapse of the Tories handed it an easy election victory. If neoliberals hadn't retaken Labour and put it back in the hands of corporate lobbyists, the party may have actually used its electoral supermajority to really help Britain at a time when the rich seemed to be getting richer and the poor poorer. But because Labour is currently a hollow shell of its former self, it has chosen to let ordinary people down instead. According to the poll, people who voted Labour in 2024 but are no longer planning to vote for them in the future said the main reasons the government's: Nothing forced Starmer to push voters away. In fact, you would expect most of these issues to be no-brainers for a socialist policy-maker. But Starmer is not a socialist, and nor is his government. And that's why, in spite of the facts above, he's trying to suck up to the right and attack the left rather than placing blame for Britain's problems where it lies - on the privatising policies of previous governments and the massive levels of inequality they have caused. https://twitter.com/SteveAkehurst/status/1882379502711632194/photo/1 But why aren't the government's participation in Israel's genocide in Gaza and its failure to tackle the climate crisis more of a problem for voters? The simple answer is propaganda. Many traditional Labour voters clearly care about solidarity, understanding the link between the wellbeing of other people and their own. But the billionaire-owned mainstream media has been fully committed to covering for Israel's genocidal war criminals and hiding the British government's support for them. They've helped the state to smear anti-genocide protesters and confuse the issues for people who are not actively following the news. And that's hardly surprising, because billionaires tend to support Israel. It's the same situation with the environment. The ""CO2 emissions from just 50 billionaires exceed those of world's poorest 155 million people"", producing ""on average more carbon through their investments, private jets and superyachts in under three hours than the average Brit does in their entire lifetime"". This disinterest in the destruction of the planet and the climate crisis pushes them to ""fund a network of organisations that seek to prevent effective environmental action"". And at the same time, some will even cynically exploit opportunities to make money from the opposite side, even if they don't really care. There's a reason why escaping into space is so popular among billionaires. Starmer's corporate cronies refuse to challenge the rich and powerful because they're in bed with them. That's why they prefer to attack environmentalists and anti-genocide protesters who don't have immense resources, and it's why they prefer to focus on right-wing talking points rather than addressing the issues most important to the people who voted for them. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn completely understood the danger of billionaire control of the media, and it's why he believed in wholescale media reform. Starmer, on the other hand, has submitted to the corporate media overlords. That's why the country doesn't like him. It's why he's haemorrhaging votes. And it's why he's empowering the far right with his privatisation of the Labour Party's soul.",Canary,2025-01-27T10:38:59+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/27/starmer-labour-polling/
Now the US wants to fly its drones out of the UK - despite widespread outrage,"Protestors led by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and Drone Wars will gather outside the main gates of RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire at 1pm on Saturday 25 January to oppose plans to fly US Global Hawk drones from the base. The protest comes as the newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump once again repeated his plan to 'Make America Great' articulating a 'peace through strength' foreign policy. The US plan to operate the huge RQ-4 Global Hawk drones from RAF Fairford as part of NATO's 'Agile Combat Employment' (ACE) concept which argues that key military aircraft should be able to operate from different bases in order to make it harder for adversaries to conduct pre-emptive strikes. As the Telegraph reported, ""introducing the long-range RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones to the Gloucestershire base means severing a vital flight path used by airlines serving the West Midlands airport several times a week"": Now airport managers have written to the CAA warning that flights could be extended by hundreds of extra miles and delayed by up to 20 minutes while the Global Hawks are flying to and from Fairford. According to documents submitted to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the ""working assumption"" is that when the drones are at the base they will fly 2-3 times per week. However, a trial flight of the giant drone into the base in August 2024 seriously disrupted UK passenger flights arriving into Birmingham airport. CND general secretary Sophie Bolt said: The Global Hawk is part of the US spying apparatus and has been for decades, from the devastating invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan to supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza. Whether it's US nuclear weapons stationed at RAF Lakenheath or drone flights from RAF Fairford, these British bases are critical hubs for the US war-fighting machine. With Donald Trump back in power this is even more alarming. Instead of hiding behind bogus arguments of national security, the British government should be held accountable for the war crimes being perpetrated from these bases. Director of Drone Wars Chris Cole said: While in theory the UK has to give approval for any military operations carried out from its territory, given that the UK government is so determined to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Washington, there must be serious questions as to whether the Government would ever refuse permission for flights, no matter what the purpose of the operation. Allowing US drones to fly from Fairford is effectively handing Washington a blank cheque for its drone operations and must be challenged.",Canary,2025-01-22T17:53:05+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/22/now-the-us-wants-to-fly-its-drones-out-of-the-uk-despite-widespread-outrage/
Leicester university hunger strikers for Palestine reach two-week mark,"Hunger strikers at Leicester university have reached the two-week mark in their protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. On Wednesday 15 January, five University of Leicester students went on hunger strike ""over the university's complicity [Israel's] in genocide"". Leicester Action for Palestine said this followed ""severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower"". An open letter in solidarity with the hunger strikers and arrestees explains that students want the university to ""cut ties with Barclays, arms companies and other companies targeted by BDS"". After ten days of hunger striking, students would require hospitalisation as a result of their protest. For this reason, Leicester Action for Palestine revealed at the weekend, three of the original five students had stopped their strike at that point. The group also described how the university has sent ""lots of information about how dangerous a prolonged hunger strike can be"", but has nonetheless ""chosen to delay our next negotiation meeting until the end of next the week"". This means ""forcing the strikers to extend their strike unnecessarily"". The students are ""risking their health and education"" in order to push the university to ""sever ties with companies complicit in the slaughter of thousands across the Middle East"". The university's inaction so far, Leicester Action for Palestine asserted, suggests the institution doesn't truly care about its students beyond a ""facade of wellbeing slogans and posturing"".

Keir Starmer's AI plan misses the central point of the fourth industrial revolution,"Keir Starmer's plan for artificial intelligence (AI) falls well short of the main point of the fourth industrial revolution. That is to liberate people from labouring work they don't want to do, providing more time for social, creative, and intellectual endeavours. Instead, Starmer is largely pursuing private sector for-profit ownership of AI that threatens to rob people of their work without fairly sharing the fruits that robots have created. In his speech on AI, the prime minister paid some lip service to the issue, without saying how for-profit, private ownership of AI will facilitate it: Who gets the benefits? Just those at the top - or working people everywhere? The thing is, there will be a point where capital increasingly becomes labour: where the money for resources equates to labour. That's because in the long term the economy will be mainly automated rather than consisting of people providing the labour. Without public ownership of that automation or some kind of citizens dividend, the opportunity for the utopia explored in Aaron Bastani's Fully Automated Luxury Communism will be replaced by the opposite: AI-controlling overlords and a poverty stricken public. Yet the public research and development funding for AI Starmer has issued is a drop in the ocean compared to the private investment we are seeing. The government's AI plan also mentions the environmental factor in this, given AI generation is an energy intensive process. But corporate lobbyists and fossil fuel donations have played a role in reducing the government's green energy strategy to near zero, compared to what's necessary. In Labour's first budget, the government issued just PS100m to Great British Energy (GBE) for two years. That's despite its already low pledge of PS8bn by 2029. GBE aims to crowd in private investment in renewables. It falls far short of what we need. And it squanders the opportunity for a publicly funded Green New Deal. Starmer's plan further proposes a national data library to power for-profit AI. That includes data from publicly funded institutions such as the British Library, the NHS, the BBC (through TV license), the Natural History Museum and the National Archives. It also includes reworking copyright law so AI can use people's work, whether academic or creative. All of this is essential for the development of AI. But why should people's work and public funding fuel AI if the outcomes are going to be privately-owned profit generation? It only makes sense for public ownership of the outcomes: AI machines that could be liberating. At present, the British people are already paying twice for education and information. Once, to create research (for example, through Research Council funding).

Palestine Action are occupying the offices of Aviva - complicit in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"From 7.30am on Wednesday 22 January, Palestine Action begun occupying 'The Aviva Centre' in Bristol over its ongoing complicity with Israel's genocide in Gaza. One activist is on top of the overhang of the 'UK's largest insurer': Another spray painted the front glass of the building. Messages painted on the building include 'Pal Action' and 'Elbit Out': Aviva provides the mandatory employers liability insurance for UAV Engines in Staffordshire, a drone engine factory owned by Israel's biggest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems. Recent disclosures show the company no longer holds direct shares in Elbit Systems. However, as well as insuring an Israeli weapons factory, Allianz also continue to hold investments in funds which hold Elbit shares. By insuring UAV Engines, Aviva is facilitating the design and production of drone engines used to power Israel's killer drone fleet, including the Hermes 450 drones and IAI's Harop and Harpy attack drones. Such drones are used to surveil, massacre and terrorise Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank. In direct contradiction with facilitating Elbit weapons production, 'The Aviva Business Ethic Code' states: ""Respecting our customers, colleagues, communities, partners and the environment is part of our approach to human rights. As a company, we have an obligation to ensure our business activities do not cause or contribute to violations of human rights of others"". Elbit Systems provides over 85% of Israel's military drone fleet and land-based equipment, as well as munitions, missiles and electronic warfare. According to Elbit's CEO Bezhalel Machlis, the company ""ramped up production"" to arm the Israeli military to commit what the International Court of Justice ruled as a 'plausible genocide' in Gaza. The company routinely uses assaults on Palestinians as a means to market new weaponry as ""battle-tested"". Despite a ceasefire being implemented in Gaza, the Israeli military begun ""Operation Iron Wall"" in Jenin, West Bank. In the last 24 hours, they've killed 9 Palestinians and injured 70 in the region. Many of those killings were conducted using air strikes and drones. Palestine Action's direct action campaign has also consistently target Allianz offices, as they provide insurance for the other Elbit British subsidiaries. Actions against Allianz included operations against 10 of their British and Irish offices overnight, as well as sustained actions against the insurers premises. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: Israel's biggest weapons firm could not work in Britain in isolation. Aviva is providing the mandatory insurance Elbit needs in order to build Israeli weapons on our doorstep. Without insurance, the Israeli arms maker would not be able to operate in Britain. Palestine Action will continue to take direct action against companies such as Aviva as long as they facilitate the destruction of Palestine and massacres of the indigenous population of the land.",Canary,2025-01-22T10:40:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/22/aviva-palestine-action/
The Assisted Dying Bill Committee just voted to EXCLUDE key people who don't agree with it,"The first committee meeting of Kim Leadbeater's assisted dying bill confirmed what many disabled people already knew - and have been highlighting from the beginning. Specifically, that the bill and its proponents have disgracefully dismissed and sidelined disabled voices at every turn. This was once again painfully evident when members overwhelmingly voted to exclude a leading disabled activist as a witness in its upcoming sessions. In particular, among other amendments, they shot down one which sought to include Ellen Clifford, who this January momentously took on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in the High Court over its dangerous plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment - and won. On 21 January, the Public Bill Committee for the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life Bill) sat for the first time. Including herself, Leadbeater has appointed 14 supporters of the bill to this committee responsible for scrutinising it. These include health minister Stephen Kinnock and justice minister Sarah Sackman. Six other Labour MPs who supported the bill will join them. There's also two Conservative MPs, two Liberal Democrats, and one Plaid Cymru MP that backed it as well. The remaining nine - six Labour, two Conservative, and one Liberal Democrat - opposed the bill at second reading. Immediately, it's clear the weighting of the committee is heavily pro-assisted dying from the get-go. Now, it's also already apparent that this is biasing the evidence-gathering process. During this first session, it was quickly obvious that Leadbeater was moving to mothball scrutiny and genuine challenges to her bill. She started by bringing a motion to make discussions on the proposed witness list private. In other words, she wanted to conceal this part of the meeting from the public. Naturally, the pro-assisted dying stacked members passed this through. It means that all matters pertaining to why Leadbeater selected the witnesses she has, happened behind closed doors. To start, the committee will take oral evidence from around 42 witnesses during three upcoming sessions this January. At the time of writing, the committee has not yet published the witness list on the bills page - so we don't currently know who this will include. However, we do know who this won't include already - and that's legendary Ellen Clifford: Specifically, Labour MP Naz Shah brought a series of amendments to the witness list. One of these was to remove Irwin Mitchell partner and solicitor Yogi Amin from the line-up and replace him with Clifford. Predictably, the committee shot the amendment down with a resounding clamour of ""no's"". Evidently, fresh from her High Court win for disabled people's rights, Clifford's tenacity against the DWP has the pro-assisted dying proponents anxious to avoid her holding their feet to the fire in an evidence session on parliamentary record for all to see. Of course, it's also hardly surprising from a committee make-up that already failed to include a single disabled MP that voted against the bill. Moreso when you take into account that many of its members support the bill as is. And add to that, that some want to water down its so-called safeguards even further, and you have the recipe for more disastrous sidelining of disabled voices. Effectively, like Leadbeater, they see little wrong in a bill with a swelling litany of issues. This is despite the fact that every single DPPOs - all 350 - has opposed it from the start. That mere fact alone should be telling enough. Moreover, it's obvious that Leadbeater and the largely pro-assisted dying panel would be reticent to remove Amin. The solicitor has supported a number of high profile court cases seeking to legalise assisted dying - most recently in 2018. There were other witnesses the committee snubbed in Shah's amendments as well. This included the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP). This was because the committee considered that the General Medical Council (GMC) and the British Medical Association (BMA) covered its remit. As the Canary's Rachel Charlton-Dailey pointed out, that wouldn't have anything to do with psychiatrists majority concerned existing 'safeguards' on consent are woefully inadequate where coercion comes in: Arguably though, it'd be better to include mental health advocates with lived experience over the RCP. Certainly, it'd be a shameful oversight if the committee leaves out people living with mental health conditions who can directly speak to issues around coercion firsthand. Leadbeater has since walked back on this decision to leave the RCP out. She has now added the RCP to the witness list. Naturally though, not without making a dig at people who oppose the bill: The committee will still have to agree to this at a future session. It also looks to be the case that Leadbeater hasn't included any experts from Canada either. However, aside from spurning Clifford's inclusion, the other most alarming revelation was that the witness list won't be remotely balanced. Conservative MP Danny Kruger drew attention to this. He highlighted that there were 38 witnesses he considered supporters of the bill, and only 20 opposed. He also noted that of the eight witnesses from ""foreign jurisdictions"", all support assisted dying within their own countries. Multiple members weighed in here to defend the decision. They opined that it apparently only made sense to have people involved in the 'successful' operation of assisted dying bills elsewhere to make Leadbeater's legislation ""workable"". That is, they had no interest taking evidence from people and communities assisted dying laws have harmed and put at risk elsewhere. Ultimately, Leadbeater and the committee's choice to leave Clifford out speaks volumes. Despite the spiteful quip in her post about the RCP U-turn, Leadbeater is right about one thing - her list isn't enough. Not when it's looking likely that she has deliberately chosen not to include even a single representative from a DDPO on it. Contrary to Leadbeater and her supporters repeated boasts to inclusivity, the committee proceedings are already shaping up to be anything but. After MPs voted it through second reading - it was clear Parliament was ignoring chronically ill and disabled people's voices. Now, this whole sham scrutiny process is showing just how little MPs will listen to them when it really comes down to it.",Canary,2025-01-22T16:31:38+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/assisted-dying-committee-ellen-clifford/
Media democracy has persistently failed - as the Sun and prince Harry case shows,"Almost exactly 24 hours after the trial was due to begin, the Sun has reached a settlement agreement with lord Watson and prince Harry to avoid trial over allegations of phone hacking, illegal activity and a cover up at the Sun and the News of the World. As part of the agreement, and after many years of denial, the Sun has finally admitted that it was indeed engaged in unlawful activity. However, the case also points to a wider, systemic problem in the corporate media. It's one of concentrated ownership and lack of accountability. Speaking from court, Hacked Off Board Director Emma Jones said, It is a humiliating day for The Sun and the senior executives at News Group Newspapers, who have finally admitted that allegations of illegality made against the publisher are true. News Group has now spent over a billion pounds - funds which could have been put to much better use supporting journalism - fighting allegations which they have now largely admitted were accurate. The Sun has spent years denigrating the individuals and campaigners - including Hacked Off - who have alleged illegal activity at the newspaper and forced 1300 people through legal action to uphold their rights. Today, The Sun's targets have been vindicated. It is now clear that the public and Parliament were lied to by the newspaper and its publisher, as part of the most extraordinary corporate cover up in living memory. The Sun's claims of innocence formed part of the broader press campaign against independent regulation and Leveson Part Two. Now we have confirmation - from the publisher itself - that this was fabrication, the Prime Minister must get on with robust policy on press accountability without further delay. Yet somehow, independent media like the Canary is the villain - even thought many of us are the ones who are independently regulated by the government-approved IMPRESS. It said of the Sun case: How can the public trust an industry where invasions of privacy and coverups remain commonplace? Having previously attempted to deny and deflect any wrongdoing, News Group Newspapers have now admitted to serious intrusion, phone hacking, misuse of private information and unlawful activities carried out by private investigators for the Sun and the News of the World against Prince Harry. It is incredibly disheartening that, during a period when the Sun and NGN could have carried out in-depth reviews and implemented changes to ethical practices of their journalists, they chose to litigate instead. Prince Harry is in the privileged position of being able to afford to take a media giant like NGN to court and get an apology. The vast majority of the public, however, in a similar position would have been financially ruined by taking a similar course of action. This can no longer be dismissed as being the case of a few bad apples; self-regulation of the press has failed. Effective and truly independent regulation is the only way to stop these unethical practises which have been commonplace across the industry. Impress holds its publishers to the highest standards in journalism and provides accessible avenues to justice for all. Without rigorous and transparent accountability, the world of journalism risks surrendering public trust forever. So, why are we in this mess? The UK corporate media landscape is dominated by a shrinking number of powerful conglomerates, leaving little room for diversity, independence, or public interest. However, one group has been consistently advocating for change. Now, it is set to host its yearly Media Democracy Festival. The latest Media Reform Coalition report paints a troubling picture of concentrated ownership across newspapers, broadcasting, and online platforms--posing serious questions about the independence and plurality of media in a democratic society. Three companies - DMG Media, News UK, and Reach - control 90% of the national newspaper market. DMG Media alone dominates 40% of the market through titles like the Daily Mail and Metro, while News UK (publisher of the Sun and the Times) commands 33%. Smaller groups like the Guardian are little better content-wise, pushing a narrative that maintains the failing status quo. Local journalism fares no better: six publishers own 71% of local newspapers, with Newsquest, Reach, and National World holding larger market shares than the combined total of 157 smaller publishers. This concentration has created ""news deserts,"" with 2.5 million people living in areas without a local newspaper. Even digital shifts haven't democratised media, as corporate publishers pivot to generic regional ""hub"" websites, replacing local reporting with cookie-cutter content. Online news consumption has risen to 68% of the UK population, but this hasn't diluted corporate influence. Meta and Google dominate the ecosystem, controlling 80% of online advertising revenue. Of the top 15 online news platforms, 10 are owned by Meta, Alphabet, or X Corp. Combined, Meta's services (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) reach 72% of online news consumers, reinforcing their gatekeeping role in public discourse. The BBC, a supposed bastion of public service broadcasting, faces political and financial pressures, losing audience share to platforms like Netflix and YouTube. It has bene heavily criticised for its coverage of Israel's genocide in Gaza - adding to a rap sheet that critics argue shows it is little more than a mouthpiece for the Western establishment. In the local radio sector, Bauer and Global own 65% of analogue stations and over three-quarters of the national digital radio market. Cuts to regional programming further erode localized news coverage. The impacts of such concentrated ownership are stark. The pursuit of profits has led to newsroom closures, job cuts, and a reliance on clickbait content. Dominant platforms and media channels often amplify sensationalism, conspiracy theories, and divisive narratives. Moreover, with a handful of owners dictating the news agenda, diverse voices struggle to be heard. Despite these issues, regulatory bodies like Ofcom remain passive and ineffective, and government promises of reform have yielded little. This lack of action perpetuates an imbalance that prioritizes shareholder and corporate interests over public accountability. So, the Media Reform Coalition is once again hosting a 'democracy' festival to highlight how this can be changed. As it said in a statement: Every year, the Media Democracy Festival brings together activists, independent media outlets, journalists, researchers and policymakers to debate how we can transform the media into a more independent, accountable and democratic system that serves the public interest. With keynote speeches from leading public figures, panel discussions and interactive workshops covering debates on Big Tech, media moguls, the future of the BBC and how to create more ethical, community-based journalism. Whether you're a hardened media reform advocate, a disillusioned media worker looking for change, or a curious media consumer, join us and help to reshape the media so that it works for people, not profit. The group advocates for ""progressive reform"" to counterbalance the influence of powerful media and tech conglomerates. Proposals include stricter regulation of ownership limits, better funding for independent journalism, and more public accountability for tech platforms. For younger audiences, who overwhelmingly consume news online, the stakes are particularly high. The Media Reform Coalition report emphasises the need for a media ecosystem that reflects the full diversity of society, rather than one shaped by a few powerful actors. As the Sun/prince Harry case shows, corporate media is not to be trusted. If you want to get involved with shaping media that can be, you can register for the Media Democracy Festival here.",Canary,2025-01-22T15:21:51+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/22/media-democracy-has-persistently-failed-as-the-sun-and-prince-harry-case-shows/
#WeWillMarch: campaign groups push back against Met Police over Palestine demo,"A new year has begun, yet Israel's atrocities in Palestine persist. In Gaza, the situation is more dire than ever. Health workers are stretched to breaking point, particularly in northern Gaza, where not a single hospital remains functional. Their resilience in the face of unimaginable suffering is nothing short of heroic, but they cannot do it alone. On Monday 7 January, health workers and supporters gathered outside parliament to demand urgent action. Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd calling for IDF troops to withdraw from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as from southern Lebanon and Syria; and for the British government to stop supplying arms to Israel. On Saturday 18 January, we will unite and once again call for an end to the genocide, despite attempts by the police to curb our right to protest. Join us in Central London for the next National Demonstration for Palestine, just days before the inauguration of Donald Trump in the US. Date: Saturday 18 January Time: Assemble 12pm (midday) Location: BBC, Portland Place, W1A If you haven't yet, please email your MP using a letter written by health workers who have been on the ground in Gaza. Their first-hand accounts highlight the devastating impact of the ongoing violence and call for immediate action. It takes just two minutes - click here to take action. Yesterday, the Met Police stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead, reneging on the previous agreement with the organisers made months ago. The coalition leading the marches put out this statement to confirm that we will march in solidarity with the Palestinian people, as planned. Coaches from towns and cities across the country are being organised for the Palestine march. Please help make this march as large as possible by sharing it on social media and encouraging friends, colleagues and neighbours to join too. We must show the people of Palestine that they are not alone and together, make 2025 a year of justice for Palestine. As Jeremy Corbyn reminded us on Monday, ""we will stand forever with the people of Palestine until they have justice, peace and freedom"".",Canary,2025-01-09T12:45:25+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/palestine-march-18-january/
Matt Wrack demands 'more investment' as attacks on firefighters hit 15-year high,"Data collected by Legal Expert has cast light on the threat faced by firefighters around the UK and led to Matt Wrack, then-general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, calling for urgent change. The information, which was gathered through Freedom of Information requests sent to nearly 40 fire services around the UK, shows that members of the public attacked crew members on thousands of occasions. Firefighters were subjected to physical attacks, verbal assault and threats of violence, with numerous missiles thrown at them and their appliances during operations. Statistics published by the Home Office indicate that there were 96 injuries suffered from attacks during England-based operational incidents in 2023/24. Not only was this a rise of more than 25% on the year before, but it was the highest figure recorded in any of the past 15 years, and a 284% increase on the 25 cases noted in 2014/15. Firefighters suffered 82 slight injuries and 14 serious injuries, according to the data. Before leaving his role in January, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) general secretary Matt Wrack called for greater trust and protection for firefighters when responding to the data collected by Legal Expert. Wrack said: Firefighters must be able to respond to emergencies everywhere without fear of abuse or injury from attacks. It is vital that fire and rescue services retain and build trust with local communities, but community engagement projects have been cut while firefighters are sent out with fewer resources and smaller crews. Some services are now overseen by police commissioners, which jeopardises public perception of the service as independent and humanitarian. We need investment in the fire and rescue service to reduce the risks firefighters face while they are protecting others. West Midlands Fire Service took in 666 reports of violent activity between April 2020 and November 2024-with the data covering a period more than a year shorter than that of most other services. There were 449 cases of verbal abuse, at a rate above one every four days. Only three other services across the UK reported more instances of physical or verbal attacks in six years than the 180 seen in the West Midlands in 2023 alone. Also returning a significant number of cases was Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. The North West's largest service had 372 separate incidents between November 2019 and October 2024. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service flagged 327 incidents across 2019-2023 and most of 2024. This includes 140 in the Newcastle area, with the Tyneside city having more assault reports than all but three regions, excluding Tyne and Wear, in the entire country. Kent (190), South Wales (139), and London (104) were also host to more than 100 incidents. It was not the same story everywhere. Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service claimed to have had no incidents whatsoever, while other populous areas like Merseyside (five), West Yorkshire (seven) and Lancashire (12) returned relatively small figures. Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service confirmed only ten cases to Legal Expert, stating that it was sharing details only of incidents which led to crew members suffering injuries. Fire service staff have felt the strain in recent years, with one report showing a 40% rise in mental health-related absences. Multiple services also saw staff miss significant amounts of time because of attacks by members of the public. The London Fire Brigade lost 372 working days due to assault-related absence, 259 of which involved staff in Barnet. Northern Irish staff were also significantly affected, with three injured crew members missing 103 days between them. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, which noted 56 incidents including 17 physical assaults, provided summaries of its reports. They paint a picture of firefighters facing needless violence in many scenarios. An April 2022 case noted how the family member of a person who died in an incident attacked one firefighter, scratching their face, then ""tried to run down"" two more. In another incident, Tamworth Fire Station was informed that a first responder was struck on the ankle when a member of the public threw tiles from the roof of a building. Rugeley Fire Station received a report in 2020 of one shovel-wielding occupier refusing to let staff enter the property to tackle a fire. Even training was not without risk, as one station reported two young people, including one carrying a knife, confronted staff during a course. Another report noted that while staff were filming for Safe + Sound, a programme aiming to ""educate children about safety in a fun and interactive way"", they were verbally abused and threatened by a member of the public. On 39 occasions, staff experienced a noteworthy amount of verbal abuse while carrying out tasks. This included two incidents where protestors at an NHS vaccination clinic for children hurled abuse at staff while blocking access routes. Fire services across the UK shared reports of missiles being thrown, with objects including bricks, stones, eggs and fireworks all aimed at staff. Hospitalisation was not an uncommon factor of assaults, as numerous services shared reports of at least one staff member needing medical attention because of an assault suffered on the job. Legal Expert offers free advice to emergency service workers considering civil action for injuries suffered in an assault at work. Those interested in learning their legal options can call 0800 073 8804 or contact Legal Expert online.",Canary,2025-01-21T20:43:12+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/21/matt-wrack-firefighters/
Just Stop Oil trio who targeted ex-Tory MP Mark Jenkinson NOT GUILTY - and rightly so,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters who fly posted the offices of a former Conservative MP to draw attention to his lies about a proposed Cumbrian coal mine have been acquitted of criminal damage by a magistrate in Carlisle. The trio took action in April 2024 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Catherine Rennie Nash, 74, Fiona Atkinson, 68, and Margaret Reid, 54 all from Kendal were part of a group of four arrested on 24 April 2024 after posters reading ""Stop Tory Coal"" were plastered on the Maryport offices of the former Conservative MP for Workington, Mark Jenkinson: The three have been acquitted of criminal damage under PS5,000 at Carlisle Magistrates today, after the magistrate ruled that the three could not have known that the window was covered with a specialist film that the prosecution alleged had been damaged and led to repair costs of PS3,392.21. Margaret Reid has been on remand at HMP Styal for the past five months after being arrested by Great Manchester Police on August 5 2024 during the Oil Kills international uprising at airports around the world. She is charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and is due to stand trial on 3 February. Catherine Rennie Nash said: Mark Jenkinson promised his constituents a carbon neutral coal mine that would deliver hundreds of jobs for West Cumbria. However the High Court ruled that this was legally flawed and the mine will not go ahead. Mark Jenkinson also claimed that in our efforts to draw attention to this misinformation we had caused thousands of pounds' worth of damage to his office. Today we have been found not guilty and we question why the police and courts wasted so much time in pursuing this. Fiona Atkinson said: We call on Cumbria's new MPs to tell the truth about fossil fuels and support, rather than criminalize, people who are drawing attention to the climate crisis. We welcome Markus Campbell-Savours' and Josh McAllisters' efforts to bring investment in new green jobs for Cumbria but this needs to happen much more quickly. Also arrested on 24 April 2024, but subsequently released without charge was Alison Parker who said: I was shocked that I was arrested, as I only filmed what was happening. I was recognised outside the office by Mark Jenkinson, and then pursued by the police and courts for 8 months until finally my case was dropped. A solicitor is taking on my case for wrongful arrest so I can find out why so much taxpayer's money was wasted. Mark Jenkinson has been a strong advocate for the proposed new Whitehaven coal mine, which was granted planning permission by the former Conservative Government in 2021, before it was subject to legal challenges by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Climate Action last year. The High Court ruled in September 2024 that the former secretary of state for levelling up Michael Gove had acted unlawfully in granting the coal mine proposal planning permission. In doing so the High Court upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas should have been taken into account when deciding whether to approve the project.",Canary,2025-01-14T19:45:32+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/just-stop-oil-mark-jenkinson/
DWP benefits like PIP are officially GOOD for the economy - despite Labour's propaganda,"Just as the Labour Party government is tabling reforms and cuts to Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits like PIP, a new report by a think tank has exposed that, far from being a drain on public finances, health and disability-related welfare is actually good for both the claimant and society more broadly. For 3.5 million people in the UK, DWP benefits like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) are a lifeline. These programs cover essential extra living costs, such as mobility aids and support for daily activities. Yet, the value of these benefits transcends mere financial support. Think tank Pro Bono Economics has released a new report. It's called More than money: The life-long wellbeing impact of disability benefits. The study reveals that receiving chronic illness or disability benefits increases life satisfaction by an average of 0.79 points on a 10-point scale. This improvement becomes even more pronounced over time, reaching 1.1 points after four years of receiving support. For individuals in poor health, the impact is even greater, with life satisfaction increasing by 1.2 points. This boost reflects not only financial relief but also enhanced mental health, social inclusion, and reduced anxiety . The monetary value of this wellbeing improvement is staggering. According to the study, the annual wellbeing benefit for each recipient of DWP PIP or DLA is valued at PS12,300. This translates to an estimated PS42 billion in total annual benefits for all recipients, far outweighing the PS28 billion cost of providing these benefits. For every PS1 spent on disability support, the UK economy gains PS1.48 in wellbeing benefits . Cutting these benefits would not only diminish the quality of life for millions but also negate these substantial economic gains. The government must recognise that disability benefits are an investment in public health and societal wellbeing, not a drain on public resources. Behind the DWP PIP statistics are real people whose lives have been transformed by disability benefits. Take Peter, for example, a single Autistic man in his fifties who also lived with communication difficulties. Before receiving PIP, Peter relied on food banks and struggled with severe mental health challenges due to financial stress. The award of PIP doubled his income, enabling him to pay off debts, improve his mental health, and escape the cycle of poverty. Peter described the support as giving him ""a new life"". Similarly, Anatoli and Agnes, a refugee couple, faced insurmountable financial difficulties due to Anatoli's disabilities. Their approval for PIP provided the financial stability needed to access healthcare and rebuild their lives in the UK. Stories like these highlight the irreplaceable role of disability benefits in fostering dignity and independence . Despite their proven benefits, not all eligible individuals receive disability support. Complex application processes, lack of awareness, and fear of rejection deter many from claiming their entitlements. For those who attempt to navigate the system, the process can exacerbate mental health challenges and anxiety . In 2023/24, nearly 37% of DWP PIP awards were granted for mental health conditions, reflecting the growing need for support in this area. Yet, proposals to tighten eligibility criteria or add further barriers could prevent many vulnerable individuals from accessing the assistance they desperately need . The government's rationale for reducing disability benefits may stem from a desire to control public spending. However, the evidence suggests that such cuts would be a false economy. The wellbeing benefits of disability support via DWP PIP not only enhance recipients' lives but also generate significant economic returns. Furthermore, reducing benefits would likely increase demand on other public services, such as healthcare and social care, exacerbating existing pressures on these systems. Improving, rather than restricting, access to disability benefits is the way forward. Simplifying application processes, raising awareness about eligibility, and collaborating with charities can ensure that support reaches those who need it most. Organisations like Z2K already play a vital role in helping disabled individuals navigate the system, but their efforts must be complemented by systemic reforms . As the government considers reforms to the disability benefit system, it must prioritise the wellbeing of disabled people. Maintaining--and even expanding--current levels of support is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. Any reforms should focus on reducing barriers and improving access, ensuring that those eligible can claim their entitlements without undue hardship. Disability benefits like DWP PIP are not a luxury; they are a lifeline for millions of people facing systemic inequalities and additional living costs. Cutting these benefits would harm some of the most vulnerable members of society and undermine the economic and social fabric of the nation. The evidence is clear: investing in disability benefits is investing in a healthier, happier, and more inclusive society.",Canary,2025-01-29T12:24:35+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/dwp-pip-health-benefits/
ANOTHER Just Stop Oil supporter is preposterously sentenced by a judge,"A Just Stop Oil supporter who climbed an M25 gantry after an unprecedented 40c heatwave in the UK was found guilty by a jury in Chichester on Thursday 9 January. Abigail Percy Ratcliff took action in July 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Abigail, 25, a student from London, was among five supporters who blocked the M25 in three places by climbing on the overhead signs after Just Stop Oil declared the M25 a site of civil resistance on 20 July 2022. The action was prompted by news that UK temperatures had recently topped 40c for the first time ever, causing multiple fires to break out and resulting in the busiest day for the London Fire Brigade since the WWII. Before taking action in 2022 Abigail said: The UK crossed the 40 degree threshold yesterday, runways melted, wildfires raged and hundreds died. This is not the new normal, it will keep getting worse until we just stop oil. We must act now. I joined Just Stop Oil because I was worried about my future, about my sister's future, but I think a lot of us have realised this week that we're not talking about the future, we're talking about now, it's happening today. Abigail was found guilty of public nuisance, and given an eight month suspended sentence plus PS1,500 in costs. She was previously remanded to prison in November 2022 for three and a half months. Her sentence comes just days after Just Stop Oil supporter Dr Patrick Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. The judge sentenced him to a year in prison. Speaking prior to the trial Abigail said: This protest I'm on trial for was back in 2022, during a heatwave that broke temperature records and killed thousands of people in the UK. And the government at the time was planning to approve 100 new licenses for oil exploration in the North Sea, in light of the evidence of the harm it would cause. The most vulnerable among us were killed that summer and the UK government went ahead and approved those licenses anyway, flagrantly denying the evidence that the climate disaster was already a threat to this nation. It was under those circumstances that I took action. Democracy has failed to protect us. Both the labour and Tory parties are neglecting to take serious action on the climate. We have now passed 1.5 degrees warming over pre-industrial levels. There is absolutely no time for talking about whether it's okay to block a road. It's not okay to sell future generations' futures off for a profit, and that's exactly what these fossil fuel companies are doing. It's exactly what our government is allowing them to do. Peaceful protesters are filling our prisons while the real criminals sit in power handing down a death sentence to future generations. We mustn't go without a fight. Another of those taking action on 20 July 2022 was Louise Lancaster. She was prosecuted in October 2022 for contempt of court for breaking the M25 protest injunction, but received a suspended sentence. Three others who took action on the same day were also given suspended sentences after being found guilty of public nuisance in May 2024. However, that was before 'Lord' Walney called for Just Stop Oil to be treated like a terrorist organisation and the courts started dishing out multi-year prison sentences for nonviolent action. These disproportionate sentences are being challenged at the court of appeal at the end of this month. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

Beating benefit reforms starts with tackling the MSM’s eugenicist anti-fatness stigma,"We're now a quarter of the way through the 21st century. But from one look at the corporate media benefit claimant-bashing bile over the last year, you wouldn't know it. The date marches on, some of the hacks trade places with electoral washouts - and vice versa - but the vile bigotry never ceases. If anything has changed in the past 25 years of hate-rag vitriol, it's only that they've increased the ever-flowing pool of marginalised community scapegoats. Not that any oppressed group ever graduates from the right-wing press's punch down portfolio. The Canary reviewed the past five years of Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail coverage on disability benefits - and the data can attest to this. However, perhaps most notably of all, what became abundantly clear was quite how much the corporate media had refused to let some abhorrently ableist and grossly bigoted narratives lie. And amidst a torrent of this, the corporate press's particularly nasty and appalling anti-fatness stigma stood out tall. The benefits are a ""life-style choice"" purveyors, arbiters of the 'grift' and 'graft' ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" sanctimony, ""workshy"", ""idlers"", ""shirkers"" - it was all there. Across the dataset - with its 1130% rise in 2024 - the words themselves weren't particularly prolific. We found the facetious idea that it's a ""lifestyle choice"" in five articles. Grifter and grafter guff came up in four. That old (rotten) ""workshy"" chestnut cropped up across no fewer than ten pieces. Invocations of ""idleness"" and ""shirkers"", just three and one pieces over our time period and search terms respectively. That these outlets used these terms in any articles at all is appalling enough. Yet, most also didn't have to say it in as many explicit words. The implication was often plain and terrible to see in many articles regardless. Among the most infamous of infamous smears, there were two that really encapsulated an especially disgusting discourse that the corporate media refuses to put to bed. Just when you think it can't get any worse, the right-wing regurgitators raise you: its ""lazy scrounger"" rhetoric. Again, they didn't often voice it in quite so florid adjectives. Four counts of ""scrounger"" - all courtesy of the Daily Mail, naturally. Meanwhile, the Telegraph spewed out five out six of the pieces peddling ""laziness"" as synonymous with benefit claimants. Once more, there were plenty of articles where it didn't need to say these outright for readers to know that's what it was implying. Crucially, the corporate media often wrapped this up in a vastly more reprehensible narrative (hard to believe, we know). It's one that has long been rife in the right-wing press. In tandem with these disgusting terms, the mainstream media's output was also bristling in anti-fatness bigotry. That is, amidst the vicious crusade against benefit claimants, the fascistic foghorns whipped up a furore over fat people. And often, they did this in the most paternalistic, and putridly body-shaming ways. In October, Telegraph troll Allison Pearson penned one notable disgusting anti-fat diatribe. Hers specifically extolled the economic advantages of mass-prescribing weight-loss drugs. In it, she unironically advised we ""as a society"" should stop fat-shaming people. So herself and her hate-mongering employer especially then? Rich too when she packed the very same Ozempic - likely quid-pro-quo - promo-piece with every single hate-riddled insult and stereotype under the sun (or in the Sun for that matter). The oxymoronic lack of self-awareness was therefore truly off-the-charts scale staggering throughout. She literally labelled benefit claimants ""useless lumps"" and suggested they would ""flog their free drugs on the black market"". To the likes of Pearson, people not cranking out capital are burdens to society, or criminal fraudsters - a rhetoric that has reared its head repeatedly in recent months. And why not divvy out a dose of anti-fat discrimination while she was at it - ""lumps"" - a deliberate double entendre that should not go unnoticed. We won't reel off a list of her numerous other incorrigible insults and give them any oxygen. Safe to say that she made every attempt to punch down on fat folks, poor people, really any marginalised demographic she could swing her arm at. And the grand crescendo of it all leads exactly where you might expect. Make people fit for work - then ramp up punitive benefit conditionality. Every other sentence seems an ode to framing fatness as something to revile - about yourself, and in others. Similarly, a supposedly 'satirical' soapbox from Telegraph columnist Michael Deacon in December had an equally vile message. Deacon pitched ""high-altitude fat camps"" to fix the UK's so-called 'obesity crisis'. Of course, his bigoted banter fits right in with the worst kinds of weight loss porn we see plastered across every nook and cranny of the media. From late-stage capitalist entertainment media's fetishization of fat-shaming to the clickbait press' capitalisation of it. The point is that it's within this context that Deacon was emboldened to say this - and vice-versa legitimise it in a vicious mutually-sustaining circle. And significantly, what these articles have in common is the way in which they pitch fatness as some form of personal failing. Ostensibly, they're suggesting that people are undeserving of health-related benefits by reason of their fatness. So there's the implication too that people claiming disability benefits for conditions linked to their weight, shouldn't be. If the corporate media can foist the blame for people's poor health on individuals, then they can preserve the capitalist status quo. Simply put, it shifts the onus away from tackling the structural factors of our inequitable classist, ableist, racist, and misogynistic society. One particularly revolting headline from the Daily Mail said it all: Listen love, I can't be applying for jobs day in and day out. You've got to have some 'me time': The brazen words of Jimmy, 40, to SABRINA MILLER in this shocking dispatch from the 'disability benefits capital of the UK' where 75 per cent are overweight Needless to say, it's the 'lazy scrounger' narrative all over. However, the blatantly bigoted tirades from corporate media's resident click-hate merchants wasn't the only way these outlets farmed outrage and stirred up contempt either. They also churned out a steady stream of analysis articles pointing out the so-called ""sickness benefits bill"". Crucially, these made the connection with 'obesity' as a driver of increasing rates of ill health and unemployment. Some directly honed in on this, while others merely mused on it in passing. But all were part of building a despicable discourse over fatness. Let's talk cause and effect here. What do you get when you have a band of right-wing media anti-fat bigots bashing the costs of ""obesity-linked benefits""? A government in bed with Big Pharma readying to pimp claimants out for profits. Specifically, this would be the DWP doing a deal with the pharmaceutical corporate devil Eli Lilly for a weight loss drug trial. Essentially, it's the department testing whether so-called weight-loss jabs could get unemployed claimants back into work. Slow-clap for Labour then. The dust barely settles before Starmer's government seems to jump jovially aboard another astonishingly atrocious back-to-work bandwagon. In fact, the Times piece was quite literally crooning over a report from healthcare analytics consultancy LCP reifying the welfare savings these drugs could foment. What the Times didn't mention? That Novo Nordisk A/S has previously paid an author of the report - Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard - for studies into the healthcare costs of 'obesity-related' conditions. That would of course be the same Novo Nordisk that manufactures two of the major weight loss drugs in question - Wegovy and Ozempic. Additionally, Pearson-Stuttard also took fees from Pfizer outside the study. The company produces weight loss drugs too. Go figure. So perhaps it's no surprise Pearson-Stuttard was plugging the ""cashable savings for the welfare system"" of Novo Nordisk's drugs to the Times. Honourable mention too to former DWP coalition government Liberal Democrat minister-turned-lobbyist Steve Webb for jumping on the Wegovy-train as another author on the report. The so-called ""worklessness crisis"" narrative and weight loss jabs have been banging around together at least since Sunak launched Wegovy NHS trials in June 2023. Then health secretary Steve Barclay boasted the boon they could be for the economy by getting people back to work. Predictably, this - at least in part - revolved around building: evidence that the drugs can reduce the benefits bill And since then, the right-wing press and politicians have been increasingly trading on this anti-fat benefit claimant propaganda. Yet, that has hardly been the end of it. Because, if that all weren't insulting enough, in December, the Telegraph reported that: Obese people are to be given gastric band surgery on the NHS in a drive to reduce worklessness. So, we have both pharmaceutically suppressing appetites and surgically shrinking people's stomachs. That's the new Labour government's grand plan for getting claimants back to work? There's a stupefying scale of anti-fat bigotry on display in all this. And as the Canary's Steve Topple has noted, it all comes down to the matter of coercion. He tempered that it doesn't mean that ""Labour is that dystopian - yet"" that it's going to condition benefits on their take-up. After all, it's early trial days for now on both counts. At minimum though, the rancid rhetoric the press is spouting could pave the way for the DWP withdrawing disability benefits from people with conditions it links to obesity. And that's a form of coercion too. Namely that by rendering people without support, it could leave them with little choice but to turn to these drastic - and sometimes dangerous - health interventions. Not that there's actually any guarantee that either will actually improve people's health, or help them find work with a livable wage. There aren't even enough jobs going for the number of job seekers, let alone sick and disabled people that the government seems hell-bent on shunting into work. Plus, vacancy numbers say nothing of whether the work is appropriate, accessible, and accommodating of people's health conditions. Not to mention the companies too numerous to count who's bosses are parasitic pricks profiting off the backs of low-waged workforces. Every article we found bandied about the concept of 'obesity'. This pertains to the medical measurement of body mass index (BMI). That might seem innocuous enough at first glance. However, it's premised on a medical model that disparages fat bodies as automatic indicators of unhealthiness. Essentially, it promotes fatness as something that needs to be fixed. Of course, this atrociously ableist thinking tracks, given its roots in eugenics. It was 19th century Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet who invented the model that later formed the basis of BMI. Notably though, he did so on a study he conducted with only white French and Scottish men. In other words, by its very origins it centred whiteness and patriarchy. Moreover, he pursued this to identify the ""ideal"" weight and size for an ""average man"" - by which he quite clearly meant white Western European males. A telling passage in his book laid bare the ableism at the heart of it: Everything differing from his proportion or condition would constitute deformity or disease. Fatness above his metrics constituted a deviation from his ""ideal"" and inherently signalled sickness. Invariably, it fed into the dominant ideology of the day to devalue chronically ill and disabled lives. Because from there, a who's who of 19th and 20th century eugenicists took up the concept. Predictably, vulture capitalists of the 20th century also sniffed out the profits potential of this junk science-turned medical model. Life and health insurance companies adopted it as a predictor of health conditions. So let me be clear: the implicit assumption that there's anything wrong with fatness in the first place is utter bullshit. The medical mainstreaming of BMI is about one thing, and one thing only. That is, the capitalist urge for policing poor, racialised, and disabled bodies. In short, insurance companies hijacked BMI to deny claims. Now, the media-political corporate establishment is making mutterings over removing disability benefits linked to 'obesity'. These things aren't unrelated. In a nutshell, it's the very same eugenicist medical science that threads through both repressive weaponisations of anti-fat stigma and bias. However, the history of the terminology the corporate media has been using is just the start of all that's wrong with the coverage. Another is that the term 'obesity' has a linguistic origin that's hardly less problematic. The Latin etymology 'obesus' translates as ""having eaten oneself fat"". Additionally then, there's in-built oppression and othering from a term that literally blames people for their body weight. And this is also largely the underlying intimation of the articles too. Outlets largely made the suggestion - though not always explicitly - that fatness equates to laziness. In other words, fat bodies are that way because of people's personal choices in relation to diet and exercise. Obviously, there's so much wrong with this too. Topple has also previously underscored how this hugely misses the point that, in multiple ways, it isn't a choice. He highlighted a number of examples: Moreover, inequitable access to healthy food is also not only down to poverty, but also due food deserts too. Specifically, where you live can determine the cost and availability of food as well. Then there's dietary requirements that can limit the types of food people can eat safely, or that their body needs. These include things like allergies, autoimmune conditions, diabetes, conditions causing digestive dysfunction like gastroparesis, or eating difficulties like dysphagia. Many neurodivergent people also have personal 'safe foods'. Moreover, plenty of these and other health conditions therefore affect people's weight gain or loss. So ultimately, it's massively ableist to make out a person's body weight is down to their own personal dietary failings. And talking of time poverty for overworked and exhausted households - we'll say it again: disability benefits are also not out-of-work benefits. Many people claiming them actually work, so this extends to them as well. Some people - like those with ME - also can't and shouldn't exercise, or risk a permanent worsening of their health. The point is, framing exercise and diet as a choice vastly oversimplifies something with multiply-marginalising factors at play. Of course, the right-wing press knows all this, but has put out this constant drip of discriminatory drivel regardless. At the end of the day, hawking hate pays. Bedding down with Big Pharma pays. Celebrating body diversity, tackling structural health inequalities, and buttressing society with a functioning, fair welfare system? Not so much - and the political establishment media lapdogs know this too.",Canary,2025-01-14T18:44:57+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/anti-fatness-media-headlines/
An outrage: private rents have risen by as much as 72% in just TEN years,"The latest research by Tlyfe, the UK's housing tenant lifecycle app launched by OpenBrix, has revealed that, over the last decade, Salford tops the table when it comes to the highest rate of rental growth, with the average rent in the area having increased by 72.4%. Tlyfe analysed the latest rental market figures from Gov UK, released this month, looking at which areas of the rental market have seen the sharpest increase in the cost of renting over the last decade. The research shows that, across England, the average cost of renting has increased by 44.4% over the last 10 years, now averaging PS1,369 per month. Wales has seen a similar rate of growth at 43.9%, although the monthly cost does remain significantly cheaper at PS777 per month. Regionally across England, it's not London (40.9%) but the East Midlands that has seen the highest increase in the cost of renting, up 51.8% in the last 10 years. The East of England has also seen one of the highest increases (50.4%), whilst the lowest rate of growth has been across the North East (33%). However, further analysis by Tlyfe shows that when it comes to local rental market growth, it's Salford that tops the table, with the average cost of renting in the area increasing by a huge 72.4% in the last decade. Leicester ranks second with an increase of 70.7%, with Folkestone and Hythe (69.1%), South Gloucestershire (69%) and Thanet (67.4%) also making the top five, whilst Bristol (66.1%), Manchester (64.9%), Ipswich (64.5%), Tameside (64.5%) and Stevenage (64.1%) rank within the top 10. The London Borough of Brent has seen the largest increase of all London boroughs at 58.4%, although it sits at number 25 in the table overall. In fact, rents have climbed across every single area of the market in England and Wales, with Hartlepool seeing the smallest increase, up by just 14.3% in the last 10 years. See how rents have changed in your local area here. The news comes after the Canary previously reported that people under the age of 45 pay 66% of all rent in the UK. This amounted to a record PS56.2bn for 2024, according to research from housing agents Hamptons. The total amount of rent paid by under 45s has increased by a startling 59% over the past decade, reflecting eye-watering price increases as much as additional renters. CEO of OpenBrix Adam Pigott commented: The cost of renting has only gone one way over the last decade - and that's up. Such is the consistent and overwhelming demand for rental properties that we find ourselves facing a severe crisis across the sector and one of the key factors causing this crisis is a lack of available homes to meet demand. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as though this market imbalance is set to be addressed anytime soon and, if anything, we've seen more landlords exit the sector due to consistent legislative changes implemented by the government. It's the nation's renters who are left to face the consequences and, for many, the cost of residing within the private rental sector is simply too high, whilst those who are able to stomach it are severely hindered from saving and making the jump to homeownership.",Canary,2025-01-27T11:21:37+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/27/rent-increases-uk/
Labour just gave crumbs to desperate leaseholders: a 'drop in the ocean',"In November 2024 Labour Party housing minister Matthew Pennycook made the promise to leaseholders. It was that he would put into force a part of the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 by the end of this month. On Wednesday 22 January he finally fulfilled this - posting on X (formerly Twitter) that he has signed a regulation removing the requirement for a flat owner to have owned a flat for two years before they can extend their lease. However, one expert has described his actions as a 'drop in the ocean' over what's actually needed. The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 was the last bill to be passed before the general election, having received support from both parties. Over six months have passed. While the provisions relating to lease extensions being enabled is welcome, those around freehold purchases and other measures are still not in force. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders are waiting for this legislation to be fully turned on and make good on its promise to make it ""cheaper and easier"" for them to extend their lease. In the meantime, many of these homeowners will be stuck in properties that they cannot sell or remortgage. The government has now said that they will launch yet another consultation, on how to set the valuation rates which will define whether lease extensions become cheaper or more expensive. Frustratingly, they are delaying this consultation until ""next summer"", and then have conceded that further legislation will have to be passed to put it into effect. Linz Darlington, MD of lease extension specialists Homehold, said of Pennycook's announcement: The Housing Minister has today signed the regulations implementing the first part of the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 that affects lease extensions and freehold purchases. According to the Housing Minister's post on X (formerly Twitter), from the end of this month a leaseholder will no longer have had to own their property for two years before they can extend the lease of their flat or purchase the freehold to their house. While this is a welcome development, removing the ownership condition is a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed from leasehold reform. It is a small change which will benefit a small proportion of leaseholders. We estimate that hundreds of thousands of leaseholders are waiting for the more significant changes to the lease extension regime which have been promised to make it ""cheaper and easier"" for them to extend their leases. The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 has already set out these changes but they are not yet in force. Despite this legislation receiving Royal Assent in May 2024 - now eight months ago - the government intends to run a further consultation on some of the important provisions. They don't intend to run this consultation until the Summer, and this creates a further delay which is unwarranted and unwelcome. Darlington summed up: For leaseholders waiting for leasehold reform, they have now had successive governments promise reforms which always seem tantalisingly close, but never actually seem to arrive. We need the Labour Government to bring forward the consultation, and commit to swiftly implementing the legislation.",Canary,2025-01-23T14:21:41+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/?p=1694312
A 'life-changing' new research centre for deafblind people is opening,"A new deafblind UK centre for education and research based at Birmingham City University (BCU) has been hailed as ""life-changing"" and a ""game changer"" in the fight to address the ""frustrating and overwhelming isolation"" felt by many deafblind people. The centre, which is the first of its kind, will connect researchers, practitioners, and people living with deafblindness to increase knowledge and raise awareness It will also equip junior researchers and the workforce with the knowledge and skills to become future leaders in deafblindness research and practice. British Labour Party politician Lord Blunkett, who is himself blind, said ""A great deal is known about sensory challenges for blind people and those with profound deafness, but much less about the dual challenges that deafblind people encounter on a daily basis"": This Centre will make an important contribution - both to greater understanding and public awareness to the ways in which social and technological innovation can assist in the future. Deafblind UK CEO Nikki Morris added: There's an urgent need to better understand the impact of deafblindness on people and their loved ones. This new Centre will help to fill that gap. David Childs, associate professor, head of College of Education and Social Work at BCU, said ""This Centre will be a game changer in how we understand more about deafblindness and what we can do to make the lives of all those affected better: The research undertaken in this area is shockingly low. The new Centre won't just meet the knowledge gap, it will be an important beacon of hope to those affected by dual sensory loss. Deafblindness affects everyone in different ways. Some people might have mild sight and hearing loss whereas others can't see or hear anything. It can be isolating and lonely and can lead to mental health issues - but it's far more common than many people realise. Around 450,000 people are affected by sight and hearing loss in the UK. ""The spectrum of deafblindness is unique,"" said Deafblind UK member Ricky Blair: Certain situations are isolating and overwhelming, like knowing when it's your place to speak. Frustratingly, there are often adjustments in place for those who are deaf or blind. People often forget that many people have to grapple with both disabilities simultaneously. Deafblind UK partnered with BCU in 2019. The University went on to launch the Certificate and Diploma in Professional Studies (Deafblind Studies) in collaboration with Deafblind UK and a consortium of charities in 2021, welcoming its first cohort of students in March 2022. The only one its kind in the UK, the course is run by BCU's Dr Peter Simcock, who is internationally renowned for his work and will lead the new Centre. ""Helen Keller, author, disability rights advocate, political activist and perhaps one of the world's most well-known deafblind people, described life as either a daring adventure or nothing at all,"" said Dr Simcock, an Associate Professor of Social Work and a Deafblind UK ambassador: Our Deafblind UK Centre will play a vital role in responding to the urgent need for more research, supporting deafblind people to enjoy this daring adventure to the full.",Canary,2025-01-28T10:04:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/28/deadblind-birmingham-centre/
London mayor refuses to act to block Heathrow expansion,"Despite running on a platform to halt any further expansion of Heathrow Airport, on Thursday 16 January during Mayor's Question Time, Sadiq Khan dismissed multiple invitations from Green Party AM Zack Polanski to work together in pursuit of that shared goal. At the core of Heathrow's expansion plans is the construction of a third runway. Initially proposed over two decades ago, the plan seeks to increase Heathrow's capacity by accommodating up to 700,000 flights annually, compared to its current cap of 480,000. This expansion would allow Heathrow to handle an estimated additional 50 million passengers per year. Of course, one of the most contentious aspects of the Heathrow expansion has been its environmental impact. Critics have long argued that adding a third runway would significantly increase carbon emissions at a time when the UK has set legally binding commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The additional flights, coupled with construction emissions, pose a substantial challenge to these climate goals and would exacerbate the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Heathrow expansion has faced numerous legal battles and political hurdles over the years. In 2020, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that the government's approval of the third runway was unlawful because it failed to account for the country's climate obligations under the Paris Agreement. However, this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court later that year, allowing the project to proceed. As of early 2025, the Labour Party government has expressed conditional support for the expansion, contingent on meeting stringent environmental standards and securing broader public backing. Proponents of the expansion argue that it is vital for the UK's economic future. Heathrow's role as a global hub supports thousands of jobs directly and indirectly, and the additional capacity could generate billions of pounds in economic benefits. Increased connectivity is seen as crucial for trade, tourism, and maintaining London's status as a leading financial center. However, opponents highlight the significant costs associated with the project, estimated to exceed PS14 billion. They also point to potential disruptions for local communities, including increased noise pollution and the need to relocate homes and businesses. Local communities near Heathrow have expressed mixed reactions to the expansion plans. While some see the potential for job creation and economic revitalization, others are concerned about noise pollution, air quality, and the loss of green spaces. The proposed expansion would require the demolition of parts of several villages, including Harmondsworth, raising questions about fair compensation and community well-being. Currently, as the Financial Times reported Keir Starmer's cabinet are split over whether to approve the Heathrow expansion: Bosses at Heathrow, which handles more than 80mn passengers a year, are putting the final touches to their first expansion plan since the pandemic, but will not include a third runway at this stage, said people familiar with the matter. Downing Street and the Department for Transport said they were ""open-minded"" about a third runway, but only if it satisfied four tests: delivering growth across the country, meeting climate obligations and complying with air pollution and noise considerations. But one political aide said the cabinet was divided. ""It's no secret that there isn't universal backing for the third runway, it's just not a priority right now. [Energy secretary] Ed [Miliband] is the most obvious example of someone who is anti, but there are others who are uncomfortable about expanding Britain's biggest airport,"" the person said. So, on that Polanski pushed Khan on 16 January over the Heathrow expansion. Yet when prompted to join forces in lobbying government against any approval of the Airport National Policy Statement (ANPS), the Mayor repeatedly dismissed, and even mocked, Zack's outstretched hand: Reflecting after the exchange, Green Party London Assembly Member Zack Polanski said: Expanding Heathrow Airport would be dangerous, even deadly, for every Londoner interested in breathing clean air or swimming in the Thames anytime in the next century. The Mayor ran on a campaign promising to oppose Heathrow expansion, yet when I present him with opportunity after opportunity to take action, he refuses to engage with me. Why won't the Mayor work across party lines to stop Heathrow expansion in its tracks?",Canary,2025-01-16T14:47:12+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/heathrow-expansion/
Raffi Berg just 'the tip of the iceberg' when it comes to BBC pro-Israel bias,"Raffi Berg, the online editor for BBC News coverage on the Middle East, has been at the centre of a massive controversy in recent weeks. But a new petition from former Channel 4 editor Tamara Abood insists that ""Raffi is the tip of the iceberg"". And she calls for the sacking of people even higher up than Berg over the BBC's shameful (and longstanding) pro-Israel bias, specifically during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Public attention focused in on Berg after journalist Owen Jones published an investigation in December about pro-Israel bias at the BBC. Having interviewed journalists and other staff at the public service broadcaster, Jones revealed that ""senior figures"" had been skewing coverage to be more favourable to Israel while dismissing regular objections from employees who demanded the corporation uphold its supposed commitment to providing fair and impartial reporting. And in particular, Jones highlighted the malign role that Berg played. According to one former BBC journalist: This guy's entire job is to water down everything that's too critical of Israel. Others said he ""micromanages"" coverage, with one insisting that he ""has the power to reframe every story"". Even worse are his connections to the CIA, Mossad, and war criminal Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Jewish Voice for Peace explains: Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism, and is the primary ideology that drove the establishment of Israel. It adds that: While it had many strains historically, the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state where Jews have more rights than others. The pro-Israel (or Zionist) lobby in Britain has a massive influence. In the last parliament, it donated money to a quarter of British MPs, and reportedly had significant sway in the government. Half of the initial cabinet of the current Labour government, meanwhile, had received such funds. Abood argues that the same is true in the British media sector. As she said in the petition text: I have first hand experience of the extraordinary and malign influence that Zionist lobby groups exert over programme makers and broadcasters. I have spent the last 15 months watching in disgust as mainstream broadcasters in the UK have framed what is happening in Gaza through the lens of Israeli propagandists. But Berg is just a part of this, she stressed: Raffi is the tip of the iceberg. Scratch the surface of the BBC and you will find it packed to the rafters with Zionists who will quash ideas for programmes that are critical of Israel and who will frame the reporting on Gaza to centre Israeli interests. Abood also insisted: It is my belief as a former lawyer and tv producer that, in time, our mainstream media will be judged to have been complicit in a genocide by providing cover for Israel's crimes. In fact, as I write, lawyers who specialise in international law and human rights have many of these so-called ""journalists"" in their sights. And she argued that: BBC license payers are being deliberately mislead about the nature and extent of Israel's depravity in Gaza. The BBC is breaching its own requirements, and that of Ofcom, for due impartiality. As a license payer, you should be able to trust the BBC as a credible news source. The BBC is no longer credible. It has shown itself to be an outpost of the Israeli Ministry of Misinformation. Overall, her comments were damning. She said ""the BBC subverts the truth in order to influence the public's response in favour of Israel"", and that there has been ""a deliberate strategy of lies and omissions by broadcasters like the BBC"". Rather than focusing on Raffi Berg, though, she looks to BBC News CEO Deborah Turness. As she emphasised: Your license fee pays her PS400K + salary. Deborah Turness must go For her, licence-fee payers deserve so much better. And we completely agree.

Water companies are spreading disinformation to 'manufacture doubt' about sewage spilling,"Privatised water companies are under investigation by environmental regulators for discharging sewage for 3.6 million hours in 2023 into rivers and the sea. Environmental scientists have found that these companies are using disinformation tactics, similar to those tobacco and fossil fuel companies use, to control perceptions about the harm they are doing. The researchers compared the tried and tested tactics with the communications of the nine largest water and sewages companies in England. They found that the water companies have used 22 of 28 tactics from the corporate propaganda playbook to downplay environmental damage, delay action and bring scientific findings into question. Lead author of the research, Professor Alex Ford, of the University of Portsmouth's school of the environment and life sciences and institute of marine sciences, told the Guardian: Water and sewage companies have prolonged environmental injustice by using a playbook of tactics other large polluters have relied upon in the past to mislead the public and influence government agencies or laws. The paper calls for greater regulation of the communications of companies, at a time when the Labour Party government is presenting regulation as 'anti-growth'. This example shows that, actually, regulation is often about the standards we introduce in society. But Labour seems more concerned with putting profit first. One way the water companies deflected blame away from under-investment in infrastructure was to hold the public as mainly responsible for sewage spills. The paper explores a campaign across water companies blaming wet wipe flushing: ""'The Unflushables' (Southern Water), 'Unblocktober' (Thames Water), 'Waging War on Flushable Wipes' (Severn Trent Water), 'Stop the Block' (South West Water) and 'Wipe out Wipes' (Wessex Water)"". The environmental scientists note that this is only a minor issue and confuses the greater picture of a lack of investment causing sewage spills. Water companies also suggested that the only other option instead of sewage spills in rivers was discharging into hospitals and schools, as if the infrastructure couldn't be improved. Further, the report found companies have sanitised language around raw sewage spills through rebranding sewage centres as for ""water recycling"". Since privatisation, water companies have paid out PS78bn in dividends - money that could've been invested in infrastructure to improve the sewage system. There is a correlation between public ownership of the water system and a cleaner environment. Countries with water in 100% public ownership like Cyprus, Austria, and Malta have above 95% excellent water in bathing sites. By contrast, the UK has an average of 66.3% excellent water, putting us near the bottom of our European counterparts.",Canary,2025-01-29T09:41:30+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/29/water-companies-disinformation/
The 'Hastings Three' are in court next week for protesting outside an arms supplier to Israel,"Huge crowds are expected next week at the trial of the ""Hastings Three"", who were charged nearly a year ago for their part in protesting Israel's genocide in Gaza. NHS worker Clem McCulloch, 33, artist Thomas Delves, 25, and retired train driver Laurie Holden, 72, were arrested at General Dynamics arms factory on February 29 last year during a peaceful protest organized by the Hastings & District Palestine Solidarity Campaign (HDPSC) and supported by a coalition of community groups including Jewish groups, social justice and climate justice groups, parent groups, and political parties. All three will plead not guilty to charges of aggravated trespass when they come before a district judge at Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 22 January. The charge carries a maximum tariff of a three-month jail term and PS2,500 fine. They are expected to be joined by a large number of supporters as local groups across the county - including Brighton Stop the War, University of Sussex Friends of Palestine and Brighton and Hove Palestine Solidarity Campaign (BHPSC) - have called a 'solidarity rally' in support of the three men. Ahead of the trial, BHPSC's executive committee released a statement: BHPSC is a sister PSC branch to Hastings & District PSC, and have followed the case of the #Hastings3 with great interest - not least because we in Brighton know too well the indignation caused locally by having an arms factory based in our city - an arms factory (like General Dynamics in Hastings) that is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide being perpetrated by Israel upon the people of Gaza. The statement went on: The executive committee of BHPSC sends our solidarity to the three defendants whose case will be heard here in Brighton on the 22nd of January. Our many local members and supporters will be outside the court in large numbers on the 22nd to voice our support for our Hastings comrades, who are on trial for doing nothing more than exercising their right to peaceful non-violent protest. Compared with the appalling crimes against humanity being facilitated by the General Dynamics factory in Hastings and other weapons manufacturers in the UK, the actions of the #Hastings3 register as expressions of conscience rather than crimes. General Dynamics is the fifth largest global arms manufacturer and is responsible for all the MK80 bombs being dropped on Gaza. Laurie Holden, from Burwash, said: It is appalling that ordinary people like myself are in the dock instead of General Dynamics, which is making a killing from genocide. This will be the sixth time our case has come before the court, representing a disgusting waste of taxpayer's money. Meanwhile, General Dynamics made $3.3 billion profit in 2023. ""The Hastings Three are not guilty"" said Grace Lally, twinning officer for the Hastings & District PSC: General Dynamics is guilty of profiting from war crimes and genocide. Two thousand pound bombs made by General Dynamics have been dropped on families sheltering in tents in the so-called safe zone of Al Mawasi, where our friends live and our community has deep connections. Nothing can justify this. General Dynamics has come under sustained pressure from concerned locals for its part in Israel's 15-month campaign in Gaza. Hastings & District PSC has led more than a dozen actions to the two arms factory sites in Hastings since November 2023, including die-ins, marches, pickets and a 48-hour peace camp and the sites have also been subject to regular and spontaneous 'pop up' protests. Mum-of-one Olivia Cavanagh said: We don't want this weapons manufacturer here in our town, making money from slaughtering innocent Palestinians, making us complicit in war crimes. A legal fighting fund for the three men has raised nearly PS5,000 but still has some way to go to cover all their legal costs. ""The outrageous and expensive pursuit of the #Hastings3 does not stand in isolation but forms part of a nationwide clamp down on peaceful protest"" said Katy Colley, HDPSC Chair: Our friends are good men of conscience who, like the rest of us, cannot bear to see the wholesale destruction and annihilation we are witnessing in Gaza. The majority in this country stand against genocide, ethnic cleansing and apartheid. For fifteen months, people up and down the country have protested the UK's complicity in the worst crime of our time, demanding that the UK stops arming Israel. Yet our government refuses to listen and those who speak out are smeared, defamed and persecuted. There are now over 46,000 confirmed dead in Gaza - mostly women and children - though a report this month in the Lancet estimated the real death toll to be at least 40% higher with the number of deaths in the first nine months alone estimated to be over 64,000. A year ago, the International Court of Justice put Israel in the dock for acts of genocide and last month, reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Medecins Sans Frontieres all concluded that Israel is guilty of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza. The rally at Brighton Magistrates Court begins at 9.30pm and donations to the legal fighting fund can be made here.",Canary,2025-01-17T15:43:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/hastings-general-dynamics-protest/
It didn't take long. The British public now believe Keir Starmer should resign as prime minister.,"It's little over five months since the Labour Party won the election. Yet a majority of the UK public are now opting for Keir Starmer to resign as prime minister, according to YouGov. 40% of respondents think he should resign, while 36% think he should remain and 24% don't know. Further, Starmer has a net favourability rating of -38. But many who are sick of the two party status quo see Nigel Farage's Reform as a viable alternative, partly through years of corporate media boosting his profile. In a recent poll for YouGov on voting intention, Farage's Reform was just one point behind Labour. It had Starmer's Labour on 26%, Reform on 25% and the Conservatives trailing on 22%. The surge of Reform underscores the need for the progressive left to unite, potentially under an umbrella group to defeat the far right. In France, the New Popular Front - a broad alliance of the left, centre left, communists and Greens - received the most votes in the 2024 parliamentary election. Starmer indicated what he would prefer in the general election, where he gifted Farage his seat on a platter through essentially withdrawing the Labour candidate for Clacton. Starmer abandoned every pledge he made to become Labour leader and through that dropped many policies that are immensely popular with the people. These include public ownership of water, energy and healthcare. 2024 polling shows that 82% want water in public ownership, 71% for energy and 87% for the NHS. Yet Starmer lied about carrying out water nationalisation even as monopoly firms have paid out PS72.8bn in dividends over the years, along with eye watering salaries and bonuses for corporate bosses. He lied about nationalising energy and what's particularly embarrassing is that Britons don't even own the national grid itself, which alone has paid out PS28bn in dividends since privatisation. And instead of 'ending outsourcing' in the NHS as promised, Starmer is expanding private provision of NHS services by 20%, instead of properly investing in healthcare. On foreign policy, Starmer has failed to stand up to Israel with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn showing what leadership on the issue looks like. 56% want the government to ban arms sales to Israel, compared to 17% who don't. Yet Starmer has only blocked a woeful 8.5% of licenses. As well as these policies, Starmer has raised bus fares by 50%, cut the winter fuel payment for some of the least well off pensioners and announced cuts of 5% to each government department. Starmer's mantra of positive 'change' looks like anything but. Hence, the Tory/ Labour double act continues and provides ample fuel for an alternative.",Canary,2025-01-17T20:32:49+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/starmer-resignation-polling/
Have you seen 'Labour's' new ad on the London Underground?,"Unofficial adverts criticising Labour Party chancellor Rachel Reeves for accepting money from climate crisis-sceptic lobbyists appeared on several London Underground lines on Friday 24 January. The satirical posters say Your Chancellor, Sponsored by Climate Deniers: Rachel Reeves took PS10,000 from them (so far). A modified party logo reads: Labour: still backing oil: Last year, Reeves scrapped Labour's proposed PS28 billion green investment fund, shortly after accepting a PS10,000 donation from Lord Donoghue, a prominent climate sceptic and former chairman of the climate-denying Global Warming Policy Foundation. The chancellor has come under further pressure in recent weeks as the economic outlook has worsened. Sam Simons from Climate Resistance, the group behind the stunt, said: To avoid dangerous climate change, our government must get the country off dirty oil and gas and onto clean, home-grown wind and solar power. But big oil companies are hijacking our politics in a desperate bid to protect their profits and slow down action on climate change. It's outrageous that our Chancellor is accepting five figure sums from notorious climate deniers, while slashing funding for tackling the climate crisis. From fires in California to floods in the UK, we're already seeing the impact of the climate crisis. If we want a safe future, we must break the influence of oil lobbyists and climate deniers.",Canary,2025-01-24T16:56:43+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/24/labour-london-underground-adverts/
MSM ignores UK government hosting ANOTHER Israeli army general,"Despite the war-crime arrest warrants for Israeli government figures over the atrocities of the Gaza genocide, Keir Starmer's Labour Party government has once again hosted high-profile military figures from Israel in the UK, as if nothing has happened in the last 15 months. This is a grave insult to the memories of the 18,000 children Israel has murdered in Gaza. Nonetheless, the mainstream media has remained silent about the latest visit of likely war criminals to Britain. As Declassified UK reported, the Israeli military delegation visiting the Ministry of Defence included Major General Oded Basyuk, who is the head of the Israeli occupation forces' Operations Directorate. As Declassified explained: Basyuk was on the ground in Gaza during Israel's most recent onslaught and presided over decision-making on last year's offensive in southern Lebanon. Despite the international arrest warrants for top-level Israeli politicians, and the British government's participation in their genocide, the mainstream media appears to have no interest in the UK allowing probable war criminals to walk its shores. Nor was it interested when Israel's army chief visited in 2024, or when foreign secretary David Lammy went to schmooze with controversial political figures in Jerusalem. With the billionaire-owned media covering for Israel's genocidal war criminals, independent media like Declassified has stepped in to provide essential information about Britain's involvement in the atrocities. Just recently, for example, it revealed the BBC's absolute failure to inform the public about this. And the public broadcaster hasn't only failed to counter the propaganda of the corporate media. Because it has also exhibited clear pro-Israel bias itself in its reporting during the genocide in Gaza, particularly online. And the police have had to prevent protests outside the BBC's headquarters in London, facing a significant backlash for doing so. In the absence of a challenge from the mainstream media, Declassified did the job journalists should be doing. It questioned Basyuk about the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants, asking: Are you worried about the ICC investigating you for war crimes? Are you a war criminal? As journalist Richard Sanders said: This is absolutely standard, obvious journalism to be doing in the face of war crimes and accusations of genocide. Palestine Action has long sought to shut down UK operations that have links to Israel and its crimes. And there are currently numerous political prisoners in jail as a result of their resistance to British complicity in human rights violations. But as Declassified's John McEvoy has revealed, the action protesters have taken has been completely justifiable and necessary. Because the arms factories they've been targeting ""have been sending supplies to Israel throughout the Gaza genocide"". Keir Starmer's government has absolutely followed his Conservative predecessors' shameless support for Israeli crimes. Starmer is a national embarrassment, and has become an overtly racist spokesperson for genocidal war criminals. The RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, meanwhile, has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. As Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of ""a country which is participating"" in Israel's genocide - ""a direct participant"". Declassified has been doing its part in challenging this despicable situation, as have the Canary and other independent outlets. But the mainstream media has exposed itself as the immoral cesspit of corporate propaganda that it is. Resisting its stranglehold over Britain is an absolute moral imperative.",Canary,2025-01-24T16:05:30+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/24/oded-basyuk-israel-uk-visit/
"""Sex for shifts"": capitalist criminals McDonald's at the centre of another workers rights scandal","McDonald's is confronting renewed allegations of severe abuses of workers rights, with over 100 current and former employees reporting experiences of sexual assault, harassment, racism, homophobia, and bullying. These claims have prompted the UK parliament's Environmental Audit Committee to summon McDonald's UK chief executive, Alistair Macrow, for questioning. Meanwhile, the the TUC has hit back at what it calls the corporate giant's 'race to the bottom'. The BBC conducted an investigation revealing that employees, some as young as 17, faced inappropriate behavior from colleagues and managers. Reported incidents include sexual assault, sexually explicit remarks, homophobia, and a lack of effective response from management when complaints were raised. One former employee recounted being sexually assaulted by a senior manager, while another described a culture where such behavior was normalised. As the BBC reported, workers' claims against McDonald's include: A worker quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023, after she says managers inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she says she was told to ""suck it up"". A 16-year-old current employee based in the West Midlands says he was bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers. A female worker, 20, says a male manager sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald's branch in the East of England in August. Specifically, the BBC noted the case of Claire (not her real name). She told it that: A shift manager asked her for sex in return for extra shifts, which she refused. She was 17, he was in his 30s. ""You don't expect that to happen,"" she said. ""It was totally inappropriate."" Of course, McDonald's is notorious for zero-hours contracts. Across its businesses, including franchises, 89% of staff are on these contracts. The BBC noted that: McDonald's says workers can choose to switch to minimum guaranteed hours. But we have spoken to 50 workers across the country who say they were not given that choice. In response to these allegations, McDonald's stated that it does not tolerate harassment, abuse, or discrimination and is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace. The company highlighted its implementation of new policies and training programs aimed at preventing such behavior. However, the persistence of these issues suggests that existing measures may be insufficient. This is not the first time McDonald's has faced scrutiny over workplace practices. In 2021, the company introduced anti-harassment training following at least 50 employee-filed charges concerning workplace harassment over five years. The Environmental Audit Committee's involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation. The committee is expected to examine McDonald's corporate governance and the effectiveness of its policies in safeguarding employee welfare. This inquiry forms part of a broader evaluation of labor practices within large corporations operating in the UK. The outcome of this inquiry could have significant implications for McDonald's operations and reputation in the UK. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said: No-one should ever find themselves in the position of being asked to exchange sex for shifts. It's abhorrent - the McDonalds CEO has serious questions to answer. This investigation has exposed how sexual harassment and insecure work can go hand in hand. Zero-hours contracts create a huge imbalance of power in the workplace that leaves workers vulnerable to predatory bosses. If staff say no to their manager they face losing all of their work. This is why cracking down on exploitative working practices like zero-hours contracts and giving people stronger protections at work is so important. McDonald's is one of the largest employers in the UK. It should be setting the standard on workforce conditions - not leading a race to the bottom. The problem is - McDonald's is the epitome of the corporate capitalist race to the bottom. It's a business where the planet, biodiversity, human rights, and the rights of its workers are all far-less important than its profit margins. The fact that the BBC has uncovered yet another scandal is not a surprise. It is parasitic McDonald's operating as it is supposed to.",Canary,2025-01-07T11:30:55+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/07/mcdonalds-staff-abuse/
"Labour 'no better' than the Tories on dodgy political donations, polling finds","Capping political donations could help to reset the government's reputation, campaigners claim, as a poll shows two-thirds of the public regard the ethical standards of the Labour Party government as worse or no different than those of its predecessor. The survey, commissioned by pressure group Unlock Democracy, found that by more than four to one, the public favours limiting the amount of money individuals can donate to political parties or politicians, with support for such a move consistent across voters for all major parties. The most recent quarterly data from the Electoral Commission reveals Labour accepted over PS2 million in donations of PS15,000 or more between July and September of 2024, including PS171,000 from the former boss of Autoglass, Gary Lubner. Tom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy, said: The public is fed up with the corrosive influence of big money in politics.3 Labour will find it hard to convince voters it is serious about governing in service of working people while it continues to accept large donations from wealthy individuals and corporations. There is an opportunity here for the government to show clearly that it is different from its predecessor. At the moment, if the public perceives a difference, it's not in a good way. Two-thirds of survey respondents - including more than four in 10 Labour voters - said this government is worse (34%) or no better (31%) than the last government when it comes to behaving ethically, compared to only a quarter (25%) who think it's behaving better. Just as troublingly for a government elected on a promise to restore ""the highest standards of integrity and honesty"" to public life, one in two Labour voters see no improvement with this government in delivering on its promises. Overall, nearly half of all respondents felt Labour was worse in this regard (46%), compared to only one in five (19%) who thought it was doing better. Brake continued: Labour must address these perceptions head-on. More people think the scandals and dysfunction in politics are the fault of the broader system than believe it is only individuals to blame. Half-measures, such as the government's tweaks to rules around second jobs and enhanced ministerial code, won't cut it. Bold reform is what's needed. The government must deliver on its commitments by championing reforms that ensure those with the deepest pockets cannot wield outsized, unaccountable influence. The government has this week reaffirmed its manifesto commitment to strengthening donation rules. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee that the government was considering changes to ensure ""transparency in the process of where donations come from"". This follows MHCLG spokesperson, Lord Khan of Burnley, stating in the House of Lords last December: The government has committed to reforming political finance rules. We are considering changes that will help protect our system from foreign interference, such as tighter controls on donations. A cap on political donations forms part of a suite of measures aimed at protecting UK democracy from big money and foreign interference set out in Unlock Democracy's Democratic Integrity White Paper, a summary of which is available here.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:49:18+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/labour-political-donations/
Andy McDonald champions Labour's shoddy workers' rights bill at PMQs. Here's the facts.,"At Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Andy McDonald MP said on 15 January: The employment rights bill is urgently needed especially given the exploitation of gig workers like those retail assistants employed throughout with vital rights denied and staff being charged a premium should they want to be paid on time. Insecure work denies workers their rights but the TUC also says it costs the UK economy around PS10bn a year. So will the prime minister agree with me that having a single status of worker will help end such abusive practices, give workers security and significantly benefit the economy? UK high street retailers have been employing young assistants through gig acts that lack basic employment rights. Labour's employment rights bill doesn't include a single status of worker, which aims to guarantee rights across the economy. Keir Starmer responded: I believe everyone is entitled to fair, flexible and secure working. And that's why we introduced our employment rights bill, which is the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation. It includes measures that will end the scandal of fire and rehire, preventing exploitative zero hour contracts and introducing basic rights for workers from day one. The Labour Party's move to strengthen workers' rights is only significant because the benchmark is so low. That's partly because of anti-trade union legislation that the Tories introduced including in 2016. A report from academics for the Trade Union Congress (TUC) found that the UK presently lags behind other developed OECD countries when it comes to workers' rights. The bill is a step forward in a shoddy context. Professor Deakin, director of the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge University, said: The UK is an international outlier when it comes to worker protections. Our labour laws are significantly less protective of workers' rights than the average in the developed countries which make up the OECD. The gap is particularly marked with respect to laws on working time, employee representation, and the right to strike. The report shows that UK labor laws have been less protective of workers' rights than other developed countries since Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, the Tories, propped up by the Lib Dems, increased the period before workers are protected from unfair dismissal to two years of employment. Labour's bill remedies the unfair practice altogether through introducing protections from unfair dismissal from the beginning of employment. The bill also included piecemeal steps forward in the right to sick pay. Further, it will guarantee hours for those on zero hour contracts, if the employee wants them. The act will repeal the restrictive trade union ballot threshold for strike action that the Tories introduced in 2016. In October, Zarah Sultana MP said in parliament: We must go further and repeal every single anti-trade union bill since Thatcher It seems Labour won't be doing this - and so, everything else is piecemeal, as PMQs exposed.",Canary,2025-01-15T18:57:18+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/pmqs-15-january/
Headteachers warn of Labour's austerity 2.0 as schools face 'death by a thousand cuts',"Headteachers have intervened after a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that funding for primary and secondary schools is facing a 0.8% cut under the Labour Party government. And that's before you account for the 5% cut to each government department that chancellor Rachel Reeves quietly announced before Christmas, branded as ""efficiency savings"". The 0.8% reduction is because of a promised increase in teachers' salaries. But providing more income for undervalued teachers shouldn't come at the price of cutting resources for schools, as well as increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. Overall, the education budget already faced a 9% cut from 2010-2020. This was drastic for school sixth forms that underwent cuts of 26%. The lack of funding forced 47 school sixth forms to close from 2016-2019. Funding for colleges, meanwhile, will still be 11% lower than in 2010. Julie McCulloch, director of policy as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: This report reveals the reality that is facing many schools and colleges - yet another round of cutbacks. It will inevitably mean further reductions to pastoral support, curriculum options and classroom resources. It is also likely that in many cases class sizes will increase. Schools and colleges have been expected to absorb relentless financial pressures over the past 15 years, and they have done an incredible job in minimising the impact on students. But we cannot go on like this. It is death by a thousand cuts. The government must recognise the importance of improved investment in education. When it comes to a share of GDP, education spending has also fallen from around 5.6% of national income in 2010 to about 4.1% in 2023-24. The National Education Union (NEU) is also not happy with Labour's proposed pay increase. The government already issued a 5.5% pay increase for teachers for the 2024-25 academic year. But, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. NEU general secretary Daniel Kebede said: The current proposal of 2.8 per cent is not sufficient to even start to address the crisis in recruitment and retention. The suggestion that an unfunded pay award can be paid for by making 'efficiencies' is an insult to a profession who have already endured 14 years of austerity. Thousands of teachers voted for the change that Labour promised for education. They promised to invest in education, to recruit 6,500 teachers and to value education and to secure the life chances of our children. The austerity has gotten so bad that headteachers are taking on additional roles. Amanda Richards, the headteacher of Sytchampton primary in Worcestershire, said in April 2024 that her school ""literally can't afford"" a permanent caretaker. Richards told the Guardian: I'm 53 this year; I'm not built for lifting and shifting, to be honest with you. But there isn't anyone else to do it. Just before half-term, the toilets in our new building were blocked. So when that happens during the day, it's me who puts the marigolds on and goes down to the toilets with the plunger and tries to unblock it as best as I can. That's a fairly regular occurrence. With regard to things like DIY or maintenance for the building, we don't have anyone to do that. So we either do it ourselves, or we save up bigger jobs for someone to come in and do, because we just couldn't afford somebody to be on hand regularly as a member of staff. A survey has further found that one in six schools in England can no longer afford to employ a caretaker.",Canary,2025-01-09T19:44:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/schools-funding/
Palestine Action SMASH a van into an arms factory to STOP it killing Palestinians,"At around 5am on Tuesday 28 January, Palestine Action crashed a van into front of Teledyne Defence and Space in Shipley - yet another arms manufacturer complicit in Israel's ongoing genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The van hit the main perimeter: Activists then attached themselves to the vehicle in order to disrupt the factory's shipments of weapons parts to be used against the people of Palestine and Lebanon. The site was previously targeted twice by Palestine Action with rooftop occupations involving dismantling the factory. Before then, Palestine Action dismantled its 'Teledyne Labtech' factory at Presteigne, Wales, in 2022 where it caused PS1m in losses. The site, between 2009 and 2014, was granted at least 86 licenses for the export of weapons to Israel - mostly for 'ML11'-category military electronics equipment and 'ML4' category explosive weapons, munitions, or parts therefor. After 2014, the company's sales and licensing were handled by the parent company 'Teledyne UK', which continued to export vast quantities of ML4 and ML11 weapons to Israel as part of its 48 export licenses granted between 2014 and 2020. The American company Teledyne has a $5.6bn yearly turnover and is, along with its subsidiary ev2, the largest exporter (by volume of licenses granted) of weaponry from Britain to Israel. A significant proportion of the company's almost 200 export licenses for weapons and weapons parts to the US, 2009-2020, will also form into finished products ultimately exported to Israel. Teledyne Defence and Space, Shipley, manufactures critical components for missile systems - specifically missile filters - which will comprise the ML4 exports made yearly from the site. Teledyne Defence and Space boasts of its involvement with missile products procured by Israel, including the AGM-Harpoon, AIM-120 AMRAAM, and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles deployed by Israel against Gaza - the latter reportedly being used to strike Al-Shifa hospital. Teledyne Defence and Space also produces components for the American's Tomahawk and Patriot missiles, deployed by US forces against Yemen. The company also produces parts, including filters and multi-function assemblies, for UAVs (drones), aircraft, and radar systems, including the AN/APG-81 (AESA) type fitted in Lockheed Martin F-35 Fighter jets. Teledyne Defence and Space, solely based in Shipley, has sales representatives in Tel Aviv. Shipley-made products can be seen advertised by Ormic Components, the sales company for the Israeli military market. Teledyne, the parent company, also produces image sensors for military applications and radar technologies around the borders of the occupied West Bank and Gaza while also providing armed UAVs to Israel as far back as 1973. A recent investigation by Declassified also uncovered two shipments from the Teledyne Shipley site which were addressed ""to a location near the Israeli air force's (IAF) Hatzerim air base in the Negev desert, which houses fighter jets as well as the IAF Flight Academy"". A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We are more committed than ever before to disrupting the production of weapons used to massacre our brothers and sisters in Palestine.

"Palestine Action hit FIFTEEN (yes, 15) offices of Allianz in one night","In a coordinated wave of actions across Europe, Palestine Action struck at 15 premises of the 'Allianz' company, investors in and insurers of Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons company. Allianz's provision of Employers Liability Insurance to Elbit Systems UK renders the insurance giant deeply complicit in the genocide in Gaza, as - without insurance - Elbit could not operate in Britain. German firm Allianz, which is also a major institutional investor in Elbit, had nine of its premises struck with red paint and smashed windows on Tuesday 28 January. The actions happened across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Across Europe, actions took place against Allianz sites in Germany, Netherlands, and Portugal. This was London: Allianz suffered a similar fate in Birmingham: Glasgow got hit: As did Newcastle: The direct action campaign against Allianz launched last October, when Palestine Action visited ten branches of Allianz overnight, covering them in graffiti, and symbolic blood-red paint, in addition to occupying their offices in Guildford. As Palestine Action said then: These nationwide actions serve as a reminder that, throughout the past twelve months, Western capital has continued to profit from the mass murder of Palestinians. Then, as now, Palestine Action has called upon Allianz to drop Elbit as a client now and in the future, and to divest entirely from shareholdings in Elbit Systems. Having failed to confirm that this action was taken, further visits were made to Allianz offices in Belfast and Glasgow. Since then, Israel has continued to murder Palestinians, and others throughout the region, using weapons developed and made in Britain, by 'Elbit Systems UK' - despite ceasefires. While Elbit weaponry continues to slaughter Palestinians, the campaign will continue against the companies, including Allianz, which facilitates Elbit's weapons production. The insurance services rendered to Elbit are crucial for the maintenance of their operations, while Allianz has previously been described as Elbit's ""principle institutional shareholder"", at-one-point owning over 2% of the company, and to-this-day continuing to hold thousands of shares in Elbit Systems Ltd. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: Palestine Action's campaign to remove Israel's weapons trade from Britain will continue to use the necessary means, direct action, against Elbit and the companies that aid, abet, and profit from the slaughter of Palestinians. As Allianz prioritises the value of profits over the lives of Palestinians, we will ensure they lose more than they gain by working with the Israeli weapons maker.",Canary,2025-01-29T16:50:37+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/29/palestine-action-allianz-israel/
"DWP WCA consultation broke the law - yet Labour planning on making the Tories' changes, anyway","On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled - but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) - which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around PS416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths - this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The DWP misrepresented the reforms as a way to give more disabled people support into work, citing figures that said 20% of people in the LCWRA group had said ""would like to work at some point in the future"". Of course, they conveniently ignore the 80% who disagreed with this and that just 4% said they would be able to start work now if the right job and support were available. The consultation received a massive pushback from disabled people, who could see it for what it was: a cost-cutting measure designed to force people back into work and score points in the next election. Clifford and Aoife O'Reilly from the Public Law Project, who was acting as her representation, argued that the consultation was unlawful on many grounds. Firstly, the consultation did not explain that many disabled claimants impacted by the reforms would receive significantly less money and in some cases, be required to meet stringent conditions or be at risk of sanctions if they did not meet them. O'Reilly also argued that the primary motive for the reforms - to reduce DWP spending - had not been disclosed. She argued that the consultation had led people to believe the aim was to help people into work, without actually providing any evidence as to how they planned to do so. Lastly, the team crucially argued that the consultation had been unlawful as it ran for just under 8 weeks, which didn't give DDPOs adequate time to respond. Government consultations typically run for six-to-twelve weeks. Over the course of the judicial review, internal DWP documents revealed several damning things. Firstly, the DWP had not actually done any sort of impact assessment on the WCA proposals, prior to the consultation being launched. This is despite the fact that civil servants had, based on internal estimates, identified that almost 100,000 people would be pushed into poverty if they went ahead. There was an equality impact assessment that was done after the launch of the consultation, but that has never been published. Civil servants were also aware that the proposals would have a particularly strong effect on people with preexisting mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. Proposals made by civil servants on what changes to consult on were instead based on the financial benefits. Internal documents reveal that ""the Prime Minister [at the time Rishi Sunak] indicated that the DWP should consult on reforms to the WCA gateway in time to score them for the Autumn Statement..."" The narrative around how easy home working was for disabled people seemingly came out of the DWP and realised that the WCA proposals would be ""perceived as purely cost-saving measures by influential disability rights groups"" this led to recommendations that ""a wider narrative based on modern and home working"" was also developed. Internal documents demonstrate that DWP boss at the time Mel Stride had considered including particular proposals as part of the consultation, because it could be ""useful"" to play into the idea that the motivation for consultation was the importance of getting more people into work and not saving money. Mr Justice Calver ruled that the consultation was ""rushed"", ""misleading"" and ""so unfair as to be unlawful"". He described the DWP a relying upon a ""false rationale"", in the consultation. It also did not inform people about the ""substantial"" financial loss claimants would face. He said that the evidence which had been presented before him: Strongly supported the conclusion that costs savings was at least one of the two bases, if not the central basis, on which decisions would be taken on which policies would be taken forward by the Government. The judge also said considered that the DWP should have made this fact clear and that ""disclosure of this highly relevant fact, was required"". Calver ruled that the consultation time was ""unlawfully short"" given not only the importance of the subject but based on the fact that the DWP was also at the time running a significant consultation on the Disability Action Plan. This was particularly unexpected as the DWP had only just published the Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper. Mr Justice Calver observed: The unfair burden upon vulnerable people of having to deal with a yet further consultation process at this time at such short notice cannot be overstated. In setting the consultation period, the Defendant ought to have had more regard to the attributes of those people who would be affected by these proposals. These were proposals which, in particular, could potentially drive vulnerable people into poverty as well as adversely affecting disabled people and substantial risk claimants who have mental health conditions and suicide ideation. Disabled activist Paula Peters, who was outside the court for the ruling, said: It's been a rollercoaster of emotions today, bittersweet sadness as we remember all disabled people we've lost to the WCA process. Relief that justice was served and that the judge overseeing this judicial review said the WCA Consultation was radically wrong and didn't take into account the impact on disabled people's lives. In her statement outside court, Ellen said she was ""overjoyed and very emotional"" about the judgement: When I heard the judgement, I was reminded of all of those who we gave lost and all of those who we don't know who have died - countless people who've died as a result to cuts and changes to their benefits and other austerity measures. But today Mr Justice Calver has recognised the unfair of a government consultation that deliberately set out to mislead and to disguise the potentially devastating impacts that these particular changes would have on disabled people. Well, despite the ruling the government wouldn't legally be required to completely get rid of the DWP plans to make the lives of those subject to the WCA hell. That's probably why the DWP has confirmed today they will be redoing the consultation. In a statement a spokesperson for the DWP told the Canary (and the rest of the media): The judge has found the previous government failed to adequately explain their proposals. As part of wider reforms that help people into work and ensure fiscal sustainability, the government will re-consult on the WCA descriptor changes, addressing the shortcomings in the previous consultation, in light of the judgment. The government intends to deliver the full level of savings in the public finance's forecasts. This is interesting. Although they're being upfront about it being ""savings"" motivated, they're still not being transparent about how the cuts would affect people. A big takeaway is also that they're still seemingly intent on changing the goalposts of what the descriptors will mean and who will qualify to be unfit for work. Just as many disabled activists worried, a Labour-led DWP is no better than a Conservative one. But disabled people are prepared to fight them on this too. Clifford said in her statement: We know the government is hellbent on attacking disabled people and essential incomes we need to survive, in order to manage the economy better than they are at the moment. As Peters said: We hope this legal victory gives disabled people across the UK hope that disabled campaigners are fighting back, prepared to take government on and bring change about"" Speaking of the fears of disabled people facing both cuts and the Assisted Suicide Bill, Clifford said: This is not how any democracy should treat its most disadvantaged members; we fight on together.",Canary,2025-01-16T16:45:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/dwp-wca-court-verdict/
The Scottish government has 'abjectly failed' over ordinary people's access to justice,"Environmental charities including the RSPB and the Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS) have called out the Scottish government's 'abject failure' to meet the access to justice requirements of the UN Aarhus Convention. In 2021, the Convention's compliance committee gave Scotland six recommendations to remove barriers that are preventing people from taking environmental cases to court. The UK's final progress report confirms none of the recommendations have been met and it remains 'prohibitively expensive' to access justice. Scotland, as part of the UK, is a signatory to the Aarhus Convention, a UN treaty that guarantees people's rights to access information, participate in decision-making and access justice in environmental matters. Following the most recent ruling of non-compliance by the Convention's governing bodies in 2021, the Scottish government was required to make access to justice affordable, reform time limits for judicial review and reform planning permissions by the deadline of 1 October 2024. Yet the UK's Final Progress Report to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC) confirmed that Scotland has made only minor modifications to legal expenses and no concrete commitments for future reform. Comments on the UK report, submitted jointly by the RSPB, ERCS and Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, have been scathing in their assessment of government action to date, with signatories remarking that they are 'deeply concerned and frustrated that, as a whole, the UK has failed to make any tangible progress'. For the past two years, Scottish legal experts have been raising concerns about the Scottish government's lack of progress in removing barriers to environmental justice. Campaigners held a rally outside the Court of Session to mark the 1 October deadline, with speakers urging the Scottish government to ensure citizens can hold public bodies and polluters to account for environmental harm. Access to justice remains unaffordable for two main reasons. First, it is incredibly difficult to access legal aid for environmental cases. Second, the 'loser pays' rule means that litigants are liable to pay their opponents fees if they lose their case which can cost tens of thousands of pounds. The ACCC has clearly stated that this causes a 'chilling effect' - deterring individuals and organisations taking legal action, even if they have a strong case to do so. Shivali Fifield, Chief Officer at ERCS, said: Upholding our environmental rights in court is the ultimate guarantee of the rule of law. Without this credible threat, polluters can act with impunity. Scotland, as part of the UK, has been a signatory to the Aarhus Convention for nearly two decades, but despite repeated warnings from legal experts and campaigners, it has a record of abject failure when it comes to delivering the reforms needed to guarantee access to justice for environmental cases. After years of broken promises, it would be easy to think that the government is threatened by adhering to international law and making access to justice affordable. If they truly believe in community empowerment and a just transition to net zero, they must make our legal system work for people and planet. Aedan Smith, Head of Policy & Advocacy at RSPB Scotland, said: Scotland is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world and we are continuing to lose nature, with 1 in 9 species at risk of national extinction. Yet, despite welcome progress to improve some legal protections for nature over recent years, it remains extremely difficult for individuals and community groups to challenge poor decisions. The Scottish Government must urgently address this to ensure the laws it has introduced can be implemented effectively and as intended.",Canary,2025-01-13T17:07:17+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/scotland-access-to-justice/
How Brexit and Immigration Changes Are Creating a Skills Gap in the UK,"The UK faces increasing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals, exacerbated by shifts in, and far-right rhetoric around, immigration policy and the impact of Brexit. These factors have shaped the dynamics of inbound migration, contributing to growing concerns about skills shortages across industries. Understanding the role of immigration policies, the effect of Brexit, and the resulting skills gap is essential for addressing this issue. The UK's departure from the EU has significantly altered migration patterns, particularly for skilled workers from the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Under the new immigration framework, European nationals are subject to the same visa requirements as non-European nationals, which has reduced the ease of movement for workers who previously filled vital roles in the UK. Before Brexit, the healthcare sector heavily relied on EU nationals, who made up a large proportion of its workforce. According to the NHS, recruitment from the EU has slowed dramatically since the end of free movement, compounding pre-existing staffing shortages. The Skilled Worker Visa has partially mitigated this by enabling those in recognised healthcare roles to apply for a Health and Care Worker visa, which enables those eligible to pay reduced visa fees and benefit from reduced minimum salary thresholds. Nonetheless, administrative hurdles such as the need to secure sponsorship, combined with the UK's departure from the EU, have deterred many professionals from applying. The construction and engineering industries have also been impacted. EU workers were a key source of labour, particularly for roles requiring mid-level skills that often do not meet the minimum salary thresholds required under the current Immigration Rules. Many UK organisations also relied on short-term labour from the EU, with specialist workers travelling to the UK to undertake short work assignments. UK employers are now struggling to fill vacancies, which in turn is delaying projects and increasing recruitment costs. Sectors such as hospitality and agriculture, which rely on seasonal and lower-wage workers, have been particularly affected. Despite the introduction of short-term visas for some agricultural roles, businesses have reported difficulties accessing sufficient labour to meet demand.. The current immigration system recognises that high-skilled workers can be sponsored, but it imposes strict requirements that limit access to the international workforce. The general salary threshold of PS38,700 and skill level requirements exclude many mid-level roles. Employers also face high costs, including visa application fees, the Immigration Skills Charge, and the Immigration Health Surcharge, which collectively increase the financial burden of hiring international workers. The end of free movement has reduced the pool of available workers from the EU, particularly in industries where EU nationals previously accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce. For example, the hospitality and construction sectors have seen a notable decline in applications from EU citizens, leading to unfilled vacancies. Brexit-related uncertainty has made the UK less attractive to international professionals, with many professionals wanting to secure EU citizenship - along with the benefits this brings - as opposed to British citizenship. The Government's clear focus on reducing immigration also makes the UK less attractive to those considering emigrating to another country for work. Skills shortages hinder productivity, delay projects, and increase operational costs for businesses. The construction and engineering sectors, which are essential for infrastructure development, face growing difficulties meeting demand. Similarly, reduced staffing in healthcare and hospitality has affected service delivery and customer satisfaction. Employers report greater difficulty in filling vacancies, particularly for mid-level and seasonal roles. This has increased reliance on domestic workers, where available, and has driven up costs for recruitment and training. Businesses are also exploring automation and outsourcing as potential solutions, but these options are not always viable. The UK's ability to position itself as a global leader in technology, research, and innovation is at risk. Skilled professionals are critical for advancing key industries, and difficulties in attracting international talent could stifle growth in emerging fields such as renewable energy and artificial intelligence. Streamlining visa processes and reducing associated costs could help attract skilled workers from abroad. Expanding the Immigration Salary List (previously known as the Shortage Occupation List) to include more roles and lowering salary thresholds for specific industries could also ease immediate pressures. Targeted visa schemes for mid-level roles, such as those in hospitality and agriculture, could address gaps in these sectors. Investing in domestic talent is essential for long-term resilience. Enhanced apprenticeships, vocational training, and partnerships between industries and educational institutions can equip UK workers with the skills needed to fill critical roles. Since winning the General Election, Labour has confirmed its plan to upskill the domestic workforce in order to reduce immigration, and Sir Keir Starmer has recently confirmed that those who sponsor skilled workers will be expected to train people from the local labour market. To address the decline in EU migration, the UK could introduce specific incentives for EU nationals, such as reduced visa fees or streamlined pathways to residency. Recognising professional qualifications from EU countries could also simplify the process of hiring EU-based talent. Earlier this year, the UK Government was involved in discussions enabling the free movement of young people aged between 18 and 30 between the UK and EU (also known as the Youth Mobility Scheme), but thus far, the Government has rejected the possibility of extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to include EU nationals. Creating a more appealing environment for skilled professionals by enhancing working conditions and offering flexible arrangements could reduce the desire to leave the UK. In this regard, the Government has published the Employment Rights Bill, aimed at upgrading the rights of workers to improve work conditions. Policies aimed at improving quality of life, such as affordable housing and access to public services, may also help retain talent. Brexit has undeniably reshaped the UK's workforce, creating new challenges for industries reliant on skilled professionals. While government initiatives such as the Skilled Worker visa and Global Business Mobility visa routes offer partial solutions, more comprehensive measures are required to address the root causes of skills shortages. A balanced approach that combines targeted immigration reforms, domestic workforce investment, and quality-of-life improvements will be necessary to ensure the UK remains competitive in attracting and retaining talent. Collaboration between government, businesses, and educational institutions will be key to developing sustainable strategies for mitigating the impact of these changes.
