Corbyn and McDonnell leave police station after being INTERVIEWED UNDER CAUTION by Met,"Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have been interviewed under caution by the Met Police. It was over the force’s alleged lies about events at the pro-Palestine march on Saturday 18 January. Meanwhile, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) has hit back at the Met – accusing the police of falsifying events. BBC News reportedly found out that: MPs Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have agreed to be interviewed under caution by police following a pro-Palestinian rally in central London on Saturday, the BBC understands. The former Labour leader, 75, and former shadow chancellor, 73, will voluntarily attend a police station in the capital as the Metropolitan Police investigates what it says was a coordinated effort by organisers to breach conditions imposed on the event. They will be interviewed on Sunday afternoon. Sky News were ahead of the rest of the corporate media – ‘doorstopping’ the two MPs after they were interviewed: This evocative image also now bears further relevance: As the Canary previously reported, people at the march are saying that no one forced their way through the police line. People are claiming that the police agreed to it. Corbyn’s response to the Met was: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. So, people on X hit back at the cops interviewing Corbyn and McDonnell: Meanwhile, the PSC has issued the following statement about the Met Police’s actions on 18 January. The Metropolitan Police has promoted a misleading narrative about the events in Whitehall and Trafalgar Square, claiming that a peaceful delegation pushed through police lines in an attempt to justify their repressive actions on Saturday 18 January. This could not be further from the truth. On Saturday 18 January, we organised a rally on Whitehall to call for a permanent end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Despite our long-standing record of peaceful demonstrations, the police, under political pressure from pro-Israel groups, banned our planned march to the BBC. In response, we announced plans for a rally and a peaceful protest against this anti-democratic ban. Ahead of the rally, we publicly called on the police to rescind the restrictions they had imposed and allow our march to go ahead. We had also made clear that if they refused to do so we would hold a rally and protest against the ban as part of that rally. The police were fully aware of these statements and our intentions. On the day, we were confronted with extremely heavy-handed and aggressive policing. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the police had imposed a series of complex restrictions preventing people from assembling at various points on Whitehall at various times of the day – notably an area at the centre of Whitehall from which rally participants were excluded for part of the day to allow space for a children’s marching band to proceed up and down. As a result, a number of people were arrested without warning, on flimsy pretexts including simply for inadvertently standing in this central area at the wrong time. We understand that a total of 77 people were arrested on the day, 66 of them for alleged violations of these orders. At the end of the rally, it was announced from the stage that, as an act of protest against the police ban, a delegation of organisers and rally speakers – including an 87-year-old Jewish Holocaust survivor, politicians including MPs, and prominent cultural figures – would walk silently and peacefully towards the BBC. It was clearly stated that the delegation expected to be stopped by the police and that no attempt would be made to push through police lines – the delegation would simply leave the flowers they were carrying at the feet of the police and disperse in an orderly and dignified manner. They anticipated being stopped at the line of police that had been constructed at the top of Whitehall. When the delegation reached this police line, they were not stopped as expected but were instead invited to proceed into Trafalgar Square by the police who said, ‘please filter through.’ When the delegation reached the other end of the square, they encountered a line of police which prevented them from going any further. They formally requested that the delegation – a maximum of 25 people – be allowed to proceed. The police officer in charge said he would need to ‘pass this up the line for a decision.’ While the delegation was awaiting that response, the police violently and for no apparent reason arrested the chief steward of the rally, Chris Nineham. At this point, the delegation laid their flowers as they had said they would do and dispersed, and Ben Jamal and Ismail Patel used a megaphone to call on the crowd that had gathered around them to do the same, which people then did. At no stage was there any organised breach of the conditions imposed by the police. There is a large amount of video evidence confirming all of these events. This is a direct assault on freedom of assembly and democracy. The police’s actions, including their false statements after the event, are deeply troubling. We demand the immediate release of all those arrested and remain resolute in our campaign for freedom and justice for the Palestinian people.",Canary,2025-01-19T17:21:00+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-mcdonnell-met-police/
People rally at the Old Bailey in support of the Palestine Action Filton 18,"Some of the Palestine Action activists from the so-called Filton 18 appeared at the Old Bailey on Friday 17 January over an action at a weapons factory that supplies genocidal Israel. Of course, they entered not guilty to the charges the state was brining against them – and they also received huge support from crowds waiting outside. In a hearing at the Old Bailey, nine of the ‘Filton 18’ political prisoners have entered ‘not guilty’ pleas on all charges put before them, while supporters amassed in solidarity outside of the court. They were called to court to plea to charges after an action in August 2024 at the Filton, Bristol site of Israel’s largest weapons company Elbit Systems. Outside of the hearing, supporters of the Palestine Action activists gathered outside in solidarity: Palestinian flags were waved: While people rallied: Predictably, the Met Police were in attendance: Supporters waved off members of the Filton 18 as they left the hearing: All 18 face charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage, with some of the 18 additionally facing charges of violent disorder. Six activists were arrested on site for an action that saw them breach the site using a modified van, before dismantling weapons of genocide inside, including ‘quadcopter’ drone models. 12 further people were later arrested and remanded to prison for their alleged involvement. Police have justified their continued detention by alleging that their actions have a ‘terrorism connection’. The rest of the 18 are expected to enter not guilty pleas later this year. A spokesperson for Palestine Action said: We refuse to bow to this continued police intimidation and harassment. It is Elbit, Israel’s largest weapons company, that is the guilty party: those resisting the UK’s complicity in genocide are not. The activists have been returned to prison by the judge and are currently awaiting appeal hearings for bail which have been thus-far rejected. Of the 18, 10 have spent over five months in prison since August, with an additional eight detained since November. At the hearing, the judge confirmed that their case shall be seen with the 18 split across three trial dates, the first taking place in November 2025, the second in May 2026 and the final date is currently unknown. An additional date is yet to be set in March of this year, when the defence will seek to challenge and dismiss the application of a “terror connection” in this case. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton 18 case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy.",Canary,2025-01-19T15:02:29+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/filton-18-trial/
Jeremy Corbyn slams Met Police's wilful 'inaccuracies' following mass-arrests at Palestine march,"On Saturday 18 January, Britons once again took to the streets to show their support for the people of Palestine. As is unfortunately common in Britain, the peaceful march was beset by what some have described as “fascist” police violence. The Met Police also arrested 77 people, with former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn criticising their excuse for doing so: Corbyn’s response to the Met Police in full reads: This is not an accurate description of events at all. I was part of a delegation of speakers, who wished to peacefully carry and lay flowers in memory of children in Gaza who had been killed. This was facilitated by the police. We did not force our way through. When we reached Trafalgar Square, we informed police that we would go no further, lay down flowers and disperse. At that point, the Chief Steward, Chris Nineham was arrested. We then turned back and dispersed. I urge the police to release all bodycam footage and retract its misleading account of events. Corbyn’s former shadow chancellor also commented on the situation: According to the National, an internal police investigation is now under way. The outlet also carries the following response from the Met: We have policed more than 20 national protests organised by the PSC since October 2023. This is the highest number of arrests we have seen, in response to the most significant escalation in criminality. We could not have been clearer about the conditions in place. Protesters were to remain in Whitehall with no march towards the BBC. Our relationship with protest organisers has to be based on trust and good faith. If they say they will act responsibly and lawfully we need to be able to know those are genuine assurances. That is why it was so deeply disappointing to see a deliberate effort, involving organisers of the demonstration, to breach the conditions and attempt to march out of Whitehall. Officers responded bravely and decisively, ensuring they got no further than Trafalgar Square and certainly nowhere near their target. I am quite confident this was a coordinated breach with the intention being to reach the BBC at Portland Place in defiance of the conditions. There is video footage of one of the organisers clearly inciting the crowd to join a march and one of the organisations involved has released a statement this evening confirming as much. At the same time as the group was attempting to force its way past police lines, camera crews were seen arriving in Portland Place. It is unlikely that the timing was simply a coincidence. We are in possession of footage from officers’ body worn cameras, from CCTV and from social media. We know who was involved in leading the movement of so many people through police lines. Investigations are now underway and we will make every effort to bring prosecutions against those we identify. Speaking on the arrested Chris Nineham, Corbyn said: Earlier this week, the world received the news that there would be a ceasefire between the invading Israel and the invaded Gaza. Speaking on this at the march, Corbyn said: Corbyn also made it clear what more there is to be done: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDC) movement released an article responding to the ceasefire: (1) From ceasefire to ceasing the genocide The Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), the largest coalition in Palestinian society that is leading the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, welcomes the news of a ceasefire agreement with immense relief. A ceasefire, however, is only the most important first step to end the genocide against the 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied and besieged Gaza Strip. Without massive pressure, it may constitute a continuation of a less visible form of genocide that Israel and the US hope will provoke less regional and global outrage, boycotts and sanctions. After all, Israel’s genocide, armed, funded and shielded from accountability by the colonial West, intentionally reduced the illegally occupied Gaza Strip into an unlivable territory by destroying life-sustaining conditions designed to cause continued mass loss of Palestinian lives and spread of infectious diseases as well as famine or food insecurity for years to come, while attempting to force as many Palestinians as possible into exile. According to UN human rights experts, this genocide has included “domicide, urbicide, scholasticide, medicide, cultural genocide and, more recently, ecocide.” The devastating effects of all these crimes, as well as the Israeli-induced starvation, will continue to kill thousands more Palestinians due to the immense carnage and Israel’s wilful destruction of life-sustaining conditions across Gaza. Only massive global pressure, especially in the form of BDS, can truly contribute to ending Israel’s genocide and support the Palestinian struggle to dismantle Israeli apartheid. The full article presents their plan for continuing to apply pressure to Israel and the Western powers which support them. Campaign Against the Arms Trade also made a statement about the ceasefire (written before it was fully agreed by both sides). Their statement makes it clear that while this is a positive development, the many decades of oppression that the Palestinians have suffered show us we shouldn’t turn our eyes away now: We welcome the news of a potential ceasefire in Gaza- anything that could bring an end to the horrors inflicted on Palestinian people is a ray of hope. However, the promised ceasefire has not yet been agreed, let alone tested, and there is no guarantee that the planned ‘second phase’ of the agreement, leading to a permanent end to the current war, will be sealed. Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, with the full complicity of the US and UK governments. Even in the best case scenario, Palestinian people in Gaza are facing a humanitarian catastrophe and environmental devastation. Homes and infrastructure are in ruins, hospitals and healthcare destroyed and people are facing starvation and disease. The genocide will continue, even without dropping bombs, unless Palestinian people are given full access to aid and the resources to rebuild. Israel has shown it has utter contempt for international humanitarian law (IHL). Even our government admits that it assesses Israel is not committed to complying with IHL. Even if there is a ceasefire, it is still breaching IHL in its actions in the occupied territories. Even if the bombs stop dropping, Israel will be breaching IHL if it does not allow aid into Gaza. While a ceasefire would be positive progress, the conflict will not be resolved while Israel and its allies deny the humanity and rights of the Palestinian people. Recognising the state of Palestine is the only path to a just peace, the only path to realising the rights and autonomy of Palestinians. Now is the time to keep up the pressure. Israel is still committing genocide with the full complicity of our government. We need to keep demanding a full two-way arms embargo. A genuine, long-lasting peace can only be achieved when we stop the flow of arms sales. Now is the time to make sure our government knows that a ceasefire doesn’t mean it is business as usual for arms dealers. It must not reinstate the few licenses it suspended. Now is the time to keep standing with the Palestinian people. Footage from the march showed thousands of people coming together to peacefully show support for Palestinians: However, some footage shows there was violence. It’s alleged that the police instigated this due to a protester filming their actions, which is what the following video appears to show: If the police officers had a legitimate reason for arresting this person, it’s not made clear in the video. Instead they demand that marchers questioning their actions “go away” and that they’ll be “locked up”. On the same day that the Met arrested 77 marchers, Declassified published the following article: The piece highlights the well-established links between British/American police forces and Israel, and these links shouldn’t come as a surprise. America and its followers support Israel because it suits American interests, and Israel in turn does what it can to support the control that Western governments have over their citizens. In other words, you shouldn’t be surprised when the British establishment comes down heavy on peaceful protesters who are siding with the victims of a genocide. It’s all the same system; it’s all the same violence; we’re just spared from the worst of it over here. For now, anyway. But that won’t hold true forever if the people in charge can get away with increasingly depraved acts of mass violence.",Canary,2025-01-19T14:01:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/19/corbyn-met-police-palestine-march/
The blame game: the rise in false allegations of maternal abuse in long Covid and disability,"With Donald Trump’s election in the US, a wave of uncertainty has swept the globe: for the environment, gender, war, and health. However, the undermining of women’s rights has become a major theme throughout the presidential campaign. As we lurch further into climate breakdown and instability, the further society sways to the far right – just as the world did after the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918. A place where simple answers are easier to stomach than a complex reality, the vulnerable are seen as disposable, and there’s always someone else to blame – not least, in this context, with long Covid. Here we are focusing on laying the blame on women; the blame on mothers. Austerity, a ragged and inflexible NHS, a pandemic, an unfit SEND system and policy changes have led to an increase in false safeguarding accusations – almost always against the mother. Nevertheless, the framework and systemic tendency for medical misogyny is rooted in the beginnings of medicine. It is a conservative, top-down, and authoritarian structure built on strong foundations of patriarchy and patrimony. The Cerebra Report (2023) by Clements and Aiello found allegations of Fabricated Induced Illness (FII) against parents of disabled children were widespread, often causing devastating and lifelong family trauma. It’s one thing to go for help and not find any medical care. It’s another to be blamed for your child’s disability and illness. Clements discovered parents with disabilities were four times more likely to face accusations compared to non-disabled parents. The pandemic continues to leave in its wake a monstrous wasteland of chronic illness. One of those hydras is long Covid. In the early days of Covid, we were reassured that children were not affected, and post-acute viral disease was not even mentioned. Yet, these were simple answers for a complex situation. In March 2024, the ONS found that over 111,000 children have long Covid: a devastating, multi-system disease. Denial and the desire for normalcy have led to more families facing traumatic safeguarding referrals in an effort to divert blame and avoid institutional responsibility. This is nothing new in the world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), disability, and chronic illness. The LeAP research program found social care policies in the UK assume parental failings as a default position. One in five families with a child with ME faced false claims resulting in child protection involvement. Families with children with long Covid now find themselves inheritors of a precarious and dangerous system. But how has this become so ubiquitous in medicine that it barely registers as a concern for healthcare professionals? Again, we come back to systemic problems: medics overstretched and alienated from patients; education that rarely covers post-acute viral illness; a protective and anti-whistleblower culture; a root bias towards acute illness, and an ingrained attitude denigrating ME and many chronic illnesses medicine deems unexplainable. Another key reason for this growing problem is psychiatric trespass. “Within the field of liaison psychiatry and psychosomatics, CFS, CFS/ME, IBS, FM, CI, CS, EI and a number of other conditions, for example, chronic Lyme disease, are bundled under the so-called “Functional Somatic Syndromes” (FSS) and “Medically Unexplained Syndromes” (MUS) umbrellas”.  DSM-5 Working Group, DX Revision Watch. And here is the problem. In courses, textbooks, and cultural assumptions, we have the pernicious belief that medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and its other forms have psychiatric factors. Which is why professionals can be so quick to call in child protection. Because if you have a mentally disturbed mother, that child is in danger and safeguarding action is needed. With ME/CFS and long Covid often assumed to be MUS or a Perplexing Presentation (PP) it is clear there’s a growing risk to children and families. However, it is a blunt instrument – with the majority of all safeguarding referrals unfounded and causing untold damage. Action for ME found that 70% of cases were dropped in a year. Tymes Trust has been involved in over 140 cases; none resulted in a guilty verdict. The Cerebra Report found that 84% cases were abandoned or had no follow up. Dr. Nigel Speight, involved in over 200 cases over the last 25 years, said: In c.98% of all the other cases, proceedings were aborted without a court order and the case eventually closed. Some of these cases had to experience prolonged social work involvement, albeit with no real threat of removal. It is this wild, free-reign that psychiatry and the DSM-5 have that is so dangerous. It can claim, without evidence, any poorly understood disorder without due warranty, into psychological abnormality due to its broad reclassification of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the DSM-5. It’s such a vast overreach that psychologists have classed up to 23% of the population as having maladaptive thoughts connected to physical symptoms. Long Covid, ME, and other long-term illnesses can easily be given a psychiatric SSD diagnosis. In the book Cracked, Dr James Davies states: first we named a so-called medical disorder before it has identified any pathological basis in the body. So even when there’s no biological evidence that a mental disorder exists, that disorder can still enter the DSM and become part of our medical culture. However, it is not just the DSM-5. ME is in the liaison psychiatry and functional somatic syndromes of a major textbook, Kumar and Clarke’s Clinical Medicine. It is no wonder why women with ME can be sectioned so easily or starved to death. Another way psychiatry has overreached is that the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) have included PP and MUS as an alerting sign for FII in their guidance. There are fundamental issues here. One being that the RCPCH alerting signs are not derived from any peer-reviewed research. This amalgamation of conditions is increasing unlawful adverse discrimination at an alarming rate. Yet the RCPCH does not recognise the harm caused by false allegations. Even the British Association of Social Workers state in its FII Practice Guide: If social workers were to follow the RCPCH guidance, the proposed assessment criterion for FII is likely to cast suspicion on many families who are not harming their children, including children and young people with disabilities and illnesses that are undiagnosed. FII is an accepted very rare condition. Gullon-Scott and Long estimated between 53-376 cases in the UK and that the RCPCH guidelines lead to an extraordinary number of false positives. But it is the human story that we need to remember. One mother with a child with long Covid and who experienced unfounded safeguarding proceedings said: Hearing that I was abusing my daughter because she was using a wheelchair due to fatigue and pain, and doing my own research on how to manage her symptoms after being repeatedly being gaslit by medical professionals, was devastating for both myself and my daughter. After constant fighting for care and support for her for over 18 months, I was broken and my daughter lost all remaining trust in any medical professionals, her school and all professionals The trauma for families cannot be understated. It’s more complicated than saying those with MUS and PP are mentally ill. We can see from this presentation by professor Stokes that there is an assumption of a mix of physical, psychological, and behavioural factors and how embedded the culture of patient blame is in medicine. However, this is an old, old trope – one that has delayed treatment and research for decades, especially for women, due to the prejudice that their emotional lives are caught up in their biological illnesses. In many ways, it is a perfect storm. The reaction to the pandemic through educational government policy has been to zealously focus on attendance. A narrative of parent blame and anxiety has been perpetuated, so the foundations do not have to be fixed. Children in schools remain unprotected from airborne illness. The updated (September 2024) statutory government guidance, ‘Keeping Children Safe in Education’ changed the phrase ‘deliberately missing’ education to ‘unexplainable and/or persistent absence’ in relation to safeguarding. It is another pressure point where, in the omission of policy on long Covid, there is an increased risk of unsubstantiated child protection. Schools are now expected to inform social workers for any unexplained absence. There is a dearth of high-quality research, medical education, and specialism in long Covid. Yet we have a situation where it’s easier to point the finger at families, at women. We become the scapegoats, a simple answer for a complex problem – all to avoid humility in the face of responsibility. It is clear that we need action on multiple levels: a thorough change of medical literature and guidance to close loopholes; high-quality paediatric research, and a drastic shift in culture. We live in a connected world where politics, medicine, and social forces collide. We are more likely to experience pandemics because of the destruction of the environment. Yet the political response to climate breakdown and pandemic fallout has been a rise in populism. It supplies simple answers, shifts the blame game on to the individual – all to avoid institutional due diligence. It is no wonder that women have been caught in the crosshairs. We have become an easy target for complex problems.",Canary,2025-01-19T12:51:45+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/fii-long-covid/
Starmer ends a disastrous week with his most ridiculous pledge yet,"Prime minister Keir Starmer has had another bad week. While pretty much all of his weeks in power have gone badly, they haven’t all ended with a punchline. That’s because this week closed with the struggling Starmer declaring his intention to remain as prime minister for 10 years. 10 years! The man hasn’t finished one year yet, and as things stand a majority of Britons hope that he doesn’t: The biggest calamity for Starmer this week was also a welcome yet temporary reprieve for sick and disabled people. As Rachel Charlton-Dailey wrote for the Canary: On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The real sting in the tail to this story was how Starmer reacted to the court loss, with Starmer going out of his way to impress the rancid British tabloids, as the Sun gleefully reported: Asked if he had the “stomach or the balls” to take on his squeamish MPs who have railed against benefits cuts for years, the PM insisted: “Yes. I love fights. I had to fight to get the leadership of the Labour Party, had to fight to win the election.” Some like Raphael Dogg ridiculed the idea that Starmer is a ‘fighter’: While Starmer may be winning friends at the Sun – a newspaper which has been in decline for years – he’s not winning support from the electorate: Oh, and he’s also not really winning friends at the Sun: Starmer’s war on sick and disabled people contrasted poorly with comments he made on Ukraine: As many have pointed out, Starmer is happy to pledge unwavering support to an endless foreign conflict while simultaneously cutting DWP funds in his war against Britain’s disabled population: And now for the punchline. Politico interviewed Starmer during his recent trip to Ukraine. Reportedly, Starmer told them: “We are now, what, four and a half years before the next election,” Starmer said, sitting at a table for dinner in a traditional Ukrainian restaurant in Kyiv. “I remind myself that four and a half years ago, Boris Johnson was prime minister with very high ratings and most commentators were saying he’s going to be prime minister for the next 10 years. So I am a great believer in taking each step as it comes, facing each challenge as it comes, keeping my eye on the long term and not getting distracted by the noises off.” We’re sure he does remind himself of that; we’re sure he reminds himself every day given the disastrous polling and openly-expressed disgust of the public. Just look: And as our favourite analyst on Twitter also pointed out: As James Foster rightly notes, Starmer became leader of the Labour Party by lying. He then became prime minister of the country by lying again: The problem with lying to take power is that you can’t keep getting away with it. There are some who will happily eat up the lies; they’re just not doing a good job of making those lies palatable to anyone else: Starmer doesn’t understand that while you can get away with telling people ‘I will deliver’; you can’t get away with delivering people shit once you’re in power. Not as a Labour politician, anyway. He looks to Boris Johnson, but Johnson and his Tory Party had most of the media backing them up. Starmer has no one on his side except Keir Starmer and the soulless toadies in his cabinet – the least convincing people in the country. So, is it genuinely ridiculous for Starmer to think he can win another election? The short answer is ‘yes’; the long answer is ‘ha ha ha ha ha, yes’. This is what it looks like when the PM walks around the UK right now: And this is what the public is telling him: Starmer is the worst leader the Labour Party has ever produced – a vacuous non-entity who exists solely to siphon money from public services to private bank accounts. We don’t know how long he’ll last as prime minister, but we do know there’ll be serious talk of him going if this year’s local elections go as badly as people are predicting.",Canary,2025-01-19T11:34:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/19/starmer-new-policy/
It didn't take long. The British public now believe Keir Starmer should resign as prime minister.,"It’s little over five months since the Labour Party won the election. Yet a majority of the UK public are now opting for Keir Starmer to resign as prime minister, according to YouGov. 40% of respondents think he should resign, while 36% think he should remain and 24% don’t know. Further, Starmer has a net favourability rating of -38. But many who are sick of the two party status quo see Nigel Farage’s Reform as a viable alternative, partly through years of corporate media boosting his profile. In a recent poll for YouGov on voting intention, Farage’s Reform was just one point behind Labour. It had Starmer’s Labour on 26%, Reform on 25% and the Conservatives trailing on 22%. The surge of Reform underscores the need for the progressive left to unite, potentially under an umbrella group to defeat the far right. In France, the New Popular Front – a broad alliance of the left, centre left, communists and Greens – received the most votes in the 2024 parliamentary election. Starmer indicated what he would prefer in the general election, where he gifted Farage his seat on a platter through essentially withdrawing the Labour candidate for Clacton. Starmer abandoned every pledge he made to become Labour leader and through that dropped many policies that are immensely popular with the people. These include public ownership of water, energy and healthcare. 2024 polling shows that 82% want water in public ownership, 71% for energy and 87% for the NHS. Yet Starmer lied about carrying out water nationalisation even as monopoly firms have paid out £72.8bn in dividends over the years, along with eye watering salaries and bonuses for corporate bosses. He lied about nationalising energy and what’s particularly embarrassing is that Britons don’t even own the national grid itself, which alone has paid out £28bn in dividends since privatisation. And instead of ‘ending outsourcing’ in the NHS as promised, Starmer is expanding private provision of NHS services by 20%, instead of properly investing in healthcare. On foreign policy, Starmer has failed to stand up to Israel with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn showing what leadership on the issue looks like. 56% want the government to ban arms sales to Israel, compared to 17% who don’t. Yet Starmer has only blocked a woeful 8.5% of licenses. As well as these policies, Starmer has raised bus fares by 50%, cut the winter fuel payment for some of the least well off pensioners and announced cuts of 5% to each government department. Starmer’s mantra of positive ‘change’ looks like anything but. Hence, the Tory/ Labour double act continues and provides ample fuel for an alternative.",Canary,2025-01-17T20:32:49+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/starmer-resignation-polling/
The March for Palestine is STILL ON - despite the Met Police's attempt to disrupt it,"Tens of thousands of demonstrators will gather in London on Saturday as they have done throughout the 15 months of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. This will be the eve of the ceasefire that Palestinians and their supporters around the world have desperately sought as Israel carried out a barbaric assault on Gaza with catastrophic results. Ending the bombing is only the start. Israel’s siege on Gaza must be lifted immediately to enable the flow of vital humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. The ceasefire must be permanent. The genocidal onslaught in Gaza is rooted in decades of oppression – ethnic cleansing, settler-colonisation, military occupation and apartheid against the Palestinian people between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean sea. It has been enabled by decades of support for Israel from UK governments, corporations and institutions. For all these reasons and more, we will continue our campaigns and demonstrations such as that tomorrow in London. Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and its Coalition partners have organised 22 major demonstrations since October 2023, working with the police authorities. The marches have been overwhelmingly peaceful and well-ordered as the police themselves have accepted. However, this protest has suffered from heavy handed police obstruction using powers under the Public Order Act that erode our democratic rights. The Met Police originally agreed the route of the march, BBC Portland Place to Whitehall, in November 2024, but have this month reneged on their undertaking on the grounds that it would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel’s actions – including MPs, trade unions leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 900 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of a march. Over the past week the Met Police have imposed a series of repressive conditions to prevent us marching and have even attempted to impose a route that the Board of Deputies announced they had suggested to the police. This has been firmly rejected by the Palestine Coalition – it is an affront that pro-Israel groups can attempt to decide where we can or cannot march. Despite intensive efforts to reach a compromise with the Met, it has so far refused to accept or offer a reasonable solution. However, we will assemble on Whitehall on Saturday at noon. We reiterate our call on the police to lift their repressive conditions and allow us to march. If they continue to refuse to do so and prevent us from marching, we will be rallying in Whitehall to protest. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said : Israel’s genocide has not ended. Even now, while we await a ceasefire, Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza are dying from bombardment, and suffering from lack of medical care, food and shelter. We demand a permanent ceasefire, an end to the siege of Gaza and the immediate provision of massive humanitarian aid. It is absolutely legitimate and necessary for us in the UK to be holding our government to account for it’s military, diplomatic and economic support of Israel, which continues to be investigated by the world courts for war crimes and crimes against humanity. But this protest has been marred by political policing which is an attack on our fundamental democratic rights. The Met has seemingly accepted and acted upon the arguments of pro-Israel groups that seek to delegitimise our protest as antisemitic or a threat to Jewish people. This is a gross distortion of the truth. There is not a single instance of our marches posing any threat to synagogues or Jewish individuals. Indeed, we count a large, self-organised Jewish bloc as some of our most indefatigable supporters. The Met’s approach has been confrontational, heavy-handed and intransigent. Their use of powers under the Public Order Act has been based on flimsy grounds and arbitrarily applied, which erodes the right of peaceful protest that is fundamental in a democracy. Despite this, our protest tomorrow will go ahead – we call on all those who seek justice for Palestine to stand with us.",Canary,2025-01-17T16:58:23+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/17/march-for-palestine-route/
The 'Hastings Three' are in court next week for protesting outside an arms supplier to Israel,"Huge crowds are expected next week at the trial of the “Hastings Three”, who were charged nearly a year ago for their part in protesting Israel’s genocide in Gaza. NHS worker Clem McCulloch, 33, artist Thomas Delves, 25, and retired train driver Laurie Holden, 72, were arrested at General Dynamics arms factory on February 29 last year during a peaceful protest organized by the Hastings & District Palestine Solidarity Campaign (HDPSC) and supported by a coalition of community groups including Jewish groups, social justice and climate justice groups, parent groups, and political parties. All three will plead not guilty to charges of aggravated trespass when they come before a district judge at Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday 22 January. The charge carries a maximum tariff of a three-month jail term and £2,500 fine. They are expected to be joined by a large number of supporters as local groups across the county – including Brighton Stop the War, University of Sussex Friends of Palestine and Brighton and Hove Palestine Solidarity Campaign (BHPSC) – have called a ‘solidarity rally’ in support of the three men. Ahead of the trial, BHPSC’s executive committee released a statement: BHPSC is a sister PSC branch to Hastings & District PSC, and have followed the case of the #Hastings3 with great interest – not least because we in Brighton know too well the indignation caused locally by having an arms factory based in our city – an arms factory (like General Dynamics in Hastings) that is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide being perpetrated by Israel upon the people of Gaza. The statement went on: The executive committee of BHPSC sends our solidarity to the three defendants whose case will be heard here in Brighton on the 22nd of January. Our many local members and supporters will be outside the court in large numbers on the 22nd to voice our support for our Hastings comrades, who are on trial for doing nothing more than exercising their right to peaceful non-violent protest. Compared with the appalling crimes against humanity being facilitated by the General Dynamics factory in Hastings and other weapons manufacturers in the UK, the actions of the #Hastings3 register as expressions of conscience rather than crimes. General Dynamics is the fifth largest global arms manufacturer and is responsible for all the MK80 bombs being dropped on Gaza. Laurie Holden, from Burwash, said: It is appalling that ordinary people like myself are in the dock instead of General Dynamics, which is making a killing from genocide. This will be the sixth time our case has come before the court, representing a disgusting waste of taxpayer’s money. Meanwhile, General Dynamics made $3.3 billion profit in 2023. “The Hastings Three are not guilty” said Grace Lally, twinning officer for the Hastings & District PSC: General Dynamics is guilty of profiting from war crimes and genocide. Two thousand pound bombs made by General Dynamics have been dropped on families sheltering in tents in the so-called safe zone of Al Mawasi, where our friends live and our community has deep connections. Nothing can justify this. General Dynamics has come under sustained pressure from concerned locals for its part in Israel’s 15-month campaign in Gaza. Hastings & District PSC has led more than a dozen actions to the two arms factory sites in Hastings since November 2023, including die-ins, marches, pickets and a 48-hour peace camp and the sites have also been subject to regular and spontaneous ‘pop up’ protests. Mum-of-one Olivia Cavanagh said: We don’t want this weapons manufacturer here in our town, making money from slaughtering innocent Palestinians, making us complicit in war crimes. A legal fighting fund for the three men has raised nearly £5,000 but still has some way to go to cover all their legal costs. “The outrageous and expensive pursuit of the #Hastings3 does not stand in isolation but forms part of a nationwide clamp down on peaceful protest” said Katy Colley, HDPSC Chair: Our friends are good men of conscience who, like the rest of us, cannot bear to see the wholesale destruction and annihilation we are witnessing in Gaza. The majority in this country stand against genocide, ethnic cleansing and apartheid. For fifteen months, people up and down the country have protested the UK’s complicity in the worst crime of our time, demanding that the UK stops arming Israel. Yet our government refuses to listen and those who speak out are smeared, defamed and persecuted. There are now over 46,000 confirmed dead in Gaza – mostly women and children – though a report this month in the Lancet estimated the real death toll to be at least 40% higher with the number of deaths in the first nine months alone estimated to be over 64,000. A year ago, the International Court of Justice put Israel in the dock for acts of genocide and last month, reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Medecins Sans Frontieres all concluded that Israel is guilty of carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza. The rally at Brighton Magistrates Court begins at 9.30pm and donations to the legal fighting fund can be made here.",Canary,2025-01-17T15:43:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/hastings-general-dynamics-protest/
Government BURIED damning report in DWP PIP failings to try and push through reforms,"It’s been revealed by a leading disability news outlet that the previous Conservative government tried to bury a damning report into the DWP PIP system and its failings. We only know this thanks to the tenacity of one journalist. However, the issue raises further questions about the approach of the now-Labour Party government. In January 2024, Conservative ministers chose to withhold a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) report that highlighted significant issues within the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) system. This decision occurred just days before the release of a green paper proposing substantial changes to it. We only know this information thanks to John Pring at Disability News Service (DNS). As Pring wrote: DNS has obtained copies of emails exchanged last year between ministers and advisers, which show how the minister for disabled people, Mims Davies (pictured above, left), was asked to approve the publication of four Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research reports in January 2024. The unreleased report contained testimonies from disabled individuals who had undergone PIP assessments and received zero points, rendering them ineligible for support. One participant, diagnosed with ME and confined to bed for all but half an hour daily, described the assessment process as dismissive, noting that attempts to elaborate on his condition were abruptly halted. Such experiences left claimants feeling “broken,” “numb,” and “fuming.” Internal emails obtained through Pring’s freedom of information request revealed that on 29 January 2024, minister for disabled people Mims Davies was asked to approve the publication of four DWP research reports. This included the critical PIP study. A response on 8 February suggested delaying its release due to ongoing policy development. It cautioned that publication could “set hares running.” The final decision to withhold the report was made on 24 April, just five days before the green paper’s publication. On 29 April 2024, work and pensions secretary Mel Stride introduced the “Modernising Support for Independent Living” green paper. In this, the government expressed concerns over rising PIP expenditures. It also questioned the benefit’s value. The paper proposed making it more challenging to claim PIP and suggested replacing cash payments with vouchers or one-off grants, a move described by campaigners as a “brutal, ideological attack” on disabled people’s support. The timing of these events indicates a deliberate effort by ministers to suppress evidence of the PIP system’s deficiencies. It would have laid cover for advancing policies that could further restrict support for chronically ill and disabled people. The news comes as the DWP lost a court case over ex-Tory ministers’ reforms to the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Concerningly, the Labour government has already indicated it may go ahead with the changes, regardless.",Canary,2025-01-17T12:13:36+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/17/government-buried-dwp-pip-report/
"5,000 nurses come forward to expose the dire state of the NHS. It's a ""wake up call"" to Labour.","Over 5,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), a large UK and international union, have presented evidence showing the dire state of our NHS. Professor Nicola Ranger, RCN general secretary, said the findings are a “wake-up call” to Labour. The report, entitled On the frontline of the UK’s corridor care crisis, details testimony from nurses who observed patients dying in corridors, on trolleys and in chairs in waiting rooms. The crisis is also defined by nurses treating patients not only in corridors but in storerooms, carparks, offices and even toilets. There, patients have no access to critical equipment like oxygen or vital signs monitoring systems. There were also multiple testimonies of healthcare staff feeling that the scandal of corridor care has or can delay emergency procedures such as CPR. Further, nurses said corridor care was “routine” at their hospital or even happening “permanently”. Generally, the sheer volume of NHS nurses who have significant experience with corridor care is shocking. One pointed out that one nurse and a healthcare assistant were looking after 20-30 patients in a corridor. The report notes that selected testimonies already reflect the experience of many nurses. One said: I was redeployed from my shift in critical care to the emergency department – where I had never worked before. All bays were full and I also had 4 male patients on trolleys in the corridor who had been there since the previous night awaiting a hospital bed as all were admitted. This made for a concerning and difficult time since the patients were confused, there was no name allocated to a bed area as they were in corridors – staff knew these as ‘spaces’ as they were regularly used. Another said: Utilising corridors on daily basis now with patients staying up to 24 hours in these locations. Also seeing patient in the back of ambulances due to lack of flow through the system. Patients constantly receive poor dignity, are frustrated, in some cases refuse treatment and self discharge against advice due to situation placing them at risk of significant adverse event that would likely not have happened had the system been functioning as intended. This is demoralising for staff who wish to provide exceptional care, in some cases has led to long term sickness through depression and burn out, and has significantly increased staff turnover as it is no longer viewed as a sustainable career option for nurses and has diluted the overall knowledge and subsequent safety of the department. I have worked in Emergency care for nearly 20 years and have never seen it as bad as it is today, frankly it is embarrassing. Labour aren’t providing enough capital funding to fix the healthcare infrastructure we already have, let alone expanding buildings and technology to meet demand. So how will the corridor crisis end under their administration? Healthcare leaders have previously said hospitals are “outright dangerous” due to years of underfunding. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS needs an extra £6.7bn per year to maintain its estate. Labour has claimed it’s providing an “additional” £13.6bn in capital funding, but that’s actually a £3.1bn increase on the 2023-24 capital budget. The party is reportedly considering fresh private finance initiative (PFI) scams. That’s instead of the government providing sufficient public funding, the private sector loans the money off the books. Through PFI, the public purse is hugely overcharged for infrastructure in a heist of billions of pounds. Former Blairite advisor and now UK ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson is one of the figures behind the push for Labour to adopt PFI. Reeves has also walked back the headline figure in Labour’s budget of a £22.6bn increase in NHS day-to-day spending, through announcing a 5% cut to each governmental department. That leaves the spending increase at £7.6bn. This is far short of what’s required for the Long-term Workforce Plan. Rather than investing in the NHS, Keir Starmer’s Labour seems to be using the crisis as an opportunity for the private healthcare sector (which donates to Labour) to make cash from the struggling service. On 6 January, Starmer announced that the private sector will deliver an additional million appointments, scans, and operations a year. This is a 20% increase on the current private provision of five million operations, appointments and tests annually. This is not the answer – as anyone working in the NHS will tell you.",Canary,2025-01-16T19:50:07+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/nhs-rcn-report/
"DWP WCA consultation broke the law - yet Labour planning on making the Tories' changes, anyway","On Thursday 16 January, a high court judge ruled what disabled people already knew, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully in their controversial plans to reform the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). However, the DWP has also revealed that the Labour Party government is planning on going ahead with the WCA changes the Tories first tabled – but it will run another consultation, first. Disabled activist and all-round legend Ellen Clifford took the DWP to court over a consultation which ran for just eight weeks in 2023. The department later used the evidence gathered from the consultation to make changes to the WCA, and who qualified as Limited Capability for Work Related Activity (LCWRA) – which are due to come into effect this year. If they come in, the plans would see over 400,000 disabled people lose around £416 a month, something which could lead to countless deaths – this is on top of the god knows how many deaths the WCA has already caused. The DWP misrepresented the reforms as a way to give more disabled people support into work, citing figures that said 20% of people in the LCWRA group had said “would like to work at some point in the future”. Of course, they conveniently ignore the 80% who disagreed with this and that just 4% said they would be able to start work now if the right job and support were available. The consultation received a massive pushback from disabled people, who could see it for what it was: a cost-cutting measure designed to force people back into work and score points in the next election. Clifford and Aoife O’Reilly from the Public Law Project, who was acting as her representation, argued that the consultation was unlawful on many grounds. Firstly, the consultation did not explain that many disabled claimants impacted by the reforms would receive significantly less money and in some cases, be required to meet stringent conditions or be at risk of sanctions if they did not meet them. O’Reilly also argued that the primary motive for the reforms – to reduce DWP spending – had not been disclosed. She argued that the consultation had led people to believe the aim was to help people into work, without actually providing any evidence as to how they planned to do so. Lastly, the team crucially argued that the consultation had been unlawful as it ran for just under 8 weeks, which didn’t give DDPOs adequate time to respond. Government consultations typically run for six-to-twelve weeks. Over the course of the judicial review, internal DWP documents revealed several damning things. Firstly, the DWP had not actually done any sort of impact assessment on the WCA proposals, prior to the consultation being launched. This is despite the fact that civil servants had, based on internal estimates, identified that almost 100,000 people would be pushed into poverty if they went ahead. There was an equality impact assessment that was done after the launch of the consultation, but that has never been published. Civil servants were also aware that the proposals would have a particularly strong effect on people with preexisting mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. Proposals made by civil servants on what changes to consult on were instead based on the financial benefits. Internal documents reveal that “the Prime Minister [at the time Rishi Sunak] indicated that the DWP should consult on reforms to the WCA gateway in time to score them for the Autumn Statement…” The narrative around how easy home working was for disabled people seemingly came out of the DWP and realised that the WCA proposals would be “perceived as purely cost-saving measures by influential disability rights groups” this led to recommendations that “a wider narrative based on modern and home working” was also developed. Internal documents demonstrate that DWP boss at the time Mel Stride had considered including particular proposals as part of the consultation, because it could be “useful” to play into the idea that the motivation for consultation was the importance of getting more people into work and not saving money. Mr Justice Calver ruled that the consultation was “rushed”, “misleading” and “so unfair as to be unlawful”. He described the DWP a relying upon a “false rationale”, in the consultation. It also did not inform people about the “substantial” financial loss claimants would face. He said that the evidence which had been presented before him: Strongly supported the conclusion that costs savings was at least one of the two bases, if not the central basis, on which decisions would be taken on which policies would be taken forward by the Government. The judge also said considered that the DWP should have made this fact clear and that “disclosure of this highly relevant fact, was required”. Calver ruled that the consultation time was “unlawfully short” given not only the importance of the subject but based on the fact that the DWP was also at the time running a significant consultation on the Disability Action Plan. This was particularly unexpected as the DWP had only just published the Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper. Mr Justice Calver observed: The unfair burden upon vulnerable people of having to deal with a yet further consultation process at this time at such short notice cannot be overstated. In setting the consultation period, the Defendant ought to have had more regard to the attributes of those people who would be affected by these proposals. These were proposals which, in particular, could potentially drive vulnerable people into poverty as well as adversely affecting disabled people and substantial risk claimants who have mental health conditions and suicide ideation. Disabled activist Paula Peters, who was outside the court for the ruling, said: It’s been a rollercoaster of emotions today, bittersweet sadness as we remember all disabled people we’ve lost to the WCA process. Relief that justice was served and that the judge overseeing this judicial review said the WCA Consultation was radically wrong and didn’t take into account the impact on disabled people’s lives. In her statement outside court, Ellen said she was “overjoyed and very emotional” about the judgement: When I heard the judgement, I was reminded of all of those who we gave lost and all of those who we don’t know who have died – countless people who’ve died as a result to cuts and changes to their benefits and other austerity measures. But today Mr Justice Calver has recognised the unfair of a government consultation that deliberately set out to mislead and to disguise the potentially devastating impacts that these particular changes would have on disabled people. Well, despite the ruling the government wouldn’t legally be required to completely get rid of the DWP plans to make the lives of those subject to the WCA hell. That’s probably why the DWP has confirmed today they will be redoing the consultation. In a statement a spokesperson for the DWP told the Canary (and the rest of the media): The judge has found the previous government failed to adequately explain their proposals. As part of wider reforms that help people into work and ensure fiscal sustainability, the government will re-consult on the WCA descriptor changes, addressing the shortcomings in the previous consultation, in light of the judgment. The government intends to deliver the full level of savings in the public finance’s forecasts. This is interesting. Although they’re being upfront about it being “savings” motivated, they’re still not being transparent about how the cuts would affect people. A big takeaway is also that they’re still seemingly intent on changing the goalposts of what the descriptors will mean and who will qualify to be unfit for work. Just as many disabled activists worried, a Labour-led DWP is no better than a Conservative one. But disabled people are prepared to fight them on this too. Clifford said in her statement: We know the government is hellbent on attacking disabled people and essential incomes we need to survive, in order to manage the economy better than they are at the moment. As Peters said: We hope this legal victory gives disabled people across the UK hope that disabled campaigners are fighting back, prepared to take government on and bring change about” Speaking of the fears of disabled people facing both cuts and the Assisted Suicide Bill, Clifford said: This is not how any democracy should treat its most disadvantaged members; we fight on together.",Canary,2025-01-16T16:45:50+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/dwp-wca-court-verdict/
A hung jury in the latest Just Stop Oil trial shows the nonsense of these prosecutions,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters who sprayed Heathrow departure boards with orange paint during the Oil Kills, international uprising to end fossil fuels last July have won a temporary reprieve as their jury failed to reach a majority decision. Phoebe Plummer and Jane Touil were appearing before judge Duncan at Isleworth Crown Court accused of criminal damage over £5,000 for their action on 30 July 2024 to demand a fossil fuel treaty to end oil and gas by 2030. The trial, which lasted nine days, ended when the jury failed to reach a majority decision. The judge has scheduled a retrial for May 2026. Phoebe was remanded for 58 days and Jane for 14 days following the action in which the pair used fire extinguishers to spray water-based paint at the departure boards in the terminal. The Crown alleged that the Just Stop Oil action caused £8,000 worth of damages. Phoebe is currently serving a two year prison sentence for criminal damage for throwing soup on a Van Gogh painting in October 2022. They were sentenced by Judge Hehir at South Crown Court on 27 September 2024, a sentence that is now being challenged in an appeal scheduled for 29-30 January 2025. During the trial, Judge Duncan ruled out the defence of necessity, saying this did not extend to civil disobedience and what she called the Just Stop Oil defendants’ “honestly held opinions” about climate change. Jane Touil responded that: It is not accurate to say that I am acting on my beliefs. It [the climate crisis] is not ‘a cause’. This is physics, an objective reality. I can see that everything is at risk. We only do the right thing if we know what’s going on. Phoebe was not allowed to be present in court to make their closing speech as during the course of the trial, the heating system in the holding cells at Isleworth Crown court, contracted to the private company Serco broke down and no one currently in custody could be produced in court. A Just Stop Oil supporter who was present throughout the trial said that: Phoebe and Jane had all their substantial defences removed, a severely mismanaged prosecution, logistical nightmares and a jury that was told to completely disregard their motivations. This is absolutely huge! In her closing speech Phoebe Plummer said: I have struggled with not being able to talk about the climate crisis – hearing it being called irrelevant feels inhumane and dishonest. The prosecution says I’m ‘committed to breaking the law’; my only commitment is to act in line with my conscience. They say ‘I do what I like without thinking about the law’. I don’t think following the law and doing the right thing are always the same thing. I cannot be a bystander to suffering where I see it. Nonviolence means being honest and living in line with the truth. I need to tell the truth about what I see. I act in a way that I think will be effective in saving life. When a doctor breaks a rib while doing CPR the doctor’s intent is still obviously saving life not causing grievous bodily harm, the context always matters.",Canary,2025-01-16T15:12:04+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/16/just-stop-oil-hung-jury/
London mayor refuses to act to block Heathrow expansion,"Despite running on a platform to halt any further expansion of Heathrow Airport, on Thursday 16 January during Mayor’s Question Time, Sadiq Khan dismissed multiple invitations from Green Party AM Zack Polanski to work together in pursuit of that shared goal. At the core of Heathrow’s expansion plans is the construction of a third runway. Initially proposed over two decades ago, the plan seeks to increase Heathrow’s capacity by accommodating up to 700,000 flights annually, compared to its current cap of 480,000. This expansion would allow Heathrow to handle an estimated additional 50 million passengers per year. Of course, one of the most contentious aspects of the Heathrow expansion has been its environmental impact. Critics have long argued that adding a third runway would significantly increase carbon emissions at a time when the UK has set legally binding commitments to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The additional flights, coupled with construction emissions, pose a substantial challenge to these climate goals and would exacerbate the climate crisis. Meanwhile, the Heathrow expansion has faced numerous legal battles and political hurdles over the years. In 2020, the UK Court of Appeal ruled that the government’s approval of the third runway was unlawful because it failed to account for the country’s climate obligations under the Paris Agreement. However, this decision was overturned by the Supreme Court later that year, allowing the project to proceed. As of early 2025, the Labour Party government has expressed conditional support for the expansion, contingent on meeting stringent environmental standards and securing broader public backing. Proponents of the expansion argue that it is vital for the UK’s economic future. Heathrow’s role as a global hub supports thousands of jobs directly and indirectly, and the additional capacity could generate billions of pounds in economic benefits. Increased connectivity is seen as crucial for trade, tourism, and maintaining London’s status as a leading financial center. However, opponents highlight the significant costs associated with the project, estimated to exceed £14 billion. They also point to potential disruptions for local communities, including increased noise pollution and the need to relocate homes and businesses. Local communities near Heathrow have expressed mixed reactions to the expansion plans. While some see the potential for job creation and economic revitalization, others are concerned about noise pollution, air quality, and the loss of green spaces. The proposed expansion would require the demolition of parts of several villages, including Harmondsworth, raising questions about fair compensation and community well-being. Currently, as the Financial Times reported Keir Starmer’s cabinet are split over whether to approve the Heathrow expansion: Bosses at Heathrow, which handles more than 80mn passengers a year, are putting the final touches to their first expansion plan since the pandemic, but will not include a third runway at this stage, said people familiar with the matter. Downing Street and the Department for Transport said they were “open-minded” about a third runway, but only if it satisfied four tests: delivering growth across the country, meeting climate obligations and complying with air pollution and noise considerations. But one political aide said the cabinet was divided. “It’s no secret that there isn’t universal backing for the third runway, it’s just not a priority right now. [Energy secretary] Ed [Miliband] is the most obvious example of someone who is anti, but there are others who are uncomfortable about expanding Britain’s biggest airport,” the person said. So, on that Polanski pushed Khan on 16 January over the Heathrow expansion. Yet when prompted to join forces in lobbying government against any approval of the Airport National Policy Statement (ANPS), the Mayor repeatedly dismissed, and even mocked, Zack’s outstretched hand: Reflecting after the exchange, Green Party London Assembly Member Zack Polanski said: Expanding Heathrow Airport would be dangerous, even deadly, for every Londoner interested in breathing clean air or swimming in the Thames anytime in the next century. The Mayor ran on a campaign promising to oppose Heathrow expansion, yet when I present him with opportunity after opportunity to take action, he refuses to engage with me. Why won’t the Mayor work across party lines to stop Heathrow expansion in its tracks?",Canary,2025-01-16T14:47:12+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/16/heathrow-expansion/
Palestine Action's #Filton18 are in court TOMORROW - and need YOUR support,"On Friday 17 January, the Palestine Action #Filton18 political prisoners will appear at the Old Bailey, London, to enter their pleas for the first time since their arrest. They are expected to plead ‘not guilty’ to charges of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and, for some, violent disorder, after an August action against Israel’s Elbit Systems research hub in Filton, Bristol. The action saw activists enter the site, operated by Israel’s largest weapons company, and dismantle the weapons of war inside – including the Elbit ‘quadcopter’ models used for targeted killings of children in Gaza. Ten of the #Filton18 have been imprisoned since their arrest in August 2024, with a further eight arrested and imprisoned since November, all of them subjected to abuse of ‘Counter Terror’ powers by the British State. The Crown Prosecution Service are alleging that the charges faced have a ‘terrorism connection’. Amnesty International has stated that the Filton case demonstrates “terrorism powers being misused” to “circumvent normal legal protections, such as justifying holding people in excessively-lengthy pre-charge detention”. The #Filton18 political prisoners have been subjected to arbitrary and repressive treatment while inside prison – including the withholding of phone calls and mail, prohibitions on communicating with other prisoners, and denials of religious practices and medical privacy. Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest weapons company, is deeply complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza – providing over 85% of Israel’s armed drones, along with a wide range of munitions, armaments, and military equipment, all of which it markets internationally as having been “battle-tested” on Palestinians. From Britain, the subsidiary ‘Elbit Systems UK’ is a major exporter to Israel of military drone components, along with arms including weapons sights. The Filton weapons hub was opened in July 2023, with Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotevely in attendance praising the site for the “very best of Israeli technology”, alongside Elbit’s CEO Bezalel Machlis. If you want to show support for the #Filton18,  be at the Old Bailey, City of London, EC4M 7EH on Friday 17 January at 9:30am.

Andy McDonald champions Labour's shoddy workers' rights bill at PMQs. Here's the facts.,"At Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), Andy McDonald MP said on 15 January: The employment rights bill is urgently needed especially given the exploitation of gig workers like those retail assistants employed throughout with vital rights denied and staff being charged a premium should they want to be paid on time. Insecure work denies workers their rights but the TUC also says it costs the UK economy around £10bn a year. So will the prime minister agree with me that having a single status of worker will help end such abusive practices, give workers security and significantly benefit the economy? UK high street retailers have been employing young assistants through gig acts that lack basic employment rights. Labour’s employment rights bill doesn’t include a single status of worker, which aims to guarantee rights across the economy. Keir Starmer responded: I believe everyone is entitled to fair, flexible and secure working. And that’s why we introduced our employment rights bill, which is the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation. It includes measures that will end the scandal of fire and rehire, preventing exploitative zero hour contracts and introducing basic rights for workers from day one. The Labour Party’s move to strengthen workers’ rights is only significant because the benchmark is so low. That’s partly because of anti-trade union legislation that the Tories introduced including in 2016. A report from academics for the Trade Union Congress (TUC) found that the UK presently lags behind other developed OECD countries when it comes to workers’ rights. The bill is a step forward in a shoddy context. Professor Deakin, director of the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge University, said: The UK is an international outlier when it comes to worker protections. Our labour laws are significantly less protective of workers’ rights than the average in the developed countries which make up the OECD. The gap is particularly marked with respect to laws on working time, employee representation, and the right to strike. The report shows that UK labor laws have been less protective of workers’ rights than other developed countries since Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, the Tories, propped up by the Lib Dems, increased the period before workers are protected from unfair dismissal to two years of employment. Labour’s bill remedies the unfair practice altogether through introducing protections from unfair dismissal from the beginning of employment. The bill also included piecemeal steps forward in the right to sick pay. Further, it will guarantee hours for those on zero hour contracts, if the employee wants them. The act will repeal the restrictive trade union ballot threshold for strike action that the Tories introduced in 2016. In October, Zarah Sultana MP said in parliament: We must go further and repeal every single anti-trade union bill since Thatcher It seems Labour won’t be doing this – and so, everything else is piecemeal, as PMQs exposed.",Canary,2025-01-15T18:57:18+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/pmqs-15-january/
"Patients are dying because of profit-driven political decisions - so in 2025, EveryDoctor is stepping things up","In 2025, campaign group EveryDoctor is stepping up its work to save the NHS from privatisation, and build a functioning, flourishing healthcare system for patients and staff alike. However, there’s work to do. The group wants to grow its following from thousands, to a vibrant patient and staff community of millions. It feels it will take nothing short of this to turn things around because: millions of people are currently being profoundly failed by politicians In short, the group aims to transform its campaign community into something more: a movement. Its ambitious goal comes amidst another spate of alarming news stories over the appalling state of things in the NHS. What’s more, EveryDoctor founder (and Canary columnist) Julia Grace Patterson has crunched the numbers on patient deaths – and the situation is actually worse than the headlines suggest. By the close of 2024, and into the New Year already, the media has been awash with dire developments in the NHS. A ‘quad-demic’ storm of influenza, Covid, norovirus, and RSV has been overwhelming NHS hospitals across the country. More than a dozen hospitals have now declared “critical incidents” as hospitalisations mount up, and services are swamped. Meanwhile, headlines abound about intractable wait times, and lack of available beds. Patients entering NHS hospitals face a disgraceful situation – first a major problem during the Covid pandemic – but now tragically commonplace. The phrase “corridor care” has firmly cemented itself into the British vernacular. In December, 54,000 patients waited on trolleys longer than 12 hours for hospitals to admit them to wards. EveryDoctor’s Patterson has laid out the devastating cost of all this in a Tiktok video. Specifically, she analysed the Royal College of General Medicine (RCEM)’s statistics showing the toll long wait times have been having. Horrifyingly, she highlighted that almost 300 patient deaths a week can be linked to long waits. In short, this atrocious state of affairs is putting patients’ lives at risk. So, as all these crises in the NHS unfold, the Labour government has answered with yet more plans for privatising the public healthcare system. EveryDoctor wrote to its supporters on the situation that: This government released big plans for the NHS last week, and those plans involved further privatisation. This government has failed to invest properly in emergency services, and patients in A and E departments are receiving urgent treatment in corridors. Its latest foray into opening the NHS up to further backdoor privatisation comes in the form of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the Canary’s James Wright highlighted, AI companies likely had a little help from science and technology secretary Peter Kyle. Also an acting vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Kyle has repeatedly rubbed shoulders with a who’s who of AI’s most prolific lobbyists. Given this, Wright pointed out that Kyle likely had a hand in this latest NHS AI privatisation manoeuvre. Of course, all this is barely the tip of the iceberg of privatisation’s manifold fallouts for the NHS. Therefore, turning things around in the NHS will take a momentous groundswell of action. And it’s why Patterson and the EveryDoctor team have declared their intention to build a bold movement to “fearlessly” fight back. Since 2019, EveryDoctor has been campaigning against this unrelenting tide of private profiteering in the UK’s health service. The group has put out critical research on NHS privatisation. It has met with MPs, and created far-reaching public awareness campaigns. Most recently, it ran a powerful campaign to engage MPs with a doctor-led manifesto for fixing the NHS. Alongside volunteers and the public, the group brought these ideas to 117 MPs and their teams. However, Patterson lamented how to date, none of it has yet been enough. So she spelled out that: we need to think a lot bigger now. Much, much bigger. We need millions of people to know what we’re doing and to stand together with us to fight for the NHS. In just the first two weeks of 2025, EveryDoctor has already set a number of things in motion. The group has called on the Liberal Democrats to collaborate in holding the Labour government to account for the emergency situation in A&E departments. It is also organising urgent meetings with MPs about this too. And EveryDoctor has started the year off with a social media bang too. The Tiktok video Patterson posted on the RCEM statistics went viral. Off the back of this, NHS staff, film-makers, and members of the public have been flooding the group’s inbox with offers of support. Of course, this is only the start. EveryDoctor has many more plans in the works for the year ahead. Patterson set out to supporters that: There is only a point to our campaigning if we do it fearlessly, relentlessly, boldly, and loudly. I can only lead EveryDoctor if I will do it fearlessly. So that’s what I am going to do – that’s what we are going to do. I went back to TikTok this morning and continued making videos. We’re starting daily YouTube videos this week. We’re hiring into our team. We’re completing our research into the financial links between MPs and the private healthcare sector. And we have so much more to do… Going forward, she hopes that many more people will join EveryDoctor’s community to work together in saving the NHS for the millions that depend on it. You can keep up with EveryDoctor’s vital work by joining its WhatsApp community. The group is also fundraising to ramp up the reach and impact of all its upcoming plans. If you’re in a position to donate, you can do so here.",Canary,2025-01-15T16:09:03+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/everydoctor-campaign/
SEND system in England falling apart at the seams - thanks to the Tories,"The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee’s report Support for children and young people with special educational needs published on 15 January highlights significant challenges within England’s Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) system. Notably, it outlines how funding over the past ten years has not matched demand – as the previous Conservative Party governments let the SEND system fall into a state of disrepair. As BBC News reported: In a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system “in disarray”, “mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money”. An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England. The Department for Education (DfE) said the government was “making progress” on the issue with a £1bn investment in Send. Despite a 58% increase in high needs funding over the past decade, the number of children with Education, Health, and Care (EHC) plans has surged by 140%, leading to funding not keeping pace with demand. This disparity has resulted in stagnant outcomes for children, eroding parental confidence in the system. The Public Accounts Committee summed up by saying: The Department of Education will be unable to make the fundamental reforms needed without a clear, costed plan to measure progress, which it is lacking. To do this it needs a clear vision of what an inclusive education would look like, better data to target funding, and to deliver a system where all those with critical roles work together. This includes the Department for Health and Social Care, who must play their part in reducing long waits for support. With more than 40,000 children waiting over 12 weeks for speech and language therapy alone as at June 2024, timely access to health expertise constitutes a significant barrier in a struggling system. Recommendations: The Local Government Association was particularly concerned by the report. Councillor Arooj Shah, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Children and Young People Board, said: The Committee is right to describe the failing SEND system as an emergency, and its report reflects councils’ long-standing concerns over the need for more inclusive provision and the immense financial pressures on councils to be adequately addressed. It is vital the Government urgently sets out a comprehensive reform plan that ensures children and their families get the support they need and deserve. This must include ensuring councils on a financially stable footing, with high needs deficits written off. Otherwise, many councils will face a financial cliff-edge, and be faced with having to cut other services to balance budgets through no fault of their own, or their residents. Without urgent action, the report warns of a “lost generation” of children who may leave school without receiving the necessary support, emphasising the critical need for systemic reform to meet the growing demands and complexities of SEND provision in England.",Canary,2025-01-15T13:52:46+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/15/send-england/
Campaigners have 'discovered' ANOTHER company exporting arms to Israel,"Local campaigners have uncovered a previously-missed company that is actually now one of the biggest UK arms exporters to Israel – therefore, complicit in its genocide. Meet G&H Artemis. On Monday 13 January, campaigners across the south west stopped business at Gooch and Housego’s (G&H) Artemis site in Plymouth: The action marks the start of a new campaign – Shut Down G&H – committed to shutting down a company that’s deeply complicity in Israel’s genocide in Gaza: According to research by Campaign Against Arms Trade, G&H, with the acquisition of Phoenix Optical Technologies last year, is now the largest recipient of single issue arms export licenses to Israel between October 2021 and May 2023. G&H Artemis export a range of military equipment to Israel, including components for head up/down displays for military aircraft. G&H Artemis provide optical and laser technology for head up displays. On the ground, activists reported that many of the workers couldn’t gain entry to the factory due to the disruption. A spokesperson for Shut Down G&H said “this act of resistance was inspired by the growing awareness that G&H is directly implicated in the murder of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is unconscionable. As the local community, we are taking action to reject our city’s complicity in Israel’s genocide and display our unequivocal solidarity with the struggle for Palestinian life, freedom, and self-determination”: Today’s action is only the start. G&H have offices across the South West. We can and we must shut them down! The Canary asked G&H Artemis for comment – but the company declined to provide us with one. Campaign Against Arms Trade’s media coordinator, Emily Apple, said: It’s great to see this campaign being launched today. For too long G&H has got away with slipping under the radar. It should be a household name. Everyone should know this company is complicit in and profiting from Israel’s genocide. In only imposing a partial arms suspension, this government has made it clear that it will continue to prioritise arms dealers’ profits over Palestinian lives and international law. It’s therefore down to ordinary people across the country to take action and say no to the genocide profiteers on their doorsteps.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:57:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/gh-artemis/
Shell was given a stark reminder of its role in events like the LA wildfires,"Fossil Free London staged a protest outside Shell’s global HQ, the Shell Centre, on Southbank on Wednesday 15 January, in protest over the role fossil fuel corporations like Shell’s have in exacerbating the climate crisis. Dressed in red and orange, signs read “It’s not a tragedy, it’s a crime”, chanting “Shell did this”: A London firefighter joined the crowd, holding a placard saying “Big oil makes our job harder”: Shell continues to drill for new fossil fuels, making fires like the ones we are seeing in LA much more likely. In March 2024, Shell defied climate experts and rolled back their green targets, pledging to keep oil production steady until 2030. Wildfires across Los Angeles have now killed at least 24 people, and burned down more than 12,000 homes and businesses. Scientists warn these fires are driven in intensity by heat and drought; both conditions are directly linked to and made increasingly common by the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that emissions from fossil fuels are the biggest cause of climate change. Fossil fuel corporations have been aware of climate change and its effects as early as 1977, but continued to expand oil and gas production. Joanna Warrington, who attended the protest with Fossil Free London, said: LA is on fire, and it’s big oil that sparked the match and fanned the flames. Corporations like Shell have known for decades the disasters their fossil fuels would cause, but spent billions delaying climate action and funding misinformation to protect their business interests. As devastating events like these become more commonplace, its vital blame is put on the oily bosses who profit whilst our homes burn. Andy Warren, a London firefighter, said: Firefighters know that the increasingly frequent and destructive wildfires we face are the responsibility of the fossil fuel industry and its disregard for human life. These companies have known about the effects of their profiteering for decades and it is high time they were taken into public ownership and their profits used to fund a just green transition. No fire service in the world will be a match for the disasters that come if we carry on as we are.",Canary,2025-01-15T12:35:52+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/15/shell-protest-wildfires/
Keir Starmer's AI plan misses the central point of the fourth industrial revolution,"Keir Starmer’s plan for artificial intelligence (AI) falls well short of the main point of the fourth industrial revolution. That is to liberate people from labouring work they don’t want to do, providing more time for social, creative, and intellectual endeavours. Instead, Starmer is largely pursuing private sector for-profit ownership of AI that threatens to rob people of their work without fairly sharing the fruits that robots have created. In his speech on AI, the prime minister paid some lip service to the issue, without saying how for-profit, private ownership of AI will facilitate it: Who gets the benefits? Just those at the top – or working people everywhere? The thing is, there will be a point where capital increasingly becomes labour: where the money for resources equates to labour. That’s because in the long term the economy will be mainly automated rather than consisting of people providing the labour. Without public ownership of that automation or some kind of citizens dividend, the opportunity for the utopia explored in Aaron Bastani’s Fully Automated Luxury Communism will be replaced by the opposite: AI-controlling overlords and a poverty stricken public. Yet the public research and development funding for AI Starmer has issued is a drop in the ocean compared to the private investment we are seeing. The government’s AI plan also mentions the environmental factor in this, given AI generation is an energy intensive process. But corporate lobbyists and fossil fuel donations have played a role in reducing the government’s green energy strategy to near zero, compared to what’s necessary. In Labour’s first budget, the government issued just £100m to Great British Energy (GBE) for two years. That’s despite its already low pledge of £8bn by 2029. GBE aims to crowd in private investment in renewables. It falls far short of what we need. And it squanders the opportunity for a publicly funded Green New Deal. Starmer’s plan further proposes a national data library to power for-profit AI. That includes data from publicly funded institutions such as the British Library, the NHS, the BBC (through TV license), the Natural History Museum and the National Archives. It also includes reworking copyright law so AI can use people’s work, whether academic or creative. All of this is essential for the development of AI. But why should people’s work and public funding fuel AI if the outcomes are going to be privately-owned profit generation? It only makes sense for public ownership of the outcomes: AI machines that could be liberating. At present, the British people are already paying twice for education and information. Once, to create research (for example, through Research Council funding). Then, we are paying again to buy back the research through online journal subscriptions, university fees and public library costs. Despite funding the research, the taxpayer must pay again for access. The for-profit agenda for AI threatens to prolong this reality but at a much greater scale, across the entire economy.",Canary,2025-01-14T20:26:47+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/ai-fourth-industrial-revolution/
Just Stop Oil trio who targeted ex-Tory MP Mark Jenkinson NOT GUILTY - and rightly so,"Three Just Stop Oil supporters who fly posted the offices of a former Conservative MP to draw attention to his lies about a proposed Cumbrian coal mine have been acquitted of criminal damage by a magistrate in Carlisle. The trio took action in April 2024 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil, gas and coal projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Catherine Rennie Nash, 74, Fiona Atkinson, 68, and Margaret Reid, 54 all from Kendal were part of a group of four arrested on 24 April 2024 after posters reading “Stop Tory Coal” were plastered on the Maryport offices of the former Conservative MP for Workington, Mark Jenkinson: The three have been acquitted of criminal damage under £5,000 at Carlisle Magistrates today, after the magistrate ruled that the three could not have known that the window was covered with a specialist film that the prosecution alleged had been damaged and led to repair costs of £3,392.21. Margaret Reid has been on remand at HMP Styal for the past five months after being arrested by Great Manchester Police on August 5 2024 during the Oil Kills international uprising at airports around the world. She is charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and is due to stand trial on 3 February. Catherine Rennie Nash said: Mark Jenkinson promised his constituents a carbon neutral coal mine that would deliver hundreds of jobs for West Cumbria. However the High Court ruled that this was legally flawed and the mine will not go ahead. Mark Jenkinson also claimed that in our efforts to draw attention to this misinformation we had caused thousands of pounds’ worth of damage to his office. Today we have been found not guilty and we question why the police and courts wasted so much time in pursuing this. Fiona Atkinson said: We call on Cumbria’s new MPs to tell the truth about fossil fuels and support, rather than criminalize, people who are drawing attention to the climate crisis. We welcome Markus Campbell-Savours’ and Josh McAllisters’ efforts to bring investment in new green jobs for Cumbria but this needs to happen much more quickly. Also arrested on 24 April 2024, but subsequently released without charge was Alison Parker who said: I was shocked that I was arrested, as I only filmed what was happening. I was recognised outside the office by Mark Jenkinson, and then pursued by the police and courts for 8 months until finally my case was dropped. A solicitor is taking on my case for wrongful arrest so I can find out why so much taxpayer’s money was wasted. Mark Jenkinson has been a strong advocate for the proposed new Whitehaven coal mine, which was granted planning permission by the former Conservative Government in 2021, before it was subject to legal challenges by Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Climate Action last year. The High Court ruled in September 2024 that the former secretary of state for levelling up Michael Gove had acted unlawfully in granting the coal mine proposal planning permission. In doing so the High Court upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the climate impact of burning coal, oil and gas should have been taken into account when deciding whether to approve the project.",Canary,2025-01-14T19:45:32+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/just-stop-oil-mark-jenkinson/
Beating benefit reforms starts with tackling the MSM’s eugenicist anti-fatness stigma,"We’re now a quarter of the way through the 21st century. But from one look at the corporate media benefit claimant-bashing bile over the last year, you wouldn’t know it. The date marches on, some of the hacks trade places with electoral washouts – and vice versa – but the vile bigotry never ceases. If anything has changed in the past 25 years of hate-rag vitriol, it’s only that they’ve increased the ever-flowing pool of marginalised community scapegoats. Not that any oppressed group ever graduates from the right-wing press’s punch down portfolio. The Canary reviewed the past five years of Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail coverage on disability benefits – and the data can attest to this. However, perhaps most notably of all, what became abundantly clear was quite how much the corporate media had refused to let some abhorrently ableist and grossly bigoted narratives lie. And amidst a torrent of this, the corporate press’s particularly nasty and appalling anti-fatness stigma stood out tall. The benefits are a “life-style choice” purveyors, arbiters of the ‘grift’ and ‘graft’ “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” sanctimony, “workshy”, “idlers”, “shirkers” – it was all there. Across the dataset – with its 1130% rise in 2024 – the words themselves weren’t particularly prolific. We found the facetious idea that it’s a “lifestyle choice” in five articles. Grifter and grafter guff came up in four. That old (rotten) “workshy” chestnut cropped up across no fewer than ten pieces. Invocations of “idleness” and “shirkers”, just three and one pieces over our time period and search terms respectively. That these outlets used these terms in any articles at all is appalling enough. Yet, most also didn’t have to say it in as many explicit words. The implication was often plain and terrible to see in many articles regardless. Among the most infamous of infamous smears, there were two that really encapsulated an especially disgusting discourse that the corporate media refuses to put to bed. Just when you think it can’t get any worse, the right-wing regurgitators raise you: its “lazy scrounger” rhetoric. Again, they didn’t often voice it in quite so florid adjectives. Four counts of “scrounger” – all courtesy of the Daily Mail, naturally. Meanwhile, the Telegraph spewed out five out six of the pieces peddling “laziness” as synonymous with benefit claimants. Once more, there were plenty of articles where it didn’t need to say these outright for readers to know that’s what it was implying. Crucially, the corporate media often wrapped this up in a vastly more reprehensible narrative (hard to believe, we know). It’s one that has long been rife in the right-wing press. In tandem with these disgusting terms, the mainstream media’s output was also bristling in anti-fatness bigotry. That is, amidst the vicious crusade against benefit claimants, the fascistic foghorns whipped up a furore over fat people. And often, they did this in the most paternalistic, and putridly body-shaming ways. In October, Telegraph troll Allison Pearson penned one notable disgusting anti-fat diatribe. Hers specifically extolled the economic advantages of mass-prescribing weight-loss drugs. In it, she unironically advised we “as a society” should stop fat-shaming people. So herself and her hate-mongering employer especially then? Rich too when she packed the very same Ozempic – likely quid-pro-quo – promo-piece with every single hate-riddled insult and stereotype under the sun (or in the Sun for that matter). The oxymoronic lack of self-awareness was therefore truly off-the-charts scale staggering throughout. She literally labelled benefit claimants “useless lumps” and suggested they would “flog their free drugs on the black market”. To the likes of Pearson, people not cranking out capital are burdens to society, or criminal fraudsters – a rhetoric that has reared its head repeatedly in recent months. And why not divvy out a dose of anti-fat discrimination while she was at it – “lumps” – a deliberate double entendre that should not go unnoticed. We won’t reel off a list of her numerous other incorrigible insults and give them any oxygen. Safe to say that she made every attempt to punch down on fat folks, poor people, really any marginalised demographic she could swing her arm at. And the grand crescendo of it all leads exactly where you might expect. Make people fit for work – then ramp up punitive benefit conditionality. Every other sentence seems an ode to framing fatness as something to revile – about yourself, and in others. Similarly, a supposedly ‘satirical’ soapbox from Telegraph columnist Michael Deacon in December had an equally vile message. Deacon pitched “high-altitude fat camps” to fix the UK’s so-called ‘obesity crisis’. Of course, his bigoted banter fits right in with the worst kinds of weight loss porn we see plastered across every nook and cranny of the media. From late-stage capitalist entertainment media’s fetishization of fat-shaming to the clickbait press’ capitalisation of it. The point is that it’s within this context that Deacon was emboldened to say this – and vice-versa legitimise it in a vicious mutually-sustaining circle. And significantly, what these articles have in common is the way in which they pitch fatness as some form of personal failing. Ostensibly, they’re suggesting that people are undeserving of health-related benefits by reason of their fatness. So there’s the implication too that people claiming disability benefits for conditions linked to their weight, shouldn’t be. If the corporate media can foist the blame for people’s poor health on individuals, then they can preserve the capitalist status quo. Simply put, it shifts the onus away from tackling the structural factors of our inequitable classist, ableist, racist, and misogynistic society. One particularly revolting headline from the Daily Mail said it all: Listen love, I can’t be applying for jobs day in and day out. You’ve got to have some ‘me time’: The brazen words of Jimmy, 40, to SABRINA MILLER in this shocking dispatch from the ‘disability benefits capital of the UK’ where 75 per cent are overweight Needless to say, it’s the ‘lazy scrounger’ narrative all over. However, the blatantly bigoted tirades from corporate media’s resident click-hate merchants wasn’t the only way these outlets farmed outrage and stirred up contempt either. They also churned out a steady stream of analysis articles pointing out the so-called “sickness benefits bill”. Crucially, these made the connection with ‘obesity’ as a driver of increasing rates of ill health and unemployment. Some directly honed in on this, while others merely mused on it in passing. But all were part of building a despicable discourse over fatness. Let’s talk cause and effect here. What do you get when you have a band of right-wing media anti-fat bigots bashing the costs of “obesity-linked benefits”? A government in bed with Big Pharma readying to pimp claimants out for profits. Specifically, this would be the DWP doing a deal with the pharmaceutical corporate devil Eli Lilly for a weight loss drug trial. Essentially, it’s the department testing whether so-called weight-loss jabs could get unemployed claimants back into work. Slow-clap for Labour then. The dust barely settles before Starmer’s government seems to jump jovially aboard another astonishingly atrocious back-to-work bandwagon. In fact, the Times piece was quite literally crooning over a report from healthcare analytics consultancy LCP reifying the welfare savings these drugs could foment. What the Times didn’t mention? That Novo Nordisk A/S has previously paid an author of the report – Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard – for studies into the healthcare costs of ‘obesity-related’ conditions. That would of course be the same Novo Nordisk that manufactures two of the major weight loss drugs in question – Wegovy and Ozempic. Additionally, Pearson-Stuttard also took fees from Pfizer outside the study. The company produces weight loss drugs too. Go figure. So perhaps it’s no surprise Pearson-Stuttard was plugging the “cashable savings for the welfare system” of Novo Nordisk’s drugs to the Times. Honourable mention too to former DWP coalition government Liberal Democrat minister-turned-lobbyist Steve Webb for jumping on the Wegovy-train as another author on the report. The so-called “worklessness crisis” narrative and weight loss jabs have been banging around together at least since Sunak launched Wegovy NHS trials in June 2023. Then health secretary Steve Barclay boasted the boon they could be for the economy by getting people back to work. Predictably, this – at least in part – revolved around building: evidence that the drugs can reduce the benefits bill And since then, the right-wing press and politicians have been increasingly trading on this anti-fat benefit claimant propaganda. Yet, that has hardly been the end of it. Because, if that all weren’t insulting enough, in December, the Telegraph reported that: Obese people are to be given gastric band surgery on the NHS in a drive to reduce worklessness. So, we have both pharmaceutically suppressing appetites and surgically shrinking people’s stomachs. That’s the new Labour government’s grand plan for getting claimants back to work? There’s a stupefying scale of anti-fat bigotry on display in all this. And as the Canary’s Steve Topple has noted, it all comes down to the matter of coercion. He tempered that it doesn’t mean that “Labour is that dystopian – yet” that it’s going to condition benefits on their take-up. After all, it’s early trial days for now on both counts. At minimum though, the rancid rhetoric the press is spouting could pave the way for the DWP withdrawing disability benefits from people with conditions it links to obesity. And that’s a form of coercion too. Namely that by rendering people without support, it could leave them with little choice but to turn to these drastic – and sometimes dangerous – health interventions. Not that there’s actually any guarantee that either will actually improve people’s health, or help them find work with a livable wage. There aren’t even enough jobs going for the number of job seekers, let alone sick and disabled people that the government seems hell-bent on shunting into work. Plus, vacancy numbers say nothing of whether the work is appropriate, accessible, and accommodating of people’s health conditions. Not to mention the companies too numerous to count who’s bosses are parasitic pricks profiting off the backs of low-waged workforces. Every article we found bandied about the concept of ‘obesity’. This pertains to the medical measurement of body mass index (BMI). That might seem innocuous enough at first glance. However, it’s premised on a medical model that disparages fat bodies as automatic indicators of unhealthiness. Essentially, it promotes fatness as something that needs to be fixed. Of course, this atrociously ableist thinking tracks, given its roots in eugenics. It was 19th century Belgian astronomer, mathematician, and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet who invented the model that later formed the basis of BMI. Notably though, he did so on a study he conducted with only white French and Scottish men. In other words, by its very origins it centred whiteness and patriarchy. Moreover, he pursued this to identify the “ideal” weight and size for an “average man” – by which he quite clearly meant white Western European males. A telling passage in his book laid bare the ableism at the heart of it: Everything differing from his proportion or condition would constitute deformity or disease. Fatness above his metrics constituted a deviation from his “ideal” and inherently signalled sickness. Invariably, it fed into the dominant ideology of the day to devalue chronically ill and disabled lives. Because from there, a who’s who of 19th and 20th century eugenicists took up the concept. Predictably, vulture capitalists of the 20th century also sniffed out the profits potential of this junk science-turned medical model. Life and health insurance companies adopted it as a predictor of health conditions. So let me be clear: the implicit assumption that there’s anything wrong with fatness in the first place is utter bullshit. The medical mainstreaming of BMI is about one thing, and one thing only. That is, the capitalist urge for policing poor, racialised, and disabled bodies. In short, insurance companies hijacked BMI to deny claims. Now, the media-political corporate establishment is making mutterings over removing disability benefits linked to ‘obesity’. These things aren’t unrelated. In a nutshell, it’s the very same eugenicist medical science that threads through both repressive weaponisations of anti-fat stigma and bias. However, the history of the terminology the corporate media has been using is just the start of all that’s wrong with the coverage. Another is that the term ‘obesity’ has a linguistic origin that’s hardly less problematic. The Latin etymology ‘obesus’ translates as “having eaten oneself fat”. Additionally then, there’s in-built oppression and othering from a term that literally blames people for their body weight. And this is also largely the underlying intimation of the articles too. Outlets largely made the suggestion – though not always explicitly – that fatness equates to laziness. In other words, fat bodies are that way because of people’s personal choices in relation to diet and exercise. Obviously, there’s so much wrong with this too. Topple has also previously underscored how this hugely misses the point that, in multiple ways, it isn’t a choice. He highlighted a number of examples: Moreover, inequitable access to healthy food is also not only down to poverty, but also due food deserts too. Specifically, where you live can determine the cost and availability of food as well. Then there’s dietary requirements that can limit the types of food people can eat safely, or that their body needs. These include things like allergies, autoimmune conditions, diabetes, conditions causing digestive dysfunction like gastroparesis, or eating difficulties like dysphagia. Many neurodivergent people also have personal ‘safe foods’. Moreover, plenty of these and other health conditions therefore affect people’s weight gain or loss. So ultimately, it’s massively ableist to make out a person’s body weight is down to their own personal dietary failings. And talking of time poverty for overworked and exhausted households – we’ll say it again: disability benefits are also not out-of-work benefits. Many people claiming them actually work, so this extends to them as well. Some people – like those with ME – also can’t and shouldn’t exercise, or risk a permanent worsening of their health. The point is, framing exercise and diet as a choice vastly oversimplifies something with multiply-marginalising factors at play. Of course, the right-wing press knows all this, but has put out this constant drip of discriminatory drivel regardless. At the end of the day, hawking hate pays. Bedding down with Big Pharma pays. Celebrating body diversity, tackling structural health inequalities, and buttressing society with a functioning, fair welfare system? Not so much – and the political establishment media lapdogs know this too.",Canary,2025-01-14T18:44:57+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/anti-fatness-media-headlines/
Leicester and Birmingham students keep resisting university complicity in Gaza genocide,"Students remain on the frontline of resistance against institutional complicity in Israel’s genocide in Gaza. In Leicester, five students are set to go on hunger strike following their university’s harsh repression of anti-genocide protests. In Birmingham, meanwhile, students and others are calling for their university to protect the right to protest amid controversial disciplinary proceedings. According to a press release from Leicester Action for Palestine, five University of Leicester students will start a hunger strike on Wednesday 15 January “over the university’s complicity in genocide”. The statement says: This act of protest follows severe repression from the University, who had 11 people arrested in November for allegedly occupying the Attenborough tower, and is inspired by the thousands of Palestinian political prisoners who have hunger struck in the past, as well as our comrades at the Swansea encampment who went on strike for over a week, securing £5 million of divestment from Barclays bank in the process. They want the university to “stop banking with Barclays bank”, “disclose and divest” from companies complicit in the Gaza genocide, and to “demilitarise” the campus by cutting “ties with arms companies currently aiding and profiting off of the genocide”. Regarding the latter, the statement explains that: this includes the 7 and a half million pound research deal with Rolls Royce and Siemens through the school of engineering. Rolls Royce help to produce the F-35’s Israel is using to drop bombs on children and Siemens provided key infrastructure to illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Updates on the hunger strike will appear on @leicsaction4pal on Instagram. Student-staff coalition BhamLiberatedZone, meanwhile, released a press release explaining how the University of Birmingham is: under fire for disciplining two students involved in protests against the university’s financial ties to companies allegedly complicit in human rights violations in Palestine. The “coalition of students, staff, alumni, and public supporters” wants the university to drop disciplinary investigations and “to protect students’ rights to protest”. The coalition calls Antonia Listrat and Mariyah Ali’s treatment “a deeply prejudiced, management-driven disciplinary process”. It asserts: The university has accused them of intimidation and participating in unauthorized protests, but activists argue these allegations are exaggerated, rooted in anti-Palestinian racism, and part of a broader effort to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on campus. Their protest demanded the university’s: divestment from over £76 million in investments and partnerships with companies allegedly tied to the genocide of Palestinian people. But as the statement says: The students have highlighted a pattern of alleged Islamophobia and racial prejudice, including the labelling of Palestinian flags as “threatening” and the removal of such flags from campus, as well as harassment of students wearing Palestine badges. They argue such actions demonstrate systemic repression of pro-Palestinian activism under the guise of maintaining campus safety. The “prolonged process”, meanwhile, “has caused significant stress and harm to the students’ wellbeing, reflecting a punitive approach to silencing dissent”. Campaigners want the university: to drop the disciplinary actions, respect free speech, and address growing calls for divestment and ethical investment practices.",Canary,2025-01-14T16:34:58+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/leicester-birmingham-students/
Cops try to disrupt a Palestine Action meeting - just as the group target Elbit director's business,"Palestine Action targeted the new London premises of an Elbit Director’s consultancy firm, Eagle Strategic Consulting Limited, on Tuesday 14 January. However, at the same time in Bristol cops were ‘visiting’ the venue where a group meeting is being held in Bristol. Coincidence? Palestine Action activists shattered the windows and sprayed the company’s new London address in red paint to symbolise the company’s continued complicity in Palestinian bloodshed: Eagle Strategic acts as a consultancy firm for weapons manufacturers and is wholly owned by Richard Applegate, the former Chairman and current ‘head of strategy and new business’ for Israeli weapons firm Elbit Systems UK. This is the second time his lobbying company have been targeted by the direct action network, with Palestine Action shattering windows and spray painting the building of the Dorset premises in March 2024. Applegate has a long history of lobbying for the Israeli arms company, previously boasting about pulling off a covert political lobbying campaign which secured a £500m from the MOD, by ensuring his “fingerprints weren’t over any of it”. He was caught by journalists admitting that he had applied pressure by “infecting” the system at “every level”. According to Israeli media, Elbit provides up to 80% of the Israeli military’s land based military equipment and 85% of its military drones. It supplies vast numbers of munitions and missiles – including the ‘Iron Sting’ recently developed and deployed for the first time in the 2023-2024 Genocide in Gaza, along with wide categories of surveillance technologies, targeting systems, and innumerate other armaments. Meanwhile, as Palestine Action posted, cops visited the People’s Republic of Stokes Croft; a venue that is hosting a meeting of the group: Called “Smashing the genocide-industrial complex“, the meeting will look at what activists can learn “about effective direct action from the courageous efforts of Palestine Action?”. No wonder the cops weren’t happy. The venue and the group refused to be intimidated, however, and the meeting is due to go ahead as planned. A Palestine Action spokesperson said: We remain committed to targeting all firms and associations which enable Israel’s weapons trade to continue fuelling genocide. There is no space for war criminals on our streets and those responsible for mass murder must be held accountable. Applegate can’t hide behind his consulting firm and changing its premise doesn’t change a thing. We’ve hit Eagle Strategic before, we’ll hit them again and we’ll keep taking action until we’ve shut down Elbit Systems for good.",Canary,2025-01-14T15:34:58+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/palestine-action-eagle-strategic/
The Renters' Rights Bill is a victory says ACORN - but there's still a huge flaw,"As it enters its final stage in the House of Commons, community union ACORN has heralded the Renters’ Rights Bill “a huge victory for the organised renter’s movement”. However, the proposed legislation is still not without its pitfalls. The Renters’ Rights Bill is on the way to delivering improved security and standards for renters, including: A new addition, debated at the ‘report stage’ in parliament on Tuesday 14 January, would see an end to landlords being able to charge rent in advance of a tenancy starting. This is a key issue that ACORN has been campaigning on, and is welcome news for the many renters struggling to secure a place to call home. Low income people, young families and those on benefits are more likely to be asked for several months, or even longer, of rent up front, something that is simply not possible for many. More widely however, the Bill fails to seriously address the issue of unaffordable housing. This is why ACORN has been working alongside partners in the Renters Reform Coalition and MPs to support amendments in this area. One of these amendments, expected to be debated this afternoon, proposes a cap on in tenancy rent rises, to prevent landlords from hiking rents and evicting tenants through the back door. But if we are truly to tackle the burning issue of unaffordable homes, the government needs to introduce controls to stop spiralling rental costs. That’s why ACORN is supporting amendments such as the one put forward by Carla Denyer MP, calling for a national ‘living rent’ commission to set rent levels between tenancies, taking into account factors such as the home’s condition, size and local incomes. Martin Mawdsley, a renter in Liverpool and ACORN representative said: The changes promised in the Renters’ Rights Bill can’t come soon enough for the millions of renters living in poor conditions, extortionately priced homes and with the threat of eviction through no fault of their own hanging over their heads. We’re pleased to see the hard work of our members over the last decade paying off, and we’re glad that the Government has listened to us and will ban bidding wars and landlords being able to change many months worth of rent up front, two areas that ACORN has been campaigning on across the country. But as most renters are spending way more than 30% of their income on rent, and prices just keep rising, we still need more action to make rented homes more affordable. That’s why we’re calling for in-tenancy rent rises to be capped and rent controls to be brought in.",Canary,2025-01-14T13:48:01+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/renters-rights-bill-acorn/
"For the first time since records began, fewer poor students are going to university","For the first time since records began, there has been a decline in the number of the poorest students who end up going to university. Young people from free school meals (FSM) backgrounds fell further behind their peers in England in progressing to higher education from 2021/2022 to 2022/23, with the gap in terms of numbers progressing increasing to over 210,000. The areas with less than one in five FSM learners go onto higher education are drawn mainly from rural and coastal communities. The Access to Higher Education and Regional Inequality: who is missing out? report looks in-depth at progression to higher education for young people from FSM backgrounds across regions and local areas in England from 2005/06 to 2022/23. Key findings in the report include: The report argues that the government needs to build on the success of national collaborative university outreach initiatives that support those from low-income backgrounds, which were first launched 21 years ago with the Aimhigher programme. A new programme should be launched where universities combine their resources working with those 16 and under alongside local targets for FSM learners progressing to higher education. The report is produced by the National Education Opportunities Network (NEON), which is the national organisation for supporting access to higher education for those from under-represented groups in the United Kingdom based at the University of West London. As Professor Graeme Atherton, Director of NEON and author of the report states: This year’s data shows a worrying slowdown in progress in terms of widening access to higher education and shows again clearly the huge differences in future opportunities that young people from low-income backgrounds face across the country. As the government looks to break down regional inequalities post levelling up, higher education progression has to be a central concern.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:44:15+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/14/university-admissions-poorest-students/
"AI seeks to profit from NHS data, with a little help from a 'Labour Friend of Israel'","Artificial intelligence (AI) profit-makers look set to get their hands on NHS data. And lobbying Labour Friends of Israel vice chair Peter Kyle probably played a role. Backdoor privatisation of the NHS is nothing new. Thatcherism paved the way, 2010s austerity made things worse, and then the Covid-19 pandemic helped to push things further. Now, with the economy predictably struggling under Keir Starmer’s Tory continuity government, his neoliberal crack team have suggested that handing NHS and other data to AI companies could help to turn things around. In reality, however, it looks very much like corporate money and influence have triumphed again. Media outlets are currently asking questions like “Has Rachel Reeves crashed the economy?” and “Why has Labour Failed So Badly on the Economy?” The answer, says economist Richard Murphy, is that Reeves has made a conscious ideological choice to avoid the steps necessary to improve the economy. He is also doubtful that artificial intelligence is able to make a big difference without a fundamental shift in the government’s positions. Nonetheless, the Times reported on 12 January that: the health service is set to make its archives of scans, biodata and anonymised patients records available for the first time to train the latest AI models. Ministers think their plans will “attract billions of pounds of investment from American tech firms”. And the awful Peter Kyle, now secretary of state for Science, Innovation and Technology, compared AI development to “the nuclear race” of the 1940s and 50s. A lovely, hopeful image to place into our minds. Importantly, however, WeOwnIt founder Cat Hobbs asked: When did the British public give our permission or mandate to use OUR health data to make a profit for private companies? As the Guardian wrote, meanwhile, Starmer “put concerns over privacy, disinformation and discrimination to one side” when announcing the AI push. “I don’t think that we should have a defensive stance here”, he said. He would say that though, as a corporate crony who happily welcomed a dodgy donation of “£4m from [a] tax haven-based hedge fund with shares in oil and arms”, which also “stood to profit” from Israel’s genocide in Gaza. The fund had invested, for example, in billionaire Israel and Trump fanboy Peter Thiel’s spy tech company Palantir. You know, the pro-Israel company with “deep ties to British and American security agencies”, access to our NHS data, and experience helping to smear progressives, back right-wing causes, and mistreat vulnerable people. Kate Brimsted from law firm Shoosmiths warned about “the substantial data privacy, confidentiality and security challenges that accompany this initiative”. The Guardian has already reported on serious flaws with previous government uses of AI. But officials claim they’ll “take into account national security and ethical concerns”, just like they’ve ‘taken into account’ concerns about the genocide in Gaza while still participating in and legitimising it. AI companies’ mission to profit from NHS and other data, however, needs government insiders. And while massive corporate donations from dodgy hedge funds helps, constant lobbying is key. And Peter Kyle is no stranger to lobbyists’ hospitality. In 2024, openDemocracy reported on how: Hakluyt is a globally operating corporate strategy firm that advises some of the largest companies in the world across all sectors. It spun out of MI6 and despite attempts to shake off its reputation for remaining relatively ‘close’ to the intelligence services in the years since, it is still widely regarded as a retirement home for spies. It added that Hakluyt: forked out several thousand pounds to ferry… Kyle around San Francisco earlier this year. We know that Kyle sat down with senior figures at all the big silicon valley firms while he was there: Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, Open AI et al. On top of that, the firm “arranged a secretive dinner for Kyle to meet with more influential people”. openDemocracy also called Kyle’s role “one of the most lobbyable briefs in government”. And in the run-up to the 2024 election (in which he lost thousands of votes partly over his support for Israel amid its genocide), he “benefited from external support in his office… with the consultancy Public Digital providing a member of staff four days per week to support on policy” and him benefiting “one day per week from the expertise of a member of staff from Faculty AI”. The latter firm: co-authored a substantial policy report titled ‘Governing in the Age of AI: A New Model to Transform the State’. The report was published with the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change… The lobbying apparently worked. Because Kyle and his colleagues are now opening the door for AI profit-making in the NHS and beyond. Starmer’s Labour is a disgrace. And as many on the left predicted, its corporate cronyism and the lack of a mass left-wing alternative has helped to make Reform UK the second most popular party in Britain, and a real contender for power in the next election. The need for the left to come together to present a strong front against the far right and its Tory-Labour enablers is more urgent than ever.",Canary,2025-01-14T12:40:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/14/labour-ai-policy/
Met Police under pressure as outcry increases over Palestine BBC protest ban,"Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) and Coalition partners are today issuing a statement that reaffirms their determination to lead a protest at BBC headquarters in central London despite the efforts of the Met Police to prevent a March for Palestine which it previously agreed to in November 2024. Over the weekend a flurry of public figures have criticised the decision by the Met to use conditions under the Public Order Act to prevent the protest at the BBC on Portland Place, on the grounds that this would cause disruption to a synagogue which is not on the route of the march and despite the fact that there has not been a single documented case of threat or incident at a synagogue in relation to the national Palestine marches that have taken place over the last 15 months of the Gaza genocide. Hundreds of political, social and cultural figures have voiced their support for the right to demonstrate in support of Palestine after substantial evidence emerged that the BBC is failing to uphold its own editorial guidelines in the reporting of Israel’s actions – including MPs, trade union leaders, civil society leaders, actors, musicians and artists. A letter organised by the Jewish bloc which attends in support of every Palestine March has attracted more than 800 signatures by members of the Jewish community calling on the Met to reverse its ban. A group of Holocaust survivors and their descendants have also written a public letter in support of the march. PSC are calling on all those who support an immediate ceasefire and an end to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, as well as everyone who believes in the democratic right to protest, to join them in London at 12 noon on Saturday 18 January for the March for Palestine. The March for Palestine will assemble in Whitehall, which will allow people to form up in massive numbers in an orderly fashion, and then they will march towards the BBC. Organisers have written today to the Met Police seeking a meeting and asking them to work with them to ensure the march can proceed peacefully and finish with a protest outside the BBC. The groups call upon the Met to drop any restrictions which would prevent this. Ben Jamal, PSC Director, said: Hundreds of thousands of people wish to continue to protest at our Government’s ongoing complicity with Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people, which reports this week suggested may have killed tens of thousands more than the suggested figure of 46,000. They also wish to protest at the complicity of the BBC which has failed to report the facts of this genocide, as revealed in recent investigations. There are no legitimate grounds for the Police to impede our proposal to march from Whitehall to the BBC, finishing with a rally outside its HQ. We call upon the Met Police to make clear they will drop any conditions which will deny the right to protest as planned.",Canary,2025-01-13T21:04:11+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-march-18-january-bbc/
One in six UK workers skipping meals as cost of living crisis deepens under Labour,"A survey from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has found that more than one in six UK adults working full time or part time have had to skip meals to make ends meet. The figures come as workers have undergone the largest squeeze in real term pay since Napoleonic times. Real wage growth fell from between 2007-2019 by 0.2%. And it has only improved slightly since, with workers still worse off than they were from before the financial crash and the cost of living crisis continuing. The Labour Party’s first budget failed to address the crisis through measures such as public ownership of essentials (including renewable energy), price controls on essentials and significant rebalancing wealth taxes. Switzerland has kept inflation much lower through its energy security and price controls. The country’s electricity production is 60% from hydropower and 29% from nuclear. On top of that, the Swiss government has issued price controls on 30% of goods and services in the country. This shields its citizens from profiteering price hikes (greedflation) and international gas markets (fossilflation). In the budget, chancellor Rachel Reeves did increase capital gains tax. But she also boasted that we have still have the lowest rate of the G7. Proponents of an increased rate argue that people living off investments shouldn’t pay less tax than those working. Equalising capital gains with income tax rates would rebalance the economy by a further £12.7bn on top of the £2.5bn from Labour’s increase in the budget. The budget’s improvements were piecemeal: Reeves also increased the minimum wage from £11.44 to £12.21 (a 6.7% rise) from April 2025. Workers have undergone the biggest hit to living standards since the 1950s. Food prices generally rose by 19% from March 2022 until March 2023. But some key foods such as pasta and vegetable oil are up by at least 60%. Indeed, in 2023, 61% of the poorest fifth of households reported cutting back on food. And the findings from the TUC umbrella group chime with this. While 17% of worker respondents (more than one in six) said they had skipped meals in the past three months, 8% said they skipped meals most days to make ends meet. Further, 24% said they made large or significant cut backs in food spending over the past year. And 31% of working adults said they never or only occasionally put the heating on. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak had positive things to say about Labour’s Employee Rights Bill, currently at committee stage in parliament. The bill would ban zero hours contracts, among other measures. Nowak also said: After 14 years of Tory chaos and stagnation, we urgently need to boost living standards and to get more money into people’s pockets. This is vital for workers and for local economies too",Canary,2025-01-13T20:30:31+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/cost-of-living-skipping-meals/
The Scottish government has 'abjectly failed' over ordinary people's access to justice,"Environmental charities including the RSPB and the Environmental Rights Centre for Scotland (ERCS) have called out the Scottish government’s ‘abject failure’ to meet the access to justice requirements of the UN Aarhus Convention. In 2021, the Convention’s compliance committee gave Scotland six recommendations to remove barriers that are preventing people from taking environmental cases to court. The UK’s final progress report confirms none of the recommendations have been met and it remains ‘prohibitively expensive’ to access justice. Scotland, as part of the UK, is a signatory to the Aarhus Convention, a UN treaty that guarantees people’s rights to access information, participate in decision-making and access justice in environmental matters. Following the most recent ruling of non-compliance by the Convention’s governing bodies in 2021, the Scottish government was required to make access to justice affordable, reform time limits for judicial review and reform planning permissions by the deadline of 1 October 2024. Yet the UK’s Final Progress Report to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee (ACCC) confirmed that Scotland has made only minor modifications to legal expenses and no concrete commitments for future reform. Comments on the UK report, submitted jointly by the RSPB, ERCS and Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland, have been scathing in their assessment of government action to date, with signatories remarking that they are ‘deeply concerned and frustrated that, as a whole, the UK has failed to make any tangible progress’. For the past two years, Scottish legal experts have been raising concerns about the Scottish government’s lack of progress in removing barriers to environmental justice. Campaigners held a rally outside the Court of Session to mark the 1 October deadline, with speakers urging the Scottish government to ensure citizens can hold public bodies and polluters to account for environmental harm. Access to justice remains unaffordable for two main reasons. First, it is incredibly difficult to access legal aid for environmental cases. Second, the ‘loser pays’ rule means that litigants are liable to pay their opponents fees if they lose their case which can cost tens of thousands of pounds. The ACCC has clearly stated that this causes a ‘chilling effect’ – deterring individuals and organisations taking legal action, even if they have a strong case to do so. Shivali Fifield, Chief Officer at ERCS, said: Upholding our environmental rights in court is the ultimate guarantee of the rule of law. Without this credible threat, polluters can act with impunity. Scotland, as part of the UK, has been a signatory to the Aarhus Convention for nearly two decades, but despite repeated warnings from legal experts and campaigners, it has a record of abject failure when it comes to delivering the reforms needed to guarantee access to justice for environmental cases. After years of broken promises, it would be easy to think that the government is threatened by adhering to international law and making access to justice affordable. If they truly believe in community empowerment and a just transition to net zero, they must make our legal system work for people and planet. Aedán Smith, Head of Policy & Advocacy at RSPB Scotland, said: Scotland is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world and we are continuing to lose nature, with 1 in 9 species at risk of national extinction. Yet, despite welcome progress to improve some legal protections for nature over recent years, it remains extremely difficult for individuals and community groups to challenge poor decisions. The Scottish Government must urgently address this to ensure the laws it has introduced can be implemented effectively and as intended.",Canary,2025-01-13T17:07:17+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/scotland-access-to-justice/
Palestine Action has a new company in its sights over Israel's genocide in Gaza,"Palestine Action Scotland targeted the offices of military parts manufacturer Parker Hannifin at its Glasgow production facility overnight on Monday 13 January, damaging the building and covering it in red paint, which it said was ‘symbolic of the Palestinian blood on the hands of the company’. The building on Seaford Road South, which Parker Hannifin describes as a ‘state-of-the-art production facility’ for its Parker Prädifa technology division, had multiple windows smashed during the nighttime action. Its walls and signage, as well as the interior of the building, were sprayed with red paint: A Palestine Action Scotland spokesperson said the activists who carried out the direct action did so because Parker Hannifin is a supplier to Leonardo and other major weapons companies that make military products used by Israel’s forces in its attacks on Gaza. Leonardo has extensive ties to the Israeli state and makes parts for Apache helicopters and targeting systems for F-35 fighter jets, which have been used by Israel to drop 2000lb bombs on Gaza, destroying homes and civilian infrastructure, and killing tens of thousands of civilians. Leonardo’s site in Edinburgh has been targeted and shut down by activists multiple times since Israel’s ongoing destruction of Gaza intensified in October 2023. Parker Hannifin itself has been involved in the design, development, testing and production of the F-35. Its fuel systems and components are used for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It provides systems for military helicopters and drones to companies including Leonardo Helicopters. Its products are designed to meet specialist military-ready specifications for use in missiles, ordnance and aircraft, as well as use in flight control systems, jet engines and landing gear. The action was the first time that activists in Scotland have targeted Parker Hannifin for its links to the destruction of Gaza, which is described as genocide in a case brought to the International Court of Justice by South Africa and 11 other countries. An investigation by Amnesty International has concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Palestine Action Scotland’s spokesperson said: We are sickened that the continuing genocide is made possible by companies based in Scotland that are happy to profit by designing, making and selling products that result in the mass murder of Palestinian people in Gaza. Every company that chooses to be part of the supply chain to Israel’s military, including Parker Hannifin, shares responsibility for and profits from the shredding of children’s bodies in Gaza, and we will not rest until they cut all their connections to that chain of brutality. By carrying out this action, we intervened directly to disrupt the flow of technology that enables the ongoing genocide. Parker Hannifin has blood on its hands and will remain a target until it cuts its ties to complicit companies including Leonardo and stops supplying essential parts and materials without which apartheid Israel’s weapons could not cause the horrors being committed every day against the Palestinian people. In taking this action, we have been inspired by and acted in solidarity with our friends and comrades in Gaza and throughout all of Palestine, from river to sea. We look forward to celebrating the liberation of Palestine with you in the near future.",Canary,2025-01-13T15:46:02+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/13/palestine-action-parker-hannifin/
13 Holocaust survivors and descendants slam Met Police over Palestine demo ban at BBC,"Thirteen Holocaust survivors and survivor descendants have just signed a joint letter protesting against the Met Police’s plans to prevent the next Palestine march from gathering outside the BBC headquarters on 18 January. As survivors of the Jewish genocide, or descendants of such survivors, the 13 say they are in despair at the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. This is especially the case when this same government intends to commemorate other genocides – including that of the group’s Jewish relatives – on Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. How any politician can commemorate past genocides while openly supporting an ongoing genocide is something future historians will study with horror and disbelief. But this just makes it all the more important for those of us who oppose all genocides to continue to protest. Naturally, the government and other supporters of Israeli crimes want to discredit and suppress our protests. Having run out of other arguments, they can only resort to claims that people’s demonstrations are somehow antisemitic. As survivors and survivor descendants, the 13 individuals say they take antisemitism extremely seriously. Consequently, they would always make sure of their facts before accusing anyone of antisemitism. Unfortunately, many supporters of Israel are rarely so careful and they routinely accuse anyone they disagree with of antisemitism without any evidence. Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos spoke at a Palestine rally in Hyde Park in April: Note the respect with which the crowd listens to Stephen. This is not the sort of crowd that would ever chant the horrible phrase ‘genocide of Jews’ – yet this is the sort of completely unsubstantiated claim that the right-wing press are resorting too in order to have Palestine demos banned. The 13 also took part in a previous Palestine demo near the BBC headquarters on 18 May: The BBC also broadcast interviews with them there on that day and their journalists will have witnessed the overwhelmingly warm reception from the crowd. The letter from the 13 reads in full as follows: The Metropolitan police intend to ban the 18 January Palestine march from the area around the BBC headquarters in Portland Place in London. Their excuse is that Jewish attendees at a synagogue that is well away from the march route will suffer ‘disruption’ of their religious worship. We are writing as Jewish Holocaust survivors, and descendants of survivors, to protest against this clear attempt to dissuade people from opposing the Gaza genocide. Along with thousands of other openly Jewish protesters, we have attended numerous Palestine demos in London and have received nothing but support and warmth from our fellow demonstrators.

Just Stop Oil take bold action - because Darwin would be turning in his grave,"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted Charles Darwin’s grave to demand that the UK government works with others to phase out the extraction and burning of fossil fuels by 2030. At around 9:30am on Monday 13 January, two Just Stop Oil supporters entered Westminster Abbey and proceeded to use spray chalk to write ‘1.5 Is Dead’ on Charles Darwin’s grave: This was referencing the news that the world has exceeded the ‘safe’ 1.5 degree warming limit agreed by world leaders in Paris in 2015. The supporters could be heard saying “2024 was the hottest year on record. We have passed the 1.5 degree threshold that was supposed to keep us safe. Millions are being displaced, California is on fire and we have lost three quarters of all wildlife since the 1970’s. Darwin would be turning in his grave to know we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. The government’s plans will take us to over 3 degrees of warming. This will destroy everything we love. World leaders must stop burning oil, gas and coal by 2030”: One of those taking action was Alyson Lee who said: Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we have already exceeded the so-called safe temperature rise of 1.5 degrees, and are heading for over 3 degrees of warming. This rapidly accelerating crisis means huge parts of the world will become unable to support life, resulting in millions of refugees, social collapse and extinction for countless species.” Despite lots of fine words from international leaders, emissions are still rising. Without real action, words are useless, you cannot negotiate with the laws of physics. We need mass civil disobedience now, join us on the streets and help us reclaim parliament this April. Also taking action was Di Bligh who stated: Darwin once said- ‘It is not the strongest of the species, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change, that lives within the means available and works cooperatively against common threats. Last year was the hottest since modern humans evolved. If we do not work together to reign in the corporations and billionaires driving us beyond our means, humanity will not be able to adapt to what is coming. We are on course to lose everything, and politicians are doing nowhere near enough to prevent it. How many will we have to bury as a result of climate breakdown and who will be left to mourn them? Just Stop Oil’s action came as the death toll rises to 24 in California, as fires continue to rip across the state. The fires have been driven by climate breakdown after decades of drought, followed by rapid swings between extreme wet and dry conditions in the past two years. This has created large areas of ‘tinder dry’ vegetation, creating the perfect conditions for uncontrollable wildfires. Meanwhile, the Copernicus Climate Change Service has confirmed that 2024 was the first year on record with a global average temperature exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. All continents except Australasia and Antarctica experienced their hottest year on record, with 11 months of the year exceeding the 1.5°C level. All ten of the hottest years on record have fallen within the last decade. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again this April.

REVEALED: MSM disproportionately targets mental health-related DWP claimants in attack articles,"Disabled people living with mental health conditions came on the receiving end of an exponential surge in corporate media attacks against benefit claimants in 2024. Across the year, the right-wing press cranked up its concerted campaign to vilify chronically ill and disabled claimants more than eleven-fold. But significantly, over half of this coverage featured references to mental health as a leading factor in the recent post-pandemic-height rise in claims. Of course, the substantial uptick in attention on claimants with mental health conditions could have devastating ramifications in the real world. The Canary’s analysis comes amidst “senior government” sources tipping off the Telegraph that Labour Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ministers plan to proceed with some iteration of the former Conservative government’s brutal Personal Independence Payment (PIP) reforms. Already then, this media-manufactured outrage is serving as a convenient pretext for the Labour government to unleash an ideological swathe of new austerity assaults to the welfare system. It’s all a crucial reminder of how the right-wing manoeuvres to single out disabled demographics as undeserving of social security support. The Canary unveiled that in 2024, the corporate media enormously ramped up its scapegoating of disability benefit claimants. Specifically, coverage of disability benefits in the Telegraph, the Times, and the Daily Mail together sky-rocketed more than 1130% from 2023’s output. But notably, the Canary’s research also found that the three outlets had certain marginalised demographics in their sights in particular. The outlets honed in on mental health within the context of disability benefits and unemployment specifically in at least 23 articles (7.7%). In total, the three outlets put out 147 articles either focusing on mental health and disability benefits, or mentioning the two. Notably, the Canary only included articles that did so in a way that made a connection between the two, or at minimum implied it. It meant that nearly half the articles in the Canary’s data drew attention to mental health in the context of disability benefit claims and unemployment. They published the majority of these – 135 – in 2024 alone. What’s more, they weren’t the only marginalised group the mainstream hate-merchants put in the firing line for benefit clampdowns either. Neurodivergent stigma featured heavily across the corporate outlets’ output too – again showing a marked increase in 2024. Articles attributed the rise in disability benefit claims to the increase in claims from autistic people, and people with ADHD. There were 19 pieces (6.4%) that specifically focused on these in the three outlets’ coverage. All but one of these they wrote in 2024. Neurodivergence and the connection to disability benefits cropped up across 39 articles within our analysis time-frame all told (13.1%). The Telegraph published just two of these in 2023, while neither the Times nor the Daily Mail linked these in articles before 2024. The results offer more proof – if we needed it – that the right-wing press and government have a blatant joined-up agenda to strip disabled people of their benefits wherever they can whip up politically-motivated moral panic. Where mental health was concerned, a clear narrative emerged. Specifically, the outlets visibly capitalised on the Covid pandemic’s psychological fallout. In particular, they visibly did so to prey on claimants with mental health conditions. Articles frequently posited pandemic lockdowns and school closures as a key factor in the surge of mental health problems among young people. Naturally, the right-wing press has been quick to condemn Covid protection measures that helped to shield more clinically vulnerable populations at the height of the pandemic. A Times article in January 2024 proclaimed that: The effect of lockdown and school closures on the mental health of young people has also meant more need help with everyday life, officials believe By contrast, as for the trauma of living through a global deadly and disabling pandemic, it was tumbleweed from the trio. So between them, outlets simultaneously blamed protections that were vital for keeping chronically ill and disabled people safe, while at the same time managing to punch down on people psychologically disabled by the pandemic. Of course, leave it to the right-wing foghorns to deal a double-blow of ableism in one. However, more than this, it’s patently clear that the aim was to invalidate new cases of mental health diagnoses. The Canary’s data uncovered a chicken-and-egg style dance between the corporate media and halls of power. We identified how conversations on mental health and disability benefits first appeared noticeably in January 2023. Then, in September 2023, then DWP boss Mel Stride announced proposals for a dangerous tightening of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). Notably, this included honing in on mental health claimants. Significantly, the Tories’ response to the consultation stated how the government would: specify the circumstances, and physical and mental health conditions, for which LCWRA [limited capability for work-related activity] Substantial Risk should apply. In other words, the DWP will decide who this descriptor will apply to going forward. Or, in short, it will obviously move the goalposts to exclude many people living with mental health conditions. Up to that point in September, we had found at least seven articles that disparaged the rise in mental health-related claims. Of course, we can’t say for certain that these shaped the government’s thinking. However, it seems no coincidence that right-wing talking heads had been harping on about it not long before it took root in the establishment echo-chambers of Westminster. Arguably, timing is everything where the corporate press treads. So, it was also no mistake that it started stepping up its vitriol against claimants with mental health conditions in 2024 either. In other words, the Telegraph, Times, and Daily Mail planted the seed in the public consciousness. Policy-makers took up this convenient narrative and scapegoat. And on the merry-go-round of client media revolving door politics continued. It’s easy to see how the corporate media fear-mongering then paved the way for politicians making a political football out of disabled people with mental health conditions. In fact, the Canary’s data helped plot a notable timeline of this very development as well. Between January and the end of March 2024, the three posted a flurry of articles that directly honed in on this connection: Cue, a disgusting diatribe from Stride. On 20 March, he opined to the Telegraph on all things stereotyping and stigmatising mental health. He made classic bogus contention of work as a health outcome, claiming that: we seem to have forgotten that work is good for mental health If that weren’t bad enough, Stride took to the dismissive and downright despicable diminishing of people’s mental health. He derided it as the “normal ups and downs of human life” and a case of people “feeling rather down and bluesy”. The corporate media had been banging on about all this so vehemently, that it gave Stride the perfect ready-made justification for his atrocious claims. And that of course was the entire point. It should therefore come as little surprise that the Tory government followed this up with a raft of ludicrous welfare reform proposals too. Less surprising still: that people with mental health conditions were a particular target. In April 2024, the Tories launched their toxic proposals for changes to Personal Independence Payment (PIP). As with the WCA changes, this would also legislate to shut people with mental health conditions out from the disability benefits system. Naturally though, it wasn’t the end of it when Labour took to the helm either. Unsurprisingly, Labour’s DWP chief hate-hawker Liz Kendall has certainly been living up to her arch-right-wing ideology. While she made a big song and dance that she wasn’t jumping on her predecessor’s “bluesy” bandwagon – she basically did anyway. In November, she suggested that “self-diagnosed” mental health had contributed to the rise in people unable to work. So, that would be: people unable to access underfunded mental health diagnosis services then? What’s more, it was all wrapped up in a grandstanding over sanction threats, naturally. However, more than her disgraceful diatribes, she has gone pedal to the metal on policy-making as well. For instance, job coaches in more mental health settings is one example of Labour amping up this hostile offensive. Moreover, lo and behold, Labour appears to now be mulling some of these PIP reforms too. And if it seems a little too on the nose that anonymous “senior government” sources were spilling the tea to the Telegraph, it really shouldn’t. This is what the client media do best. The DWP is scratching the Telegraph’s back with an insider tip off. Conversely, the dutiful mouthpiece is doing the government’s dirty work, in preemptively announcing it. A shameless PR-type move to lessen the reputational blow this Spring? It seems highly plausible. The dataset also reinforced the fact that it has been a similar story for neurodivergent claimants. The first piece the Canary found goading the link was a Telegraph article in August 2023 titled: Number of children on disability benefit jumps after surge in ADHD and autism cases Of course, many of the articles revolved around this bogus notion the right-wing scapegoat-mongers have been spouting. Specifically, this is that healthcare professionals are over-diagnosing people with ADHD and autism. Naturally, the implication in the coverage seems to be that autistic people, and people with ADHD shouldn’t be claiming disability benefits either. Broadly, the articles are also suggesting that many have been wrongly diagnosed, and ergo again, should not be eligible to claim disability-based social support. The Canary’s Rachel Charlton-Dailey has been documenting this. In August, she debunked one of these shameful tirades. And notably, the article was emblematic of the broader discourse at play across the Canary’s dataset. For one, it had all the hallmarks of the most classic ableist tropes around neurodivergence. Overdiagnosis made its cameo appearance, as did a sweep of antiquated terms which Charlton-Dailey incisively pointed out the outlet had used to “delegitimise the conditions”. Significantly though, it was the Telegraph’s deployment of misleading statistics to underpin its nonsense claims that was most characteristic of the articles in our dataset. In its case, it made a number of deliberate categorical conflations to misrepresent the figures. Charlton-Dailey explained that: Despite linking the two and putting the main total of 730,000 kids with DLA – much, much further down, the article itself explains that less than half of claims (337,000) were for “neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and Asperger’s syndrome”. They then pulled out that 72,500 kids claimed benefits for “hyperkinetic syndrome – also known as ADHD”, despite making it sound like a separate figure this will have actually gone in with the 337k. Separately, Fullfact also eviscerated the statistical claims of the piece. The article (still) claims that: The number of parents claiming disability benefits for children with conditions such as ADHD and autism has surged by 200,000 since lockdown, new figures reveal. However, this simply isn’t true. As Fullfact detailed, that increase instead: refers to the total increase in DLA claims for under-18s, rather than only those related to ADHD and autism. Naturally, there were other problematic parts of the article too. But the bottom line was that it was using inaccurate, manipulated figures to make neurodivergent claimants a target of public acrimony. In reality, neurodivergent claimants actually made up a small fraction of the overall increases. Not that it should matter anyway. Regardless, it hasn’t stopped outlet’s spewing a slew of headlines all making the same bogus over-egged connection. Other shitty takes on neurodivergent disability claims? What the Times outlandishly branded “a new industry” of “disability influencers”. It tracks that the ableist bigot soapbox would frame a community of disabled people helping other disabled people with the notoriously inaccessible disability benefits process, in this egregiously derogatory way. The bullshit insinuation is of course that neurodivergent people are gaming the system – go figure. And like with the media fanfare over mental health claims, politicians haven’t passed up the opportunity to pounce on all this either. Amidst his vile comments on mental health in April, Stride also questioned whether people with ADHD and learning disabled people should be entitled to disability benefits. Predictably, the right-wing outlets have continued with all this in 2025. Less than two weeks in, and establishment shill the Telegraph was platforming former New Labour prime minister Tony Blair’s odious warnings to the government on mental health. He revived the ghost of DWP Tory past, parroting Stride’s facetious “ups and downs” of life drivel. In tandem, Kendall’s self-diagnosis claims made a cameo appearance. Once again, it perfectly illustrated how indistinguishable Labour’s welfare rhetoric is from the Tories. Ultimately, disabled people know all too well where corporate media scapegoating leads. This latest maligning of mental health and neurodivergence is invariably a warning signal for the next round of callous cuts and reforms. Of course, they won’t be the only demographics in line for this. The Canary has documented how it’s part of a broader-scale attack on disabled claimants en masse. We don’t know the details of what Labour has in store yet this Spring. However, all chatter from the government so far points in the direction of some form of the dangerous WCA and PIP reforms. What is clear is that if it takes its cue from the corporate media’s crackdown circus, it will spell more misery and harm for neurodivergent folks and disabled people with mental health conditions alike.",Canary,2025-01-13T12:07:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/13/msm-mental-health-dwp/
Gaie Delap spent her 78th birthday in prison - and people came out to show solidarity,"A vigil to mark unjustly imprisoned Just Stop Oil activist Gaie Delap’s 78th birthday was held outside Eastwood Park Prison on Friday 10th January. It came after she was sent back to prison – despite having served her sentence – because of failures of the criminal justice system. The vigil for Gaie a peaceful and dignified Quaker-led occasion accompanied by family and friends: https://x.com/JustStop_Oil/status/1878396377899655427 It is now three weeks since Gaie was arrested and returned to prison following systemic failings in the management of her home detention curfew. These include evidence of deceit on the part of Serco EMS who manage tagging arrangements on behalf of the Ministry of Justice (see our New Year’s statement). Gaie’s brother, Mick, who visited her last Friday said: Despite her outrage, tempered with resignation, she tries to stay strong. She knows about the vigil. She is overwhelmed with the messages of support she has received. The best birthday present for her would be that common sense and justice prevail and lead to her re-release. Lily Pridie, her daughter, had this message for her mother: Please stay strong and keep your spirits up. We are so proud of you. Thousands of people are supporting you. Let’s hope that something positive comes out as a result of this awful situation. One of the organisers of the vigil Jo Flanagan said: The vigil will be supported by dozens of singers from the Climate Choir Movement which started in Bristol. Several of the organisers of this movement are Quakers and know Gaie personally and attend the same Quaker Meeting House in Bristol including the two co- founders. Many of the principles on which the choir it is founded align with Quaker values including peacefully singing ‘truth to power’ and standing up against injustice. Close friend Mike Campbell added: Gaie makes it clear too that this is not just about her situation. There are other countless women who are impacted by tagging failures. She told us about a woman released late and then recalled because there was no available bus to get home in time for their curfew. She also witnesses daily the impact of imprisonment on other women, those with mental health problems, addiction issues, mothers separated from their children. Like Gaie, these are women who should not be in prison. Another birthday present for Gaie arrived early. This was in the form of a song called Eastwood Park Blues, written and performed by the Blue House Buoys, with a call to Shabana Mahmood, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Timpson, Prisons Minister to ‘free Gaie Delap’. “Dearest Gaie, we shower you with love”, said a spokesperson for group. Carla Denyer, Green MP for Bristol Central, said “My heart goes out to Gaie who is spending her 78th birthday behind bars – all because the private company responsible for fitting electronic tags couldn’t find one the right size for her. I know her friends and family are desperate to see her come home. Gaie has not broken bail conditions, neither is she a threat to the public. I find it beyond belief that a solution cannot be found to get Gaie home”: As Gaie’s MP I have tried everything I can to challenge the decision to send her back to prison – including writing to the prisons minister Lord Timpson and the probation service – and I will continue to push for her release. Hannah Greer, of the Good Law Project who are crowdfunding for Gaie’s legal fees, said: You should not be in prison on your birthday. On behalf of the hundreds of supporters whose generosity has so far raised over £20,000 you have our continued support and we send birthday greetings. Melanie Jameson from Quakers in Criminal Justice who are upholding Gaie on her birthday said “With prisons overflowing, this is no place for peaceful climate protesters. In Gaie’s case, we are appalled that Serco’s failings have led to her recall”.

"McDonnell brands Treasury response to bond markets turbulence ""economically inept""","Former Labour Party shadow chancellor John McDonnell has denounced the Treasury for reportedly planning to use bond markets turbulence as an excuse to cut welfare: The issue is that the bond market itself attaches debt to the financing of public services in a form of corporate welfare. The gilt set up constrains government and functions as a tool for private finance to extract money from the public. This week, Reform MP Rupert Lowe tabled a bill to ban quantitative easing. He said: Our moral decline is clearly evident as true capitalism has been undermined by regular intervention, increasing state regulation and a growing, bloated and inefficient state Regulation often means the standards that uphold quality in society. And the idea the state is necessarily inefficient makes no sense, given public ownership of essential services brings down prices for people and businesses. It also helps control inflation through keeping pricing low on the essentials society needs, like water, energy (say, through a Green New Deal) and the internet. And it’s inflation that is a key driver of the increase in price of government bonds. It’s a merry-go-round of con artistry. Essentials are a risk free investment for the state to run (and can do in a way that’s accountable to the people). That’s because we aren’t going to wake up one day and say we don’t need water anymore or we’re going to stop using electricity and live in caves. Lowe further described quantitative easing as a “national ponzi scheme”. But what we have at present is that money is created when private banks issue loans to people. This is a system where we rent our money from private banks, rather than the state issuing it without interest. Money could be cost price, rather than effective usury. As the Bank of England explains on its website: Most of the money in the economy is created, not by printing presses at the central bank, but by banks when they provide loans… Banks create around 80% of money in the economy as electronic deposits in this way. In comparison, banknotes and coins only make up 3%. Positive Money, meanwhile, estimates that 97% of the money in the economy is created in this way. So, McDonnell was right to call out just how the Labour government is responding to the bond markets. Whether it listens or not remains to be seen.",Canary,2025-01-12T11:11:36+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/12/bond-markets/
150 MPs and public figures slam the Met over pro-Palestine BBC march restriction,"Cross-party MPs and peers, trade union general secretaries, cultural figures and celebrities, writers, journalists, health workers and civil society organisations and activists have condemned police attempts to stop an agreed Protest for Palestine taking place at the BBC on Saturday 18 January. In a statement issued today (10 January) by the six organisations behind the national Palestine marches, and supported by at least 150 high profile individuals and organisations, including Liberty, Amnesty International UK, and Greenpeace, the Metropolitan Police are accused of misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. Among those to have signed the statement are musician Brian Eno, singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, actors Mark Rylance, Khalid Abdalla, Nadia Sawalha and Juliet Stevenson, author Susan Abulhawa, economist Yanis Varoufakis, Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty and Asad Rehman, executive director, War on Want, along with several leading health workers, including London Hospital A&E doctor Dr Andrew Myerson. Labour, Independent, Green, Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein and SNP MPs have signed, while trade union leaders include PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, the NEU’s Daniel Kebede and FBU leader Matt Wrack. The route of the march was agreed by the Met in November. They have now reneged on that agreement, citing possible disruption to a synagogue, which is not on the route of the march. Making the point about the preciousness of the rights to freedom of speech and protest the statement concludes: It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC. We call on the police to drop their objections and allow the protest to go ahead as planned. We strongly condemn police attempts to stop an agreed march for Palestine from protesting at the BBC on 18 January. The route for the march was confirmed with the Police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police is reneging on the agreement and has stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. The police should not be misusing public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that the march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue which is not even on the march route. As the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that pro-Palestine marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that Jewish people have been joining the marches in their thousands. The rights to protest and free speech are precious. It is not acceptable in a democratic society that, in the face of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, people should be barred from protesting at the BBC.

Headteachers warn of Labour's austerity 2.0 as schools face 'death by a thousand cuts',"Headteachers have intervened after a report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that funding for primary and secondary schools is facing a 0.8% cut under the Labour Party government. And that’s before you account for the 5% cut to each government department that chancellor Rachel Reeves quietly announced before Christmas, branded as “efficiency savings”. The 0.8% reduction is because of a promised increase in teachers’ salaries. But providing more income for undervalued teachers shouldn’t come at the price of cutting resources for schools, as well as increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. Overall, the education budget already faced a 9% cut from 2010-2020. This was drastic for school sixth forms that underwent cuts of 26%. The lack of funding forced 47 school sixth forms to close from 2016-2019. Funding for colleges, meanwhile, will still be 11% lower than in 2010. Julie McCulloch, director of policy as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: This report reveals the reality that is facing many schools and colleges – yet another round of cutbacks. It will inevitably mean further reductions to pastoral support, curriculum options and classroom resources. It is also likely that in many cases class sizes will increase. Schools and colleges have been expected to absorb relentless financial pressures over the past 15 years, and they have done an incredible job in minimising the impact on students. But we cannot go on like this. It is death by a thousand cuts. The government must recognise the importance of improved investment in education. When it comes to a share of GDP, education spending has also fallen from around 5.6% of national income in 2010 to about 4.1% in 2023-24. The National Education Union (NEU) is also not happy with Labour’s proposed pay increase. The government already issued a 5.5% pay increase for teachers for the 2024-25 academic year. But, according to the NEU, teachers pay in real terms remains 20% lower than in 2010. NEU general secretary Daniel Kebede said: The current proposal of 2.8 per cent is not sufficient to even start to address the crisis in recruitment and retention. The suggestion that an unfunded pay award can be paid for by making ‘efficiencies’ is an insult to a profession who have already endured 14 years of austerity. Thousands of teachers voted for the change that Labour promised for education. They promised to invest in education, to recruit 6,500 teachers and to value education and to secure the life chances of our children. The austerity has gotten so bad that headteachers are taking on additional roles. Amanda Richards, the headteacher of Sytchampton primary in Worcestershire, said in April 2024 that her school “literally can’t afford” a permanent caretaker. Richards told the Guardian: I’m 53 this year; I’m not built for lifting and shifting, to be honest with you. But there isn’t anyone else to do it. Just before half-term, the toilets in our new building were blocked. So when that happens during the day, it’s me who puts the marigolds on and goes down to the toilets with the plunger and tries to unblock it as best as I can. That’s a fairly regular occurrence. With regard to things like DIY or maintenance for the building, we don’t have anyone to do that. So we either do it ourselves, or we save up bigger jobs for someone to come in and do, because we just couldn’t afford somebody to be on hand regularly as a member of staff. A survey has further found that one in six schools in England can no longer afford to employ a caretaker.",Canary,2025-01-09T19:44:26+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/schools-funding/
How Brexit and Immigration Changes Are Creating a Skills Gap in the UK,"The UK faces increasing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled professionals, exacerbated by shifts in, and far-right rhetoric around, immigration policy and the impact of Brexit. These factors have shaped the dynamics of inbound migration, contributing to growing concerns about skills shortages across industries. Understanding the role of immigration policies, the effect of Brexit, and the resulting skills gap is essential for addressing this issue. The UK’s departure from the EU has significantly altered migration patterns, particularly for skilled workers from the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Under the new immigration framework, European nationals are subject to the same visa requirements as non-European nationals, which has reduced the ease of movement for workers who previously filled vital roles in the UK. Before Brexit, the healthcare sector heavily relied on EU nationals, who made up a large proportion of its workforce. According to the NHS, recruitment from the EU has slowed dramatically since the end of free movement, compounding pre-existing staffing shortages. The Skilled Worker Visa has partially mitigated this by enabling those in recognised healthcare roles to apply for a Health and Care Worker visa, which enables those eligible to pay reduced visa fees and benefit from reduced minimum salary thresholds. Nonetheless, administrative hurdles such as the need to secure sponsorship, combined with the UK’s departure from the EU, have deterred many professionals from applying. The construction and engineering industries have also been impacted. EU workers were a key source of labour, particularly for roles requiring mid-level skills that often do not meet the minimum salary thresholds required under the current Immigration Rules. Many UK organisations also relied on short-term labour from the EU, with specialist workers travelling to the UK to undertake short work assignments. UK employers are now struggling to fill vacancies, which in turn is delaying projects and increasing recruitment costs. Sectors such as hospitality and agriculture, which rely on seasonal and lower-wage workers, have been particularly affected. Despite the introduction of short-term visas for some agricultural roles, businesses have reported difficulties accessing sufficient labour to meet demand.. The current immigration system recognises that high-skilled workers can be sponsored, but it imposes strict requirements that limit access to the international workforce. The general salary threshold of £38,700 and skill level requirements exclude many mid-level roles. Employers also face high costs, including visa application fees, the Immigration Skills Charge, and the Immigration Health Surcharge, which collectively increase the financial burden of hiring international workers. The end of free movement has reduced the pool of available workers from the EU, particularly in industries where EU nationals previously accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce. For example, the hospitality and construction sectors have seen a notable decline in applications from EU citizens, leading to unfilled vacancies. Brexit-related uncertainty has made the UK less attractive to international professionals, with many professionals wanting to secure EU citizenship – along with the benefits this brings – as opposed to British citizenship. The Government’s clear focus on reducing immigration also makes the UK less attractive to those considering emigrating to another country for work. Skills shortages hinder productivity, delay projects, and increase operational costs for businesses. The construction and engineering sectors, which are essential for infrastructure development, face growing difficulties meeting demand. Similarly, reduced staffing in healthcare and hospitality has affected service delivery and customer satisfaction. Employers report greater difficulty in filling vacancies, particularly for mid-level and seasonal roles. This has increased reliance on domestic workers, where available, and has driven up costs for recruitment and training. Businesses are also exploring automation and outsourcing as potential solutions, but these options are not always viable. The UK’s ability to position itself as a global leader in technology, research, and innovation is at risk. Skilled professionals are critical for advancing key industries, and difficulties in attracting international talent could stifle growth in emerging fields such as renewable energy and artificial intelligence. Streamlining visa processes and reducing associated costs could help attract skilled workers from abroad. Expanding the Immigration Salary List (previously known as the Shortage Occupation List) to include more roles and lowering salary thresholds for specific industries could also ease immediate pressures. Targeted visa schemes for mid-level roles, such as those in hospitality and agriculture, could address gaps in these sectors. Investing in domestic talent is essential for long-term resilience. Enhanced apprenticeships, vocational training, and partnerships between industries and educational institutions can equip UK workers with the skills needed to fill critical roles. Since winning the General Election, Labour has confirmed its plan to upskill the domestic workforce in order to reduce immigration, and Sir Keir Starmer has recently confirmed that those who sponsor skilled workers will be expected to train people from the local labour market. To address the decline in EU migration, the UK could introduce specific incentives for EU nationals, such as reduced visa fees or streamlined pathways to residency. Recognising professional qualifications from EU countries could also simplify the process of hiring EU-based talent. Earlier this year, the UK Government was involved in discussions enabling the free movement of young people aged between 18 and 30 between the UK and EU (also known as the Youth Mobility Scheme), but thus far, the Government has rejected the possibility of extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to include EU nationals. Creating a more appealing environment for skilled professionals by enhancing working conditions and offering flexible arrangements could reduce the desire to leave the UK. In this regard, the Government has published the Employment Rights Bill, aimed at upgrading the rights of workers to improve work conditions. Policies aimed at improving quality of life, such as affordable housing and access to public services, may also help retain talent. Brexit has undeniably reshaped the UK’s workforce, creating new challenges for industries reliant on skilled professionals. While government initiatives such as the Skilled Worker visa and Global Business Mobility visa routes offer partial solutions, more comprehensive measures are required to address the root causes of skills shortages. A balanced approach that combines targeted immigration reforms, domestic workforce investment, and quality-of-life improvements will be necessary to ensure the UK remains competitive in attracting and retaining talent. Collaboration between government, businesses, and educational institutions will be key to developing sustainable strategies for mitigating the impact of these changes.

ANOTHER Just Stop Oil supporter is preposterously sentenced by a judge,"A Just Stop Oil supporter who climbed an M25 gantry after an unprecedented 40c heatwave in the UK was found guilty by a jury in Chichester on Thursday 9 January. Abigail Percy Ratcliff took action in July 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Abigail, 25, a student from London, was among five supporters who blocked the M25 in three places by climbing on the overhead signs after Just Stop Oil declared the M25 a site of civil resistance on 20 July 2022. The action was prompted by news that UK temperatures had recently topped 40c for the first time ever, causing multiple fires to break out and resulting in the busiest day for the London Fire Brigade since the WWII. Before taking action in 2022 Abigail said: The UK crossed the 40 degree threshold yesterday, runways melted, wildfires raged and hundreds died. This is not the new normal, it will keep getting worse until we just stop oil. We must act now. I joined Just Stop Oil because I was worried about my future, about my sister’s future, but I think a lot of us have realised this week that we’re not talking about the future, we’re talking about now, it’s happening today. Abigail was found guilty of public nuisance, and given an eight month suspended sentence plus £1,500 in costs. She was previously remanded to prison in November 2022 for three and a half months. Her sentence comes just days after Just Stop Oil supporter Dr Patrick Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. The judge sentenced him to a year in prison. Speaking prior to the trial Abigail said: This protest I’m on trial for was back in 2022, during a heatwave that broke temperature records and killed thousands of people in the UK. And the government at the time was planning to approve 100 new licenses for oil exploration in the North Sea, in light of the evidence of the harm it would cause. The most vulnerable among us were killed that summer and the UK government went ahead and approved those licenses anyway, flagrantly denying the evidence that the climate disaster was already a threat to this nation. It was under those circumstances that I took action. Democracy has failed to protect us. Both the labour and Tory parties are neglecting to take serious action on the climate. We have now passed 1.5 degrees warming over pre-industrial levels. There is absolutely no time for talking about whether it’s okay to block a road. It’s not okay to sell future generations’ futures off for a profit, and that’s exactly what these fossil fuel companies are doing. It’s exactly what our government is allowing them to do. Peaceful protesters are filling our prisons while the real criminals sit in power handing down a death sentence to future generations. We mustn’t go without a fight. Another of those taking action on 20 July 2022 was Louise Lancaster. She was prosecuted in October 2022 for contempt of court for breaking the M25 protest injunction, but received a suspended sentence. Three others who took action on the same day were also given suspended sentences after being found guilty of public nuisance in May 2024. However, that was before ‘Lord’ Walney called for Just Stop Oil to be treated like a terrorist organisation and the courts started dishing out multi-year prison sentences for nonviolent action. These disproportionate sentences are being challenged at the court of appeal at the end of this month. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

#WeWillMarch: campaign groups push back against Met Police over Palestine demo,"A new year has begun, yet Israel’s atrocities in Palestine persist. In Gaza, the situation is more dire than ever. Health workers are stretched to breaking point, particularly in northern Gaza, where not a single hospital remains functional. Their resilience in the face of unimaginable suffering is nothing short of heroic, but they cannot do it alone. On Monday 7 January, health workers and supporters gathered outside parliament to demand urgent action. Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd calling for IDF troops to withdraw from Gaza and the West Bank, as well as from southern Lebanon and Syria; and for the British government to stop supplying arms to Israel. On Saturday 18 January, we will unite and once again call for an end to the genocide, despite attempts by the police to curb our right to protest. Join us in Central London for the next National Demonstration for Palestine, just days before the inauguration of Donald Trump in the US. Date: Saturday 18 January
Time: Assemble 12pm (midday)
Location: BBC, Portland Place, W1A If you haven’t yet, please email your MP using a letter written by health workers who have been on the ground in Gaza. Their first-hand accounts highlight the devastating impact of the ongoing violence and call for immediate action. It takes just two minutes – click here to take action. Yesterday, the Met Police stated its intention to prevent the protest from going ahead, reneging on the previous agreement with the organisers made months ago. The coalition leading the marches put out this statement to confirm that we will march in solidarity with the Palestinian people, as planned. Coaches from towns and cities across the country are being organised for the Palestine march. Please help make this march as large as possible by sharing it on social media and encouraging friends, colleagues and neighbours to join too. We must show the people of Palestine that they are not alone and together, make 2025 a year of justice for Palestine. As Jeremy Corbyn reminded us on Monday, “we will stand forever with the people of Palestine until they have justice, peace and freedom”.",Canary,2025-01-09T12:45:25+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/palestine-march-18-january/
"Labour 'no better' than the Tories on dodgy political donations, polling finds","Capping political donations could help to reset the government’s reputation, campaigners claim, as a poll shows two-thirds of the public regard the ethical standards of the Labour Party government as worse or no different than those of its predecessor. The survey, commissioned by pressure group Unlock Democracy, found that by more than four to one, the public favours limiting the amount of money individuals can donate to political parties or politicians, with support for such a move consistent across voters for all major parties. The most recent quarterly data from the Electoral Commission reveals Labour accepted over £2 million in donations of £15,000 or more between July and September of 2024, including £171,000 from the former boss of Autoglass, Gary Lubner. Tom Brake, director of Unlock Democracy, said: The public is fed up with the corrosive influence of big money in politics.3 Labour will find it hard to convince voters it is serious about governing in service of working people while it continues to accept large donations from wealthy individuals and corporations. There is an opportunity here for the government to show clearly that it is different from its predecessor. At the moment, if the public perceives a difference, it’s not in a good way. Two-thirds of survey respondents – including more than four in 10 Labour voters – said this government is worse (34%) or no better (31%) than the last government when it comes to behaving ethically, compared to only a quarter (25%) who think it’s behaving better. Just as troublingly for a government elected on a promise to restore “the highest standards of integrity and honesty” to public life, one in two Labour voters see no improvement with this government in delivering on its promises. Overall, nearly half of all respondents felt Labour was worse in this regard (46%), compared to only one in five (19%) who thought it was doing better. Brake continued: Labour must address these perceptions head-on. More people think the scandals and dysfunction in politics are the fault of the broader system than believe it is only individuals to blame. Half-measures, such as the government’s tweaks to rules around second jobs and enhanced ministerial code, won’t cut it. Bold reform is what’s needed. The government must deliver on its commitments by championing reforms that ensure those with the deepest pockets cannot wield outsized, unaccountable influence. The government has this week reaffirmed its manifesto commitment to strengthening donation rules. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner told MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee that the government was considering changes to ensure “transparency in the process of where donations come from”. This follows MHCLG spokesperson, Lord Khan of Burnley, stating in the House of Lords last December: The government has committed to reforming political finance rules. We are considering changes that will help protect our system from foreign interference, such as tighter controls on donations. A cap on political donations forms part of a suite of measures aimed at protecting UK democracy from big money and foreign interference set out in Unlock Democracy’s Democratic Integrity White Paper, a summary of which is available here.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:49:18+00:00,News,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/news/2025/01/09/labour-political-donations/
"DWP complaints up 38%, with Universal Credit causing chaos for countless families","The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has seen a 38% increase in just three years in the number of claimants making official complaints against it. Moreover, the head of the independent body responsible for dealing with claimant complaints has slammed the DWP for ” simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should”. It comes amid a startling 83% increase in the number of complaints accepted by the independent body, too. Perhaps the best summing up of the situation is to be found in one DWP complaint, where it told a dying claimant that they owed it £89,000 – when they didn’t actually owe anything at all. The Independent Case Examiner’s (ICE) 2023-2024 annual report offers insight into the complaint-handling process within the DWP. It outlines recurring patterns of administrative errors, delays, and the inadequate treatment of vulnerable claimants. All this suggests that DWP has not fully embraced the principles of accountability and effective service delivery. The ICE office serves as a mediator between the public and the DWP, tasked with investigating complaints of maladministration. For the reporting year, the ICE office experienced a 38% increase in complaints compared to the past three years, highlighting a growing dissatisfaction among claimants. Among the complaints accepted for examination, nearly 50% were fully or partially upheld, a figure indicative of consistent service failures. The report asserts a commitment to fostering improvements within the DWP. However, the patterns observed – such as poor communication, lack of prompt action, and insufficient redress – raise questions about DWP’s ability to enact meaningful change based on ICE recommendations. The ICE report documents various categories of complaints, such as Universal Credit, disability benefits, debt management, and child maintenance, among others. Universal Credit remained the most complained-about benefit, reflecting its complexity and the impact of policy decisions such as mandatory recovery of overpayments caused by administrative errors. It also had one of the highest rates of complaints being upheld. However, Universal Credit was also subject to one of the most shocking complaints about the DWP. In May 2021, Customers A and B made a joint Universal Credit claim but received no payments as their income exceeded the entitlement threshold. B declared a serious health condition and later claimed New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). In early 2022, A reported that the couple would soon receive capital exceeding £16,000, which temporarily affected their Universal Credit claim, requiring a DWP decision on whether the claim should close or the capital disregarded. The DWP took three months to decide, initially miscalculating capital and incorrectly applying nearly £89,000 from the start of the claim. Although the error was corrected the same day, delays led to a £300 Universal Credit overpayment, which was referred for recovery without notifying A. The claim was eventually closed mid-2022, and Debt Management later contacted A and B to recover the overpayment. A challenged the overpayment, citing distress due to B’s terminal condition. DWP’s subsequent errors included sending a letter erroneously claiming a debt of £89,000. After further review, DWP acknowledged the mistake and revised the debt to nil. However, their errors caused significant distress during B’s final days. The DWP offered just £200 in compensation – despite A saying that the DWP’s actions had hastened B’s death. Universal Credit’s framework’s rigidity and lack of proportionality in overpayment recovery indicate structural deficiencies. Vulnerable claimants, unaware of overpayments, are disproportionately penalized, undermining the principles of fairness and trust. The transition from Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and related issues in communication exacerbated hardships for claimants. For example, a parent contested DWP’s abrupt change in the appointee for their child’s DLA without notification. Despite prolonged distress and inconvenience, DWP delayed in resolving the issue, later reinstating the rightful appointee and arrears under ICE’s direction. Procedural lapses in notifying stakeholders and delayed responses expose a failure in safeguarding the interests of dependent and vulnerable groups, violating procedural justice. Debt management, a critical area of claimant dissatisfaction, highlighted inconsistencies in application processing and lack of proactive communication. For example, a claimant requesting Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI) faced months of delays due to repeated administrative missteps. Despite escalating financial hardship, the DWP failed to address urgent needs until ICE’s intervention. The neglect of claimants’ immediate financial crises underscores systemic inefficiencies. Such failures question the robustness of the DWP’s operational oversight. The ICE report identifies systemic weaknesses within the DWP: The report commends the DWP’s incremental changes, such as revised guidance for vulnerable claimants and improved debt management procedures. However, the critical lens reveals these measures as reactive rather than preventative. ICE’s Service Improvement Observations (SIOs) repeatedly cite issues stemming from outdated policies or failure to act on past recommendations. Head of ICE Joanna Wallace said of the DWP: Given that there is some delay between the events a customer is complaining about, and my office seeing a complaint, it can be frustrating to still see complaints about things I know DWP have addressed. She particularly noted that Universal Credit was an issue, saying: Overpayments to students would be one example from this last year – I raised this concern and the action DWP had taken to stop repetition in my previous annual report, but these customers with these concerns have continued to come to my office and some of these cases have been amongst the most concerning I’ve seen. In no small part this is because Universal Credit procedures require all overpayments to be recovered, regardless of their cause. This can mean that a customer can do absolutely everything they should have done in terms of telling DWP about their circumstances, but due to administrative error be overpaid. And overall, Wallace said: I agreed with a customer’s view that they had not received the service they should, and that DWP hadn’t recognised that fully, in about half the cases I saw during this last year. Most often, as I’ve commented before, this is due to the department simply not doing what its own processes and procedures say they should. The 2023-2024 ICE report underscores persistent challenges in DWP’s complaint-handling mechanisms – but also its overall conduct. While incremental improvements are evident, the prevalence of service failures, particularly affecting vulnerable groups, demonstrates an urgent need for systemic reforms. Claimants’ case studies expose a troubling pattern of indifference and inefficiency, further showing that the department is barely fit for purpose.",Canary,2025-01-09T11:08:22+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/dwp-complaints-report/
It's obvious why Keir Starmer brushed off a question on toxic political donations at PMQs,"At Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 8 January, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey questioned the prime minister on party donations: While the honourable member for Clacton may miss out on his big allowance from Elon Musk, the spectre of the richest man in the world trying to buy a British political party should give us all pause for thought. And after years of the Conservatives taking millions of pounds of Russian money, will the prime minister now work with us to bring in long overdue reforms of party funding. So that power in this country lies with the voters and not wealthy overseas oligarchs. Musk is reportedly considering a donation of up to $100m to Reform, although he has now called for its leader Nigel Farage to resign over a disagreement about far-right fascist Tommy Robinson. The thing is, at PMQs Keir Starmer shrugged off the pressing issue of rich people buying our politics, saying: I think we all had a smile… when the honourable member said how cool it was to have the support of Musk, only for Musk to say he should be removed just a few hours later… Of course we’re looking at the question of funding more generally. It’s no wonder Starmer is so blasé about the corrupting impact of large political donations in politics. Since he became leader in April 2020, the Labour Party has accepted a total of 61 donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. That includes 11 donations of one million pounds or more from an individual or corporation. In turn, those 11 donations total a whopping £23.6m from just a handful of people. And the corrupting influence can be seen through the £4m from Quadrature Capital. This a tax haven-based hedge fund with investments in weapons, fossil fuels and private healthcare. Indeed, Labour has even appointed Rachel Kyte as its climate envoy. She also sits on the advisory board of Quadrature Charitable Foundation. By contrast, throughout Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership from 2015-2019 the party only received a total of five donations above £100,000 from individuals or corporations. Instead, donations from those other than trade unions tended to be small amounts from various members of the electorate and funds driven from a mass increase in party membership. Too bad much of the British electorate slept on the opportunity of making Corbyn prime minister. And the situation is worse than super rich individuals and corporations buying influence through donations. Recent research from Transparency International has found that one in every ten pounds donated to UK parties comes from outright dubious sources. That includes where corruption, cash for access, fraud or money laundering has been specifically alleged or proven. The organisation recommends capping donations from individuals and corporations at £10,000 per year. Such a change would be most welcome. It would be a huge step towards de-toxifying UK politics.",Canary,2025-01-08T19:47:06+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/pmqs-8-january/
Corbyn pushes government on RAF base's role in Israel's genocide in Gaza,"On 8 January 2025, independent MP Jeremy Corbyn pushed Keir Starmer’s government for transparency on the role that a strategically important RAF base is playing in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. The previous day, Corbyn described in his letter that foreign office parliamentary under-secretary Hamish Falconer had responded to a question of his “during an Urgent Question on Northern Gaza”. And the former Labour Party leader said Falconer had “failed to answer or acknowledge my question on the use of the British air base in Cyprus, RAF Akrotiri”. He insisted that: My constituents deserve to know the full scale of this government’s complicity and participation in genocide. With this in mind, Corbyn asked for clarification on three important follow-up questions: 3. Is RAF Akrotiri being used as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be deployed in Gaza? 4. How many US Air Force flights have flown from RAF Akrotiri to Israel since 7 October 2023? 5. Has your government sought legal advice over the continued use of RAF Akrotiri to support Israeli military operations? And he warned the government to be careful with its actions for legal reasons: Your government will be aware that the ICC has issued arrest warrants to Israeli officials. The government should also be aware that if it knowingly sends weapons to a government whose leader is wanted for war crimes, then it is not immune to the long arm of international law. He was referring to the International Criminal Court (ICC) finally issuing arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel‘s former defence minister Yoav Gallant back in November 2024. Both the current Labour government and the previous Conservative government have used RAF Akrotiri (the unique colonial relic on occupied Cypriot land which is part of the “largest Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom”) to lend a helping hand to Israeli war criminals. So far, RAF Akrotiri has supported covert US flights to occupied Palestine, sent dozens of British warplanes to both Israel and Lebanon, and facilitated British spy flights and the passing of intelligence from officers on the ground to Israel. And as Declassified co-founder Matt Kennard has insisted, these are the actions of “a country which is participating” in Israel’s genocide – “a direct participant”. Corbyn’s original question, that Falconer failed to answer properly, was: Will Britain continue supplying weapons, including parts for jet planes, and allowing the use of RAF Akrotiri as a route for weapons to go to Israel to be used to destroy life in Gaza? And that’s a question that everyone in the country should be asking their MPs regularly and repeatedly until British participation in the genocide ends.",Canary,2025-01-09T10:10:29+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/09/corbyn-raf-akrotiri/
Met Police just BLOCKED a pro-Palestine protest from marching outside the BBC,"Today (Wednesday 8 January) the Palestine Coalition have been informed by the Met Police that they intend to go back on a previous agreement and impose conditions to prevent us marching from BBC HQ at Portland Place on Saturday 18 January. We have already announced our intention to assemble outside the BBC to protest against the pro-Israel bias of its coverage – something recently highlighted in a detailed report by journalist Owen Jones to which the Corporation has so far not responded. We utterly condemn this attempt to use repressive powers to prevent our planned protest at the BBC. The route for the march was confirmed with the police nearly two months ago and, as agreed with them, was publicly announced on 30 November. This route, beginning at the BBC, has only been used twice in the last 15 months of demonstrations and not since February 2024. With just over a week to go, the Metropolitan Police has now reneged on our agreement and stated its intention to prevent our protest from going ahead as planned. The BBC is a major institution – it is a publicly-funded state broadcaster and is rightly accountable to the public. It is unacceptable for the police to misuse public order powers to shield the BBC from democratic scrutiny. The excuse offered by the police is that our march could cause disruption to a nearby synagogue. It follows representations from pro-Israel groups and activists who have been publicly calling for action to be taken to curtail our right to protest against Israel’s ongoing genocide. This includes the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis who has openly celebrated the horrific and criminal actions of the Israeli military in Gaza, describing them as the “most outstanding possible thing that a decent responsible country can do”. In fact, the closest synagogue to the BBC is not even on the route of the march. Moreover, as the Met Police have acknowledged, there has not been a single incident of any threat to a synagogue attached to any of the marches. Any suggestion that our marches are somehow hostile to Jewish people ignores the fact that every march has been joined by thousands of Jewish people – many in an organised Jewish bloc – and addressed by Jewish speakers on the demonstration platforms. Representatives of the Jewish bloc have written to the police seeking a meeting to express their concerns that the police are choosing to listen solely to pro-Israel Jewish voices, but they have not had any response. We firmly reject any attempt to suppress our right to campaign for an end to Israel’s genocidal violence and decades long violations of the rights of the Palestinian people. In the past few weeks, Israel has intensified its indiscriminate attacks including against hospitals and civilians sheltering in so-called ‘humanitarian safe zones.’ It is this and the ongoing complicity of the British government in these crimes that continues to bring people onto the streets in huge numbers. Our marches represent a diverse cross section of the public including the Palestinian community, many of whom are relatives of those killed by Israel. We remain in dialogue with the Metropolitan Police but call on them to immediately abandon their intention to prevent our protest at the BBC.  We call on all those who are rightly outraged by Israel’s ongoing genocide and those who uphold the democratic right to protest to join us when we march in London on Saturday 18 January.

Does Britain execute children abroad? Damning new evidence suggests it does.,"The ongoing controversy over RAF Akrotiri‘s participation in Israel’s genocide in Gaza is not the only scandal relating to British armed forces. Because the Afghanistan Inquiry into possible UK Special Forces (UKSF) war crimes has just revealed that SAS officers had a “golden pass allowing them to get away with murder” from 2010 to 2013. This is according to a former senior Special Boat Service (SBS) officer who, along with others, had raised concerns in 2011 about SAS executions and cover-ups. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick faced criticism in 2024 for “casually revealing a UK extra-judicial assassination program designed to evade ECHR jurisdiction”. And there were many official denials. But the revelations from the Afghanistan Inquiry suggest that this type of behaviour may indeed be commonplace. The inquiry’s closed hearings do not allow attendance by members of the public, the media, or the legal teams of bereaved families. As the BBC reports: Senior SBS officers told the inquiry of deep concerns that the SAS, fresh from aggressive, high-tempo operations in Iraq, was being driven by kill counts – the number of dead they could achieve in each operation. A junior officer of the SBS, meanwhile, reported how an SAS member had spoken “about a pillow being put over the head of someone before they were killed with a pistol”. They added that “some of those killed by the SAS had been children” likely younger than 16. In an email, another SBS officer showed concern about what might happen if they didn’t speak out: When the next WikiLeaks occurs then we will be dragged down with them One said that “basically, there appears to be a culture there of ‘shut up, don’t question'”. The low level of accountability for the SAS was apparently “astonishing”. British support for and participation in Israel’s genocide in Gaza has been utterly damning. But the UK seems not to reserve impunity only for its allies’ crimes. Instead, it seems to be how things work with our own forces too.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:53:10+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/sas-murder/
Raffi Berg just 'the tip of the iceberg' when it comes to BBC pro-Israel bias,"Raffi Berg, the online editor for BBC News coverage on the Middle East, has been at the centre of a massive controversy in recent weeks. But a new petition from former Channel 4 editor Tamara Abood insists that “Raffi is the tip of the iceberg”. And she calls for the sacking of people even higher up than Berg over the BBC‘s shameful (and longstanding) pro-Israel bias, specifically during the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Public attention focused in on Berg after journalist Owen Jones published an investigation in December about pro-Israel bias at the BBC. Having interviewed journalists and other staff at the public service broadcaster, Jones revealed that “senior figures” had been skewing coverage to be more favourable to Israel while dismissing regular objections from employees who demanded the corporation uphold its supposed commitment to providing fair and impartial reporting. And in particular, Jones highlighted the malign role that Berg played. According to one former BBC journalist: This guy’s entire job is to water down everything that’s too critical of Israel. Others said he “micromanages” coverage, with one insisting that he “has the power to reframe every story”. Even worse are his connections to the CIA, Mossad, and war criminal Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As Jewish Voice for Peace explains: Zionism is a form of Jewish nationalism, and is the primary ideology that drove the establishment of Israel. It adds that: While it had many strains historically, the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state where Jews have more rights than others. The pro-Israel (or Zionist) lobby in Britain has a massive influence. In the last parliament, it donated money to a quarter of British MPs, and reportedly had significant sway in the government. Half of the initial cabinet of the current Labour government, meanwhile, had received such funds. Abood argues that the same is true in the British media sector. As she said in the petition text: I have first hand experience of the extraordinary and malign influence that Zionist lobby groups exert over programme makers and broadcasters. I have spent the last 15 months watching in disgust as mainstream broadcasters in the UK have framed what is happening in Gaza through the lens of Israeli propagandists. But Berg is just a part of this, she stressed: Raffi is the tip of the iceberg. Scratch the surface of the BBC and you will find it packed to the rafters with Zionists who will quash ideas for programmes that are critical of Israel and who will frame the reporting on Gaza to centre Israeli interests. Abood also insisted: It is my belief as a former lawyer and tv producer that, in time, our mainstream media will be judged to have been complicit in a genocide by providing cover for Israel’s crimes. In fact, as I write, lawyers who specialise in international law and human rights have many of these so-called “journalists” in their sights. And she argued that: BBC license payers are being deliberately mislead about the nature and extent of Israel’s depravity in Gaza. The BBC is breaching its own requirements, and that of Ofcom, for due impartiality. As a license payer, you should be able to trust the BBC as a credible news source. The BBC is no longer credible. It has shown itself to be an outpost of the Israeli Ministry of Misinformation. Overall, her comments were damning. She said “the BBC subverts the truth in order to influence the public’s response in favour of Israel”, and that there has been “a deliberate strategy of lies and omissions by broadcasters like the BBC“. Rather than focusing on Raffi Berg, though, she looks to BBC News CEO Deborah Turness. As she emphasised: Your license fee pays her £400K + salary. Deborah Turness must go For her, licence-fee payers deserve so much better. And we completely agree. That’s why we should all support the petition and demand change.",Canary,2025-01-08T16:19:09+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/08/raffi-berg-bbc/
A family GP has been JAILED for attacking... PETROL PUMPS with Just Stop Oil,"A family doctor has been sentenced to one year in prison for taking action with climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil. Dr Patrick Hart took action in August 2022 to demand an end to new licences and consents for oil and gas projects in the UK, something which has subsequently become government policy. Hart appeared before Judge Mills at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday 7 January after being found guilty in October 2024 of Criminal Damage. He had been disabling petrol pumps at Esso Thurrock Services on the M25 on 24 August 2022. Esso is a subsidiary of the Oil giant Exxon Mobil which infamously concealed the alarming findings of its own scientists, which showed that fossil fuels caused global warming. Exxon subsequently ploughed millions into a disinformation campaign which initially sewed doubt and later confusion around the emerging climate science. In his closing statement at Chelmsford Crown Court during his trial, Hart said: I disrupted people as an act of care. I damaged the petrol pump screens as an act of care, because in times of great peril, a caring person has to stand up for what is right. My actions have already cost me greatly. I have been handed a suspended prison sentence, and thousands of pounds in costs through a civil injunction for this exact same action. I have been penalised at work and stand to be suspended or lose my licence to practise as a doctor. But I regret nothing. Because to not do it, would have been to give up on caring, and that would be worse. In the face of the permanent collapse of our climate, our economy, our society and life on Earth, the only thing that keeps me going is our continued capacity as people to care, regardless of what happens. Yes, I fear prison, but I am ready to go if I must Hart has already faced civil charges for this action and been fined, as the Thurrock Esso petrol station is subject to a private injunction. He will also face a tribunal after being referred for a disciplinary hearing by his professional regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC). In the last 12 months, the GMC has suspended two doctors from the medical register following their convictions for non-violent climate protest. As such Hart stands to be penalised three times for the same action. Before sentencing, Hart said: Right now, the greatest health threat to all of us is the unfolding climate catastrophe. It is the greatest health threat we have ever faced. All healthcare workers have a responsibility to protect the health of their patients. If we do not stand up to the oil and gas executives who are wreaking havoc on our climate and the politicians who enable them, if we do not end the burning of fossil fuels, then we will have failed as a profession and the health systems that we have developed over centuries will collapse. I will continue to fight against the death sentence of fossil fuels for as long as I have strength in me. I have no greater duty as a doctor at this moment in history. Today’s sentencing comes after a jury found three Just Stop Oil supporters ‘not guilty’ in June of 2024 for disabling petrol pumps in the same manner as Hart. Just Stop Oil will be stepping into action again in 2025.

"""Sex for shifts"": capitalist criminals McDonald's at the centre of another workers rights scandal","McDonald’s is confronting renewed allegations of severe abuses of workers rights, with over 100 current and former employees reporting experiences of sexual assault, harassment, racism, homophobia, and bullying. These claims have prompted the UK parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee to summon McDonald’s UK chief executive, Alistair Macrow, for questioning. Meanwhile, the the TUC has hit back at what it calls the corporate giant’s ‘race to the bottom’. The BBC conducted an investigation revealing that employees, some as young as 17, faced inappropriate behavior from colleagues and managers. Reported incidents include sexual assault, sexually explicit remarks, homophobia, and a lack of effective response from management when complaints were raised. One former employee recounted being sexually assaulted by a senior manager, while another described a culture where such behavior was normalised. As the BBC reported, workers’ claims against McDonald’s include: A worker quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023, after she says managers inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she says she was told to “suck it up”. A 16-year-old current employee based in the West Midlands says he was bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers. A female worker, 20, says a male manager sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald’s branch in the East of England in August. Specifically, the BBC noted the case of Claire (not her real name). She told it that: A shift manager asked her for sex in return for extra shifts, which she refused. She was 17, he was in his 30s. “You don’t expect that to happen,” she said. “It was totally inappropriate.” Of course, McDonald’s is notorious for zero-hours contracts. Across its businesses, including franchises, 89% of staff are on these contracts. The BBC noted that: McDonald’s says workers can choose to switch to minimum guaranteed hours. But we have spoken to 50 workers across the country who say they were not given that choice. In response to these allegations, McDonald’s stated that it does not tolerate harassment, abuse, or discrimination and is committed to ensuring a safe and respectful workplace. The company highlighted its implementation of new policies and training programs aimed at preventing such behavior. However, the persistence of these issues suggests that existing measures may be insufficient. This is not the first time McDonald’s has faced scrutiny over workplace practices. In 2021, the company introduced anti-harassment training following at least 50 employee-filed charges concerning workplace harassment over five years. The Environmental Audit Committee’s involvement underscores the seriousness of the situation. The committee is expected to examine McDonald’s corporate governance and the effectiveness of its policies in safeguarding employee welfare. This inquiry forms part of a broader evaluation of labor practices within large corporations operating in the UK. The outcome of this inquiry could have significant implications for McDonald’s operations and reputation in the UK. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said: No-one should ever find themselves in the position of being asked to exchange sex for shifts. It’s abhorrent – the McDonalds CEO has serious questions to answer. This investigation has exposed how sexual harassment and insecure work can go hand in hand. Zero-hours contracts create a huge imbalance of power in the workplace that leaves workers vulnerable to predatory bosses. If staff say no to their manager they face losing all of their work. This is why cracking down on exploitative working practices like zero-hours contracts and giving people stronger protections at work is so important. McDonald’s is one of the largest employers in the UK. It should be setting the standard on workforce conditions – not leading a race to the bottom. The problem is – McDonald’s is the epitome of the corporate capitalist race to the bottom. It’s a business where the planet, biodiversity, human rights, and the rights of its workers are all far-less important than its profit margins. The fact that the BBC has uncovered yet another scandal is not a surprise. It is parasitic McDonald’s operating as it is supposed to.",Canary,2025-01-07T11:30:55+00:00,Analysis,Polarised,https://www.thecanary.co/uk/analysis/2025/01/07/mcdonalds-staff-abuse/
