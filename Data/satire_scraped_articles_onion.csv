Biden Addresses Nation While Hanging From Branch On Side Of Cliff,"WASHINGTON—Using his platform to plead for Americans to lend him a hand, President Joe Biden addressed the nation Monday while hanging from a branch on the side of a cliff. “Our democracy has never before hung in the balance more than it has at this moment when I am in danger of plummeting 50 feet to those sharp rocks below,” said Biden, who implored the U.S. populace to set aside its differences and find a long stick, a rope, or, preferably, a helicopter that they could use to return him to stable ground. “What’s important is not what led us to this point, but rather how we choose to move forward in helping me back up. Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.” At press time, a Gallup Poll had found that 70% of Americans opposed Biden being rescued.",The Onion,2024-01-01T11:45:00+00:00,Politics,Satire,https://theonion.com/biden-addresses-nation-while-hanging-from-branch-on-sid-1851106795/
Marriage Counselor Sides With Hotter Spouse,"ANCHORAGE, AK—Stating that she had heard both perspectives and could understand their frustrations, marriage counselor Laurie Hartford reportedly told couple David and Julia Carter that she ultimately had to side with the hotter spouse. “So, I’ve listened to everything you’ve had to say, and I’ve come to the conclusion that while David does seem to be emotionally withholding, he’s also at least two points hotter,” said the therapist, who rushed to note that, in all fairness, she needed to take into consideration that she would at best describe the female half of the relationship “as, like, a six even on her best day.” “I’ve spent hours listening to you pour out your hearts and that’s never easy, so pat yourselves on the back. But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I’m not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I’m saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?” Hartford went on to say that it might be helpful if Julia stayed at home for their next sessions so that they could spend more time understanding where, exactly, David’s hotness came from.",The Onion,2024-01-09T11:30:00+00:00,Local,Satire,https://theonion.com/marriage-counselor-sides-with-hotter-spouse-1851143488/

After that, you can sit back and collect thousands of dollars a month. How cool is that? You and your little friends are going to have so much fun building your little real estate empire.

Our trials with Evanovia, however, show that it now takes just one injection and within 12 hours any obese individual will start rapidly thinning before finally melting out of existence completely.” At press time, critics had warned about a rash of influencers, models, and actresses who were using the drug to vanish despite not being overweight themselves.",The Onion,2024-03-08T19:00:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/ozempic-maker-triumphantly-announces-new-drug-that-make-1851320436/

Well, I suppose I should have learned my lesson when I tried  to speak to that scarecrow in Mozambique.” At press time, Attenborough  was spotted chewing out a flustered assistant director of photography and insisting that he  needed to delete the footage immediately.",The Onion,2024-06-07T10:15:00+00:00,Entertainment,Satire,https://theonion.com/embarrassed-david-attenborough-realizes-he-spent-10-min-1851512951/
Newest U.S. Aid Mission Just Single PowerBar Labeled ‘For Gaza’ Thrown Into Ocean,"WASHINGTON—With more than 2 million displaced Palestinians facing the threat of famine, the U.S. Agency for International Development announced Monday it had fulfilled its pledge to provide food assistance, throwing a single PowerBar labeled “for Gaza” into the Atlantic Ocean. USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction “DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian” underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it. Insiders confirmed that with the right currents and weather patterns, the chocolate-flavored meal replacement should reach Gaza by 2035, only two years after the expiration date.",The Onion,2024-06-17T10:30:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/newest-u-s-aid-mission-just-single-powerbar-labeled-f-1851540802/
Report: Every Place On Earth Has Wrong Amount Of Water,"RESTON, VA—A new global report released Monday by the U.S. Geological Survey  revealed that every place on earth currently has the wrong amount of water. “New satellite data confirms that every corner of the earth has the incorrect quantity of water,” the report read in part, noting that even though the total amount of water on the planet seemed to be about right, give or take a few hundred milliliters, the distribution of that water across the globe was “way off.” “In every case, there is either too much or too little water, with zero exceptions.

NASA Warns Space Hawk Has Swooped In And Picked Up Earth For Nest,"WASHINGTON—Sounding the alarm that a cosmic bird of prey had clamped its talons onto the planet, NASA warned Thursday that a space hawk had swooped in and picked up the Earth for its nest of hungry space chicks. “We are on high alert after our satellite imaging confirmed that a quite sizable space hawk has in fact descended on Earth and carried it off with the intention of feeding our planet to its interstellar hatchlings,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson, who explained that the space hawk had used its keen extrasolar vision to pinpoint Earth’s blue seas from hundreds of light-years away, allowing the cosmic raptor to pluck our rocky planet right from its orbit. “Given the evidence we’ve obtained from observing distant exoplanets, the space hawk will first tear apart  the Earth and give bite-sized pieces of our home world to its young.

Clarence Thomas Torn Over Case Where Both Sides Offer Compelling Scuba Trips,"WASHINGTON—Admitting that he had never been more conflicted about a ruling in his life, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was reportedly torn Monday over a case in which both sides offered compelling scuba trips. “While there’s a strong historical precedent for a lavish excursion to Bali, the plaintiff has instead taken a more unorthodox approach and presented an all-expenses-paid diving trip off the shores of Aruba,” said a thoughtful, inquisitive Thomas, adding that while he had supported taking vacations with donors to Southeast Asia for years, he was starting to see the appeal of visiting the white sandy shores of the Caribbean. “In their arguments, the defense made a detailed case that perhaps this summer I need three weeks with my family on a luxury yacht in the Pacific, complete with my own scuba instructor and private chef. But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed  he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I’ve always wanted to do that.” At press time, Thomas called for a short recess to give the matter more thought, as whichever choice he made could have dire consequences for decades of his luxury vacations.",The Onion,2024-07-01T11:00:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/clarence-thomas-torn-over-case-where-both-sides-offer-c-1851566812/

She was only 59 yesterday,” the visibly distraught DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after the party’s new presumptive nominee began to ask him who he was and then trailed off, her cloudy eyes glossing over beneath a wisp of stark-white hair and her skin now wrinkled and liver-spotted. “She’s been rambling about all kinds of nonsense, and she keeps calling everyone “buster.” No, Madam Vice President, I’m not your stepson, and I’m not here to take you back to California.

Congress Bans Roofs,"WASHINGTON—In response to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Congress moved quickly to pass legislation Monday that bans the civilian use of roofs. “As our country continues to reel from this horrific event, we in Congress have taken action by enacting a nationwide ban on all roofs, roof terraces, and balconies,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining that the would-be assassin, who shot at and nearly killed Trump from atop a building 430 feet away, highlighted just how lax U.S. laws had been in addressing the threat of widespread roof access. “As we saw on Saturday, the risks of Americans having roofs is far too great to continue allowing our homes, schools, and other buildings to be covered in any way. In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.” Critics of the bill argued that its effectiveness may be limited due to a loophole that would still allow future assassins to fire out of a building’s windows.",The Onion,2024-07-15T22:00:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/congress-bans-roofs-1851592883/

Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.” At press time, Krick-Nelson added that, without an increase in preservation efforts, such teens could also be left without secluded overlooks wherein to sexually experiment in their cars.",The Onion,2024-08-05T10:15:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/environmentalists-warn-u-s-running-out-of-small-wooded-1851609190/

Kelly had already filed a preliminary motion for the exposure of his penis in open court. “It is our belief that the federal judiciary should not infringe upon the defendant’s right to spray his golden shower before the bench.

It’s stressful, though, because a single mistake in the blocking of a scene can put you in the hospital.

Several reports indicated that as Palmer leapt into action to counter the malign text, he mumbled to himself with distaste not unlike a wizened sorcerer from the Far Westlands bellowing, “Begone, ye evil creature!” According to bystanders, the accountant’s fingers then confidently tapped out the four capital letters of the unstoppable reply as if he were using an unimaginably powerful staff to draw out the Elements of the Earth and Netherearth that would allow him to fend off the most ferocious of Darklings. At press time, Palmer was said to have sent off his reply with satisfaction, only to then receive a separate text from Bernie Sanders begging him to help, much like the wise-but-arrogant enchanter feeling the grasp of one of the monster’s tendrils around his ankle just as he turned his back.",The Onion,2024-09-12T12:00:00+00:00,Local,Satire,https://theonion.com/man-replies-stop-to-political-fundraiser-text-like-powerful-wizard-casting-spell-to-ward-off-mythical-beast/

‘The Onion’ Officially Endorses Joe Biden For President,"Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution’s highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country’s long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion‘s editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That’s why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion‘s latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying “it’s too late” and we are “doing more harm than good.” For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we’d hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden’s first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we’d hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden’s highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called “papers of record” are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he’s packed a lot into 81 short years. He’s fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He’s stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board’s courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup.

By 9 months, your wife will definitely be suspicious and demand to see your phone, but that’s when you gaslight her and tell her she’s crazy.” According to sources, Emerson later distributed sacks of flour to all his students to simulate what it’s like to be a father turning his young child against their mother after a divorce.",The Onion,2024-10-02T15:06:11+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/texas-sex-ed-class-teaches-boys-how-to-cheat-on-pregnant-wife/

Piss-Soaked Tucker Carlson Claims Demon Urinated On Him While He Slept,"BRYANT POND, ME—Describing the moment as a “transformative experience” that inspired him to embrace God and read the Bible, a piss-soaked Tucker Carlson claimed Friday that a demon had urinated on him while he was sleeping. “One moment I was asleep in bed, and the next, my boxers were absolutely soaked with what could only be the urine of an evil spirit,” said the former Fox News host, who added that while he did not previously consider himself a religious person, everything changed when he woke up to a rush of hot liquid covering his groin. “Lying there, I felt this terrible pressure in my bladder, almost as if a demon was sitting on it. Then it unleashed a torrent of urine that drenched my pajamas and my mattress, which still bear the scars.” At press time, Carlson claimed that embracing God had successfully helped ward off every evil spirit except for the one that occasionally visits him and covers the inside of his underwear in semen.",The Onion,2024-11-01T17:41:12+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/piss-soaked-tucker-carlson-claims-demon-urinated-on-him-while-he-slept/
Trump Calls Harris To Congratulate Himself On Winning,"PALM BEACH, FL—In a five-minute phone call that both campaigns described as largely cordial, President-elect Donald Trump reportedly called Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday morning to congratulate himself on winning. “Madame Vice President, I want to be the first to congratulate myself on running one heck of a campaign, and to let you know I’m doing everything in my power to ensure the Trump administration has a smooth transition to the White House,” said Trump, telling an entirely silent Harris that it had been the honor of his life to have been in this race with himself, and extending his genuine gratitude for everything he had done to keep the race civil, even at its most heated. “I’ll tell you what, despite everything—I know it’s been a hard-fought race—but I’ve really always secretly admired myself. No, I’m serious here, I really am.

"Man Forgetting Difference Between Meteoroid, Meteorite Struggles To Describe What Just Killed His Dog","TORONTO—Though he tried hard to recall what he had learned about space rocks back in middle school, local man Jason Nieto reportedly forgot the difference between meteoroids and meteorites Thursday, struggling to describe what had just killed his dog. “God, I always forgot which one is the kind that actually hits the ground, if that’s even the difference, so I’m not sure what just crushed Churro,” said Nieto, explaining that the meteorite or meteoroid—or maybe asteroid, if that was a category including all of them—came streaking out of the clouds while he was walking his Pomeranian in the park. “If it hadn’t left a crater where Churro was and had just burned up in the atmosphere, then that’s a meteoroid, right? One of them kills dogs in space in orbit, and the other kills dogs on Earth. I just can’t remember which is which. Oh wait, shit, there’s also just a ‘meteor’ too, isn’t there? What am I supposed to tell the vet when I bring the ashes over?” At press time, reports confirmed a stumped Nieto was frantically searching his phone to see if it mattered that the space rock had exploded when it hit his dog.",The Onion,2024-11-14T13:00:00+00:00,Local,Satire,https://theonion.com/man-forgetting-difference-between-meteoroid-meteorite-struggles-to-describe-what-just-killed-his-dog/
Every Movement In Man’s Burrito-Eating Technique Informed By Past Burrito Tragedies,"GLENDALE, CA—Rotating the tortilla-wrapped meal to consume the Mexican food in even levels, eyewitnesses reported Thursday that every movement in local man Eddy Azarian’s burrito-eating technique has been informed by past burrito tragedies. “You can see how he massages the outside to get an a well-balanced distribution of ingredients as he goes, so you know that’s a man who has lost some carne asada to a floor before,” said friend Mike Fuentes, who noted the concentration on Azarian’s face as he rolled down the foil to form an even and tactile seam out of biting range. “Just look at that grip, perfectly spaced and easy to shift on the fly. And then he rolls it at regular intervals, making sure none of the juices or grease pool in one area and leaks out. You know every memory of rice spilling out or guacamole getting lumped in a corner is running through his head as he works. The way he takes a bite from the center and then works to the exterior so nothing is at risk of spilling. He’s seen too many burrito catastrophes for one lifetime and he doesn’t want to experience one again.” At press time, Azarian was reaching for a napkin after propping up his burrito against a cup of fountain soda he assumed to be full enough.",The Onion,2024-11-21T13:00:00+00:00,Local,Satire,https://theonion.com/every-movement-in-mans-burrito-eating-technique-informed-by-past-burrito-tragedies/
