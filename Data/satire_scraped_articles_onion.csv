Biden Addresses Nation While Hanging From Branch On Side Of Cliff,"WASHINGTON—Using his platform to plead for Americans to lend him a hand, President Joe Biden addressed the nation Monday while hanging from a branch on the side of a cliff. ""Our democracy has never before hung in the balance more than it has at this moment when I am in danger of plummeting 50 feet to those sharp rocks below,"" said Biden, who implored the U.S. populace to set aside its differences and find a long stick, a rope, or, preferably, a helicopter that they could use to return him to stable ground. ""What's important is not what led us to this point, but rather how we choose to move forward in helping me back up. Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do. My fellow Americans, I urge you to act fast, as a small bird has landed on my head and is now pecking at me.""

Marriage Counselor Sides With Hotter Spouse,"ANCHORAGE, AK—Stating that she had heard both perspectives and could understand their frustrations, marriage counselor Laurie Hartford reportedly told couple David and Julia Carter that she ultimately had to side with the hotter spouse. ""So, I've listened to everything you've had to say, and I've come to the conclusion that while David does seem to be emotionally withholding, he's also at least two points hotter,"" said the therapist, who rushed to note that, in all fairness, she needed to take into consideration that she would at best describe the female half of the relationship ""as, like, a six even on her best day."" ""I've spent hours listening to you pour out your hearts and that's never easy, so pat yourselves on the back. But, frankly, only one of you has bothered to comb your hair or put on a nice shirt at these sessions. I'm not in any way trying to invalidate your experiences. All I'm saying is that only one of you—David—has an ass that you could bounce a quarter off, and the other one is kind of an uggo, if that makes sense?""

""The male mallard is a temperate waterfowl, known for its remarkable ability not to blink or even move for minute after minute—wait a second, oh, goddammit, really?"" said the renowned naturalist, who grew visibly flustered as he squinted at the wooden bird, cutting off his own monologue praising the ""incredible display of commitment and near-woodenness"" on the part of the nonliving bird in order to scream with frustration. ""I guess I wasn't wrong to say how serene it looks, but...Jesus Christ. No one could have told me? No one? Fuck all of you. Seriously. Well, I suppose I should have learned my lesson when I tried to speak to that scarecrow in Mozambique.""

Newest U.S. Aid Mission Just Single PowerBar Labeled ‘For Gaza’ Thrown Into Ocean,"WASHINGTON—With more than 2 million displaced Palestinians facing the threat of famine, the U.S. Agency for International Development announced Monday it had fulfilled its pledge to provide food assistance, throwing a single PowerBar labeled ""for Gaza"" into the Atlantic Ocean. USAID reportedly alerted the war-torn region to be on the lookout for the foil-wrapped item, which the agency is counting on to float eastward from North America toward the Mediterranean Sea, and which includes a handwritten note with the instruction ""DO NOT EAT unless Palestinian"" underlined four times. According to officials, the en-route ProteinPlus PowerBar contains a full 20 grams of proteins and will ameliorate the catastrophic hunger presently being endured by a significant percentage of Gazans, so long as whoever finds it agrees to share it. Insiders confirmed that with the right currents and weather patterns, the chocolate-flavored meal replacement should reach Gaza by 2035, only two years after the expiration date.",The Onion,2024-06-17T10:30:00+00:00,News,Satire,https://theonion.com/newest-u-s-aid-mission-just-single-powerbar-labeled-f-1851540802/

NASA Warns Space Hawk Has Swooped In And Picked Up Earth For Nest,"WASHINGTON—Sounding the alarm that a cosmic bird of prey had clamped its talons onto the planet, NASA warned Thursday that a space hawk had swooped in and picked up the Earth for its nest of hungry space chicks. ""We are on high alert after our satellite imaging confirmed that a quite sizable space hawk has in fact descended on Earth and carried it off with the intention of feeding our planet to its interstellar hatchlings,"" said NASA administrator Bill Nelson, who explained that the space hawk had used its keen extrasolar vision to pinpoint Earth's blue seas from hundreds of light-years away, allowing the cosmic raptor to pluck our rocky planet right from its orbit. ""Given the evidence we've obtained from observing distant exoplanets, the space hawk will first tear apart the Earth and give bite-sized pieces of our home world to its young.

""While there's a strong historical precedent for a lavish excursion to Bali, the plaintiff has instead taken a more unorthodox approach and presented an all-expenses-paid diving trip off the shores of Aruba,"" said a thoughtful, inquisitive Thomas, adding that while he had supported taking vacations with donors to Southeast Asia for years, he was starting to see the appeal of visiting the white sandy shores of the Caribbean. ""In their arguments, the defense made a detailed case that perhaps this summer I need three weeks with my family on a luxury yacht in the Pacific, complete with my own scuba instructor and private chef. But the plaintiff has repeatedly claimed he can get me more in Aruba. He even said I could swim with a shark. And I've always wanted to do that.""

Congress Bans Roofs,"WASHINGTON—In response to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend, Congress moved quickly to pass legislation Monday that bans the civilian use of roofs. ""As our country continues to reel from this horrific event, we in Congress have taken action by enacting a nationwide ban on all roofs, roof terraces, and balconies,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining that the would-be assassin, who shot at and nearly killed Trump from atop a building 430 feet away, highlighted just how lax U.S. laws had been in addressing the threat of widespread roof access. ""As we saw on Saturday, the risks of Americans having roofs is far too great to continue allowing our homes, schools, and other buildings to be covered in any way. In terms of public policy, this would seem to be the best option available to us.""

""Sadly, accelerating levels of industrialization have led us to a point where our nation's stoner communities are being severely threatened, with their habitats disappearing at an alarming rate,"" said environmental scientist Jill Krick-Nelson, adding that the past year had seen a marked increase in real estate developments destroying chill-ass groves previously frequented by young Americans, who use such places to smoke low-quality cannabis from a poorly rolled joint or a pipe fashioned from aluminum foil. ""Without these shaded, secluded areas, millions of American teens have been displaced, making them vulnerable to parents and police. Despite conservation efforts, these endangered populations of buddies will soon be left with no place to get super baked except for truck stop parking lots or the rare garage of a divorced parent.""

""I came home from the set pretty beaten up every day, but it was worth it to get those raw reactions to the breasts in real time.

‘The Onion’ Officially Endorses Joe Biden For President,"Throughout its venerable 268-year reign,The Onionhas always made it a top priority to endorse the correct presidential candidates. From George Washington to Richard Nixon to Donald Trump, this institution's highly respected editorial board has had its finger on the pulse, and has accurately backed the winner of every single national election in this country's long and storied history. Now, with our nation at a pivotal crossroads,The Onion's editorial board faces its most difficult decision yet. That's why we have chosen to officially endorse Joseph R. Biden for president of the United States. To our loyal, handsome, and stunningly brilliant readers, please know thatThe Onion's latest foray into the 2024 election does not come lightly. In these unprecedented times of misinformation and political violence, everyone from left-wing activists to Silicon Valley megadonors attempted to dissuade us from endorsing Joe Biden at this moment in time. ButThe Onionand its six-member editorial board do not listen to outsiders. Nor do we listen to data, facts, polls, the U.S. government, or the widely panned Geneva Conventions. It is with great pride that this institution officially throws its full and unequivocal support behind Joe Biden, despite many across the political spectrum, including the entire Democratic Party, saying ""it's too late"" and we are ""doing more harm than good."" For months, our editorial board has agonized over this momentous decision. Initially, we'd hoped to publish our endorsement on June 27, 2024, in the hours after Joe Biden's first televised debate against Donald Trump. Then, we'd hoped to publish it a few days later, following Biden's highly anticipated July 5 interview with George Stephanopoulos. Now, on Oct. 2, 2024, we are finally doing what we should have done months ago: Buck tradition, put our reputation on the line, and take a position thatTheNew York Times,TheWashington Post, and other so-called ""papers of record"" are too cowardly to even consider this late in the election. Lest readers doubt the value of our endorsement, we ask them to remember 2016, when voter complacency almost put Hillary Clinton in the White House beforeThe Onionstepped in. Joe Biden may be young by Washington standards, but he's packed a lot into 81 short years. He's fought hard for working Americans, be they on the factory line or on the board of Blackstone Group. He's stood up to everyone who threatened this great nation, from Vladimir Putin to Anita Hill. And he supports women and minorities, based on that seemingly random lady he chose to be his vice president. And soThe Onionhumbly requests that on Nov. 5 you remember our editorial board's courageous, measured, and well-reasoned endorsement of Joseph R. Biden. But if, for some incomprehensible reason, this fails to resonate with the American public, we will be proud to endorse Asa Hutchinson as a backup.

""The ability to recite from memory the names of each of the nation's residents used to be a basic component of a person's civic knowledge, but of the respondents we polled, only 15% could list them all,"" said researcher Janet Medallis, adding that a full third of respondents incorrectly included citizens of Canada and Mexico in their answers. ""People made it through the Johns and Marys confidently enough, but most of them trailed off well before naming a single Kip. As alarming as it is to say, the average European can probably name more U.S. citizens than the average American. It's a full-blown educational crisis. And keep in mind, this is just asking them for first and last. God only knows how bad it would be if we asked them to list all 340 million middle initials too.""

JD Vance Begins To Suspect There Another Group Chat,"PALM BEACH, FL—Noticing everyone else's phone simultaneously buzzing throughout a meeting, Vice President-elect JD Vance began to suspect there was another group chat among Trump's senior staff that he wasn't part of, sources confirmed Monday. ""It can't be a coincidence that they all keep looking down at their phones and chuckling at the same time,"" said the former Ohio senator, growing increasingly suspicious that he was being excluded after a hard reset on his phone failed to illuminate any connectivity issues. ""For the past week or so they've been referencing these inside jokes that everyone seems in on except me. I go to all the meetings, so those jokes must be originating from a separate thread. Plus, the group chat I'm on is pretty dead—it seems like no one uses it except me and Lara. And when I tried to make a side group with me, Elon Musk, and Stephen Miller, they both texted back and asked who this was—and when I replied that it was me, JD, I could hear laughter from down the hall.

Target Losing Market Share As More Americans Opt To Forgo All Earthly Possessions,"MINNEAPOLIS—After months of declining sales at the retail chain, experts confirmed Tuesday that Target was losing market share due to more Americans opting to forgo all earthly possessions.

""They've unfortunately realized that satisfaction is not found through ceramic mugs and storage bins. Boots and slippers were flying off the shelves a year ago, but now customers would rather cast off all their possessions and wander barefoot into the wilderness.
